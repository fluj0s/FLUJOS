sec hat hco sec hat case sup hat ds of p hat ds of t hat staff member hat franchise issued may 1965 note neglect of this pol ltr has caused great hardship on staffs has cost countless millions and made it necessary in 1970 to engage in an all out international effort to restore basic scientology over the world within 5 years after the issue of this pl with off the lines violation had almost destroyed orgs quickie grades entered in and denied gain to tens of thousands of cases therefore actions which neglect or violate this policy letter are high crimes resulting in comm evs on administrators and executives it is not entirely tech matter as its neglect destroys orgs and caused 2 year slump it is the business of every staff member to enforce it all levels keeping scientology working hco sec or communicator hat check on all personnel and new personnel as taken on we have some time since passed the point of achieving uniformly workable technology the only thing now is getting the technology applied if you cant get the technology applied then you cant deliver whats promised its as simple as that if you can get the technology applied you can deliver whats promised the only thing you can be upbraided for by students or pcs is results trouble spots occur only where there are results attacks from governments or monopolies occur only where there are results or bad results therefore the road before scientology is clear and its ultimate success is assured if the technology is applied so it is the task of the assn or org sec the hco sec the case supervisor the d of p the d of t and all staff members to get the correct technology applied getting the correct technology applied consists of one having the correct technology two knowing the technology three knowing it is correctfour teaching correctly the correct technology five applying the technology six seeing that the technology is correctly applied seven hammering out of existence incorrect technology eight knocking out incorrect applications nine closing the door on any possibility of incorrect technology ten closing the door on incorrect application one above has been done two has been achieved by many three is achieved by the individual applying the correct technology in proper manner and observing that it works that way four is being done daily successfully in most parts of the world five is consistently accomplished daily six is achieved by instructors and supervisors consistently seven is done by few but is weak point eight is not worked on hard enough nine is impeded by the reasonable attitude of the not quite bright ten is seldom done with enough ferocity seven eight nine and ten are the only places scientology can bog down in any area the reasons for this are not hard to find weak certainty that it works in three above can lead to weakness in seven eight nine and ten b further the nottoobright have bad point on the button selfimportance c the lower the iq the more the individual is shut off from the fruits of observation d the service facs of people make them defend themselves against anything they confront good or bad and seek to make it wrong the bank seeks to knock out the good and perpetuate the bad thus we as scientologists and as an organization must be very alert to seven eight nine and ten in all the years i have been engaged in research i have kept my comm lines wide open for research data i once had the idea that group could evolve truth third of century has thoroughly disabused of that idea willing as i was to accept suggestions and data only handful of suggestions less than twenty had long run value and none were major or basic and when i did accept major or basic suggestions and used them we went astray and i repented and eventually had to eat crow on the other hand there have been thousands and thousands of suggestions and writings which if accepted and acted upon would have resulted in the complete destruction of all our work as well as the sanity of pcs so i know what group of people will do and how insane they will go in accepting unworkable technology by actual record the percentages areabout twenty to 100000 that group of human beings will dream up bad technology to destroy good technology as we could have gotten along without suggestions then we had better steel ourselves to continue to do so now that we have made it this point will of course be attacked as unpopular egotistical and undemocratic it very well may be but it is also survival point and i dont see that popular measures self abnegation and democracy have done anything for man but push him further into the mud currently popularity endorse degraded novels self abnegation has filled the south east asian jungles with stone idols and corpses and democracy has given us inflation and income tax our technology has not been discovered by group true if the group had supported in many ways i could not have discovered it either but it remains that in its formative stages it was not discovered by group then group efforts one can safely assume will not add to it or successfully alter it in the future i can only say this now that it is done there remains of course group tabulation or coordination of what has been done which will be valuableonly so long as it does not seek to alter basic principles and successful applications the contributions that were worth while in this period of forming the technology were help in the form of friendship of defence of organization of dissemination of application of advices on results and of finance these were great contributions and were and are appreciated many thousands contributed in this way and made us what we are discovery contribution was not however part of the broad picture we will not speculate here on why this was so or how i came to rise above the bank we are dealing only in facts and the above is factthe group left to its own devices would not have evolved scientology but with wild dramatization of the bank called new ideas would have wiped it out supporting this is the fact that man has never before evolved workable mental technology and emphasizing it is the vicious technology he did evolvepsychiatry psychology surgery shock treatment whips duress punishment etc ad infinitum so realize that we have climbed out of the mud by whatever good luck and good sense and refuse to sink back into it again see that seven eight nine and ten above are ruthlessly followed and we will never be stopped relax them get reasonable about it and we will perish so far while keeping myself in complete communication with all suggestions i have not failed on seven eight nine and ten in areas i could supervise closely but its not good enough for just myself and few others to work at this whenever this control as per seven eight nine and ten has been relaxed the whole organizational area has failed witness elizabeth ny wichita the early organizations and groups they crashed only because i longer did seven eight nine and ten then when they were all messed up you saw the obvious reasons for failure but ahead of that they ceased to deliver and that involved them in other reasons the common denominator of group is the reactive bank thetans without banks have different responses they only have their banks in common they agree then only on bank principles person to person the bank is identical so constructive ideas are individual and seldom get broad agreement in human group an individual must rise above an avid craving for agreement from humanoid group to get anything decent done the bankagreement has been what has made earth helland if you were looking for hell and found earth it would certainly serve war famine agony and disease has been the lot of man right now the great governments of earth have developed the means of frying every man woman and child on the planet that is bank that is the result of collective thought agreement the decent pleasant things on this planet come from individual actions and ideas that have somehow gotten by the group idea for that matter look how we ourselves are attacked by public opinion media yet there is more ethical group on this planet than ourselvesthus each one of us can rise above the domination of the bank and then as group of freed beings achieve freedom and reason it is only the aberrated group the mob that is destructive when you dont do seven eight nine and ten actively you are working for the bank dominated mob for it will surely surely introduce incorrect technology and swear by it b apply technology as incorrectly as possible c open the door to any destructive idea and d encourage incorrect application its the bank that says the group is all and the individual nothing its the bank that says we must fail so just dont play that tune do seven eight nine and ten and you will knock out of your road all the future thorns heres an actual example in which senior executive had to interfere because of pc spin case supervisor told instructor to have auditor b run process x on preclear c auditor b afterwards told instructor that it didnt work instructor was weak on three above and didnt really believe in seven eight nine and ten so instructor told the case supervisor process x didnt work on preclear c now this strikes directly at each of one to six above in preclear c auditor b instructor and the case supervisor it opens the door to the introduction of new technology and to failure what happened here instructor didnt jump down auditor bs throat thats all that happened this is what he should have done grabbed the auditors report and looked it over when higher executive on this case did so she found what the case supervisor and the rest missed that process x increased preclear cs ta to 25 ta divisions for the session but that near session end auditor b qed and aed with cognition and abandoned process x while it still gave high ta and went off running one of auditor bs own manufacture which nearly spun preclear c auditor bs iq on examination turned out to be about 75 instructor was found to have huge ideas of how you must never invalidate anyone even lunatic the case supervisor was found to be too busy with admin to have any time for actual cases all right theres an all too typical example the instructor should have done seven eight nine and ten this would have begun this way auditor b that process x didnt work instructor what exactly did you do wrong instant attack wheres your auditors report for the session good look here you were getting lot of ta when you stopped process x what did you do then the pc wouldnt have come close to spin and all four of these would have retained certainty in year i had four instances in one small group where the correct process recommended was reported not to have worked but on review found that each one had increased the ta b had been abandoned and c had been falsely reported as unworkable also despite this abuse in each of these four cases the recommended correct process cracked the case yet they were reported as not having worked similar examples exist in instruction and these are all the more deadly as every time instruction in correct technology is flubbed then the resulting error uncorrected in the auditor is perpetuated on every pc that auditor audits thereafter so seven eight nine and ten are even more important in course than in supervision of cases heres an example rave recommendation is given graduating student because he gets more ta on pcs than any other student on the course figures of 435 ta divisions session are reported of course his model session is poor but its just knack he has is also included in the recommendation careful review is undertake because nobody at levels to iv is going to get that much ta on pcs it is found that this student was never taught to read an emeter dial and instructor observed his handling of meter and it was not discovered that he overcompensated nervously swinging the ta 2 or 3 divisions beyond where it needed togo to place the needle at set so everyone was about to throw away standard processes and model session because this one student got such remarkable ta they only read the reports and listened to the brags and never looked at this student the pcs in actual fact were making slightly less than average gain impeded by rough model session and misworded processes thus what was making the pcs win actual scientology was hidden under lot of departures and errors i recall one student who was squirreling on an academy course and running lot of offbeat whole track on other students after course hours the academy students were in state of electrification on all these new experiences and werent quickly brought under control and the student himself never was given the works on seven eight nine and ten so they stuck subsequently this student prevented another squirrel from being straightened out and his wife died of cancer resulting from physical abuse hard tough instructor at that moment could have salvaged two squirrels and saved the life of girl but students had right to do whatever they pleased squirreling going off into weird practices or altering scientology only comes about from noncomprehension usually the noncomprehension is not of scientology but some earlier contact with an offbeat humanoid practice which in its turn was not understood when people cant get results from what they think is standard practice they can be counted upon to squirrel to some degree the most trouble in the past two years came from orgs where an executive in each could not assimilate straight scientology under instruction in scientology they were unable to define terms or demonstrate examples of principles and the orgs where they were got into plenty of trouble and worse it could not be straightened out easily because neither one of these people could or would duplicate instructions hence debacle resulted in two places directly traced to failures of instruction earlier so proper instruction is vital the d of t and his instructors and all scientology instructors must be merciless in getting four seven eight nine and ten into effective action that one student dumb and impossible though he may seem and of use to anyone may yet some day be the cause of untold upset because nobody was interested enough to make sure scientology got home to him with what we know now there is student we enrol who cannot be properly trained as an instructor one should be very alert to slow progress and should turn the sluggards inside out personally system will do it only you or with our sleeve rolled up can crack the back of bad studenting and we can only do it on an individual student never on whole class only hes slow something is awful wrong take fast action to correct it dont wait until next week by then hes got other messes stuck to him if you cant graduate them with their good sense appealed to and wisdom shining graduate them in such state of shock theyll have nightmares if they contemplate squirreling then experience will gradually bring about three in them and theyll know better than to chase butterflies when they should be auditing when somebody enrols consider he or she has joined up for the duration of the universe never permit an openminded approach if theyre going to quit let then quit fast if they enroled theyre aboard and if theyre aboard theyre here on the same terms as the rest of us win or die in the attempt never let them be halfminded about being scientologists the finest organizations in history have been tough dedicated organizations not one nambypamby bunch of pantywaist dilettantes have ever made anything its tough universe the social veneer makes it seem mild but only the tigers surviveand even they have hard time well survive because we are tough and are dedicated when we do instruct somebody properly he becomes more and more tiger when we instruct halfmindedly and are afraid to offend scared to enforce we dont make students into good scientologists and that lets everybody down when mrs pattycake comes to us to be taught turn that wandering doubt in he eye into fixed dedicated glare and shell win and well all win humour her and we all die little the proper instruction attitude is youre here so youre scientologist now were going to make you into an expert auditor matter what happens wed rather have you dead that incapablefitting that into the economics of the situation and lack of adequate time and you see the cross we have to bear but we wont have to bear it forever the bigger we get the more economics and time we will have to do our job and the only things which can prevent us from getting that big fast are areas in from one to ten keep those in mind and well be able to grow fast and as we grow our shackles will be less and less failing to keep one to ten will make us grow less so the ogre which might eat us up is not the government or the high priests its our possible failure to retain and practise our technology an instructor or supervisor or executive must challenge with ferocity instances of unworkability they must uncover what did happen what was run and what was done or not done if you have one and two you can only acquire three for all by making sure of all the rest were not playing some minor game in scientology it isnt cute or something to do for lack of something better the whole agonized future of this planet every man woman and child on it and your own destiny for the next endless trillions of years depends on what you do here and now with and in scientology this is deadly serious activity and if we miss getting out of the trap now we may never again have another chance remember this is our first chance to do so in all the endless trillions of years of the past dont muff it now because it seems unpleasant or unsocial to do seven eight nine

pressure exerted to speed up student completions and auditing completions was mistakenly answered by just not delivering the correct way to speed up students progress is by using 2 way comm and applying the study materials to students the best way to really handle pcs is to ensure they make each level fully before going on to the next and repairing them when they do not the puzzle of the decline of the entire scientology network in the late 60s is entirely answered by the actions taken to shorten time in study and in processing by deleting materials and actions reinstituting full use

altering scientology offbeat practices it is bad thing i have found way to explain why scientology is workable system this does not mean it is the best possible system or perfect system remember and use that definition scientology is workable system in fifty thousand years of history on this planet alone man never evolved workable system it is doubtful if in foreseeable history he will ever evolve another man is caught in huge and complex labyrinth to get out of it requires that he follow the closely taped path of scientology scientology will take him out of the labyrinth but only if he follows the exact markings in the tunnels it has taken third of century in this lifetime to tape this route out it has been proven that efforts by man to find different routes came to nothing it is also clear fact that the route called scientology does lead out of the labyrinth therefore it is workable system route that can be travelled what would you think of guide who because his party said it was dark and the road rough and who said another tunnel looked better abandoned the route he knew would lead out and led his party to lost nowhere in the dark youd think he was pretty wishywashy guide what would you think of supervisor who let student depart from procedure the supervisor knew worked youd think he was pretty wishywashy supervisor what would happen in labyrinth if the guide let some girl stop in pretty canyon and left her there forever to contemplate the rocks youd think he was pretty heartless guide youd expect him to say at least miss those rocks may be pretty but the road out doesnt go that way all right how about an auditor who abandons the procedure which will make his preclear eventually clear just because the preclear had cognition people have following the route mixed up with the right to have their own ideas anyone is certainly entitled to have opinions and ideas and cognitionsso long as these do not bar the route out for self and others scientology is workable system it white tapes the road out of the labyrinth if there were white tapes marking the right tunnels man would just go on wandering around and around the way he has for eons darting off on wrong roads going in circles ending up in the sticky dark alonescientology exactly and correctly followed takes the person up and out of the mess so when you see somebody having ball getting everyone to take peyote because it restimulates prenatals know he is pulling people off the route realize he is squirreling he isnt following the route scientology is new thing it is road out there has not been one not all the salesmanship in the world can make bad route proper route and an awful lot of bad routes are being sold their end product is further slavery more darkness more misery scientology is the only workable system man has it has already taken people toward higher iq better lives and all that other system has so realize that it has competitor scientology is workable system it has the route taped the search is done now the route only needs to be walked so put the feet of students and preclears on that route dont let them off of it matter how fascinating the side roads seem to them

often brought about by noncomprehension the noncomprehension itself and failure to mention it is an avoidance of orders very degraded beings alteris degraded ones refuse to comply without mentioning it beings in fair condition try to comply but remark their troubles to get help when needed competent higher toned beings understand orders and comply if possible but mainly do their jobs without needing lots of special orders degraded beings find any instruction painful as they have been painfully indoctrinated with violent measures in the past they therefore alteris any order or dont comply thus in auditing pcs or in org where you find alteris covert noncompliance and non compliance given sensible and correct tech or instructions you are dealing with degraded low level being and should act accordingly one uses very simple low level processes on degraded being gently in admin orgs and especially the tech div where staff member alterises or fails to comply you are also dealing with degraded being but one who is too much pc to be staff member he cannot be at cause and staff members must be at cause so he or she should not be on staff this is primary senior datum regulating all handling of pcs and staff members degraded being is not suppressive as he can have case gain but he is so pts that he works for suppressives only he is sort of supercontinual pts beyond the reach really of simple s d and handled only at sect 3 ot course degraded beings taking cue from sp associates instinctively resent hate and seek to obstruct any person in charge of anything or any big being anyone issuing sensible orders is the first one resented by degraded being degraded being lies to his seniors avoids orders covertly by alteris fails to comply supplies only complex ideas that cant ever work obstructive and is general area of enturbulence often mild seeming or even cooperative often even flattering sometimes merely dull but consistently alterising or noncomplying this datum appeared during higher level research and is highly revelatory of earlier unexplained phenomenathe pc who changes commands or doesnt do them the worker who cant get it straight or who is always on tea

others none are truly equal but the degraded being is not necessarily natively bad thetan he is simply so pts and has been for so long that it requires our highest level tech to finally undo it after he has scaled up all our grades degraded beings are about 18 to 1 over big beings in the human race minimum ratio so those who keep things going are few and those who will make it without the steam of

him as this is passive test and could mean only that he was simply sitting still whether things are currently all right or not is beside the point the thetan who is making things go right may be tackling mountain of confusion and of course things are not all right because what he is attacking is mainly wrong it is whether or not he is making things go right in spite of hell or high water that is the test many beings live lives of quiet correctness without ever once making anything do anything things around them just happen to be orderly the social system props them up but somedaybangthe society gets into turmoil which knocks out the props then we see that there were too few present who could make things go right and that is the end of the society thus died all old civilizations their people lived in system correctness and things went right only so long as nothing was going wrong then one day things go wrong these sophisticated but weak beings never were able to make things go right and so the whole society collapses one might also ask what is meant by right this would be forwarding purpose not destructive to the majority of the dynamics aberration is by definition crooked line it is from the latin aberratio wandering from and from the latin errare to wander or to err sane person thinks looks and sees in straight lines black is black white is white the aberrated person looks toward black and wanders off in his gaze to something else and makes the error of saying it is grey you can consider aberration in passive way supinely of force or action person is sane or not sane he thinks straight or crookedly now consider aberration in forceful way person looks then an opposing force to him pushes aside his gaze or distracts it but the really sane forceful person looks right on through and past the opposition and sees what is there anyway let us take real action mr q rolls ball from toward b route opposition x pushes the ball aside toward c mr q then shoves the ball toward c and says the reason he did not arrive properly at b was because mr s rolls ball from toward b opposition x diverts the ball toward c mr s pulls the ball back into line and despite over and through opposition x arrives at b anyway you can see that mr q in the first example is willing to be aberrated or pushed aside or at least does not contest it enough mr q is aberrated mr s on the other hand was not willing to be diverted and went right on to b mr s is not aberrated now society being mainly suppressive observes that mr q never has much commotion around him true he never arrives and gets nothing done but he isnt noisy so he is okay mr s on the other hand makes an awful row and bashes opposition x on the head and snarls his way onward toward b society says he is bad fellow because he has fusses of course he also gets something done but in decadent society men are measured by how pleasant they are not how effective they are so mr s is regarded as bit mad yet when trouble comes it is only the mr ss who will save the day while the mr qs all give up and die there is another point here however that is purpose the difference between one thetans forward thrust and anothers is purpose validity of madman can also go from toward b relentlessly where b is totally undesirable and destructive point but in actual practice real madmen never really arrive at the b they wanted to arrive at madman only goes toward but never really arrives so he only makes everything go wrong b must be desirable point not destructive to majority of the dynamics for rightness to occur so there is the savage and bare datum the supreme test of thetan is the ability to make things go right people who explain how wrong it is all going and who have reasons why and who arent putting it right are the real crazy people in the universe the only ones crazier than they are are the ones who are quite happy to have everything fail and go wrong with protest from them and the only ones even worse are

august 1967 remimeo discipline sps and admin how statistics crash one of the ways an sp works to stop an activity or to halt an affluence is to pick out key personnel and spread wild false and alarming stories about them another way often used in conjunction with the above is to pound key executive with alarming entheta about staff divisions or activities this urges the key executive to take uncalled for action which upsets things and which may lead to the dismissal of valuable staff also it is symptom of an org under external pressure to come down on its own personnel rather than on the public or on real sps sps tend to vanish in memory since they speak in generalities always everyone salt their language so that when you say who told you in tracing rumor it is hard to remember since everyone seems to have said it actually the sp who did say it used everyone in his comm so often as to become in memory everyone good manager ignores rumor and only acts on statistics had i heeded over the years any rumormonger we would have orgs i generally dont listen and if i do only go so far as inspecting stats it is easy to discipline staff and hard to discipline the public lazy executive only disciplines staff it takes more confront to tackle the public when an executive listens to rumor and bad things about his fellow staff members without looking at the actual production statistics that executive can harm the org badly i have never tried to make staff members be good i have only tried to make them produce and wear their hats our whole statistic system exists to end excessive discipline of valuable staff members to staff member whose stats are up can do wrong i am not interested in wog morality i am only interested in getting the show on the road and keeping it there also i detest having to discipline anyone for anything particularly scientologist and the only discipline i use is to hold the fort until people are clear enough to see the light they always do all misconduct comes from aberration however if anyone is getting industrious trying to enturbulate or stop scientology or its activities i can make captain bligh look like sunday school teacher there is probably limit on what i would do to safeguard mans only road to freedom against persons who disdaining processing seek to stop scientology or hurt scientologistsi well know mans fixation on trying to make everybody good which means really inactive the best men i have had in wars routinely have been continually arrested and generally frowned on by shore patrols military police etc to the body politic quiet person is the ideal when the guns begin to go these quiet ones are all hiding and only the active ones are there to fight i often wonder what would happen to state if it did achieve its apparent goal of making one and all inactive little sheep so i dont care what men or women do if they just wear their hats and keep their stats up only when scientology is being slowed or stopped do you find rigging up the tools of discipline in actual fact i rather hold the person who is inactive because he is afraid of punishment in contempt i respect only those who are strong enough to be decent without the self protection of evil i use disciplhze to hold the edges of channel not to stop the flow sps love to coax those with power to slay as the basic ambition of any sp is everybody dead so i can be safe he or she will use all manner of lies and mechanisms to excite thirst for discipline in those in power if i ever heed any kill everybody advice it is to put the adviser up against brick wall all evil stems from aberration and it can be pretty evil and awfully aberrated the only road out from evil is processing therefore one must protect the road to freedom as the answer to evil and must protect as well all those who are working to keep the road in the world will never become good because of discipline or oppression of evil all discipline presupposes that the person being disciplined wants to survive the truly evil only want to succumb so discipline threat is answer the truly evil love pain and suffering and deprivation so it coerces nothing and improves nothing when you seek to solve all evil with discipline only the already decent can be disciplined it only obliges the evil ones so all you can do really is to get the evil ones parked off the lines the executive in disciplining is concerned with those who would stop or hinder the flow and those who are just plain idle or stupid so he severely leaves alone all up stats and only acts to move the suppressives off the lines and not let the idle and stupid slow the tlow an executive could never make the world reform by discipline alone he can by processing so his only use of discipline is to continue to make processing possible its as simple as that l ron hubbard founder lrhjpcden copyright 1967 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east

able to look at things directly he is unable to erase them or even see what they are such people often have curtain of pictures they look at instead of the universe around them they do not see building they see picture of building in front of the building they are not at the point from which they view things thus they are peculiar in that they cant changes the three principal zones in

much tech to describe them but one does not have to be an auditor with meter to find these people an administrator only needs to know the three things about them 1 change in ethics 2 change in case 3 change in admin these people have 1 thick ethics files 2thick or case files3 thick full or comm baskets if you just dismissed anyone who had all three you would have gotten rid of an sp it works this way when you start to get in ethics most people learn the ropes fast they may have few down conditions and chits or even courts or comm evs but you see the frequency dwindles and eventually vanishes or nearly so when you start to get in tech on person it may be hard haul for while and then it begins to level out and get easier when you start to get in admin the confusion around some person may be great but after while the lines and policies straighten out none are good little angels but 90 make progress in these 3 fields of ethics tech and admin the sp does not make any consistent progress at all and lapses every time as only 10 of the people then are making nearly all the tough work in ethics tech and admin the thing to do then is to get them off the lines rather than betray 90 and the sp is detectable in all three areas it needs microscope to find out who on staff has the seniors working so hard for so little gain their ethics file is huge their case file either doesnt exist at all or is very fat their comm lines are jammed their policy is out and their stats are on the bottom eternally so as an administrator you can detect sps you better had your own stats will be down to the degree you fail to detect them just go to your files and look at the desks and sack whoever satisfies all three conditions above and you cant miss and will be able to breathe l ron hubbard founder lrh

change is in this type stye overtmotivator sequence dianetics courses level two solo audit ot sections there was an important discovery made in 1952 on the subject of engrams which did not get included in book one dianetics the modern science of mental health this was the overtmotivator sequence of engrams an overt in dianetics and scientology is an aggressive or destructive act by the individual against one or another of the 8 dynamics self family group mankind animals or plants mest life or the infinite motivator is an aggressive or destructive act received by the person or one of the dynamics the viewpoint from which the act is viewed resolves whether the act is an overt or motivator the reason it is called motivator is because it tends to prompt that one pays it backit motivates new overt when one has done something bad to someone or something one tends to believe it must have been motivated when one has received something bad he also may tend to feel he must have done something to deserve it the above points are true the actions and reactions of people on the subject are often very falsified people go about believing they were in an auto accident when in actual fact they caused one also people may believe they caused an accident when they were only in one some people on hearing of death at once believe they must have killed the person even though they were far away police in large cities have people turn up and confess to almost every murder as routine one doesnt have to be crazy to be subject to the overtmotivator sequence it is not only used on him continually by others it also is basic part of his own casethere are two extreme stages of overtmotivator phenomena one is person who gives up only motivators always done to him and the other is the person who has done only overts done to others in running engrams you will find 1 all overt engrams that hang up wont audit easily have also motivator engram as the same or different incident 2 all motivator engrams that hang up have an overt engram in the same or different incident the two types of engrams then are overt engrams and motivator engrams example of overt engramshooting dog example of motivator engrambeing bitten by dog the rule is that the subject matter must be similar they can be in different points in time when you cant run out erase dog bite engram why then you find the shoot dog engram psychosomatic ills or aberrations that do not resolve by running one side usually resolve by finding and running the other when you cant erase an engram about shooting dog why then theres bitten by dog its all very simple really there are always two sides to the coin if one wont run you try the other basics finding the basic engram on chain also applies to finding the basic overt or basic motivator engram engrams then hang up wont run out when the other type needs to be run and b the one found has earlier engrams on it nonextant engrams an engram sometimes didnt exist pc can be trying to run being run over by car when he never was what needs to be done when the incident wont run is get the pcs incident of running over somebody it also works in reverse pc can be trying to run an engram of running over somebody when he was in fact only run over himself and never did run over anyone so both engrams can exist and be run or only one side exists and can be run or with heavy foulup on overts and motivators one side can be nonfactual and wont run because only the other side existsit is easy to visualize this as matter of flows an overt of course is an outflow and motivator is an inflow secondaries it may never have been said that secondaries always sit squarely on incidents of actual pain and unconsciousness also secondaries can exist on the overtmotivator sequence pattern just as in engrams this is the cause of frozen emotions or unemotional people also some people complain they cant feel anymore this works out by overtmotivator sequence person in grief over loss grief is always loss who then cant run it has caused grief and that overtsecondary can be run also person misemotional over causing grief has been caused grief it works both ways with all points on the tone scale the last is newer discovery and wasnt known to early dianeticists the overtmotivator engram phenomena did not receive adequate dissemination the principle applied to secondaries has not before been released it is basically dianetic engram running that resolves all cases in the end so one had better be pretty good at auditing engrams and secondaries motivator and

environment thus progress can be made by all many mechanisms can exist to mask counter intention one has an intention to expand the org an expert says it is difficult as the building society the impulse is to then handle the problem presented by the expert whereas the correct ethics action is to remove his counter intentionedness or other intentionedness if he were an expert he would simply say ok ill handle my end of the expansion there are many ways to handle counter and other intentionedness there is fine line between ethics and tech the point where thetan goes mad is very exact it is the point where he begins to obsessively stop something from this the effort becomes generalized and he begins to stop lots of other things when this includes anyone who or anything that would help him as well as those people and things that help the being is suppressive his intentions counter any other intention particularly good intentions other intentionedness comes from unawareness or

routine process of what has been overrun hcob 17 sept 68 it is not used as rudiment it is for chronic high tas there is another one also it is quite different and is run differently it is not listing process it is the simple question has anything been overrun it is used at session start or after break when the ta is found to have risen mysteriously to 40 or above it requires clever auditor first he notices the ta is at 40 then he gets the pc to answer has anything been overrun if the pc says something and the ta comes down thats it the ta may only come down to 35 but thats it then one puts in rud unless of course the answer to has anything been or was ruds or asking for arc brks one would then indicate this as bpc and the ta should come on down this action is just getting the ta down so one can audit dont expect ruds to pull down 40 ta and never start main action with the ta high expecting the main action will get it down the main action hasnt got it up overrun of the main action or of any action past fn will cause the ta to rise one knows why that is and simply indicates the bypass of an fn and down comes the ta calling for has anything been overrun is very simple you dont ask how many times etc you just get it spotted and down comes the ta if the pc says something in answer and the ta doesnt come down the auditor says the pc searches about and gives another if its not that the auditor says the pc says something else and down comes the ta and the auditor says good thats the overrun and then the auditor carries on with his session actions the commonest cause of ta flying up in break is the process went fn out of session and the intention of the auditor to continue it sends it up note real hot auditor who really knows his basics can float needle on this with one shot

could vanish if babylon turn to dust if egypt could become badlands if sicily could have 160 prosperous cities and be looted ruin before the year zero and near desert ever sinceand all this in spite of all the work and wisdom and good wishes and intent of human beings then it must follow as the dark follows sunset that something must be unknown to man concerning all his works and ways and that this something must be so deadly and so pervasive as to destroy all his ambitions and his chances long before their time such thing would have to be some natural law unguessed at by himself and there is such law apparently that answers these conditions of being deadly unknown and embracing all activities the law would seem to be third party must be present and unknown in every quarrel for conflict to exist or for quarrel to occur an unknown third party must be active in producing it between two potential opponents or while it is commonly believed to take two to make fight third party must exist and must develop it for actual conflict to occur it is very easy to see that two in conflict are fighting they are very visible what is harder to see or suspect is that third party existed and actively promoted the quarrel the usually unsuspected and reasonable third party the bystander who denies any part of it is the one that brought the conflict into existence in the first place the hidden third party seeming at times to be supporter of only one side is to be found as the instigator this is useful law on many dynamics it is the cause of warone sees two fellows shouting bad names at each other sees them come to blows one else is around so they of course caused the fight but there was third party tracing these down one comes upon incredible data that is the trouble the incredible is too easily rejected one way to hide things is to make them incredible clerk and messenger b have been arguing they blaze into direct conflict each blames the other neither one is correct and so the quarrel does not resolve since its true cause is not established one looks into such case thoroughly he finds the incredible the wife of clerk has been sleeping with messenger b and complaining alike to both about the other farmer j and rancher k have been tearing each other to pieces for years in continual conflict there are obvious logical reasons for the fight yet it continues and does not resolve close search finds banker l who due to their losses in the fighting is able to loan each side money while keeping the quarrel going and who will get their lands completely if both lose it goes larger the revolutionary forces and the russian government were in conflict in 1917 the reasons are so many the attention easily sticks on them but only when germanys official state papers were captured in world war ii was it revealed that germany had promoted the revolt and financed lenin to spark it off even sending him into russia in blacked out train one looks over personal quarrels group conflicts national battles and one finds if he searches the third party unsuspected by both combatants or if suspected at all brushed off as fantastic yet careful documentation finally affirms it this datum is fabulously useful in marital quarrels the correct approach of anyone counseling is to get both parties to carefully search out the third party they may come to many reasons at first these reasons are not beings one is looking for third party an actual being when both find the third party and establish proof that will be the end of the quarrel sometimes two parties quarreling suddenly decide to elect being to blame this stops the quarrel sometimes it is not the right being and more quarrels thereafter occur two nations at each others throats should each seek conference with the other to sift out and locate the actual third party they will always find one if they look and they can find the right one as it will be found to exist in fact there are probably many technical approaches one could develop and outline in this matter there are many odd phenomena connected with it an accurately spotted third party is usually not fought at all by either party but only shunned marital conflicts are common marriages can be saved by both parties really sorting out who caused the conflicts there may have been in the whole history of the marriage several but only one at timequarrels between an individual and an organization are nearly always caused by an individual third party or third group the organization and the individual should get together and isolate the third party by displaying to each other all the data they each have been fed rioters and governments alike could be brought back to agreement could one get representatives of both to give each other what they have been told by whom such conferences have tended to deal only in recriminations or conditions or abuses they must deal in beings only in order to succeed this theory might be thought to assert also that there are bad conditions that cause conflict there are but these are usually remedial by conference unless third party is promoting conflict in history we have very foul opinion of the past because it is related by recriminations of two opponents and has not spotted the third party underlying causes of war should read hidden promoters there are conflicts which cannot be resolved unless the true promoters of them remain hidden this is the natural law the ancients and moderns alike did not know and not knowing it being led off into reasons whole civilizations have

shed some interesting light on this and also insanity the basic equation is apparently when threatened with unmocking thetan mocks up obsessively actually the datum is small bit from ot viii data being part of energy creation it applies too well at lower levels however to leave it in such stratosphere it explains for instance why pc challenged by an auditor who is breaking the auditors code gets such solid reaction in the reactive bank threatened by an apparent effort to destroy him instead of letting him find the truth the pc reacts by mocking up hard below his awareness level this does not of course make him insane it just sticks him bit in the session drugs lsd marijuana alcohol whatever produce threat to the body like any other poison the threat is to the body the thetan reacts by mocking up of course what he mocks up is some engram secondary or combination of fancy and fact he can do this in some cases so hard that it becomes more real and safer than present time thus under threat he goes out of present time now comes the next bit which is important as new discovery his time track is not then being made up wholly of present time events it is composite of past track imagination and present events thus right there before your eyes he apparently in the same room as you are doing the same things is really only partially there and partially in some past events he seems to be there really he isnt tracking fully with present time what is going on to rational observation is not what is going on to him thus he does not duplicate statements made by another but tries to fit them into his composite reality in order to fit them in he has to alter them we therefore have the real basis of alterishe may be sure he is helping one repair the floor but in actual fact he is hindering the actual operation in progress which really consists of cleaning the floor so when he helps one mop the floor he introduces chaos into the activity since he is repairing the floor request to give the mop has to be reinterpreted as hand the hammer but the mop handle is larger than hammer handle so the bucket gets upset as thetan can mock up an infinity of combinations there would be an infinity of types of reactions to drugs there would also be an infinity of types of insanity what is constant is that he is not running in the same series of events as others this can be slight wherein the person is seen to make occasional mistakes it can be as serious as total insanity where the events apparent to him are completely different than those apparent to anyone else and it can be all grades in between it isnt that he doesnt know whats going on its that he perceives something else going on instead of the present time sequence of events thus others appear to him to be stupid or unreasonable or insane as they dont agree in their actions and orders with what he plainly sees is in progress they arent sensible example group is moving furniture to all but one they are simply moving furniture this one perceives himself to be moving geometric shapes into cloud thus this one makes mistakes alterises noncomplies as the group doesnt see inside him and only sees another like themselves they cant figure out why he balls things up so such persons as drug takers and the insane are thus slightly or wholly on an apparently different time track of present time events drug may be taken to drive person out of an unbearable pt or out of consciousness altogether in some persons they do not afterwards return wholly to present time thetan can also escape an unbearable pt by dropping into the past even without drugs the penalty is running into obsessive mocking up to counter the threat of being unmocked the answer is to erase the engrams and reactive mechanisms as all this outofpt is unknowing it is aberrative things one is doing that one knows one is doing are not aberrative the drug taker and the insane alike have not recovered present time to greater or lesser degree thus they think they are running on different time track than they are which unknowingly and out of the past they are to greater or lesser degree mocking up these are the underlying facts in odd human behaviour enturbulation thus we get an explanation of enturbulation as well as what is going on according to the perception and subjective reality of such person is varied in greater or lesser degree from the objective reality of others such person enturbulates the actual environment what is really going on is not what is going on for themorders then are not complied with other things happen and people around such person have their own consecutive events disrupted this causes enturbulation the noncompliance alteris and upsets from person who is out of present time and what is new about this who is running on different series of events than those going on for the rest cause general enturbulation this is why it takes two additional staff members to handle the routine goofs of such person they are forcing events to run more or less normally against the counter effort of person with delusory time track we have all known such person many more than one so it is not uncommon in the current civilization the sudden non sequitur remark out of context the blank stare when given an order or remarkbehind these lies whole imaginary time track which we jar into and accidentally disrupt exteriorization in ot sections we sometimes hear of person who is exterior and so cant be audited any more the symptoms of the person have not changed so he still has aberrations the answer is to clear the word exteriorization with them they often are exterior into nevernever nonextant universe or exterior in past death when the word is cleared with them they often dont really say what was going on they experience strange reaction and change if one then runs bit of objective havingness they come into present time this applies only to exteriorized cases who cant be audited because they are exterior and yet arent all right casewise the usual course is to just handle the case by standard tech they eventually come right dangerous environment anyone forced into dangerous environment tends to either go fully into pt or retreat from pt the only ones who suffer from it afterwards are those who dont move on up the track as life goes on but stay there retreated from long gone present time or stuck in moment of the past this is done of course because of pictures mocked up obsessively under the threat of unmock when you understand the condition you cant be

class viii this is true of arc straight wire and ot vi alike the rule holds any level is capable of giving stable case gain and if it does not there is something very wrong with the way it or an earlier level was run to chase pc on up the levels to cure an outness on earlier levels is idiocy it is wasting auditing it is shabby excuse for not setting case up to be audited or auditing badly to solve an earlier out tech situation one does not give the next level if pc ends up at level ii or ot ii without stable gain attained then the setup of the case or the handling of it is sour this is the most elementary situation in case repair any level is capable of case gain and of being stable the pc feeling good etc the drive to get the next level is very natural but when it becomes obsessive to get case gain then it isnt the next level thats needed arc straight wire is more tech than man ever had before it produces stable gain this is true of every level on up we have just had preot whose case at every level was going to be solved by the next level people kept saying he needed the next level to solve his case bull he got all the way to ot ii before i caught wind of it he had to have ot iii to solve his case according to the qual sec that case probably never made arc straight wire one or more earlier levels or ruds or 7 cases are out thats the trouble with that case if you now let him go on to ot iii hed cop itthe tech you are handling is capable of giving spectacular gains at every level if it does not then the case has missed somewhere comes under 7 resistive cases or out ruds or one or more missed or overrun levels this is one of those things which seems to have been going around needs the next level to solve his case for some time without my finding out about it sure they need their next level but do they have their levels up to where they are if they arent in good shape at the end of any one level then theres miss on the case and it must be repaired by standard

how amongst auditors but has not actually been covered previously the conditions of new preclear are these doesnt know what is supposed to happen b may be under the stress of being embarrassed to talk to someone c may have preconceived ideas of how he is supposed to respond to the auditor such as psychoanalytic free association where he just talks etc d may be waiting for some magical effect entirely independent of his own participation as in getting shot from doctor it is too much to ask of being to 1 talk to another intimately about himself 2 fumbling with new activity while 3 confronting his own bank possibly he has never done any of the three before and to ask him to do them all at once well all cases are started in their lowest ability level since they have not had it increased whereas they may be quite well off as human beings they do not know how well off they might become the wrong thing to do is to enforce their improvement with sales talk or evaluation on how well they did in the session and it is wrong to go on auditing them while they essentially remain in mystery the correct solution to all these difficulties is to assign the pc to do pe course if it includes trs and to have the pc do the trs before being audited we probably should have set of poster type pictures put up in pe area as follows picture of an auditor with meter in front of him profile view this is an auditor he does not invalidate criticize or evaluate for the preclearpicture of an emeter this is an emeter it is used to verify the preclears gain and register when each separate auditing action is ended picture of being silhouette showing features this is you preclear spiritual being who is now on the road to becoming clear hence preclear picture of an auditor with meter and shadowy preclear this is session the auditor and the preclear locate step by step any mental blocks to increased ability and freedom picture of down point to the left and road going up high to the right at the down point is succumb at the up point is survival some figures are on the line they are the auditing session interspersed with small figure of somebody studying big arrow parallels the line pointing up scientology auditing and study are the road to ability and freedom picture of the grade chart simplified modernized to show subzeros plainly and including ot levels freedom is reached by going up through the grades of auditing picture of the classes of auditors all the way to class viii including the pe course etc and where taught ability and gain are achieved by training series of pictures of cavedin person who gets better and better in subsequent higher pictures scientology processing obtains continual improvement picture of body thetan you are spiritual being not body or an animal as you will discover in processing picture representation of each of the dynamics from i to 8 including the r6 god with an arrow paralleling them on slant upwards there is more to life than personal suffering and trouble the picture of the r6 god used is the old man symbol as used on the covers of various dianetics and scientology publications picture of sunburst with scientology written in its centre scientology reveals the natural laws of life you can know the answers this set prominently displayed in an org in long panel from left to right with sign over it you have come to the right place and long arrow indicating the sequence will do an awful lot to answer preclears questions at the end of the panel sign same size saying see the registrar room will also direct the preclear the preclear should be signed up if he is preclear and with the money paid sent to pe course if this is not feasible he at least should be first assigned to do trs preclear information sheet can also be compiled giving him data commonly asked preclears dictionary which includes all terms used in processes and their definition should also be given to him if the preclear seems not to be improving even as early as the trs white form of case and health history should be very carefully done including narcotics if he is on narcotics he must come off them and have been off them for while in angeles they say six weeks before resuming his auditingif on resuming auditing the preclear still does not gain despite 7 cases careful and full medical clinical examination should be ordered as the preclear is medically ill in some previously unsuspected fashion this is covered in hco b 12 march 1969 physically ill pcs should this not prove to be the case or if the pc does not get well then apply the hco b of 2 april 1969 dianetic assists an auditing assist as given in that hco b above all dont let unnecessary stops occur on this line for pcs who just sail through in recent glance over the case folders of some stalled or chronically ill pcs i found the main was simply auditing occurring in the following ways case 13 case supervision directions carefully and correctly advised but none of them done other auditing was done either then fourth case supervision direction on top ignoring the folder and advising something else but that was not done either case 2preclear chronically doing badly was being audited but hadnt clue was not up to talking to an auditor at all i ordered trs and the auditor did them the pc bloomed and went on up the grades splendidly case 3pc all crippled up from old injuries in the folder i found cses there had been done as ordered also found the pc had sneaked his folder and done some wild self auditing before auditing could be done ordered hco b 12 march 1969 touch assists and then medical treatment to set long time broken back case 4pc told the auditor in the session she had secondary sitting right there and was in it and although had bad indicators in the auditor just ended the session case 5pc ordered in for review was given the cans the auditor said thats it pc went off in mystery case 6pc shaking and fevered but physical illness according to doctor auditor did an s d pc still not well few weeks later illness recurred i got hold of the pc asked when the shaking had begun found an engram where the pc had been withholding being cold ran it pc totally recovered the incident had occurred only day before auditor as session had auditor merely asked what had been going on he would have found it at once run it and that would have been that it was only an auditing assist that was needed which is why i wrote hco b 2 april 1969 dianetic assists it hadnt ever occurred to that auditors wouldnt use the principle of engram running to handle pc who hurt so it adds up to the fact that just not doing auditing is fundamental error thats whats meant by auditing in the 7 resistive cases of class viii auditing just wasnt used to handle the pc auditing the new pc who hasnt clue what auditing is is apt to get lot of auditing so you teach him what to expect by posters pe trs the troubled pc who is all introverted with real physical or mental problem had jolly well better get it handled as in the physically ill pcs hco b 12 march 1969 or with dianetic assist as per hco b 2 april 1969 you dont just sail on up the grades and throw them away if you ever get an area that thinks dianetics and scientology dont work which is about as silly as saying there is gravity then you have an area that has been infiltrated and the tech performance perverted orb you have person around who is terrified that it will work and others grown more powerful will now destroy him which surrenders casewise to physically ill pcs or the top power process used first followed by subzeros and grades or c you have narcoticsilly area and are not making them desist before auditing or handling their past addiction by running out its engrams or d you have an area that just isnt auditing at all or you are not handling new pcs as we used to and as recommended in this hco b as final remark i have seen person get audited all the way to the top who wasnt ever audited at all as comment this is pretty bad but close check revealed that large percent did not even know the content or action of key grade below where they were supposed to have arrived they had zero indoctrination as pc and had not ever made even the subzero of arc straight wire so lay this down case supervisors and auditors all as firm castinconcrete rule if your pc does not obtain total reality on having had gains beyond his expectations auditing has not been done in the first place or the pc is on drugs or physically ill i look at it this way auditing is terribly simple turn loose with an emeter and pc and up the line he comes if he doesnt or cant respond hes seriously ill if hes that ill that he cant be audited he needs medical treatment and when hes had that back to the meter and ill show you shining pc you say yes thats you you know and can do it sure sure sure but anyone who has studied his meter his books and bulletins can do it

manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 6 april 1969 remimeo dianetics course fundamental auditing for some years it has not been appreciated fully that the ability to do dianetic auditing is the true fundamental background of scientology auditor for many years 1950 onward dianetic auditor was proudly capable of resolving mental and physical problems by his ability to find and run engrams and secondaries the dianetic auditor had other skill or tools than his understanding of mental image pictures as locks secondaries and engrams and the time track with these tools he produced many miracles broken bones healed in two weeks instead of six withered limbs restored burns vanished swellings reduced visibly to nothing lives wrecked by grief and loss recovered women lost their aging wrinkles and soughtafter abilities returned the percentage of win was above 50 which is double that of former approaches the use of the emeter and my development of r3r increased this percentage dianetic training was usually one month in length and attained high percentage of successful graduates who could attain excellent results dianetics operates at the level of the human being and is addressed mainly to the body and mind it does not attempt and should not be confused with the end product of scientology which is spiritual freedom the end product of dianetics is well happy high iq human being dianetics is itself and has its place when one can handle dianetics so as to make people well and happy one can then begin to think of and work on the higher aspects of scientology to attempt to obtain the results of scientology by applying only dianetics is in fact confusion of objectives the dianetic auditor whether the very best people behind governments like it or not is the natural inheritor of all mental healing working in conjunction with bona fide physical healers such as the actual practicing medical doctor the dianetic auditor with only the skills taught on the dianetic course could all but eradicate psychosomatic illness and mental illness on this planet tens of thousands of cases in dianetics show this is idle boast the recent breakthrough showing most insanity is common physical illness untreated adds up to making such an objective fact the scientology auditor is all too often balked by the fact that his preclear comes to him already ill his preclear is below being well human being that is part of the gradient if the scientology auditor is not also good dianetic auditor he tends to ignore the fact that his preclear is not yet up to being well human being applying grade processing the scientology auditor has already skipped gradea well human being he therefore fails to understand that his preclear is simply seeking to escape as thetan the gradient of being well being the role of dianetics let us face it is that of healing science it is the most advanced mental science man has it should not be skimped or scanted good dianetic auditor canhandle the bulk of psychosomatic illness and speed the healing of ordinary illness or make it possible for the person to recover mental aberration as such can be handled in dianetics if it works in conjunction with other valid branches of physical healing there is then demarcation between dianetics and scientology the dianetic auditors skills reach up to and include well happy human being this is in excess of mans hope for any mental science the scientology auditor is working for increased ability and spiritual freedom and that is far in excess of any dream of accomplishment man has had including buddhism when we get sick human being being handled to make him spiritually free we get confusion and are likely to fail the scientology auditor who is also good basic dianetics auditor can make that being well enough using dianetics and available healing skills to succeed with scientology objectives but it has become plain particularly in the last few months when i have been sorting out materials to communicate them better that there is vast difference between dianetics and scientology dianetic preclear is one who is being processed toward the objective of well and happy human being scientology preclear is well happy human being who is being processed toward total ability and spiritual freedom those two definitions should be well learned it will prevent much confusion and some failures when i hear of preclear getting his grade iv to get rid of his headaches i really groan preclear getting his grade iv obviously never got his dianetic auditing and the auditors who audited him were mixed up i would never never never audit pc on grades if i found before sick person i would simply change gears get busy with good old dianetics and use physical healers if necessary to get well happy pc before then i would go on with grades scientology objectives are so far above anything man has any hope for that he at once thinks of them as healing activities they are not dianetics is the healing activity therefore all dianetic course materials are refined with that objective fully in view and when scientology auditor finds himself with dianetic preclear on his hands and if that auditor learned his dianetics well then he will apply dianetics and when the preclear is ready for it only then will he apply scientology any scientology failures are totally owing to the auditor not learning his dianetics in the first place so have at it and get hatful of healing wins as dianetic auditor lrhjkaap l ron hubbard copyright 1969 founder by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard

brother by somatic is meant pain or ache sensation and also misemotion or even unconsciousness there are thousand different descriptive words that could add up to feeling pain aches dizziness sadnessthese are all feelings awareness pleasant or unpleasant of body is what we are trying to run in dianetics all chains are held together by one similar feeling that is new discovery chains are not held together by narratives or personnel or locations they are held together by feelings thus we ask for and follow down only feelings those can be aches pains sensations misemotionany feeling this brings to light further discovery one never assesses medical terms or symptoms an engram contains pain and unconsciousness all right then its basic would be physical duress not symptom resulting from that duress example the pc says headache you assess headache you try to run headaches and all you ever get is times pc had headache well the headache is symptom caused by head injury the engram must have contained shot in the head or crushed skull or some actual injury the word headache would describe only how the head feels later when the engram occasionally goes into restimulation so you would get only locks and secondaries to audit and only by chance and an alteration by the pc of the command to find an earlier headache would you ever get to an engram in which the head was crushed or injured headache is the result of head injury and it doesnt describe the injury which in engram form is now giving the pc headaches take the medical term arthritis you could ask for arthritis and get only visits to the doctor or times in wheel chair the physical injury contained in the engram causing the arthritis is not described alcoholism would present the same problem if the pc listed and the auditor assessed alcoholism we would only get times when he was drunk not the engram causing the symptom which might contain feeling very dry therefore one has more than one column on health form one would give the physical disability or complaint the second would be pcs description of the feeling we would land the real engram every time not only its locks or secondaries it is quite all right to run locks and secondaries as it is necessary to unburden the chain and increase the pcs confront but chains always end up in basic engram at the bottom and if you dont get and erase that then the chain will key in again in asking for list items one puts down only what the pc says thats an invariable rule but when the pc says some mere symptom like headache or medical term like arthritis the auditor writes it down but also asks what is the feeling of that or some such question and writes what the pc then says and only assesses the feeling statedexample pc says complaint is sinusitis the auditor writes it down but asks also for the feeling of it the pc says burning sensation in the nose in assessing the list the auditor does not call out sinusitis he says burning sensation in the nose and marks down its meter read if the auditor took and assessed only sinusitis and then asked for incidents of sinusitis he would get only locks and secondariestimes when the engram was in restimulation and he would rarely get the real basic and engram that causes the symptom this discovery opens the door to swift cures but one is obviously not treating sinusitis he is looking for an incident in which there was burning sensation in the nose and after few locks and upper engrams hed find and run the real injury in which the nose was burned l ron hubbard founder lrhjcldm ei rd

less than the bank by bank is meant the mental image picture collection of the pc it comes from computer technology where all data is in bank the difference between auditors is not that one has more data than another or more tricks the difference is that one auditor will get better results than another due to his stricter adherence to procedure better trs more confident manner and closer

you will find usually long period of noauditing or flubbed session few days before the onset of the illness pcs who have not been properly programmed but have been audited on random this or that instead of progress advance and class and grade chart to fully completed grades are the most likely to become ill penalty for violation of the 24 hour rule is loss of days stats for the division the day being that day when the unrepaired flub occurred and subtracted at the time the flub is found if flubbed session is found hidden and not disclosed the division loses all its stats for that week

procedure on certain preclears i have been able to view the underlying motives and mechanisms of psychosis very possibly this is the first time the mechanisms which bring about insanity have been fully viewed i must say that it requires bit of confronting the alleviation of the condition of insanity has also been accomplished now and the footnote in dianetics the modern science of mental health concerning future research into this field can be considered fulfilled the things cs should know about insanity are as follows higher percent about 15 to 20 of the human race apparently is insane or certainly much higher percent than was estimated the truly insane do not necessarily act insane visibly they are not the psychiatric obvious cases who go rigid for years or scream for days this is observed only in the last stages or during temporary stress under apparent social behavior the continual crimes knowingly committed by the insane are much more vicious than ever has been catalogued in psychiatric texts the actions of the insane are not unconscious they are completely aware of what they are doing all insane actions are entirely justified and seem wholly rational to them as they have reality on the harmful and irrational nature of their conduct it does not often register on an meter the product of their post duties is destructive but is excused as ignorance or errors as cases in normal processing they roller coaster continually they nearly always have fixed emotional tone it does not vary in nearly all insane people in very few it is cyclic high then low all characteristics classified as those of the suppressive person are in fact those of an insane person the easiest ways for cs to detect the insane are1 pretending to do post or duties the real consistent result is destructive to the group in terms of breakage lost items injured business etc 2 the case is case gain or roller coaster and is covered under pts symptoms 3 they are usually chronically physically ill 4 they have deep but carefully masked hatred of anyone who seeks to help them 5 the result of their help is actually injurious 6 they often seek transfers or wish to leave 7 they are involved in warfare with conflicts around them which are invisible to others one wonders how they can be so involved or get so involved in so much hostility types the german psychiatric 1500 or so different types of insanity are just different symptoms of the same cause there is only one insanity and from it springs different manifestations psychiatry erred in calling these different types and trying to invent different treatments definition insanity can now be precisely defined the definition is insanity is the overt or covert but always complex and continuous determination to harm or destroy possibly the only frightening thing about it is the cleverness with which it can be hidden whereas sane person can become angry or upset and bit destructive for short periods he or she recovers the insane mask it are misemotional continuously and do not recover except by modern processing the nature of man man is basically good this is obvious for when he begins to do evil he seeks to destroy his memory in order to change and seeks to destroy his body he seeks to check his evil impulses by inhibiting his own skill and strength he can act in very evil fashion but his basic nature then makes it mandatory that he lessens himself in many ways the towering strength of madman is rarity and is compensated by efforts at self destruction mans mortality his one life fixation all stem from his efforts to check himself obliterate his memory in fruitless effort to change his conduct and his selfdestructive habits and impulses and losses of skills and abilities as this rationale proves out completely in processing and fits all cases observed we have for the first time proof of his actual natureas only around 20 are insane and as those who previously worked in the mental field were themselves mainly insane man as whole has been assigned an evil repute govemments where such personalities exist listen to the opinion of the insane and apply the characteristic of 20 to the entire hundred percent this gives an 80 wrong diagnosis which is why mental science itself was destructive when used by states techniques the only technique available at this writing which will benefit the insane is contained in all the overtmotivator sequences and grade ii technology at flag at this writing new improvement on this exists but it is so powerful that slight errors in use can cause psychotic break in the insane it therefore will only be exported for use by specially trained persons and this programming will require quite while meanwhile it helps the cs to know and use

psychotic being processed will not recover but may even trigger into psychotic break if one never ran anything but motivators psychotic manifestations would not erase depend on expanded grade ii technology to ease off or handle the insane dont keep asking whats been done to him as hell trigger new discovery on this is that when you run out the motivator the person gets higher reality on his overts if you ran out all his motivators he would have reason for his overts if these are not then run out he might cave himself in pattern of behavior the apparent pattern of insane behavior is to come in ask for processing go on staff etc with the advertised intention of being helped or helping then mess up either as pc or on post then state how bad it all is and leave it looks obvious enough he came found it bad left that is only the apparent behavior apparent reasons based on numerous cases this is the real cycle hearing of something good that might help these hateful awful rotten nasty people the psycho comes in wrecks this upsets that caves in this one chops up that one and when somebody says the psychotic either caves himself in physically or b runs away the psychotic is motivated by intent to harm if he realizes he is harming things he shouldnt he caves himself in if he is afraid he will be found out he runsin the psychotic the impulse is quite conscious conclusion none of this is very nice it is hard to confront even i find it so freud thought all men had hidden monster in them for he dealt mainly with the psychotic and their behavior was what he saw all men are not like this the percentage that are is greater than i supposed but is long way from all men sometimes one only becomes aware of these when things are getting worked on and improved they stay on as long as it can be made bad or there is hope it can be destroyed then when attention is given to improvement they blow artists writers often have these types hanging around them as there is someone or something there to be destroyed when success or failure to destroy or possible detection appears on the scene they blow often as destructively as possible orgs are subjected to lot of this psychotic sometimes succeeds in blowing off good staff and then sooner or later realizes how evil he is acting and sickens or leaves the society is not geared to any of this at all the insane walk around wrecking the place and decent people think its human nature or inevitable or bad childhood as of this writing the insane can be handled the proof of any pudding is the processing and this is successful it is also rather swift but as i say it is so swift the special technique has to be done by the specially trained flubless auditor for long while ive realized that we would have to be able to handle insane people as the psychiatrist is fading i have had opportunity to work on the problem and have it handled until it is fully released the cs will benefit greatly from knowing the above as these come on his lines far more often than he has suspected the insane can be helped they are not hopeless i trust this data will be of use l ron hubbard founder lrh rrrd copyright 1970 by l ron

lower awareness levels77 the bridge78 the axioms of sop 8c81 the factors summation of the considerations and examinations of the human spirit and the material universe completed between ad 1923 and 1953 1 before the beginning was cause and the entire purpose of the cause was the creation of effect 2 in the beginning and forever is the decision and the decision is to be 3 the first action of beingness is to assume viewpoint 4 the second action of beingness is to extend from the viewpoint points to view which are dimension points 5 thus there is space created for the definition of space is viewpoint of dimension and the purpose of dimension point is space and point of view 6 the action of dimension point is reaching and withdrawing 7 and from the viewpoint to the dimension points there are connection and interchange thus new dimension points are made thus there is communication 8 and thus there is light 9 and thus there is energy 10 and thus there is life 11 but there are other viewpoints and these viewpoints outthrust points to view and there comes about an interchange amongst viewpoints but the interchange is never otherwise than in terms of exchanging dimension points 12 the dimension point can be moved by the viewpoint for the viewpoint in addition to creative ability and consideration possesses volition and potential independence of action and the viewpoint viewing dimension points can change in relation to its own or other dimension points or viewpoints thus comes about all the fundamentals there are to motion 13 the dimension points are each and every one whether large or small solid and they are solid solely because the viewpoints say they are solid 14 many dimension points combine into larges gases fluids or solids thus there is matter but the most valued point is admiration and admiration is so strong its absence alone permits persistence 15 the dimension point can be different from other dimension points and thus can possess an individual quality and many dimension points can possess similar quality and others can possess similar quality unto themselves thus comes about the quality of classes of matter 16 the viewpoint can combine dimension points into forms and the forms can be simple or complex and can be at different distances from the viewpoints and so there can be combinations of form and the forms are capable of motion and the viewpoints are capable of motion and so there can be motion of forms 117 and the opinion of the viewpoint regulates the consideration of the forms their stillness or their motion and these considerations consist of assignment of beauty or ugliness to the forms and these considerations alone are art 18 it is the opinions of the viewpoints that some of these forms should endure thus there is survival 19 and the viewpoint can never perish but the form can perish 20 and the many viewpoints interacting become dependent upon one anothers forms and do not choose to distinguish completely the ownership of dimension points and so comes about dependency upon the dimension points and upon the other viewpoints 21 from this comes consistency of viewpoint of the interaction of dimension points and this regulated is time 22 and there are universes 23 the universes then are three in number the universe created by one viewpoint the universe created by every other viewpoint the universe created by the mutual action of viewpoints which is agreed to be upheld the physical universe 24 and the viewpoints are never seen and the viewpoints consider more and more that the dimension points are valuable and the viewpoints try to become the anchor points and forget that they can create more points and space and forms thus comes about scarcity and the dimension points can perish and so the viewpoints assume that they too can perish 25 thus comes about death 26 the manifestations of pleasure and pain of thought emotion and effort of thinking of sensation of affinity reality communication of behavior and being are thus derived and the riddles of our universe are apparently contained and answered herein there is beingness but man believes there is only becomingness 28 the resolution of any problem posed hereby is the establishment of viewpoints and dimension points the betterment of condition and concourse amongst dimension points and thereby viewpoints and the remedy of abundance or scarcity in all things pleasant or ugly by the rehabilitation of the ability of the viewpoint to assume points of view and create and uncreate neglect start change and stop dimension points of any kind at the determinism of the viewpoint certainty in all three universes must be regained for certainty not data is knowledge 29 in the opinion of the viewpoint any beingness anything is better than nothing any effect is better than effect any universe better than universe any particle better than particle but the particle of admiration is best of all 30 and above these things there might be speculation only and below these things there is the playing of the game but these things which are written here man can experience and know and some may care to teach these things and some may care to use them to assist those in distress and some may desire to employ them to make individuals and organizations more able and so give to earth culture of which we can be proud humbly tendered as gift to man by lron hubbard april 23 1953 2the qs the prelogics q1 selfdeterminism is the common denominator of all life impulses definition of selfdeterminism the ability to locate in space and time energy and matter also the ability to locate in space and time energy and matter also the ability to create space and time in which to create and locate energy and matter b the identification of the source of that which places matter and energy and originates space and time is not necessary to the resolution of this problem at this time q2 theta creates space energy and objects by postulates q3 universes are created by the application of self determinism on eight dynamics q4 selfdeterminism applied will create alter conserve and possibly destroy universes q5 the action cycle is one of the abilities of thetan an action cycle goes from 400 to o0 on the tone scale an action cycle is the creation growth conservation decay and death or destruction of energy and matter in spaceaction cycles produce time note this edition restores the q numbers as given in the philadelphia doctorate course lectures of december 1952 3consideration and mechanics considerations take rank over the mechanics of space energy and time by this it is meant that an idea or opinion is fundamentally superior to space energy and time or organizations of form since it is conceived that space energy and time are themselves broadly agreedupon considerations that so many minds agree brings about reality in the form of space energy and time these mechanics then of space energy and time are the product of agreedupon considerations mutually held by life the aspects of existence when viewed from the level of man however is reverse of the greater truth above for man works on the secondary opinion that mechanics are real and that his own personal considerations are less important than space energy and time this is an inversion these mechanics of space energy and time the forms objects and combinations thereof have taken such precedence in man that they have become more important than considerations as suchand so his ability is overpowered and he is unable to act freely in the framework of mechanics man therefore has an inverted view whereas considerations such as those he daily makes are the actual source of space energy time and forms man is operating so as not to alter his basic considerations he therefore invalidates himself by supposing another determinism of space energy time and form although he is part of that which created these he gives them such strength and validity that his own considerations thereafter must fall subordinate to space energy time and form and so he cannot alter the universe in which he dwells the freedom of an individual depends upon that individuals freedom to alter his considerations of spaceenergy time and forms of life and his roles in it if he cannot change his mind about these he is then fixed and enslaved amidst barriers such as those of the physical universe and barriers of his own creation man thus is seen to be enslaved by barriers of his own creation he creates these barriers himself or by agreeing with things which hold these barriers to be actual there is basic series of assumptions in processing which assumptions do not alter the philosophy of scientology the first of these assumptions is that man can have greater freedom the second is that so long as he remains relatively sane he desires greater freedom and the third assumption is that the auditor desires to deliver greater freedom to that person with whom he is working if these assumptions are not agreed upon and are not used then auditing degenerates into the observation of effect which is of course goalless soulless pursuit and is indeed pursuit which has degraded what is called modern science the goal of processing is to bring an individual into such thorough communication with the physical universe that he can regain the power and ability of his own considerations postulates 4the axioms of scientology axiom 1 life is basically static definition life static has mass motion wavelength location in space or in time it has the ability to postulate and to perceive axiom 2 the static is capable of considerations postulates and opinions axiom 3 space energy objects form and time are the result of considerations made andor agreed upon or not by the static and are perceived solely because the static considers that it can perceive them axiom 4 space is viewpoint of dimension axiom 5 energy consists of postulated particles in space axiom 6 objects consist of grouped particles and solids axiom 7 time is basically postulate that space and particles will persist axiom 8 the apparency of time is the change of position of particles in space axiom 9 change is the primary manifestation of time axiom 10 the highest purpose in this universe is the creation of an effect axiom 11 the considerations resulting in conditions of existence are fourfold asisness is the condition of immediate creation persistence and is the condition of existence which exists at the moment of creation and the moment of destruction and is different from other considerations in that it does not contain survival b alterisness is the consideration which introduces change and therefore time and persistence into an asisness to obtain persistency c isness is an apparency of existence brought about by the continuous alteration of an asisness this is called when agreed upon reality d notisness is the effort to handle isness by reducing its condition through the use of force it is an apparency and cannot entirely vanquish an is ness axiom12 the primary condition of any universe is that two spaces energies or objects must not occupy the same space when this condition is violated perfect duplicate the apparency of any universe or any part thereof is nulled 5axiom 13 the cycle of action of the physical universe is create survive persist destroy axiom 14 survival is accomplished by alterisness and notis ness by which is gained the persistency known as time axiom 15 creation is accomplished by the postulation of an asis ness axiom 16 complete destruction is accomplished by the postulation of the asisness of any existence and the parts thereof axiom 17 the static having postulated asisness then practices alterisness and so achieves the apparency of isness and so obtains reality axiom 18 the static in practicing notisness brings about the persistence of unwanted existences and so brings about unreality which includes forgetfulness unconsciousness and other undesirable states axiom 19 bringing the static to view asis any condition devaluates that condition axiom 20 bringing the static to create perfect duplicate causes the vanishment of any existence or part thereof perfect duplicate is an additional creation of the object its energy and space in its own space in its own time using its own energy this violates the condition that two objects must not occupy the same space and causes vanishment of the object axiom 21 understanding is composed of affinity reality and communication axiom 22 the practice of notisness reduces understanding axiom 23 the static has the capability of total knowingness total knowingness would consist of total arc axiom 24 total arc would bring about the vanishment of all mechanical conditions of existence axiom 25 affinity is scale of attitudes which falls away from the coexistence of static through the interpositions of distance and energy to create identity down to close proximity but mystery by the practice of isness beingness and notisness refusal to be individuation progresses from the knowingness of complete identification down through the introduction of more and more distance and less and less duplication through lookingness emotingness effortingness thinkingness symbolizingness eatingness sexingness and so through to notknowingness mystery until the point of mystery is reached some communication is possible but even at mystery an attempt to communicate continues here we have in the case of an individual gradual falling away from the belief that one 6can assume complete affinity down to the conviction that all is complete mystery any individual is somewhere on this knowtomystery scale the original chart of human evaluation was the emotion section of this scale axiom 26 reality is the agreedupon apparency of existence axiom 27 an actuality can exist for one individually but when it is agreed with by others it can then be said to be reality the anatomy of reality is contained in isness which is composed of asis ness and alterisness isness is an apparency it is not an actuality the actuality is asisness altered so as to obtain persistencyunreality is the consequence and apparency of the practice of notisness axiom 28 communication is the consideration and action of compelling an impulse or particle from sourcepoint across distance to receipt point with the intention of bringing into being at the receiptpoint duplication and understanding of that which emanated from the source point the formula of communication is cause distance effect with intention attention and duplication with understanding the component parts of communication are consideration intention attention cause sourcepoint distance effect receiptpoint duplication understanding the velocity of the impulse or particle nothingness or somethingness noncommunication consists of barriers barriers consist of space interpositions such as walls and screens of fastmoving particles and time communication by definition does not need to be twoway when communication is returned the formula is repeated with the receiptpoint now becoming source point and the former sourcepoint now becoming receiptpoint axiom 29 in order to cause an asisness to persist one must assign other authorship to the creation than his own otherwise his view of it would cause its vanishment any space energy form object individual or physical universe condition can exist only when an alteration has occurred of the original asisness so as to prevent casual view from vanishing it in other words anything which is persisting must contain lie so that the original consideration is not completely duplicated axiom 30 the general rule of auditing is that anything which is is unwanted and yet persists must be thoroughly viewed at which time it will vanish if only partially viewed its intensity at least will decrease axiom 31 goodness and badness beautifulness and ugliness are alike considerations and have other basis than opinion axiom 32 anything which is not directly observed tends to persist axiom 33 any asisness which is altered by notisness by force tends to persist 7axiom 34 any isness when altered by force tends to persist axiom 35 the ultimate truth is static static has mass meaning mobility wavelength time location in space space this has the technical name of basic truth axiom 36 lie is second postulate statement or condition designed to mask primary postulate which is permitted to remain examples neither truth nor lie is motion or alteration of particle from one position to another lie is statement that particle having moved did not move or statement that particle not having moved did move the basic lie is that consideration which was made was not made or that it was different axiom 37 when primary consideration is altered but still exists persistence is achieved for the altering consideration all persistence depends on the basic truth but the persistence is of the altering consideration for the basic truth has neither persistence nor impersistence axiom 38 1 stupidity is the unknownness of consideration 2 mechanical definition stupidity is unknowness of time place form and event 1 truth is the exact consideration 2 truth is the exact time place form and event thus we see that failure to discover truth brings about stupidity thus we see that the discovery of truth would bring about an asisness by actual experiment thus we see that an ultimate truth would have time place form or event thus then we perceive that we can achieve persistence only when we mask truth lying is an alteration of time place event or form lying becomes alterisness becomes stupidity the blackness of cases is an accumulation of the cases own or anothers lies anything which persists must avoid asisness thus any thing to persist must contain lie axiom 39 life poses problems for its own solution axiom 40 any problem to be problem must contain lie if it were truth it would unmock 8an unsolvable problem would have the greatest persistence it would also contain the greatest number of altered facts to make problem one must introduce alterisness axiom 41 that into which alterisness is introduced becomes problem axiom 42 mest matter energy space time persists because it is problem axiom 43 time is the primary source of untruth it is problem because it contains alterisness axiom 44 theta the static has location in matter energy space or time it is capable of consideration axiom 45 theta can consider itself to be placed at which moment it becomes placed and to that degree problem axiom 46 theta can become problem by its considerations but then becomes mest problem is to some degree mest mest is problem axiom 47 theta can resolve problems axiom 48 life is game wherein theta as the static solves the problems of theta as mest axiom 49 to solve any problem it is only necessary to become theta the solver rather than theta the problem axiom 50 theta as mest must contain considerations which are lies axiom 51 postulates and live communication not being mest and being senior to mest can accomplish change in mest without bringing about persistence of mest thus auditing can occur axiom 52 mest persists and solidifies to the degree that it is not granted life axiom 53 stable datum is necessary to the alignment of data axiom 54 tolerance of confusion and an agreedupon stable datum on which to align the data in confusion are at once necessary for sane reaction on the eight dynamicsthis defines sanity axiom 55 the cycle of action is consideration create survive destroy the cycle of action accepted by the ge is only consideration which can be changed by the thetan making new consideration or different action cycles axiom 56 theta brings order to chaos 9corollary chaos brings disorder to theta axiom 57 order manifests when communication control and havingness are available to theta definition communication the interchange of ideas across space control positive postulating which is intention and the execution thereofhavingness that which permits the experience of mass and pressure axiom 58 intelligence and judgement are measured by the ability to evaluate relative importances corollary the ability to evaluate importances and uninimportances is the highest faculty of logic corollary identification is monotone assignment of importance corollary identification is the inability to evaluate differences in time location form composition or importance 10this is the auditors code of 1968 it supersedes any earlier codes it has been developed as part of the standard tech programme it is the official auditors code it is required of auditors and students under training that they know this code by heart know what it means and as they process practice it it is one thing to know it another to practice it good auditor does both it is not something to be read agreed with and forgotten following it means success in cases neglecting any part of it means failures it combines the arduously won experiences collected during eighteen years from the practice of thousands of auditors we want successes lrh the auditor issue 43 the auditors code ad 18 in celebration of the 100 percent gains attainable by standard tech i hereby promise as an auditor to follow the auditors code 1 i promise not to evaluate for the preclear or tell him what he should think about his case in session 2 i promise not to invalidate the preclears case or gains in or out of session 3 i promise to administer only standard tech to preclear in the standard way 4 i promise to keep all auditing appointments once made 5 i promise not to process preclear who has not had sufficient rest and who is physically tired 6 i promise not to process preclear who is improperly fed or hungry 7 i promise not to permit frequent change of auditors 8i promise not to sympathize with preclear but be effective 9 i promise not to let the preclear end session on his own determinism but to finish off those cycles i have begun 10 i promise never to walk off from preclear in session 11 i promise never to get angry with preclear in session 12 i promise to run every major case action to floating needle 13 i promise never to run any one action beyond its floating needle 14 i promise to grant beingness to the preclear in session 1115 i promise not to mix the processes of scientology with other practices except when the preclear is physically ill and only medical means will serve 16 i promise to maintain communication with the preclear and not to cut his comm or permit him to overrun in session 17 i promise not to enter comments expressions or enturbulence into session that distract preclear from his case 18 i promise to continue to give the preclear the process or auditing command when needed in the session 19 i promise not to let preclear run wrongly understood command 20 i promise not to explain justify or make excuses in session for any auditor mistakes whether real or imagined 21 i promise to estimate the current case state of preclear only by standard case supervision data and not to diverge because of some imagined difference in the case 22 i promise never to use the secrets of preclear divulged in session for punishment or personal gain 23 i promise to see that any fee received for processing is refunded following the policies of the claims verification board if the preclear is dissatisfied and demands it within three months after the processing the only condition being that he may not again be processed or trained 24 i promise not to advocate scientology only to cure illness or only to treat the insane knowing well it was intended for spiritual gain 25 i promise to cooperate fully with the legal organizations of dianetics and scientology as developed by l ron hubbard in safeguarding the ethical use and practice of the subject according to the basics of standard tech 26 i promise to refuse to permit any being to be physically injured violently damaged operated on or killed in the name of mental treatment 27 i promise not to permit sexual liberties or violation of the mentally unsound 28 i promise to refuse to admit to the ranks of practitioners any being who is insane 12the code of honor one expects the code of honor to be closely and tightly followed an ethical code cannot be enforced any effort to enforce the code of honor would bring it into the level of moral code it cannot be enforced simply because it is way of life which can exist as way of life only as long as it is not enforced any other use but self determined use of the code of honor would as any scientologist could quickly see produce considerable deterioration in person therefore its use is luxury use and which is done solely on selfdetermined action providing one sees eye to eye with the code of honor 1 never desert comrade in need in danger or in trouble 2 never withdraw allegiance once granted 3 never desert group to which you owe your support 4 never disparage yourself or minimize your strength or power 5 never need praise approval or sympathy 6 never compromise with your own reality 7 never permit your affinity to be alloyed 8 do not give or receive communication unless you yourself desire it 9 your self determinism and your honor are more important than your body 10 your integrity to yourself is more important than your body 11 never regret yesterday life is in you today and you make your tomorrow 12 never fear to hurt another in just cause 13 dont desire to be liked or admired 14 be your own adviser keep your own counsel and select your own decisions 15 be true to your own goals 13the code of scientologist as scientologist i pledge myself to the code of scientologist for the good of all 1 to keep scientologists the public and the press accurately informed concerning scientology the world of mental health and society 2 to use the best i know of scientology to the best of my ability to help my family friends groups and the world 3 to refuse to accept for processing and to refuse to accept money from any preclear or group i feel i cannot honestly help 4 to decry and do all i can to abolish any and all abuses against life and mankind 5 to expose and help abolish any and all physically damaging practices in the field of mental health 6 to help clean up and keep clean the field of mental health 7 to bring about an atmosphere of safety and security in the field of mental health by eradicating its abuses and brutality 8 to support true humanitarian endeavors in the field of human rights 9 to embrace the policy of equal justice for all 10 to work for freedom of speech in the world 11 to actively decry the suppression of knowledge wisdom philosophy or data which would help mankind 12 to support the freedom of religion 13 to help scientology organizations and groups ally themselves with public groups 14 to teach scientology at level it can be understood and used by the recipients 15 to stress the freedom to use scientology as philosophy in all its applications and variations in the humanities 16 to insist upon standard and unvaried scientology as an applied activity in ethics processing and administration in scientology organizations 17 to take my share of responsibility for the impact of scientology upon the world 18 to increase the numbers and strength of scientology over the world 19 to set an example of the effectiveness and wisdom of scientology 20 to make this world saner better place 14the creed of the church of scientology we of the church believe that all men of whatever race color or creed were created with equal rights that all men have inalienable rights to their own religious practices and their performance that all men have inalienable rights to their own lives that all men have inalienable rights to their sanity that all men have inalienable rights to their own defense that all men have inalienable rights to conceive choose assist and support their own organizations churches and governments that all men have inalienable rights to think freely to talk freely to write freely their own opinions and to counter or utter or write upon the opinions of others that all men have inalienable rights to the creation of their own kind that the souls of men have the rights of men that the study of the mind and the healing of mentally caused ills should not be alienated from religion or condoned in non religious fields and that agency less than god has the power to suspend or set aside these rights overtly or covertly and we of the church believe that man is basically good that he is seeking to survive that his survival depends upon himself and upon his fellows and his attainment of brotherhood with the universe and we of the church believe that the laws of god forbid man to destroy his own kind to destroy the sanity of another to destroy or enslave anothers soul to destroy or reduce the survival of ones companions or ones group and we of the church believe that the spirit can be saved and that the spirit alone may save or heal the body 15the supervisors code and stable data the supervisors code 1 the supervisor must never neglect an opportunity to direct student to the actual source of scientology data 2 the supervisor should invalidate students mistake ruthlessly and use good arc while doing it 3 the supervisor should remain in good arc with his students at all times while they are performing training activities 4 the supervisor at all times must have high tolerance of stupidity in his students and must be willing to repeat any datum not understood as many times as necessary for the student to understand and acquire reality on the datum 5 the supervisor does not have case in his relationship with his students nor discuss or talk about his personal problems to the students 6 the supervisor will at all times be source point of good control and direction to his students 7 the supervisor will be able to correlate any part of scientology to any other part and to livingness over the 8 dynamics 8 the supervisor should be able to answer any questions concerning scientology by directing the student to the actual source of the data if supervisor cannot answer particular question he should always say so and the supervisor should always find the answer to the question from the source and tell the student where the answer is to be found 9 the supervisor should never lie to deceive or misdirect student concerning scientology he shall be honest at all times about it with student 10 the supervisor must be an accomplished auditor 11 the supervisor should always set good example to his students such as giving good demonstrations being on time and dressing neatly 12 the supervisor should at all times be perfectly willing and able to do anything he tells his students to do 13 the supervisor must not become emotionally involved with students of either sex while they are under his or her training 14 when supervisor makes any mistake he is to inform the student that he has made one and rectify it immediately this datum embraces all phases in training demonstrations lectures and processing etc he is never to hide the fact that he made the mistake 15 the supervisor should never neglect to give praise to his students when due 16 the supervisor to some degree should be pandetermined about the supervisorstudent relationship 1617 when supervisor lets student control give orders to or handle the supervisor in any way for the purpose of demonstration or other training purposes the supervisor should always put the student back under his control 18 the supervisor will at all times observe the auditors code during sessions and the code of scientologist at all times 19 the supervisor will never give student opinions about scientology without labelling them thoroughly as such otherwise he is to direct only to tested and proven data concerning scientology 20 the supervisor shall never use student for his own personal gain 21 the supervisor will be stable terminal point the way to stable data be certain but not dogmatic or dictatorial toward his students 22 the supervisor will keep himself at all times informed of the most recent scientology data and procedures and communicate this information to his students supervisors stable data in addition to the supervisors code there is primary stable datum about all supervision get the student to accomplish auditing the preclear and then get the student to accomplish it with better form speed and accuracy supervisor must never lose sight of the purpose of auditing auditing is for the preclear is intended to improve the preclears case auditing is not just matter of good form the reason some students do not accomplish auditing is that they become so oriented on form alone that they forget the purpose of the form good auditing form and correct sessioning obtains many times the result of bad form and incorrect sessioning but total form and effort to do something for the preclear results in auditing the result comes before the form in importance because students may use this idea to excuse lack of form q and aing and to squirrel with their processes the datum becomes unpopular with supervisors student should first be held responsible for the state of the preclear during and after sessions and made to know that as an auditor he is there to get fast good result the student should then be taught that he can get better faster result with better form after that the student should be taught that scientology results are only obtained by correct and exact duplication of scientology processes not by offbeat variations the student wants to know how to do this or that refer him to his materials on how to do the most fundamental actions but make him or her do it and keep up running refrain that you want results results results on his preclear the student will be all thumbs and faint the supervisor may be horrified by the goofs but dont bother with the goofs just demand results on the preclear results on the preclear results on the preclear 17this action by the supervisor will teach the student that he or she is supposed to get results in auditing and b that results can be obtained and c that he or she sure needs better skill so the first address in training is to teach those above three things b and c you cant teach student who doesnt realize that results in the preclear depend on the auditor and auditing and that results are expected from auditing who believes results cant be obtained from auditing or wants to prove auditing doesnt work and who doesnt yet know that he or she doesnt know these are the barriers to training and good auditor the gradient approach to the mind is vital clearing will not occur without it but the gradient approach to auditing can be overdone to point where the student completely loses sight of why he is auditing 1 first and foremost the auditor accomplishes something for the preclear and without that there is neither sense nor purpose to auditing 2 excellent form accomplishes more for the preclear faster and 3 exact duplication of processes alone returns standard high level results on all preclears the student thrown in over his head learns results in the preclear depend on the auditor and auditing and that results are expected from auditing b that results can be obtained in auditing and the better the form and duplication the better the results and c that the student has more to learn about auditing and that the student doesnt yet know therefore the supervisor must teach the student that he or she is supposed to get results in auditing b that scientology can obtain results and c that better form and duplication obtain better faster results i dare say many students learn things just because they are told to and find relationship between form duplication and the preclear let them fall on their heads and yet obtain results and this attitude will change and youll save us lot of offbeat nonsense and case failures in organizations and the field 18the credo of good and skilled manager to be effective and successful manager must 1 understand as fully as possible the goals and aims of the group he manages he must be able to see and embrace the ideal attainment of the goal as envisioned by goal maker he must be able to tolerate and better the practical attainments and advances of which his group and its members may be capable he must strive to narrow always the ever existing gulf between the ideal and the practical 2 he must realize that primary mission is the full and honest interpretation by himself of the ideal and ethic and their goals and aims to his subordinates and the group itself he must lead creatively and persuasively toward these goals his subordinates the group itself and the individuals of the group 3 he must embrace the organization and act solely for the entire organization and never form or favor cliques his judgement of individuals of the group should be solely in the light of their worth to the entire group 4 he must never falter in sacrificing individuals to the good of the group both in planning and execution and in his justice 5 he must protect all established communication lines and complement them where necessary 6 he must protect all affinity in his charge and have himself an affinity for the group itself 7 he must attain always to the highest creative reality 8 his planning must accomplish in the light of goals and aims the activity of the entire group he must never let organizations grow and sprawl but learning by pilots must keep organizational planning fresh and flexible 9 he must recognize in himself the rationale of the group and receive and evaluate the data out of which he makes his solutions with the highest attention to the truth of that data 10 he must constitute himself on the orders of service to the group 11 he must permit himself to be served well as to his individual requirements practicing an economy of his own efforts and enjoying certain comforts to the end of keeping high his rationale 12 he should require of his subordinates that they relay into their own spheres of management the whole and entire of his true feelings and the reasons for his decisions as clearly as they can be relayed and expanded and interpreted only for the greater understanding of the individuals governed by those subordinates 13 he must never permit himself to pervert or mask any portion of the ideal and ethic on which the group operates nor must he permit the ideal and ethic to grow old and outmoded and unworkable he must never permit his planning to be perverted or censored by subordinates he must never permit the ideal and ethic of the groups individual members to deteriorate using always reason to interrupt such deterioration 14 he must have faith in the goals faith in himself and faith in the group 1915 he must lead by demonstrating always creative and constructive subgoals he must not drive by threat and fear 16 he must realize that every individual in the group is engaged in some degree in the managing of other men life and mest and that liberty of management within this code should be allowed to every such submanager thus conducting himself manager can win empire for his group whatever that empire may be how to live though an executive 20primary axioms from the original thesis axiom 1 survive axiom 2 the purpose of the mind is to solve problems relating to survival axiom 3 the mind directs the organism the species its symbiotes or life in the effort of survival axiom 4 the mind as the central direction system of the body poses perceives and resolves problems of survival and directs or fails to direct their execution axiom 5 the persistency of the individual in life is directly governed by the strength of his basic dynamic axiom 6 intelligence is the ability of an individual group or race to resolve problems relating to survival dianetics the original thesis 1948 21the fundamental axioms of dianetics the dynamic principle of existence survive survival considered as the single and sole purpose subdivides into four dynamics dynamic one is the urge of the individual toward survival for the individual and his symbiotes by symbiote is meant all entities and energies which aid survival dynamic two is the urge of the individual toward survival through procreation it includes both the sex act and the raising of progeny the care of children and their symbiotes dynamic three is the urge of the individual toward survival for the group or the group for the group and includes the symbiotes of that group dynamic four is the urge of the individual toward survival for mankind or the urge toward survival of mankind for mankind as well as the group for mankind etc and includes the symbiotes of mankind the absolute goal of survival is immortality or infinite survival this is sought by the individual in terms of himself as an organism as spirit or as name or as his children as group of which he is member or as mankind and the progeny and symbiotes of others as well as his own the reward of survival activity is pleasure the ultimate penalty of destructive activity is death or complete nonsurvival and is pain successes raise the survival potential toward infinite survival failures lower the survival potential toward death the human mind is engaged upon perceiving and retaining data composing or computing conclusions and posing and resolving problems related to organisms along all four dynamics and the purpose of perception retention concluding and resolving problems is to direct its own organism and symbiotes and other organisms and symbiotes along the four dynamics toward survival intelligence is the ability to perceive pose and resolve problems the dynamic is the tenacity to life and vigor and persistence in surivival both the dynamic and intelligence are necessary to persist and accomplish and neither is constant quantity from individual to individual group to group the dynamics are inhibited by engrams which lie across them and disperse life force intelligence is inhibited by engrams which feed false or improperly graded data into the analyzer happiness is the overcoming of not unknown obstacles toward known goal and transiently the contemplation of or indulgence in pleasure the analytical mind is that portion of the mind which perceives and retains experience data to compose and resolve problems and direct the organism along the four dynamics it thinks in differences and similarites 22the reactive mind is that portion of the mind which files and retains physical pain and painful emotion and seeks to direct the organism solely on stimulusresponse basis it thinks only in identities the somatic mind is that mind which directed by the analytical or reactive mind places solutions into effect on the physical level training pattern is that stimulusresponse mechanism resolved by the analytical mind to care for routine activity or emergency activity it is held in the somatic mind and can be changed at will by the analytical mind habit is that stimulusresponse reaction dictated by the reactive mind from the content of engrams and put into effect by the somatic mind it can be changed only by those things which change engrams aberrations under which is included all deranged or irrational behavior are caused by engrams they are stimulusresponse pro and contrasurvival psychosomatic ills are caused by engrams the engram is the single source of aberrations and psychosomatic ills moments of unconsciousness when the analytical mind is attenuated in greater or lesser degree are the only moments when engrams can be received the engram is moment of unconsciousness containing physical pain or painful emotion and all perceptions and is not available to the analytical mind as experience emotion is three things engramic response to situations endocrine metering of the body to meet situations on an analytical level and the inhibition or the furtherance of life force the potential value of an individual or group may be expressed by the equation pv idx where i is intelligence and d is dynamic the worth of an individual is computed in terms of the alignment on any dynamic of his potential value with optimum survival along that dynamic high pv may by reversed vector result in negative worth as in some severly aberrated persons high pv on any dynamic assures high worth only in the unaberrated person dianetics the modern science of mental health 23the logics logic 1 knowledge is whole group or subdivision of group of data or speculations or conclusions on data or methods of gaining data logic 2 body of knowledge is body of data aligned or unaligned or methods of gaining data logic 3 any knowledge which can be sensed measured or experienced by any entity is capable of influencing that entity corollary that knowledge which cannot be sensed measured or experienced by any entity or type of entity cannot influence that entity or type of entity logic 4 datum is facsimile of states of being states of not being actions or inactions conclusions or suppositions in the physical or any other universe logic 5 definition of terms is necessary to the alignment statement and resolution of suppositions observations problems and solutions and their communication definition descriptive definition one which classifies by characteristics by describing existing states of being definition differentiative definition one which compares unlikeness to existing states of being or not being definition associative definition one which declares likeness to existing states of being or not being definition action definition one which delineates cause and potential change of state of being by cause of existence inexistence action inaction purpose or lack of purpose logic 6 absolutes are unobtainable logic 7 gradient scales are necessary to the evaluation of problems and their data this is the tool of infinityvalued logic absolutes are unobtainable terms such as good and bad alive and dead right and wrong are used only in conjunction with gradient scales on the scale of right and wrong everything above zero or center would be more and more right approaching an infinite rightness and everything below center would be more and more wrong approaching infinite wrongness all things assisting the survival of the survivor are considered to be right for the survivor all things inhibiting survival from the viewpoint of the survivor can be considered wrong for the survivor the more thing assists survival the more it can be considered right for the survivor the more thing or 24action inhibits survival the more it is wrong from the viewpoint of the intended survivor corollary any datum has only relative truth corollary truth is relative to environments experience and truth logic 8 datum can be evaluated only by datum of comparable magnitude logic 9 datum is as valuable as it has been evaluated logic 10 the value of datum is established by the amount of alignment relationship it imparts to other data logic 11 the value of datum or field of data can be established by its degree of assistance in survival or its inhibition to survival logic 12 the value of datum or field of data is modified by the viewpoint of the observer logic 13 problems are resolved by compartmenting them into areas of similar magnitude and data comparing them to data already known or partially known and resolving each area data which cannot be known immediately may be resolved by addressing what is known and using its solution to resolve the remainder logic 14 factors introduced into problem or solution which do not derive from natural law but only authoritarian command aberrate that problem or solution logic 15 the introduction of an arbitrary into problem or solution invites the further introduction of arbitraries into problems and solutions logic 16 an abstract postulate must be compared to the universe to which it applies and brought into the category of things which can be sensed measured or experienced in that universe before such postulate can be considered workable logic 17 those fields which most depend upon authoritative opinion for their data least contain known natural law logic 18 postulate is as valuable as it is workable logic 19 the workability of postulate is established by the degree to which it explains existing phenomena already known by the degree that it predicts new phenomena which when looked for will be found to exist and by the degree that it does not require 25that phenomena which do not exist in fact be called into existence for its explanation logic 20 science may be considered to be large body of aligned data which has similarity in application and which has been deduced or induced from basic postulates logic 21 mathematics are methods of postulating or resolving real or abstract data in any universe and integrating by symbolization of data postulates and resolutions logic 22 the human mind is an observer postulator creator and storage place of knowledge logic 23 the human mind is servo mechanism to any mathematics evolved or employed by the human mind postulate the human mind and inventions of the human mind are capable of resolving any and all problems which can be sensed measured or experienced directly or indirectly corollary the human mind is capable of resolving the problem of the human mind the borderline of solution of this science lies between why life is surviving and how life is surviving it is possible to resolve how life is surviving without resolving why life is surviving logic 24 the resolution of the philosophical scientific and human studies such as economics politics sociology medicine criminology etc depends primarily upon the resolution of the problems of the human mind the human mind by definition includes the awareness unit of the living organism the observer the computer of data the spirit the memory storage the life force and the individual motivator of the living organisms it is used as distinct from the brain which can be considered to be motivated by the mind note the primary step in resolving the broad activities of man could be considered to be the resolving of the activities of the mind itself hence the logics carry to this point and then proceed as axioms concerning the human mind such axioms being substantiated as relative truths by much newly discovered phenomena the ensuing axioms from logic 24 apply less to the various ologies than they do to deaberrating or improving the operation of the mind it should not be thought that the following axioms are devoted to the construction of anything as limited as therapy which is only incidental to the resolution of human aberration and such things as psychomatic illnesses these axioms are capable of such solutions as has been demonstrated but such narrow application would indicate very narrow scope of view 26the axioms of dianetics axiom 1 the source of life is static of peculiar and particular properties axiom 2 at least portion of the static called life is impinged upon the physical universe axiom 3 that portion of the static of life which is impinged upon the physical universe has for its dynamic goal survival and only survival axiom 4 the physical universe is reducible to motion of energy operating in space through time axiom 5 that portion of the static of life concerned with the life organisms of the physical universe is concerned wholly with motion axiom 6 the life static has as one of its properties the ability to mobilize and animate matter into living organisms axiom 7 the life static is engaged in conquest of the physical universe axiom 8 the life static conquers the material universe by learning and applying the physical laws of the physical universe symbol the symbol for the life static in use hereafter is the greek letter theta axiom 9 fundamental operation of theta in surviving is bringing order into the chaos of the physical universe axiom 10 theta brings order into chaos by conquering whatever in mest may be prosurvival and destroying whatever in mest may be contrasurvival at least through the medium of life organisms symbol the symbol for the physical universe in use hereafter is mest from the first letters of the words matter energy space and time or the greek letter phi axiom 11 life organism is composed of matter and energy in space and time animated by theta symbol living organism or organisms will hereafter be represented by the greek letter lambda axiom 12 the mest part of the organism follows the laws of the physical sciences all lambda is concerned with motion axiom 13 theta operating through lambda converts the forces of the physical universe into forces to conquer the physical universe 27axiom 14 theta working upon physical universe motion must maintain harmonious rate of motion the limits of lambda are narrow both as to thermal and mechanical motion axiom 15 lambda is the intermediate step in the conquest of the physical universe axiom 16 the basic food of any organism consists of light and chemicals organisms can exist only as higher levels of complexities because lower levels of converters exist theta evolves organisms from lower to higher forms and supports them by the existence of lower converter forms axiom 17 theta via lambda effects an evolution of mest in this we have the waste products of organisms on the one hand as those very complex chemicals which bacteria make and on the other hand we have the physical face of the earth being changed by animals and men such changes as grass holding mountains from eroding or roots causing boulders to break buildings being built and rivers being dammed there is obviously an evolution in mest in progress under the incursion of theta axiom 18 lambda even within species varies in its endowment of theta axiom 19 the effort of lambda is toward survival the goal of lambda is survival the penalty of failure to advance toward that goal is to succumb definition persistence is the ability to exert continuance of effort toward survival goals axiom 20 lambda creates conserves maintains requires destroys changes occupies groups and dispersesmest lambda survives by animating and mobilizing or destroying matter and energy in space and time axiom 21 lambda is dependent upon optimum motion motion which is too swift and motion which is too slow are equally contrasurvival axiom 22 theta and thought are similar orders of static axiom 23 all thought is concerned with motion axiom 24 the establishment of an optimum motion is basic goal of reason definition lambda is chemical heat engine existing in space and time motivated by the life static and directed by thought 28axiom 25 the basic purpose of reason is the calculation or estimation of effort axiom 26 thought is accomplished by theta facsimiles of physical universe entities or actions axiom 27 theta is satisfied only with harmonious action or optimum motion and rejects or destroys action or motion above or below its tolerance band axiom 28 the mind is concerned wholly with the estimation ofeffort definition mind is the theta command post of any organism or organisms axiom 29 the basic errors of reason are failures to differentiate amongst matter energy space and time axiom 30 rightness is proper calculation of effort axiom 31 wrongness is always miscalculation of effort axiom 32 theta can exert itself directly or extensionally theta can direct physical application of the organism to the environment or through the mind can first calculate the action or extend as in language ideas axiom 33 conclusions are directed toward the inhibition maintenance or accelerations of efforts axiom 34 the common denominator of all life organisms is motion axiom 35 effort of an organism to survive or succumb is physical motion of life organism at given moment in time through space definition motion is any change in orientation in space definition force is random effort definition effort is directed force axiom 36 an organisms effort can be to remain at rest or persist in given motion static state has position in time but an organism which is remaining positionally in static if alive is still continuing highly complex pattern of motion such as the heart beat digestion etc the efforts of organisms to survive or succumb are assisted compelled or opposed by the efforts of other organisms matter energy space and time definition attention is motion which must remain at an optimum effort attention is aberrated by becoming unfixed and sweeping at random or becoming too fixed without sweeping 29unknown threats to survival when sensed cause attention to sweep without fixing known threats to survival when sensed cause attention to fix axiom 37 the ultimate goal of lambda is infinite survival axiom 38 death is abandonment by theta of life organism orrace or species where these can longer serve theta in its goals of infinite survival axiom 39 the reward of an organism engaging upon survival activity is pleasure axiom 40 the penalty of an organism failing to engage uponsurvival activity or engaging in nonsurvival activity is pain axiom 41 the cell and virus are the primary building blocks of life organisms axiom 42 the virus and cell are matter and energy animatedand motivated in space and time by theta axiom 43 theta mobilizes the virus and cell in colonial aggregations to increase potential motion and accomplish effort axiom 44 the goal of viruses and cells is survival in space through time axiom 45 the total mission of higher organisms viruses and cells is the same as that of the virus and cell axiom 46 colonial aggregations of viruses and cells can be imbued with more theta than they inherently contained axiom 47 effort can be accomplished by lambda only through the coordination of its parts toward goals axiom 48 an organism is equipped to be governed and controlled by mind axiom 49 the purpose of the mind is to pose and resolveproblems relating to survival and to direct the effort of the organism according to these solutions axiom 50 all problems are posed and resolved through estimations of effort axiom 51 the mind can confuse position in space with position in time counterefforts producing action phrases axiom 52 an organism proceeding toward survival is directedby the mind of that organism in the accomplishment of survival effort 30axiom 53 an organism proceeding toward succumb is directed by the mind of that organism in the accomplishment of death axiom 54 survival of an organism is accomplished by the overcoming of efforts opposing its survival note corollary for other dynamics definition dynamic is the ability to translate solutions into action axiom 55 survival effort for an organism includes the dynamic thrust by that organism for the survival of itselfits procreation its group its subspecies its species all life organisms material universe the life static and possibly supreme being note list of dynamics axiom 56 the cycle of an organism group of organisms or species is inception growth recreation decay anddeath axiom 57 the effort of an organism is directed toward the control of the environment for all the dynamics axiom 58 control of an environment is accomplished by the support of prosurvival factors along any dynamic axiom 59 any type of higher organism is accomplished by the evolution of viruses and cells into forms capable of better efforts to control or live in an environment axiom 60 the usefulness of an organism is determined by its ability to control the environment or to support organisms which control the environment axiom 61 an organism is rejected by theta to the degree that it fails in its goals axiom 62 higher organisms can exist only in the degree that they are supported by the lower organisms axiom 63 the usefullness of an organism is determined by the alignment of its efforts toward survival axiom 64 the mind perceives and stores all data of the environment and aligns or fails to align these according to the time they were perceived definition conclusion is the theta facsimiles of group of combined data definition datum is theta facsimile of physical action 31axiom 65 the process of thought is the perception of the present and the comparison of it to the perceptions and conclusions of the past in order to direct action in the immediate or distant future corollary the attempt of thought is to perceive realities of the past and present in order to predict or postulate realities of the future axiom 66 the process by which life effects its conquest of the material universe consists in the conversion of the potential effort of matter and energy in space and through time to effect with it the conversion of further matter and energy in space and through time axiom 67 theta contains its own theta universe effort which translates into mest effort axiom 68 the single arbitrary in any organism is time axiom 69 physical universe perceptions and efforts are received by an organism as force waves convert by facsimile into theta and are thus stored definition randomity is the misalignment through the internal or external efforts by other forms of life or the material universe of the efforts of an organism and is imposed on the physical organism by counter efforts in the environment axiom 70 any cycle of any life organism is from static to motion to static axiom 71 the cycle of randomity is from static through optimum through randomity sufficiently repetitious or similar to constitute another static axiom 72 there are two subdivisions to randomity data randomity and force randomity axiom 73 the three degrees of randomity consist of minus randomity optimum randomity and plus randomity definition randomity is component factor and necessary part of motion if motion is to continue axiom 74 optimum randomity is necessary to learning axiom 75 the important factors in any area of randomity are effort and countereffort note as distinguished from nearperceptions of effort axiom 76 randomity amongst organisms is vital to continuous survival of all organisms axiom 77 theta affects the organism other organisms and the physical universe by translating theta facsimiles into physical efforts or randomity of efforts 32definition the degree of randomity is measured by the randomness of effort vectors within the organism amongst organisms amongst races or species of organisms or between organisms and the physical universe axiom 78 randomity becomes intense in indirect ratio to the time in which it takes place modified by the total effort in the area axiom 79 initial randomity can be reinforced by randomities of greater or lesser magnitude axiom 80 areas of randomity exist in chains of similarity plotted against time this can be true of words and actions contained in randomities each may have its own chain plotted against time axiom 81 sanity consists of optimum randomity axiom 82 aberration exists to the degree that plus or minus randomity exists in the environment or past data of an organism group or species modified by the endowed self determinism of that organism group or species axiom 83 the selfdeterminism of an organism is determined by its theta endowment modified by minus or plus randomity in its environment or its existence axiom 84 the selfdeterminism of an organism is increased by optimum randomity of counterefforts axiom 85 the selfdeterminism of an organism is reduced by plus or minus randomity of counterefforts in the environment axiom 86 randomity contains both the randomness of efforts and the volume of efforts note an area of randomity can have gret deal of confusion but without volume of energy the confusion itself is negligible axiom 87 that countereffort is most acceptable to an organism which most closely appears to assist its accomplishment of its goal axiom 88 an area of severe plus or minus randomity can occlude data on any of the subjects of that plus or minus randomity which took place in prior time note shutoff mechanisms of earlier lives perceptics specific incidents etc axiom 89 restimulation of plus minus or optimum randomitycan produce increased plus minus or optimum randomity respectively in the organism 33axiom 90 an area of randomity can assume sufficient magnitude so as to appear to the organism as pain according to its goals axiom 91 past randomity can impose itself upon the present organism as theta facsimiles axiom 92 the engram is severe area of plus or minus randomity of sufficient volume to cause unconsciousness axiom 93 unconsciousness is an excess of randomity imposed by countereffort of sufficient force to cloud the awareness and direct function of the organism through the minds control center axiom 94 any countereffort which misaligns the organisms command of itself or its environment establishes plus or minus randomity or if of sufficient magnitude is an engram axiom 95 past engrams are restimulated by the control centers perception of circumstances similar to that engram in the present environment axiom 96 an engram is theta facsimile of atoms and molecules in misalignment axiom 97 engrams fix emotional response as that emotional response of the organism during the receipt of the counter effort axiom 98 free emotional response depends on optimum randomity it depends upon absence of or nonrestimulation of engrams axiom 99 theta facsimiles can recombine into new symbols axiom 100 language is the symbolization of effort axiom 101 language depends for its force upon the force which accompanied its definition note countereffort not language is aberrative axiom 102 the environment can occlude the central control of any organism and assume control of the motor controls of that organism engram restimulation locks hypnotism axiom 103 intelligence depends on the ability to select aligned or misaligned data from an area of randomity and so discover solution to reduce all randomity in that area axiom 104 persistence obtains in the ability of the mind to put solutions into physical action toward the realization of goals 34axiom 105 an unknown datum can produce data of plus or minus randomity axiom106 the introduction of an arbitrary factor or force without recourse to natural laws of the body or the area into which the arbitrary is introduced brings about plus or minus randomity axiom107 data of plus or minus randomity depends for its confusion on former plus or minus randomity or absent data axiom108 efforts which are inhibited or compelled by exterior efforts effect plus or minus randomity of efforts axiom109 behavior is modified by counterefforts which have impinged on the organism axiom110 the component parts of theta are affinity reality and communication axiom111 selfdeterminism consists of maximal affinity reality and communication axiom112 affinity is the cohesion of theta affinity manifests itself as the recognition of similarity of efforts and goals amongst organisms by those organisms axiom113 reality is the agreement upon perceptions and data in the physical universe all that we can be sure is real is that on which we have agreed is real agreement is the essence of reality axiom114 communication is the interchange of perception through the material universe between organisms or the perception of the material universe by sense channels axiom115 selfdeterminism is the theta control of the organism axiom116 selfdetermined effort is that countereffort which has been received into the organism in the past and integrated into the organism for its conscious use axiom117 the components of selfdeterminism are affinity communication and reality selfdeterminism is manifested along each dynamic axiom118 an organism cannot become aberrated unless it has agreed upon that aberration has been in communication with source of aberration and has had affinity for the aberrator axiom119 agreement with any source or pro survival postulates new reality for the organism 35axiom120 nonsurvival courses thoughts and actions require nonoptimum effort axiom121 every thought has been preceded by physical action axiom122 the mind does with thought as it has done with entities in the physical universe axiom123 all effort concerned with pain is concerned with loss organisms hold pain and engrams to them as latent effort to prevent loss of some portion of the organism all loss is loss of motion axiom124 the amount of countereffort the organism can overcome is proportional to the theta endowment of the organism modified by the physique of that organism axiom125 excessive countereffort to the effort of life organism produces unconsciousness axiom126 perceptions are always received in the control center of an organism whether the control center is in control of the organism at the time or not this is an explanation for the assumption of valences axiom127 all perceptions reaching the organisms sense channels are recorded and stored by theta facsimile axiom128 any organism can recall everything which it has perceived axiom129 an organism displaced by plus or minus randomity is thereafter remote from the perception recording center increased remoteness brings about occlusions of perceptions one can perceive things in present time and then because they are being recorded after they passed theta perception of the awareness unit they are recorded but cannot be recalled axiom130 theta facsimiles of countereffort are all that interpose between the control center and its recalls axiom131 any countereffort received into control center is always accompanied by all perceptics axiom132 the random counterefforts to an organism and the intermingled perceptions in the randomity can re exert that force upon an organism when restimulated definition restimulation is the reactivation of past countereffort by appearance in the organisms environment of similarity toward the content of the past randomity area 36axiom133 selfdeterminism alone brings about the mechanism of restimulation axiom134 reactivated area of the past randomity impinges the effort and the perceptions upon the organism axiom135 activation of randomity area is accomplished first by the perceptions then by the pain finally by the effort axiom136 the mind is plastically capable of recording all efforts and counterefforts axiom137 countereffort accompanied by sufficient enrandomed force impresses the facsimile of the countereffort personality into the mind of an organism axiom138 aberration is the degree of residual plus or minus randomity accumulated by compelling inhibiting or unwarranted assisting of efforts on the part of other organisms or the physical material universe aberration is caused by what is done to the individual not what the individual does plus his selfdeterminism about what has been done to him axiom139 aberrated behavior consists of destructive effort toward prosurvival data or entities on any dynamicor effort toward the survival of contrasurvival data or entities for any dynamic axiom140 valence is facsimile personality made capable of force by the countereffort of the moment or receipt into the plus or minus randomity of unconsciousness valences are assistive compulsive or inhibitive to the organism control center is not valence axiom141 control center effort is aligned toward goalthrough definite space as recognized incident in time axiom142 an organism is as healthy and sane as it is self determined the environmental control of the organism motorcontrols inhibits the organisms ability to change with the changing environmentsince the organism will attempt to carry forward with one set of responses when it needs by self determinism to create another tosurvive in another environment axiom143 all learning is accomplished by random effort axiom144 countereffort producing sufficient plus or minus randomity to record is recorded with an index of space and time as hidden as the remainder of its content axiom145 countereffort producing sufficient plus or minus randomity when activated by restimulation exerts 37itself against the environment or the organism without regard to space and time except reactivated perceptions axiom146 counterefforts are directed out from the organism until they are further enrandomed by the environ at which time they again activate against the control center axiom147 an organisms mind employs counterefforts effectively only so long as insufficient plus or minus randomity exists to hide differentiation of the facsimiles created axiom148 physical laws are learned by life energy only by impingement of the physical universe producing randomity and withdrawal from that impingement axiom149 life depends upon an alignment of force vectors in the direction of survival and the nullification of force vectors in the direction of succumb in order to survive corollary life depends upon an alignment of force vectors in the direction of succumb and the nullification of force vectors in the direction of succumb and the nullification of force vectors in the direction of survive in order to succumb axiom150 any area of randomity gathers to it situations similar to it which do not contain actual efforts but only perception axiom151 whether an organism has the goal of surviving or succumbing depends upon the amount of plus or minus randomity it has reactivated not residual axiom152 survival is accomplished only by motion axiom153 in the physical universe the absence of motion is vanishment axiom154 death is the equivalent to life of total lack of life motivated motion axiom155 acquisition of prosurvival matter and energy or organisms in space and time means increased motion axiom156 loss of prosurvival matter and energy or organisms in space and time means decreased motion axiom157 acquisition or proximity of matter energy or organisms which assist the survival of an organism increase the survival potentials of an organism axiom158 acquisition or proximity of matter energy or organisms which inhibit the survival of an organism decrease its survival potential 38axiom159 gain of survival energy matter or organisms increases the freedom of an organism axiom160 receipt or proximity of nonsurvival energy matter or time decreases the freedom of motion of an organism axiom161 the control center attempts the halting or lengthening of time the expansion or contraction of space and the decrease or increase of energy and matter this is primary source of invalidation and it is also primary source of aberration axiom162 pain is the balk of effort by countereffort in great intensity whether that effort is to remain at rest or in motion axiom163 perception including pain can be exhausted from an area of plus or minus randomity still leaving the effort and countereffort of that plus or minus randomity axiom164 the rationality of the mind depends upon an optimum reaction toward time definition sanity the computation of futures definition neurotic the computation of present time only definition psychotic computation only of past situations axiom 165 survival pertains only to the future corollary succumb pertains only to the present and past axiom166 an individual is as happy as he can perceive survival potentials in the future axiom167 as the needs of any organism are met it rises higher and higher in its efforts along the dynamics an organism which achieves arc with itself can better achieve arcwith sex in the future having achieved this it can achieve arc with groups having achieved this it can achieve arc with mankind etc axiom168 affinity reality and communication coexist in an inextricable relationship the coexistent relationship between affinity reality andcommunication is such that none can be increased without increasing the other two and none can be decreased withoutdecreasing the other two axiom169 any aesthetic product is symbolic facsimile or combination of facsimiles of theta or physical 39universes in varied randomities and volumes of randomities with the interplay of tones axiom170 an aesthetic product is an interpretation of the universes by an individual or group mind axiom171 delusion is the postulation by the imagination of occurrences in areas of plus or minus randomity axiom172 dreams are the imaginative reconstruction of areas of randomity or the resymbolization of the efforts of theta axiom173 motion is created by the degree of optimum randomity introduced by the countereffort to an organisms effort axiom174 mest which has been mobilized by life forms is in more affinity with life organisms than nonmobilized mest axiom175 all past perception conclusion and existence moments including those of plus or minus randomity are recoverable to the control center of the organism axiom176 the ability to produce survival effort on the part of an organism is affected by the degrees of randomity existing in its past this includes learning axiom177 areas of past plus or minus randomity can be readdressed by the control center of an organism and the plus or minus randomity exhausted axiom178 the exhaustion of past plus or minus randomities permits the control center of an organism to effect its own efforts toward survival goals axiom179 the exhaustion of selfdetermined effort from past area of plus or minus randomity nullifies the effectiveness of that area axiom180 pain is the randomity produced by sudden or strong counterefforts axiom181 pain is stored as plus or minus randomity axiom182 pain as an area of plus or minus randomity can re inflict itself upon the organism axiom183 past pain becomes ineffective upon the organism when the randomity of its area is addressed and aligned axiom184 the earlier the area of plus or minus randomity the greater selfproduced effort existed to repel it axiom185 later areas of plus or minus randomity cannot be re aligned easily until earlier areas are realigned 40axiom186 areas of plus or minus randomity become increased inactivity when perceptions of similarity are introduced into them axiom187 past areas of plus or minus randomity can be reduced and aligned by address to them in present time axiom188 absolute good and absolute evil do not exist in the mest universe axiom189 that which is good for an organism may be defined as that which promotes the survival of that organism corollary evil may be defined as that which inhibits or brings plus or minus randomity into the organism which iscontrary to the survival motives of the organism axiom190 happiness consists in the act of bringing alignment into hitherto resisting plus or minus randomity neither the act or action of attaining survival nor the accomplishment of this act itself brings about happiness axiom191 construction is an alignment of data corollary destruction is plus or minus randomity of data the effort of construction is the alignment toward the survival ofthe aligning organism destruction is the effort of bringing randomity into an area axiom192 optimum survival behavior consists of effort in the maximum survival interest in everything concerned in the dynamics axiom193 the optimum survival solution of any problem would consist of the highest attainable survival for every dynamic concerned axiom194 the worth of any organism consists of its value to the survival of its own theta along any dynamic advanced procedure and axioms 1951 41the fiftyfive human perceptions researched 1951 the overall subject of communication covers far more than the

series of tests or of performances used in rating individual intelligence or achievement websters seventh new collegiate the term gradient scale can be applied to anything and means scale of condition graduated from zero to infinity depending on the direction in which the scale is graduated there could be an infinity of wrongness or an infinity of rightness absolutes are considered unobtainable the difference between one point on these scales and another point could be as different or as wide as the entire range of the scale itself or it could be so tiny as to need the most minute discernment for its establishment life in its highest state top of the scale is understanding life in its lower states is in lower level of understanding understanding is composed of affinity reality and communication this triangle tells us that the coexistent relationship between affinity reality and communication is such that none can be decreased without decreasing the other two of the three communication is by far the most important affinity and reality exist to further communication under the heading of affinity we have for instance all the varied emotions which go from apathy at 01 through grief fear anger antagonism boredom enthusiasm exhilaration and serenity in that order it is affinity and this rising scale of the characteristics of emotion which give us the tone scale the

can be observed by an auditor and used to spot the preclears tone level either chronic or temporary on any or all dynamics these are some examples of what might be observed at different tone levels enthusiasm effect tolerable on self can receive large effects on self the man who loses his fortune and bounces back he is willing to receive other peoples opinions can accept large changes he knows he has had case change and is willing to change he can accept defeats and will persist does not compulsively prevent effect on self effect believed necessary on others he has considerable ability to create effects on others but is not under compulsion to create effects he is not compelled to affect other peoples lives he grants beingness can tolerate differences in people conservatism effect tolerable on self not very willing to receive effects that change the status quo not willing to be questioned on some subjects not willing to have other peoples attention directed to him such as being pointed out in crowd wearing outstanding clothes etc effect believed necessary on others believes effects which preserve the status quo are necessary somewhat cautious about creating an effect witholds those things he thinks might hurt your feelings or that you might not approve of believes he should not create too much effect but should be one of the crowd should respect the privacy of others boredom effect tolerable on self will receive any effect which produces pleasant randomity wants to be entertained but otherwise doesnt like to be shifted cant be bothered with most ideas and puts off any action effect believed necessary on others doesnt need to do anything about anything compulsion to do or not to do action either anger 67effect tolerable on self cant receive an effect on self and is fighting to ensure this pc stuck in an anger incident may manifest this in his inability to receive changes affinity others reality communication etc effect believed necessary on others must destroy anything that tries to create effect on him covertness effect tolerable on self cannot tolerate much effect on self tries to slip out of being an effect by covert means gives the impression of taking an order etc while holding destructive intent and intention to actually do it effect believed necessary on others believes large effect is necessary to handle others is incapable of doing this in any other than covert way must cause an effect but is unwilling to be known as the cause of bad effects if accused of having created bad effects he will claim his intention was good this pc will make excuses will make all sorts of conditions in doing process will try to give an answer that will satisfy the auditor without actually doing the command fear effect tolerable on self this person can take so little effect that he runs from the slightest thing jumps at door slam etc pc in fear will manifest this by stiffness leaning back in his chair whistling during session whistling in the dark he may turn pale shake cold sweat avoid answering questions squirm laugh nervously try to get out of session etc effect believed necessary on others believes the effect he would have to create to overcome those things which overwhelm him is huge so huge that he would rather go elsewhere than confront it may make lot of logical excuses to get out of being an effect going upscale to covertness propitiation effect tolerable on self very little does favors to protect himself against bad effects will try to appease the auditor to avoid continuing the process effect believed necessary on others propitiative actions grief effect tolerable on self tolerable effect would be the acquisition of tokens of better time pc with grief just under the surface may not be able to tolerate direct questioning on his problem without getting lump in his throat or being brought to tears someone elses grief might be enough effect to cause him to cry rough word might not be tolerable effect believed necessary on others believes that large effect would have to be created to overcome his overwhelming opposition but the idea of creating an effect on others produces the idea of loss and though he must create vast effects he is very close to the idea that he cannot create any effect thus the only thing he can do about it is cry 68apathy effect tolerable on self can accept even less effect here this is the effect case believes that everything is useless anyway therefore nothing could make any difference on him he will tell you that nothing is workable apathetically effect believed necessary on others believes that an infinite amount of effect must be created to get anything done thats why he is in apathy 69effect scale fromcan cause or receive any effect 400 to

other valid workable road charge the stored quantities of energy in the time track is the sole thing that is relieved or removed by the auditor from the time track when this charge is present in huge

experience space becomes beingness formula i permitting the preclear to discover with certainty where people and things are not in the present past and future recovers sufficient orientation to establish his knowledge and certainty of where he is and they are the application of this is accomplished by negative orientation of beingness havingness and doingness on each of eight dynamics in the present past and future ii bodies axiom in life experience energy becomes doingness axiom compulsive position precedes compulsive thinking axiom that which changes the preclear in space can evaluate for him formula ii permit the preclear to discover that he handles bodies and allow him to handle bodies in mockups and actuality and remedy his thirst for attention which he has received by contagion from bodies iii space prelogic theta creates space and time and objects to locate in them definition space is viewpoint of dimension axiom energy derives from imposition of space between terminals and reduction and expansion of that space formula iii permit the preclear to regain his ability to create space and impose it upon terminals to remove it from between terminals and to regain his security concerning the stability of mest space iv havingness axiom in life experience matter becomes havingness observation to thetan anything is better than nothing observation any preclear is suffering from problems of too little havingness any any reduction of his existing energy if not replaced will cause him to drop in tone formula iv the remedy of problems of havingness is accomplished by creating an abundance of all things as the preclear has rendered automatic his desires and ability to create and destroy and thus has placed havingness beyond his control the auditor should place in the control of the preclear his automaticities of havingness and unhavingness and permit him on his own self determinism to balance his havingness v terminals axiom space exists by reason of anchor points 81definition an anchor point is any particle or mass or terminal axiom energy is derived from mass by fixing two terminals in proximity in space axiom selfdeterminism is related to the ability to impose space between terminals axiom cause is potential source of flow axiom effect is potential receipt of flow axiom communication is the duplication at the receipt point of that which emanated at cause point axiom wrongness in terms of flow is inflow formula v the thetan is rehabilitated as to energy and terminals by remedying his postulates about outflow and inflow and drills relating to the outflow and inflow of energy according to the above axioms vi symbolization definition symbol is an idea fixed in energy and mobile in space formula vi the thetan who has been moved about by symbols is strengthened by mocking up and moving about and fixing in space ideas which have formerly moved him vii barriers axiom the mest universe is game consisting of barriers definition barrier is space energy object obstacles or time formula vii problems of barriers or their lack are resolved by contacting and penetrating creating and destroying validating and neglecting barriers by changing them or substituting others for them by fixing and unfixing attention upon their somethingness and nothingness viii duplication fundamental the basic action of existence is duplication logic all operating principles of life may be derived from duplication axiom communication is as exact as it approaches duplication axiom unwillingness to be cause is monitored by unwillingness to be duplicated axiom unwillingness to be an effect is monitored by unwillingness to duplicate axiom an inability to remain in geographical position brings about an unwillingness to duplicate axiom an enforced fixation in geographical position brings about an unwillingness to duplicate axiom inability to duplicate on any dynamic is the primary degeneration of the thetan 82axiom perception depends upon duplication axiom communication depends upon duplication axiom in the mest universe the single crime is duplication formula viii the primary ability and willingness of the thetan to duplicate must be rehabilitated by

auditing is sold by the hour where auditors are so engaged and the new folder routing line is in use this cs form is used full blank page pcs name red date auditors name red class of auditor required next sess session grade left blank auditors comment red or think about the case if he wishes the next cs 1 blue 832 blue 3 blue 4 blue auditor signature red the auditor does not grade his own session he leaves this blank the correctly admined folder is then given to tech services which routes it usually with the auditors other folders for the day to the cs the cs looks it over it is his final responsibility for the case being run right the cs looks to see if the examiner form taken by the examiner at session end fned if it did not he leaves the grade line blank as it is grade session see fn and well done hours as the auditor gets hour credit for the session if the cs and other admin is ok he writes ok with his initial in the session grade space if none of it is okay he leaves it blank and does the cs form or programs completely new in this last case he enters subtract figure in his log for the auditing time for the week against that auditors name if the exam form fned but the admin is not okay and the session actions were not okay the cs writes well done by exams on his own new cs in its proper place and ignores the form and subtracts the admin time in his book to subtract the admin from the auditors weeks stat if the session was not okay with fn at exams yet the admin and next cs are ok the auditor loses the session time in the cs but gets the admin time credited to his weeks stat the cs subtracts the session time in his book not the admin time of course as we hope is usually the case if the auditor did the cs did correct session got an fn at exam and did the admin and next cs is correct then the cs marks very well done in the blank space for session grade with his initial after inspection this would be the sole action of the cs regarding that folder by the cs writing in the session grade very well done well done okay flunk to cramming the auditor is receiving acknowledgement for his work and is not just acking himself the new line the ideal foldercs line can shift the number of well done hours from ceiling of 250 300 to 600800 with one cs matter how many auditors an org has older lines put 250 300 top ceiling on the orgs well done hours when hours could go above 600 due to the available auditors 20 or 30 new parallel line has to be manned by new cs new d of p and another examiner and more tech services personnel despite how hard the cs and anyone else in tech works line not so run will ceiling at about 250 hours matter how many auditors are hired cs using the old lines can cs for about 5 working auditors only with the line running any old way and even so will work himself half to death 84in trying to get pcs handled auditors will be added the cs will not be able to handle his job the line being faulty gets pegged at about 250 hours matter how hard the cs and admin people work with the same cs and tech services people and correct new line 24 to 30 auditors will be kept busy at their 5 hours day given auditing rooms and the stat will be able to rise to 600 to 800 new sequence 1 auditor picks up his pc folders and his pc schedule list at tech services at the start of his day from the leaving rack 2 tech services having duplicate list begins sending pcs to him using tech pages 3 the auditor gives the session 4 the auditor leaves the folder in the auditing room at session end and takes the pc to the examiner 5 the examiner simply does the exam form on meter with folder he sends the exam form hand route to tech services 6 the auditor returns at once to his auditing room and tech page has pc there waiting for him 7 having done all his pcs for the day the auditor carries his folders to the auditor admin room 8 tech services has placed the exam forms in the auditor admin room and sees they get into the auditors basket and the folder 9 the auditor does the complete admin of the session 10 the auditor does any program needed for future sessions 11 the auditor cses the folder for the next session 12 the auditor marks in box 2 columns on sheet stapled to the inside front cover the process the exam result the session time and the admin time he has just put in 13 the auditor hands his completed folders in to tech services 14 tech services gets the folders to the cs using folder page who comes on late and works the css hours 15 fed the folders rapidly by the folder page who is standing in the cs area the cs does his cs work if the folder page is fast removing folders and putting the new one in chasing up data and other bits for the cs the time of csing even when done very carefully will be found to average 3 to 5 minutes folder even when some require full programming but not fesing this makes ceiling of about 100 folders sessions day for the cs an output of 30 auditors needless to say the cs and the auditors have to know their business and qual cramming is used extensively both for new material and for flubs both in auditing and csing by auditors 16 the folder page gets the folders over to the d of p office preserving the piles per auditor as much as possible 85the cs posts the data he wants auditors to know or do on the auditors board of the auditors admin room he turns in his cramming orders into the d of p basket this finishes his actions where there is senior review cs there is hot spur line from the cs to the senior cs and back to the cs this is not necessarily an instant line it can be 12 hour lag line in orgs where co or exec dir or product officer or org officer is also very skilled cs this hot line would probably be in new tech in use fantastic completions and utter dog cases nobody can make anything out of go on this senior cs hot spur line there are very few of these only two or three day in very busy org the senior cs does these and sends them back to the cs they are then sent on as usual to the d of p 17 the director of processing comes on duty very early the csed folders will all be there the d of p has assignment master sheets that are kept up by the d of p the d of p does the days schedules list for each auditor the lists preferably have few too many pcs on them the d of p can tell what class of auditor is required for the next session because the auditor has marked it in in the upper righthand corner of the cs for the next session when the d of p has the lists done the folders are placed in the leaving rack of tech services and tech services now up and about is given the lists and gets to work on the scheduling board moving the names about to agree with the lists tech services does any room shifts or handlings at this time 18 the d of p now goes to the auditor admin room and begins to muster auditors from her muster list as they come in and gets them over to tech services 19 cramming personnel will be in there trying to get any crammings scheduled 20 tech services hands out folders which are in neat piles for each auditor and schedules to the auditors as they turn up and handles any arguments or shifts in sequence 21 tech pages are on phones or running to round up pcs and get them going to sessions which work continues all day 22 the d of p interviews any hungup or curious pcs or as requested by the cs or gets new auditors or keeps up admin this goes on until the cs comes in when the dofp is off 23 the auditor picking up his folders begins the cycle all over again at 1 above above 600 when the well done hours go above 600 week whole new hgc is put in duplicating the first with its own cs d of p ts auditing rooms and auditor admin room it would be hgc section two or hgc 2 with the original being hgc 1 special second cramming would have to be provided in qual for it at first they would share new hours and build up independently more hgcs are added to the department at each multiple 600 wd hours seniors 86the two chief seniors in the area are the cs for tech and the d of p for auditors and bodies it is the d of p who must see that auditors exist and are on post it is tech services who sees pcs are rounded up and audited the d of ts is actually in charge of pcs and all folder files and all board keepup work the d of p should have some tech training the d of ts need not have any the cs of course is the tech expert and should be an hsst if there are auditors it is the d of ps neck if there are cses it is the css neck if there are folders it is the d of tss neck and if there are auditing rooms it is the d of tss neck if signedup scheduled pcs dont get to session it is the d of tss neck if there are new pcs it is the d of ps neck who should begin to shoot dissem secs and registrars and procure new pcs on bypass for the org from this table of seniors and duties can be made cramming you will notice pcs are sent to review on this new line review actions are done in tech as patchup in tech the qual sec is responsible for overall tech quality but does it by cramming cses or auditors thus cramming is busy street cramming must be good checkouts excellent if an auditor doesnt grasp cs he has received he gets help from cramming auditors new to the hgc are given fast hard grooving in in cramming or qual interne course new auditors never audit until grooved in tech will be as good as the cramming officer can cram this line is grooved in by the has and kept in by qual or if there is qual it is kept in by the has who will find qual very embarrassing dummy run the line should be dummy run by folders pcs and auditors until they understand it people are often totally unaware of lines and get very sloppy thus this line has to be drilled hard on old and new tech personnel all must know this exact line it is good line 87fully in it raises the well done hours stat from 250 per week maximum at total overload to an easy 600 to 800 auditors must audit five hours day 25 minimum per week of well done hours for any bonus to be paid at all in the so they get pay at all much less bonuses if short on their 25 tech services and an unenergetic d of p or bad dissem sec and registrar setup can cause pc situation and often do unless pushed but counting feses and admin in on an auditors wd time helps slack periods to even out and one auditor can fes and program folders for others or from files if he is left adrift and shorttimed by the d of p or d of ts or until the tech division forces the dissem div and distribution div to really get on the ball and wear their hats on pc flow procurement the d of p has always had new pc procurement responsibility when all else failed or even when it didnt old folders for example are marvelous source of new auditing repairs and intensives an fes done on an old folder and letter to come in and get audited before you fall apart is excellent pc procurement usually neglected by registrars any procurement by d of p is legitimate auditors who have pcs can write procurement letters and have for 20 years summary this is beautiful line it has been piloted hard it will serve as well as it is checked out drilled in and used this line is the key to affluence from pcs alone but if the org isnt training auditors heavily youll soon have auditors to be on it and the org will not gain its high income low cost cushion from training this line is

cycle from the lrh tape 6 february 1964 comm cycle in auditing if you look over communication you will find that the magic of communication is about the only thing that makes auditing work the thetan in this universe has begun to consider himself mest and has begun to consider himself mass and the being that considers himself mass of course responds to the laws of electronics and the laws of newton he is actually incapable of generating very much or as ising very much an individual considers himself mesty or massy and therefore he has to have second terminal second terminal is required to discharge the energy here we have two poles we have an auditor and pc and as long as the auditor audits and the pc replies we get an exchange of energy from the pcs point of view many auditors think they are being second terminal to the degree that they pick up the somatics and illnesses of the pc actually there is backflow of any kind that hits the auditor but if he is so convinced that he is mest he will turn on somatics in echo of the pc actually nothing hits the auditor it has to be mocked up or envisioned by him you have set up in essence two pole system and that will bring about an asising of mass it isnt burning the mass it is asising the mass and thats why there is nothing hitting the auditor now that is the essence of the situation the magic involved in auditing is contained in the communication cycle of auditing you see now you are handling the smooth interchange between these two poles when you look over the difficulties of auditing realize that you are handling simply the difficulties of the communication cycle and when you yourself as the auditor do not permit smooth flow between you as terminal and the pc as terminal and the pc as terminal back to you you get asising of mass so you dont get ta action part of the trick of course is what has to be asised and how do you go about it but that we call techniquewhat button has to be pressed we find oddly enough if the auditor is 89actually capable of making the pc willing to talk to him he wouldnt have to hit button to get tone arm action he cannot make the pc get tone arm action basically because communication cycle doesnt exist the person who is insisting continuously upon new technique is neglecting the basic tool of his auditing which is the communication cycle of auditing when the communication cycle does not exist in an auditing session we get this horrible compounding of felony of trying to get technique to work but the technique cannot be administered because there is communication cycle to administer it basic auditing is called basic auditing because it goes prior to the technique communication cycle must exist before the technique can exist the fundamental entrance to the case is not on level of the technique but is on level of the communication cycle communication is simply familiarization process based on reach and withdraw when you speak to pc you are reaching when you cease to speak you are withdrawing when he hears you hes at that moment bit withdrawn but then he reaches toward you with the answer youll see him go into withdraw while he thinks it all over then he reaches the reason now he will reach the auditor with the reason and he will say that was it you have made an exchange from the pc to the auditor and will see it reflect on the meter because that exchange now is giving an asising of energy in the absence of that communication you do not get meter action so the fundamental of auditing is the communication cycle thats the fundamental of auditing and that is really the great discovery of dianetics and scientology its such simple discovery but you realize that nobody knew anything about it l ron hubbard founder lrhntrd

revised 6 december 1974 students tech qual basic auditing series 2r the two parts of auditing from the lrh tape 2 july 1964 ow modernised and reviewed in order to do something for somebody you have to have communication line to that person communication lines depend upon reality and communication and affinity and where an individual is too demanding the affinity tends to break down slightly processing goes in two stages 1 to get into communication with that which you are trying to process 2 do something for him there is many pc who will go around raving about his auditor whose auditor has not done anything for the pc all that has happened is that tremendous communication line has been established with the pc and this is so novel and so strange to the pc that he then considers that something miraculous has occurred something miraculous has occurred but in this particular instance the auditor has totally neglected why he formed that communication line in the first place he formed it in the first place to do something for the pc he very often mistakes the fact that he has formed communication line and the reaction on the pc for his having formed one with having done something for the pc there are two stages 1 form communication line 2 do something for the pc those are the two distinct stages it is something like 1 walking up to the bus and 2 driving off if you dont drive off you never go anyplace it is very tricky and small thing to be able to communicate to human being who has never been communicated to before this is quite remarkable and is such remarkable feat that it appears to be an endall of scientology to some but you see thats just walking up to the bus now you have got to go someplace 91any upset that the individual has is so poised it is so delicately balanced that it is difficult to maintain t is not difficult to get well it is very hard to remain batty fellow has to work at it if your communication line is very good and very smooth and if your auditing discipline is perfect so you dont upset this communication line and if you just made foray of more importance than saying something likewhat are you doing thats sensible and why is it sensibleand kept your communication line up all the while and kept your affinity up with the pc all the while did it with perfect discipline you would see more aberration fall to pieces per square inch than you ever thought could exist now thats what i mean when i say do something for the pc you must audit well get perfect discipline and get your communication cycle in dont arc break the pc let your cycles of action complete all of that is simply an entrance you see the discipline of scientology makes it possible to do this and one of the reasons why other fields of the mind never got anyplace and could never get near anybody was because they couldnt communicate to anybody so that discipline is important that is the ladder that goes up to the door and if you cant get to the door you cant do anything the perfect discipline of which we speak the perfect communication cycle the perfect auditor presence perfect meter readingall of these things are just to get you in state where you can do something for somebody so when youre real slow picking up the discipline real slow picking up keeping in the communication cycle when youre pokey on the subject you are still 9 miles from the ball youre not even attending yet what you want to be able to do is audit perfectly by that we mean keep in communication cycle be able to approach the pc be able to talk to the pc and be able to maintain the arc get the pc to give you answers to your questions be able to read meter and get the reactions all of those things have to be awfully good because its very difficult to get communication line in to somebody anyway they all have to be present and they all have to be perfect if they are all present and they are all perfect then we can start to process somebody then we can start to process somebody im giving you an entrance point here of if all your cycles were perfect if you were able to sit there and confront the pc and meter that pc and keep your auditing report and do all these multiple various things and keep pleasant smile on your face and not chop his communication well then there is something you do with these things it takes process now we used to have it all backwards we used to try and teach people what they could do for somebody but they could never get in communication with him to do it so therefore you had failures in processing the most elementary procedure would bewhat do you think is sensibleor anything of that sort the pc says well i think horses sleep in beds thats sensible the auditor says alright now why is that sensible the pc says well ah hey thats not sensible thats nuts you actually wouldnt have to do anything more than that hes cognited youve flattened it its so easy to do but you keep looking for some magic 92well your magic is in getting into communication with the person the rest is very easy to do all you have to do is remain in communication with the person while you are doing this and realize that these huge aberrations hes got are poised with the most fantastically delicate balance on little pinheads all you have to do is to phooph and these things crash now if youre not in communication with this person he doesnt cognite he takes it as an accusative action he tries to justify thinking that way he tries to make himself look good to you and tries to put on public front of some kind or another he tries to hold up his status anytime i see bunch of pcs around who want to jump happily to something else because sane people run on that and crazy people run on something else and they never have to be run on the crazy one i right away know their auditors are not in communication with them and that auditing discipline itself has broken down because the pc is trying to justify himself and trying to uphold his own status so he must be defending himself against the auditor the auditor couldnt possibly be in communication with him so we are right back to the fundamental of why didnt the auditor get into comm with the pc in the first place you get into communication with the pc in the first place by doing proper scientology discipline that is not any trick it goes off 1 2 3 4 you sit down and you start the session and you start handling the pc and his problems and that sort of thing and you do it by completing your communication cycles and not cutting his communication the very things you are taught in the trs and you find you are in communication with the person now youve got to do something for the person unless having gotten into communication you do something for the person you lose your communication line because the rfactor of why youre in communication with the pc breaks down he doesnt think youre so good and you go out of communication with him that having happened the person will be in sort of status defensive and wonder why he is being processed on the other hand if you have done something for the pc and he has had his cognition and you try and go on and get more ta action out of the fact that all horses sleep in beds you dont get there as youve already flattened the process you can overaudit and you can underaudit if you dont notice that one answer come your way that indicates you have done something for the pc and if you keep him working on that same thing your ta action will disappear your pc will get resentful and youll lose your communication line hes already had the cognition you see you are now restimulating the pc you have gotten your keyout destimulation factorit has occurred right before your eyes you have done something for the pc one more mention of the subject and youve had it there are lot of things you could do with the pc without doing anything for him you can turn on some very very handsome somatics on pc at one time or another without turning them off either youve got to do something for the pc not to him now you can be doing something and the pc is doing b and you go on doing while the pc is doing b then somewhere on down the line you wind up in hell of mess and you wonder what happened 93well the pc never did what you said so you didnt do anything for the pc there was in actual fact barrier to your willingness to do something for the pc but there must have been tremendous barrier to your understanding of what was going on that you could ask while the pc answered b in itself showed the auditor observation was very poor so therefore the auditor wasnt in communication with the pc so again the communication factor was out and once more we werent doing anything for the pc it requires of the auditor discipline to keep in his communication line he has got to stay in communication with his pc those cycles have got to be perfect he cant be distracting the pcs attention onto the ta eg im not getting any ta action now thats not staying in communication with the pchas nothing to do with it youre distracting the pc from his own zones and areas dont put the pcs attention out of session keep him going and keep that communication line in and the next requirement is to do something productive for the pc using the communication line l ron hubbard founder lrhntjh copyright 1971 1974 by l ron hubbard all rights

what are the 3 important communication lines and what is their order of importance 1 the first is the pcs line to his bank the itsa maker line 2 the second is the pcs line to the auditor the itsa line 3 the third is the auditors line to the pc the whatsit line now the definition willing to talk to the auditor is very easy to interpret as talking to the auditor so the auditor cuts the line the pc has to the bank in order to get the pc to talk because its the itsa line that blows the charge he says so the auditor cuts the pcs communication line with his bank in order to bring about an itsa lineand then he wonders why he gets ta action and why the pc arc breaks this cut communication line is not perceivable to the naked eye its hidden because its from the pca thetan unseen by the auditorto the pcs bankunseen by the auditor the auditor is simply there to use the whatsit line in order to get the pc to confront his bank the charge blows off it to the degree that its confronted and this is represented by the itsa line the itsa line is report on what has been asised that gives it its flow the sequence of use of these lines in an auditing cycle is 3 1 and then 2 where the auditor neglects this hidden line from the pc to the pcs bank where he doesnt understand that hidden line and cant integrate it or do anything with it he is going to fail lrhnttsrd l ron hubbard

supervisors revised 4 december 1974 students tech qual basic auditing series 4r communication cycles within the auditing cycle taken from the lrh tape comm cycles in auditing 25 july 1963 the difficulty that an auditor gets into is normally found in his own auditing cycle there are basically two communication cycles between the auditor and the pc that make up the auditing cycle they are cause distance effect with the auditor at cause and the pc at effect and cause distance effect with the pc at cause and the auditor at effect cause distance effect auditor pc effect distance cause these are completely distinct one from the other the only thing that connects them and makes an auditing cycle is the fact that the auditor on his communication cycle has calculatingly restimulated something in the pc which is then discharged by the pcs communication cycle what the auditor has said has caused restimulation and then the pc needs to answer the question to get rid of the restimulation if the pc does not answer the question he doesnt get rid of the restimulation that is the game that is being played in an auditing cycle and that is the entirety of the game some auditing breaks down because the auditor is unwilling to restimulate the pc there is little extra communication cycle on here the auditor says thank you and you have this as the acknowledgement cycle c command auditor answer c pc acknowledgement now there are some little inner cycles that can throw you off and make you think that there are some other things to the auditing cycle there is another little shadow cycle it is the 96observation of has the pc received the auditing command this is such tiny cause that nearly all auditors who are having any trouble finding out whats going on with the pc are missing this one does he receive it actually there is another cause in here and youre missing that one when youre not perceiving the pc you can tell by looking at the pc that he didnt hear or understand what youd said or that he was doing something peculiar with the command he was receiving whatever that message is in response it rides on this line did pc receive understand and c answer command c command auditor answer c pc acknowledgement an auditor who isnt watching pc at all never notices pc who isnt receiving or understanding the auditing command then all of sudden somewhere along the line there is an arc break and then we do assessments and we patch up the session and all kinds of things go wrong well they actually neednt ever have gone wrong in the first place if this line had been in what is the pc doing completely aside from answering well what he is doing is this other little subcause distance effect line another of these tiny lines is the cause distance effect line ofis the pc ready to receive an auditing command this is the pc causing and it rides up the line across distance is received at the auditor and the auditor perceives that the pc is doing something else it is an important one and you find that auditors goof that one very often the pcs attention is still on prior action now heres another onehas the pc received the acknowledgement sometimes you violate this one you have been acknowledging but youve never seen that he didnt receive the acknowledgement that perception has another little tiny one in it that actually comes on this line it ishas the pc answered everything the auditor is watching the pc and the auditor sees that the pc has not said all that the pc is going to say you sometimes get into trouble with pcs that way everything at cause hasnt moved on down the line to effect and you havent perceived all of the effect and you go into the acknowledgement one before this line has completed itself thats chopping the pcs communication you didnt let the communication cycle flow to its complete end the acknowledgement takes place and of course it cant go through as its an inflowing line and it jams right there on the pcs incomplete outflowing answer line is pc ready for the command c did pc receive understand and c answer command 97c command auditor answer c pc acknowledgement so if you want to break it all down there are six communication cycles which make up one auditing cycle six not more than six unless you start running into trouble if you violate one of these six communication lines you of course are going to get into trouble which causes mishmash of one kind or another there is another communication cycle inside the auditing cycle and that is at the point of the pc its little additional one and its between the pc and himself this is him talking to him youre listening to the inside of his skull when youre examining it t actually can be multiple as it depends upon the complications of the mind this happens to be the least important of all the actions except when it isnt being done and of course its the hardest to detect when it isnt being done pc says yes now what has the pc said yes to and sometimes you are insufficiently curious and that in essence is this internal perception of line it includes this cause distance effect backflash hereis the pc answering the command i gave him so with this there are seven communication cycles involved in an auditing cycle it is multiple cycle communication cycle consists of just cause distance effect with intention attention duplication and understanding how many of these are there in one auditing cycle youd have to answer that with how many principal ones there are because some auditing cycles contain few more if pc indicates that he didnt get the command cause distance effect the auditor would give repeat of it cause distance effect and that would add 2 more communication cycles to the auditing cycle so youve got 9 because there was flub so anything unusual that happens in session adds to the number of communication cycles in the auditing cycle but they are still all part of the auditing cycle repetitive commands as an auditing cycle is doing the same cycle over and over again now there is completely different cycle inside the same pattern the pc is going to originate and its got nothing to do with the auditing cycle the only thing they have in common is that they both use communication cycles but this is brand new the pc says something that is not germane to what the auditor is saying or doing and you actually have to be alert for this happening at any time and the way to prepare for it is just to realize that it can happen at any time and just go into the drill that handles it dont get it confused with the drill that you have as an auditing cycle consider it its own drill you shift gears into this drill when the pc does something unexpected and by the way this handles such thing as the pc originates by throwing down the cans thats still an origin it has nothing to do with the auditing cycle maybe the auditing cycle went to pieces and this origination cycle came in well the auditing cycle cant complete because this origin cycle is now here that doesnt mean that this origin has precedence or dominance but it can start and take place and have to be finished off before the auditing cycle can resume so this is an interruptive cycle and it is cause distance effect the pc causes something the auditor now has to originate as the auditor has to understand what the pc is talking aboutand then acknowledge and to the degree that it is hard to understand you have the cause distance effect of the auditor trying to clarify this thing and every time he asks question hes got new communication cycle 98you cant put machine action at that point because the thing has to be understood and this must be done in such way that the pc isnt merely repeating his same origination or the pc will go frantic hell go frantic because he cant get off that linehes stuck in time and it really upsets him so the auditor has to be able to understand what the devil the pc is talking about and theres really substitute for simply trying to understand it there is little line where the pc indicates he is going to say something this is line cause distance effect that comes before the origination takes place so you dont run into jam and you dont give the auditing command the effect at the auditors point is to shut up and let him there can be another little line cause distance effect where the auditor indicates he is listening then there is the origination the auditors acknowledgement of it and then there is the perception of the fact that the pc received the acknowledgement thats your origination cycle an auditor should draw all these communication cycles out on scrap of paper just take look at all these things mock up session and all of sudden it will become very straight how these things are and you wont have couple of them jammed up whats mainly wrong with your auditing cycle is that you have confused couple of communication cycles to such degree that you dont differentiate that they exist thats why you sometimes chop pc who is trying to answer the question you know whether the pc has answered the question or not how did you know even if its telepathy its cause distance effect it doesnt matter how that communication took place you know whether hes answered the command by communication cycle i dont care how you sense this if you are nervy on the subject of handling the basic tool of auditing and if thats giving you trouble and if you get into trouble by suddenly breaking it down and analyzing it then it should be broken down and analyzed at time when youre auditing something nice and simple ive given you general pattern for an auditing cycle maybe in working it over you can find couple of extra communication cycles in the thing but they are all there and if you made someone go through each one painstakingly you would find out where his auditing cycle is jammed up it isnt necessarily jammed up on his ability to say thank you it may very well be jammed up in another quarter l ron hubbard founder lrhnt jh copyright 1971 1974 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 99hubbard communications office saint hill manor east

get all this fixed up is in training if you know your communication cycle is good you havent any longer got to be upset about whether youre doing it right or not you know yours is good so you dont worry about it any more in actual auditing the communication cycle that you watch is the pcs your business is the communication cycle and responses of the pc this is what makes the auditor who can crack any case and when absent you have an auditor who couldnt crack an egg if he stepped on it this is the difference its whether or not this auditor can observe the communication cycle of the pc and repair its various lapses its so simple it simply consists of asking question that the pc can answer and then observing that the pc answers it and when the pc has answered it observing that the pc has completed the answer to it and is through answering it then give him the acknowledgement then give him something else to do you can ask the same question or you can ask another question asking the pc question he can answer involves clearing the auditing command you also ask it of the pc so that the pc can hear it and knows what hes being asked when the pc answers the question be bright enough to know that the pc is answering that question and not some other question you have to develop sensitivitywhen did the pc finish answering what youve asked you can tell when the pc has finished its piece of knowingness he looks like hes finished 100and he feels like hes finished its part sense its part his vocal intonation but its an instinct that you develop you know hes finished then knowing hes finished answering you tell him hes finished with an acknowledgement ok good etc its like pointing out the bypassed charge to the pc like you have now found and located the bypassed charge in answer to the question and you have said it thats the magic of acknowledgement if you dont have that sensitivity for when the pc is finished answeringhe answers gets nothing from you you sit there and look at him his social machinery goes into action he gets onto self auditing and you get ta action the degree of stop you put on your acknowledgement is also your good sense because you can acknowledge pc so hard that you finish the session right there its all very well to do this sort of thing in training and its forgivable but not in an auditing session get your own communication cycle sufficiently well repaired that you dont have to worry about it after training l ron hubbard founder lrhntrd jh copyright 1971 1974 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 101hubbard communications office saint hill

understand if pc says something and the auditor fails to understand what the pc said or meant the correct response is i did not hear you understand what was said get that last to do anything else is not only bad form it can amount to heavy arc break invalidation to say you did not speak loud enough_____ or any other use of you is an invalidation the pc is also thrown out of session by having responsibility hung on him or her the auditor is responsible for the session therefore the auditor has to assume responsibility for all comm breakdowns in it evaluation far more serious than invalidation above is the accidental evaluation which may occur when the auditor repeats what the pc said never repeat anything pc says after him matter why repeating not only does not show the pc you heard but makes him feel youre circuit the highest advance of 19th century psychology was machine to drive people crazy all it did was repeat after the person everything the person said children also do this to annoy but that isnt the main reason you do not repeat what the pc said after the pc if you say it wrong the pc is thrown into heavy protest the pc must correct the wrongness and hangs up right there it may take an hour to dig the pc out of it further dont gesture to find out to say pointing you mean this item then is not only an evaluation but nearly hypnotic command and the pc feels he must reject very strongly dont tell the pc what the pc said and dont gesture to find what the pc meant 102just get the pc to say it again or get the pc to point it out again thats the correct action driving in anchor points also do not shove things at pc or throw things to pc dont gesture toward pc it drives in anchor points and makes the pc reject the auditor rock slammer the reason person who rock slams on scientology or auditors or the like cant audit well is that they are wary of pc and feel they must repeat after the pc correct the pc or gesture toward the pc but rock slammer or not any new auditor may fall into these bad habits and they should be broken fast summary very high percentage of arc breaks occur because of failure to understand the pc dont prove you didnt with gestures or erroneous repeats just audit please l ron hubbard founder lrhntrd copyright 1962 1971 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 103hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead

imagine my making one on the comm formula after all these years do people ever explain to you long after you have understood do people get cross with you when they are trying to tell you something if so you are suffering from premature acknowledgement like body odor and bad breath it is not conducive to social happiness but you dont use lifebuoy soap or listerine to cure it you use proper comm formula when you coax person to talk after he has begun with nod or low yes you ack make him forget then make him believe you havent got it and then make him tell you at great length he feels bad and doesnt cognite and may arc break try it out have somebody tell you about something and then encourage before he has completely told you all thats why pcs itsa on and on and on and on with gain the auditor prematurely acknowledged thats why pcs get cross for reason the auditor has prematurely and unwittingly acknowledged thats why one feels dull when talking to certain people they prematurely acknowledge thats why one thinks another is stupidthat person prematurely acknowledges the quickest way to become social pariah dog is to prematurely acknowledge one can do it in many ways the quickest way to start the longest conversation is to prematurely acknowledge for the person believes he has not been understood and so begins to explain at greater and greater length so this was the hidden arc break maker the cognition wrecker the stupidifier the itsa prolonger in sessions and why some people believe others are stupid or dont understand any habit of agreeable noises and nods can be mistaken for acknowledgement ends cycle on the speaker causes him to forget feel dull believe the listener is stupid get cross get exhausted explaining and arc break the missed withhold is inadvertent one didnt get chance to say what one was going to say because one was stopped by premature acknowledgement result missed wh in the speaker with all its consequences 104this can be counted on to make you feel frightened of being agreeable with noises or gestures for bit and then youll get it straight what piece of tech to remain incompletely explained fair scares one it does and in the

ever hope to see is an auditor letting pc itsa i have seen auditors let pc talk and talk and talk and talk and run down and talk and run down and talk again until one wondered where if anywhere that auditor had been trained in the first place such an auditor could not know the meaning of the word itsa the word means it is now how an auditor letting pc talk believes he is getting pc to spot what it is is quite beyond this pc has been talking all his life he isnt well analysts had people talk for five years and they seldom got well so how is it supposed to happen today that pc let talk enough will get well it wont the auditor does not know the very basics of auditing skills thats all these are the trs an auditor who cant do his trs cant audit period instead he says he is letting the pc itsa if by this he means he is letting the pc drive all over the road and in both ditches then this isnt auditing in auditing an auditor guides he gives the pc something to answer when the pc answers the pc has said it is and thats itsa if the pc answers and the auditor acknowledges too soon the pc tends to go into an anxietyhe has been chopped so he talks more than he wanted if the pc answers and the auditor does not acknowledge then the pc talks on and on hoping for an acknowledgement that doesnt come runs dry tries again etc 106so premature or lateornever acks result in the same thingthe pc running on and on and on and they call it letting the pc itsa bah if pc talks too much in session he either is getting cut off too fast by the auditor or hasnt got an auditor at all it isnt itsa its lousy trs the one single exception is the pc who had years in analysis but even he begins to get better with proper trs used on him the proper cure is to drill the auditor until the auditor realizes 1 the auditor asks the questions 2 the pc says what is the answer its 3 the auditor acks when the pc has said it to the pcs satisfaction and 4 the auditor acks when the pc has finished saying its and thats itsa scientology auditing is precision skill not gag blop goo slup guck blah 1 the auditor wants to know 2 the pc says it is 1 2 1 2 1 2 etc tech savvy now an auditor who doesnt know his technology about the mind and his processes of course never knows what to ask so he or she simply sits like lump of sacking hoping the pc will say something that makes the pc feel better sure sign that an auditor doesnt know an engram from cow about processes is seeing pc itsa on and on and on in scientology we do know what the mind is what being is what goes wrong in the mind and how to correct it we arent psychoanalysts or psychiatrists or harley street witch doctors we do know the data about beings and life is there in scientology to be learned it isnt our idea of how things are or our opinion of scientology is precision subject it has axioms like geometry two equilateral triangles arent similar because euclid said so theyre similar because they are if you dont believe it look at them there isnt single datum in scientology that cant be proven as precisely as teacups are teacups and not saucepans now if we get person fresh out of the study of the mystical metaphysics of cuffbah hes going to have trouble his pcs are going to itsa their heads off and never get well or better or anything because that person doesnt know scientology but thinks its all imprecise opinion 107the news about scientology is that it put the study of the mind into the precise exact sciences if one doesnt know that ones pcs itsa by the hour for one doesnt know what he is handling that he is calling pc by my definition an auditor is real auditor when his or her pcs dont overtalk or undertalk but answer the auditing question and happily now and then originate so how to tell an auditor how to determine if you have trained one at last is do his pcs answer up or do they talk on and on if i had an auditor in an hgc whose pcs yapped and yapped and ran dry and yapped while the auditor just sat there like chinese pilot frozen on the controls i would do the following to that auditor 1 remedy book of case remedies 2 remedy b book of case remedies 3 disagreements with scientology technology and orgs and scientology personalities all found and traced to basic and blown 4 grind study assignment of the scientology axioms until the auditor could do them in clay 5 memorization of the logics

qual basic auditing series 10r recognition of rightness of the being taken from the lrh tape good indicators 7 january 1964 an auditors tendency is to look for wrongnesses he is always trying to find something wrong with the pc thats the nature of scientology we assume that there is something wrong with somebody otherwise he wouldnt be here and be dead in his head and he would be capable of doing great deal more than he is doing at the particular moment an individual is basically and routinely good capable of many actions and considerable power in the state of free thetan or native state he is far more powerful individual than when hes been complicated up its the idea of the additive data to the thetan try to give somebody something he doesnt want and you are going to overthrow his power of choice his power of choice is the only thing that he had to begin with which gave him power capability and anything else and that power of choice has been consistently and continuously overthrown by giving him things he didnt want and taking away from him things he didnt want to get rid of back and forth you get the individual pretty overwhelmed and he goes down in power what happened to him actually is he solved something that didnt need solving there was something he couldnt confront so he solved it and he fixed the solution anytime you fix these solutions for ever and ever you put the individual down grade an individual becomes aberrated by additives his experiences in this universe are usually calculated to degrade and depower him now all you have to do is pick up all of these criss crosses and you return him to power man is an addedto being and everything that has been added to him has decreased his ability to cope when you add something to the being he gets worse we are in the business of deleting wrongnesses from the individual even the freudian analyst realized that some additive had been added that should be deleted so the idea of deleting something to bring about recovery is not new with us because we are in the business of deleting wrongnesses from the individual we seldom look at rightnesses and thats whats wrong with most auditors they are so anxious to find the wrongnessand quite properlyand they never really look at the rightness if they dont look at the rightnesses that are present then they arent appreciating the degrees of truth that are present that can be promoted into more truth 111in other words they are starting at level of truth present all the time so of course they never make any forward progress you must realize that there must be truth present and that this truth must be recognized and that this is handinglove part of auditing the recognition of the fact that truth is present if you only look for wrongnesses and only recognize wrongnesses then you will never be able to pull anything up gradient because you wont think you have any rightnesses to work with it just all looks wrong to you you have to be able to look at the wrongnesses in order to right them but we also have to be able to look at the rightnesses in order to increase them we are only trying to find wrongnesses in order to increase rightnesses and thats very important if you have rightnesses present in session you will never be able to make any progress of any kind progress is built on gradient scale of rightnesses by which you delete wrongnesses and they drop and fall away therefore processing is an action by which wrongnesses can be deleted from the case to the degree that rightnesses are present in the session you cannot take case that doesnt have any rightness present and delete wrongness so you have to realize that there are rightnesses present and then you increase those rightnesses that makes it possible for you to pick up the wrongnesses and thats what auditing consists of auditing is contest of maintaining rightnesses so that we can delete wrongnesses if you keep on deleting wrongnesses all the while maintaining and increasing the rightnesses you eventually wind up with very right being you are trying to get right being therefore if you dont continually encourage right beingness you never wind up with right being you must learn to observe an auditing session you want your pc to wind up in right statein more native more capable less overwhelmed higher power of choice sort of state you want him to wind up with more rightnesses therefore if you audit so that you do not encourage and increase rightnesses then you wont wind up with right pc the degree of rightness you have present must exceed the wrongness you are going to pick up its proportional action if youve got as much wrongness in session as youve got rightness youre not riding on any cushion it makes very difficult job of auditing if you want to pick up this little wrongness you have to have rightnesses present which are big enough to engulf it that makes easy auditing if the rightnesses in the session are very minor and the problem is tiny one there isnt enough rightness in the session to handle the problem and the pc cannot erase it the pcs ability to asis or erase in session is directly proportional to the number of good indicators present in the session and his inability to cope in session rises proportionally to the number of bad indicators present in session any process has its own series of bad indicators and the bad indicator moves in when the good indicator moves out so you have to have primary knowledge of good indicators dont look for bad indicators on and on and on youll drive the pc around the bend and suppress the good indicators what you want to do is know your good indicators for the level you are running so well that when one of them disappears out of the session your ears go up 112and you instantly look for the bad indicator dont look for the bad indicator until you see the vanishment of the good indicator otherwise youre continually prowling around looking for wrongnesses in session and you keep pc very upset and you get auditing done of any kind whatsoever remember this next time you see pc start to bog and drag and flounder one way or the other youve got to get the pcs good indicators back in before you can get the pc to handle what you want him to handle what influences the attitude of the pc is an arc break that of course is influenced earlier by the auditors behavior or the pc has an overt on the auditor or the pc has missed withhold an auditor who never gets in and finds out what is wrong in the sessionthe reasonable auditormesses up pcs like mad if all the good

responsibility that pc or pre ot is sent to declare this is not an admin point im making it is technical point every so often pc is found hung up in not having declared and attested the state attained declare completes his cycle of action and is vital part of the action one never forces or feeds one to the pc i recall one org where the entire tech and income structure crashed the co and several personnel had to be removed because they were forcing clear cogs on their dianetic pcs who hadnt had them and then telling them they couldnt be audited further on scientology connie broadbent asho march 70 so this goes 2 ways the pc or pre ot who knows he made it must be sent to exams and c to attest the pc or pre ot who hasnt made it must never be sent to exams to declare and attest this gives us third pcs and pre ots who havent made it must be handled until they have made that specific declare even though it means signing up for more auditing truth is the keynote the essence the point here all the pr slang for promotional talk in the world will not supplant truth the pc knows he made something therefore he must be sent to declare it whether its standard grade or not the pc who hasnt made it knows he hasnt and so when forced to declare or ordered to attest tends to cave in his concept of the validity of the org and honesty of scientology depends on this and really on this alone

stem from not permitting what i know of tech and cases to be clouded by human emotion and reaction scn public relations term by others part of css duty is to get the case through it despite auditor opinions and flubs or the opinions of others cs has political or personnel opinions he can of course have his own opinions of the pcs case but he is the friend of the pc even when being harsh often

name and ron sometimes its only the auditor but mos pcs know the cs is there this awareness is also great trust and it is trust that is earned by great results and is never betrayed to the majority of

being or an upstat one who has high statistics and sterling person when we are researching csing or auditing we do our best for him we have nothing to do with whether his seniors like him or for that matter whether we like him it is our job we hold it in trust in our hands is his future his sanity his immortality it depends on us whether he survives and lives full life or whether he goes into limbo 118if we do our duty when we know and do our jobs he achieves everything when we dont he is gone priest or fancied idol has ever been endowed with more cause over the beingness of another than cs and his auditor this isnt my opinion or my feeling about it its the way pcs look at it actually one cant really state the full actuality of it the pc is justified in trusting us when we keep up to date on our tech know our job take every care that good job is done and do our duty auditor opinion some auditors develop overts and withholds on pc and color their auditing reports with critical remarks about pc more withholds cs who pays much attention to these opinions is foolish when they get too bad on too many pcs get the auditors overts and withholds pulled as hell begin to flub the worksheet and what the pc said or did is important the opinions arent an auditor has right to refuse to audit certain pcs as long as he audits others thats as it should be but lot of dog cases are just unsolved cases that can be solved some are very difficult true but the difficulty is finding the bug some pcs are rather wild in conduct but they solve too so an auditors opinion is not study of the case talking to an auditor about case he is auditing is not of any technical value to cs again case does not know what is wrong with it or it would asis and wouldnt be wrong so talking to case about his case is waste of time for cs some write huge notes to cs the only value in all this is to analyze whether its hidden standard or an arc brk or wh or pts matter technical considerations are all that enter in looking over such executive opinion is the worlds worst source of data on pc cs should ever take what seniors say about junior its all human emotion and reaction its not tech family husbands wives fathers mothers brothers and sisters aunts and uncles are of little value to listen to about case the most they could give you would be list of accidents or illness or time in home but

is fortunately different degree of upset in these three things int rd trouble is worse than list trouble is worse than out ruds therefore the correct cs would be to 1 repair int 2 repair lists 3 put in ruds 1 repair int rd is done by using l3b on each flow and on flag by dating to blow and locating to blow 2 lists are repaired with l4b on each list preferably with the list available and

from ability 73 assists in scientology by l ron hubbard edited and reissued for use on the hqs coaudit assists in scientology definition an assist an action undertaken by minister to assist the spirit to confront physical difficulties an assist is not normally done in formal session the way the term has been used is very simple activity to relieve an immediate troublesome difficulty an assist is much more specifically and definitely anything which is done to alleviate presenttime discomfort an assist could happen almost anywhere at the beginning of session matter how formally this session is constituted you are running an assist you have an auditing room you have preclear and you are the auditor you know all these things but the preclear doesnt dont call it formal session tell the preclear that it is an assist and that you are not intending anything very strenuous in rendering an assist you should tell the preclear that this is just an assist to try and ease the pain in his hand little after which you are going to stop the handling of an assist as an auditor is different than the handling of formal session since the factor of control is notably slackened sometimes almost completely missing one of the factors in assists is that an assist has as large part of its anatomy trying to help just remember that you are only trying to help and dont get your heart broken by the fact that the fellows broken spine doesnt heal instantly another factor is that an assist is differentiated and defined as addressing the game someone knows he is playing what techniques would comprise an assist anything that would help and what are these one of the easiest ones to render is locational processing you tell the person look at that chair look at that ceiling look at that floor look at that hand the auditor pointing to the objects when he has an injured hand and the pain will diminish this is very easy assist for example person has bad shoulder you touch his hand of the same arm and say close your eyes and look at my fingers make sure that he keeps his eyes closed you then touch him on the elbow and say look at my fingers do this anywhere on his body just touch him and say look at my fingers this is communication process which eases his attention over from concentration upon the injury to something else which is quite near the injury and thus doesnt result in too much of shock it reduces havingness but it is positive and gets positive results it can be done by an untrained person you can teach this assist to anybody you say if somebody has bruise injury burn cut the way to handle this is to tell the person to close his eyes and then you touch the area 123near and distant from the vicinity of the injured area asking them with their eyes closed to look at your fingers you contact them this way many times they will experience sudden pains in the area and you will discover that the psychic trauma has been discharged you will find that most people do not have any upset about physical contact most people think that this is the thing to do say you wanted to render an assist on somebody who had very indefinite difficulty that is the hardest one to render an assist on the person has pain but he cannot say where he doesnt know what has happened to him he just feels bad use locational processing as such you will find out that this process will work when other processes fail an assist carries with it certain responsibility if you give an assist casually to somebody out in the public and do not shove calling card in his pocket you are making an error the reason for this is that he will not know from whom and where help came an auditor goes through life and he casts his shadow upon many people and they have really cognizance of what has happened at all if he is rendering an assist he says do this do thatmaybe he wins or maybe he loses because this is the type of session least calculated to procure orderly results but in the main these people have been helped they dont know really by what except some word that the auditor kept saying they dont even know that he is an auditor they dont know anything about it at all show person where he can obtain further assistance and by whom the assistance was given be yourself be positive be professional and definite have calling card and make sure the card is easily enough understood dont ask them for permission just do it reason to wander around and give them funny notions if you are going to help some stranger out help him out dont explain to him or any bystander otherwise you are likely to stand there explaining waiting for somebodys permission dont bother with that you act as though you are the one in charge and you will be in charge and this is part and parcel of the knowledge of how to do an assist you have got to be the person in charge this has to be so good as far as you are concerned that you overcome the informality of the session to very marked degree if you do it extremely well the assist will amount to auditing say for example there is big accident and crowd of people are pressing around the police are trying to push the people back well push the people back and then push the policeman back say officer keep these people at distance then you lean over the victim and snap him back to rights if you are enough there everybody else will realize that you are the one that is there therefore such things as panic worry wonder upset looking dreamily into the far distance wondering what is wrong or what should be done are part of your makeup if you are rendering an assist cool calm and collected should be the keynote of your attitude realize that to take control of any given situation it is only necessary to be there more than anybody else there is necromancy magic conjuration of the spirits of the dead in order to predict the future involved just be there the others arent and if you are there enough then somebody else will pull himself out of it and go on living understand that an auditor when rendering an assist must make up with presence what he lacks in surroundings and agreements it all comes under the heading of willingness to be there and willingness to control people one of the ways of convincing people of beingness and of being there is to exercise controlpositive undeniable tone 40 exercise of control start to control the situation with high enough arc enough presence and factualitythere wont be anybody present that wont step back and let you control the situation you are entitled to it in the first place because of senior knowhow the control of body attention or thought comprises the majority of your knowledge the majority in scientology simply points in this direction the observable thing is control of attention objects and thoughts when you have good confidence of being able to handle these and when you positively know how to do these then you can make sure that 124everybody else knows you can do this and you make them realize this by doing it you have all of these things available in rendering an assist you might never think of riot as being situation which necessitated an assist or an assist as applicable to riot but riot is simply psychosomatic momentary injury or traumatic condition on the third dynamic could you settle riot well if you can settle riot you can certainly settle one person who is in riot the antithesis of any pain disturbance or tumult is order the thing which controls tumult is order and conversely the thing which controls order is tumult you need only bring order into confused situation and bring confusion into an orderly situation to control everything in the field of motion action and objects this is fantastic simplicity and one which takes some grasping conceive as order merely fixed position idea and attitude policeman knows what he is supposed to do maybe he will put on tourniquet or maybe he wont keep the people away and stop everything is his idea of how it should be now you can aid or abet the order he is creating or cancel the order by creating confusion which he cannot handle of the two the first is the best in that situation you aid and abet and cap the order he is creating if you were to accuse him of having confused accident scene which is by now not at all confused and ask him to straighten it out you would channel his attention in the direction it is already gone and so you control his attention remember those people are still moving little bit they are still breathing there is still tiny bit of motion going on if you were to ask him something on the order of cant we have it little quieter and more orderly here he would at once perceive that there was far too much confusion and motion and he would simply come under your direction because you have simply channeled his attention in the direction it was already going therefore you have taken control if you ever want to overset fixed order create confusion if you want to overset confusion create fixed order pick out of the scene those beings in the scene whose attention is channeled in the direction you want attention to go and you aid and abet that attention which already exists or where you have too many fixed positions and fixed ideas to overcome you simply take those turbulent individuals in the scene who are creating the confusion against those fixed ideas and channels and you make their confusion much more confused at the same time yourself imposing another order in another direction the mechanics of taking over any confused scene are simply the mechanics of trying to get preclear to see through the morass of cross purposes commands ideas and environments in which he has lived and whether that applies to the third dynamic or otherwise the laws are still there and it tells you then that the imposition of order on preclear comes foremost in an assist in an assist you always count on the fact that the thetan himself would if he could do the right thing if you work on that postulate you will never be wrong get the idea that it is something else trying to do the wrong thing the keynote of thetan is order where you are giving an assist to one person you put things in the environment into an orderly state as the first step unless you are trying to stop pumping arterybut here you would use first aid you should understand that first aid always precedes an assist you should look the situation over from the standpoint of how much first aid is required maybe you will find somebody with temperature of 106 degrees it may very well be that he needs to lie down and be covered up and though antibiotics are much overrated he might be better off with shot of one of these than with an assist at that time auditing will not shut off pumping artery but tourniquet will if you are going into the zone of accidents you are going to be in the vicinity of great deal of destruction and chaos and you are very foolish not to have your red cross first aid certificate you may often have to find some method of controlling handling and directing personnel who get in 125your way before you can render an assist you might just as well realize that an assist requires that you control the entire environment and personnel associated with the assist if necessary an assist is auditing on several dynamics it is therefore much harder to do than auditing in formal room as it requires presence you must bring yourself to face the fact that you have to give enough presence and enough control to enough dynamics to bring the environment into compliance with your postulate if you postulate that somebody is going to pick up his bed and walk then you have to be willing to move and be capable of moving around the people who are going to watch him pick up his bed and walk good example of an assist would be when somebody is washing dishes in the kitchen there is horrendous crash and the person comes down all over the sink hits the floor and as she is going down she grabs the butcher knife as it falls you go in and say well let fix that up one of the first things you would have to do is to wind some bandage around the hand to stop the bleeding part of the first aid would be to pick up the dishes and put them back on the sink sweep the pieces together into more orderly semblance this is the first symptom of control she becomes introverted into the cut to the point that she wouldnt particularly notice what you were doing but you relieve the anxiety that all her blood is pouring out your first attention to the case is attention to the environment next you would make her sit down to remove her from the scene of the accident is not as desirable as auditing her there that is directly contrary perhaps to what you believe but it is true that is why you bring little order into the environment you position her and then you are ready for techniques it is quite remarkable for you have manifested order in much wider sphere than cut hand in order to bring about healing of the cut hand if you understand that your responsibility always extends much wider than the immediate zone of commotion you never miss if you bring order to the wider environment you also bring it to the narrower environment if you bring it into the narrow environment you also bring it to the wider environment it is gradient scale of how much order you can bring in processing you have to control or direct attention objects person or thoughts of the injured person if you are really good on the subject of assists you will direct an additional thing his knowingness you can control mans knowingness rather easily but it is hard to see it about the first thing that you can observe about somebody is his person you are trying to straighten it out dont think even though you have this person sitting down that you have straightened it out because it is still messed up but there is something that you can straighten out easilyand that is his attention if you could heighten his attention and his knowingness at the same time you would really be in wonderful circumstances you always shift and direct his attention hence locational processing because he is injured you are not going to move his person around you have got his attention dont try to shift his thoughts around at first because they are dispersed and chaotic this leaves you his attention only if someone is in terrible condition and he is really writhing around and you want to render an assist you dont wait until he stops writhing he is liable to stop writhing dead what you do with him is to direct his attention you tell him to shut your eyes and look at my fingers you press your fingers hard enough so that he cant help but put his attention on them in this wise you can always have successful assist because assists all come under the heading of control the beingness of the person and his presence makes the control possible so part of control is always presence identity person the one who takes charge and has things under control when you are able to control his attention his body and thoughts then he will be in session and you are longer doing an assist assists dominantly require that you direct the attention of the preclear and dispose his person one way or the other and eventually take over control of his thoughts on the subject but by the time you have all these three in line you are longer doing an assist 126so what you really do is do an assist up to the time the person can handle the incident or pain put him in more favorable environment and give him auditing so the assist is what you do on the street and auditing is what you do in the auditing room when he comes to you after your assist has been successful l ron hubbard

emeter books checksheets false ta some pcs have very difficult time in auditing due solely to can electrode outnesses some auditors have heavy losses because they do not realize the troubles that can come from electrodes and thus remedy them ta use the ta must be between 2 and 3 for correct fn when the ta is reading falsely pc can be butchered example auditor talking the ta down it gets to 31 by his meter so he gets the pc to talk bit more to get the ta between 2 and 3 and fn the ta suddenly rises to 38 pc and auditor go desperate what has happened is that the ta was false read it was really reading 29 and fning but for reasons given below it read 31 thus the auditor overran the fn and by keeping on invalidated the release pulled the pcs attention out of session and demanded more than the pc had to give example auditor 2 way communicating with pc to get the ta up from 18 the ta suddenly sinks to 16 pc goes into apathy what happened was missed fn for reasons covered below the ta at 18 was false and was really at 21 and fning example pc being asked for an earlier similar incident because ta is at 40 pc cant get one gets desperate ta goes to 50 for reasons given below the ta was at 30 but was reading falsely at 40 some cases get upset at the very idea of fn when these mistakes are made more than one case has missed all his wins for year because of false ta so it is very important to know how false ta comes about and how to avoid it properly set up meter with cans electrodes fitted to pc who is holding them properly is wa ys correct however totally false tone arm readings can exist and an auditor must know how these come about trim meter can be improperly trimmed not set at 20 with the trim knob and can give false ta position 128further when meter is not left on minute or two before trimming it can drift in the session and give slightly false ta the trim can be quietly checked in midsession by snapping out the jack where the cord goes into the box and putting the ta on 2 seeing if the needle is now on set if not the trim knob can be moved to adjust it the jack is quietly slipped back in all without distracting the pc discharged cadmium cell meter discharges very suddenly when it does go flat in midsession the meter can run out of battery the ta will cease to act well and may go very false the remedy is to keep meter charged at least one hour for every 10 of auditing for 240 ac volt charging current or 2 hours for every 10 of auditing on 110 ac volt charging current meter lasts much longer than this in practice but the above is very safe before each session snap the knob over to test the needle should hit hard on the right side of the face it can even bounce this guarantees lots of charge in the battery and chance of meter going flat in session if the needle doesnt snap to the right hard or if it doesnt quite get there on test then that meter will go flat in midsession and give false ta and reads or ta on hot subjects one hand electrode single hand electrode with two terminals separated by rubber works but it always gives falsely high ta solo auditor who does not know this can get release point and go half mad wondering why he is fning at 40 the answer is to make single hand electrode out of two small cans about 33 inches by 218 inches or 912 cm by 512 cm or even smaller for very smallhanded pc glue thin circle of foam rubber solidly to the bottom of one can so it reaches out slightly around the bottom dont glue it up the sides put the alligator jaw clips one to each can now put the can bottoms together and hold them in one hand mark the ta imeaning one hand such as 375 1 now take the cans one in each hand and mark the ta 2meaning two hands such as 30 audit with them in one hand keep your worksheet with 1 marks such as 35 1 check at start and middle and end by taking can in each hand and putting down the 2 can read such as 25 2 it is too much trouble to totally change cans and the distraction can change the ta read this two small can arrangement is not quite accurate it gives lower ta than big cans but the difference is slight it can scare you with 19 when trim is 20 and real ta is 20 if this happens check with big cans 129as an added tip solo auditor usually keeps the back of his hand on his leg while solo auditing the small 712 volt current gives tingle to the leg that is distracting when ones hand is moist put piece of foam rubber in plastic sack lay the sack on the leg put your hand on this pad it insulates the area and is very comfortable moist hands when pcs hands sweat lot you will get low ta contrary to 19th century superstition the meter does not work on sweat very sweaty hands as found on nervous persons give false ta it goes low many low ta cases are just sweaty hand cases paper handkerchiefs kleenex are standard item for an auditing roomfor grief charges and burning eyes etc these should be available if the ta is low check if the pcs hands are wet if so have him wipe them and get new read it is usually found that the 16 was really 20 or the 16 was really 18 and the trim was 18 20 have the pc wipe hands check and correct trim before you bypass all low tas fns tas can go low invalidation of the pc lousy trs can drive one low if so the ta comes back up on repair but dont brand case low ta case until you make sure his hands are dried and the meter trimmed also very small cans or cans too small for the pc can give slightly low reading dry hands some pcs have extremely dry hands usually from industrial chemicals such as chlorine in dishwater or skin scale this can give wildly high ta the pc can be worried to death with high ta repairs when in fact he just doesnt have contact with the electrode metal foot plates connected to the meter and the pc barefooted in session will usually handle quick test is have the pc put the cans under his armpits and youll see if its his calloused or chemically driedout hands arthritic hands rare pc is so crippled with arthritis that he doesnt make contact fully with the cans this gives high ta use foot plates or wide wrist straps and youll get right read 130slack grip sometimes rare pc lets his hands go slack on the cans particularly if they are the wrong size cans too big this gives mysterious high ta it is false the ta will come down only to 32 and fn and of course an overrun then really gives high ta and the pc goes bit frantic and begins to believe things dont erase or release keep the pcs hands in sight check the pcs grip get smaller cans can size the most common fault is wrong can size for normal or largehanded pc the can size is about 4 78 inches by 2 58 inches or 1212 cm by 7 cm this can be altered as big as 412 inches by 3 inches diameter or 11 cm by 8 cm this is standard this can is too large for people with small hands these should use can 334 inches by 2 18 inches or 9 cm by 5 cm diameter or thereabouts small child would be lost even with that can so small 35 mm film can could be used this is 2 inches long by 1 316 inches diameter or 5 cm by 3 cm this works but watch it as these cans are aluminum they do work but test for true read with slightly larger can and then trim to adjust for the aluminum if any different cans of course should be steel with thin tin plating regular soup cans can size to match the pc avoids slack can grip or tiring the hands into going slack giving the auditor 32 fns and trouble cold pc pc who is too cold sometimes has falsely high ta wrap him in blanket or get warmer auditing room the auditing environment is the responsibility of the auditor late at night between 2 and 3 am or late at night pcs ta may be very high the time depends on when he sleeps usually this ta will be found normal in regular hours rings rings on the pcs hands must always be removed they dont influence ta but they give false rockslam floating ta 131many an auditor before now has gone bit mad trying to handle floating ta they are not very common and are startling what happens is the pc is so released the needle cant be gotten onto the dial the needle is swinging wider than the meter dial both ways from center and appears to lay first on one side then the other the ta cant be moved fast enough to keep the extreme floating needle on the dial this gives false ta of sorts as it cant be read some auditors seeing it for the first time have even sent the pc out of the room so they could adjust the meter or get another one thus the very highest state of release can be invalidated as where is the ta rusty corroded cans youd think soup was very expensive the way some auditors hold onto old cans corroded cans can falsify ta get new ones now and then tight shoes and then there was the vain lady who wore shoes too small for her feet she removed them every session the session went well each time then she put on her agonizing shoes and went to the examiner and the cses and auditors all went mad trying to find out why every exam had high ta tight shoes the emeter is accurate it is lovely instrument you have to fit the pc to it good luck lrh ntrd l ron hubbard copyright 1971 founder by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 132hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 25 october 1971 remimeo drug drying out it occasionally happens that someone is still on drugs when he or she requires drug processing this sets up very rough problem drugs prevent any case gain if the person is still on drugs processing will have little effect he will not cease to be drug addict the drugs trap him when the world went druggie about 1960 this problem of drying out became one of the first order it was not just problem to us all prescientology efforts failedand had been failing for all mans history but relatively small numbers had been involved after 1960 the problem became planetwide our first organization to handle this was angeles they made the person cease to take drugs for 6 weeks then audited the drugs out most of these cases stayed stable and thereafter had case gain and were longer condemned to an eternity of disability however some were unable to stop taking drugs what is called withdrawal symptoms set in these are the body and mental reactions to longer taking drugs they are ghastly torturer ever set up anything worse the patient had this problem then stay on drugs and be trapped and suffering from here on out b try to come off the drugs and be so agonizingly ill meanwhile that he couldnt stand it this was dead if you do dead if you dont sort of problem medicine did not solve it adequately psychotherapy was impossible two approaches now exist to this withdrawal problem 1 light objective look outward take attention off body processes ease the gradual withdrawal and make it possible 2 nutritionist experiments indicate that vitamins assist the withdrawal objective processes are covered elsewhere in this material vitamin therapy according to worldrenowned nutritionist adelle davis vitamin therapy has had success in handling withdrawal symptoms 133instead of just telling the person to break off drugs with all that suffering and danger of failure the patient is given heavy doses of vitamins the data is repeated here for information drug bomb one dose 1000 mg of niacin amide not nicotinic acid as it is severely toxic in such amounts this for any mental disturbance 500 milligrams of magnesium carbonate to make the vitamin c effective 2000 milligrams of vitamin c 25 milligrams of b6 200 milligrams of b complex 100 milligrams of pantothenic acid administration the bomb is given four times day roughly every six hours it is given in mild preparation that furnishes intestinal flora such as yoghurt great caution must be used to give the dose in such way that the vitamins will not corrode the stomach if this is neglected the patient can be given false duodenal upper intestine ulcer and will be unable to continue the treatment druggies are usually in terrible physical condition anyway thus all the above would have to be in enteric coated capsules meaning an intestinal shielding must be on the pills so they gradually dissolve and dont hit the sensitive upper stomach hard enough to corrode it thus milk with powdered amino acids in it would have to be given to wash the pills down in testing these recommendations stomach corrosion from the bomb was the main barrier noted if the bomb is given without any cushion the patient can feel too full after eating b have stomach ache c have burning sensation d the exterior of the stomach can get sore these are all stomach ulcer symptoms if such symptoms turn on end off the vitamins aluminum hydroxide tablets chewed up and swallowed in milk each time the symptoms start will ease the stomach amino acids intestinal flora and milk must then be given until the stomach gets better shots with needle especially of vitamin c can be too painful not the needle thats nothing but the vitamin itself such medication is in crude state of research mainly because of the violent hostility earlier exerted against vitamin people by the american medical association and other reactionaries to anything beneficial or new it is hoped that the stomach corrosion factor can be lessened by new preparations which do the same thing but less violently 134i am not particularly advocating the use of the drug bomb but as pioneer in this area of research i feel that any data of value on the subject of drug withdrawal should be widely published the difficulties and agonies of withdrawal are the primary failure point in trying to salvage being from the insanity of drugs summary people who have been on drugs do not make case gain until the drugs are handled in processing processing such as dianetics is not effective when done on person who is taking drugs withdrawal from drugs sometimes sets up violent physical reaction too painful or depressing to be continued and the person goes back on drugs anyone on drugs or who has taken drugs is doomed as being just like that he or she will cave right on in and finish up in the ash can from here on out only processing by dianetics and scientology can handle the effects of drugs fully other technology medical or biochemical has ever helpedwe have thousands of cases to prove this completely the primary barrier to processing is getting the person off drugs and keeping him off until he can be fully audited then he will be very okay two means to do this are knowna light objective processes while drying out and b nutritional therapy and b can be combined neither nor b will fully handle drugs the person on vitamins if not processed will relapse vitamins are not drugs they are nutrition person can be processed while on them by close application of these principles the person can be salvaged and having been salvaged can go on up to greater freedom and ability he wont make it otherwise by any other known technology l ron

auditor failure to understand edited from hcob 17 oct 1962 for use on the hqs course if pc says something and the auditor fails to understand what the pc said or meant the correct response is i did not hear you understand what was said get that last to do anything else is not only bad form it can amount to heavy arc break invalidation to say you did not speak loud enough_____ or any other use of you is an invalidation the pc is also thrown out of session by having responsibility hung on him or her the auditor is responsible for the session therefore the auditor has to assume responsibility for all comm breakdowns in it evaluation far more serious than invalidation above is the accidental evaluation which may occur when the auditor repeats what the pc said never repeat anything pc says after him matter why repeating not only does not show the pc you heard but makes him feel youre circuit the highest advance of 19th century psychology was machine to drive people crazy all it did was repeat after the person everything the person said children also do this to annoy but that isnt the main reason you do not repeat what the pc said after the pc if you say it wrong the pc is thrown into heavy protest the pc must correct the wrongness and hangs up right there it may take an hour to dig the pc out of it further dont gesture to find out to say pointing you mean this item then is not only an evaluation but nearly hypnotic command and the pc feels he must reject very strongly dont tell the pc what the pc said and dont gesture to find what the pc meant just get the pc to say it again or get the pc to point it out again thats the correct action 136summary very high percentage of arc breaks occur because of failure to understand the pc dont prove you didnt with gestures or

ta cold cans regardless of can size cold emeter electrodes tend to give much higher tone arm reading particularly on some pcs until the cans warm up the reading is generally false and is false in the direction of high chilled pc almost always has high ta until he or she gets warm just throwing coat over the pcs shoulders can bring down ta in cool room but some pcs are cool blooded and the shock of icecold cans can drive the ta up and it takes while to drift down this has great effect on examinations where the cans are used very briefly practice which gets around this is for the auditor or examiner to hold the cans briefly until they are warm and then give them to the pc variation is for the auditor or examiner to put the cans under his armpits while setting up this warms them there are probably many other ways to warm up cans to body temperature footplates tests show that footplates do not give exactly the same read as handheld electrodes on pcs who have nothing wrong with their hands this is probably due to body imbalances cans held under the armpits or under knees not advised as there sometimes is tiny electrical sting give varied reads from handheld cans where full weight rests on the footplates the read is also varied to all practical purposes the differences can be neglected unless they give trouble in getting fns one should simply be alert in using footplates and find out the differences if new problems of false ta or fns develop and handle any such trouble when it occurs person used to going barefoot for instance would have foot calluses and would give false footplate ta pcs who falsify some pcs rare take mistaken pride in being able to push the ta up by straining or tensing by just moving into the body the ta can be sent up by an otherwise exterior pc 138some pcs also take road out by getting an fn at will they have various tricks that do this the main one being to think of something else and get an fn any of these rare pcs are manifesting outofsessionness they arent in session the definition of in session is interested in own case and willing to talk to the auditor remedy that and they cease such tricks usually they arent being run on

could rig up water meter so it read that twice as much water had flowed and then sit around and wonder all week why the swimming pool never filled up the accuracy of meter depends upon its being honestly set up and honestly used the honesty of the auditor determines his results the whole field of psychotherapy was dishonest from the days of witch doctors to psychiatry falsified data came from lack of knowledge of the mind this made its practitioners dishonest we do not and must not follow that fatal road the technology we have works to definite positive predictable results results are obtained if the auditor has honestly studied and understood his materials and honestly applies them falsifying study leads to falsifying meters and this gives bad results on pcs honest use of the materials and the meter gives an honest result one who does not know his materials and who cannot do his drills then thinks he has to make meter cheat honest use of the meter by an honest auditor is the route to good results low tas 141a bad practice has arisen to beat the low ta this is to have the pc wipe his hands every few minutes to get the ta up above 20 not only does this distract the pc and yank him out of session but it is by inference putting his attention on the meter thing good auditor does not do in formal session the pcs attention must be on his own case in session not on the meter or his hands an answer to low ta because of wet hands is foot plates but the best answer is to get the pc up scale so he doesnt have perspiring hands overwhelming trs is the commonest reason for low tas not all the hand wiping in the world will cure poor trs some auditors spook leap off the road like horse frightened by something blowing along at the very thought of high or low tas this is because they havent got the trs to handle low ta nor the tech to handle high one making meter read falsely low with cream or falsely high with talcum powder or wiping hands continually will not handle the pcs case that is what the auditor is there to do not make his session look good the funniest one i have ever heard was solo auditor who had high ta trouble so he used to fill up bathtub with

founder lrh nerd copyright 1972 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 142hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco policy letter of 13 march 1972 remimeo establishment officer series 5 production and establishment orders and products the situation one often finds in an org after one has to some degree conquered devt is that people require orders for years i wondered why this was so well i found it when people do not clearly know what their products are they require constant orders to the establishment officer this reflects most visibly in trying to get program targets done some people have to be ordered and ordered and ordered and threatened and howled at then in bewildered way they do target sometimes half sometimes nearly all behind this apparent blankness lies an omitted datum when theyre like that they dont know what their product is or what it adds up to or they think its something else or should be that blankness can invite overts it is very seldom that malice or resentment or refusal to work lies behind the inaction people are seldom that way they usually just dont understand whats wanted or why because they dont know what product is whole ad council of downstat org was unable even to define the word they had required orders orders orders and even then didnt carry them out hat survey for orders staff member who requires orders may also think that any order is policy and lasts forever if you look into hats you will even find casual close the door type of orders given on one occasion to fit one circumstance are converted over into standing continual orders that forever keep certain door closed an est surveying the hats of unit may very well find all manner of such oddities it is standard est action to survey hats 143in hats you will find despatches giving specific orders or quoted remarks preserved instead of notes on what one has to know to produce product in auditors hats directions for 1 specific pc in 1960 never published and from tape or correct source held onto like death like it was to be applied to every pc in the world dishwashing hat may have orders in it but not how to wash dishes rapidly and well this is all symptom of unit or activity that does not know what its products are disestablishment where you find lots of orders kicking around you will also find disestablishment by by pass command channels not held and staff members like to take their orders from anyone but those in authorityany passerby could give them orders this is rampant where an executive has not been well on post by counting such orders up and seeing who they are from one can determine the unhattedness of staff their org bd weaknesses and principally their lack of knowledge of their products hatting for product if an est is to hat so as to get the staff member to get his product out then the est has to know how to clear up products now an est is an establishment officer there are product officers the product of an est is the establishment then what is he doing with products well if he doesnt hat so staff members get out products then the org will be turmoil unhappy and downstat production is the basis of morale hattedness is basic of 3rd dynamic sanity but if you dont hat so as to get the staff member you are hatting producing you will hat and hat and it will all be in vain the person wont stay hatted unless he is hatted so as to be able to produce the product officer should be working to get the products out so if you dont hat for the product then the staff member will be tom between two sets of orders the est and the product officers only when you hat to get product will you get agreement with product officers if you are in disagreement with product officers then the est is not hatting to get production right way to there is right direction to hat all others are incorrect 1 clear up what the product is for the post and hat from there 1442 hat from the top of the division or org down these are the two right directions all other directions are wrong these two data are so important that the failure of an est can often be traced to violation of them you can have senior exec going almost livid resisting being hatted unless you hat by 1st establishing what the product is if product is first addressed and cleaned up then you can also hat from the top down if this is not done the staff will not know where they are going or why and you will get silly unusual situations like a11 right so youre the establishment officer well i give up the division can have 2l2 hours day establishment time and then get the hell out of here so some work can be done man you got these people all tied up stats are down cant you understand well if you dont do one and two above youll run into the most unusual messes and solutions you ever heard of go sailing off policy and as an est wind up at your desk doing admin instead of getting your job done in the division and an est who is not on his feet working in the division is worth very little to anyone so see where the basic errors lead and hat on product before doing anything else and hat from the top down steps to clear product this is general rundown of the sequence by which product is cleared and recleared and recleared again this can be checklisted for any exec or staff member and should be with name and date and kept in the persons est file folder for eventual handing to his new est when the person is transferred out of the division or in personnel files if he goes elsewhere 1 clear the word product 2 get what the product or products of the post should be get it or any number of products he has fully fully stated not brushed off 3 clear up the subject of exchange see hco pl 27 nov 71 exec series 3 and hco pl 3 dec 71 exec series 4 4 exchange of the product internal in the org for what valuable 5 exchange external of the valuable with another group or public for what valuable person must come to fn vgis on these above actions before proceeding or he goes to an auditor to get his us and out ruds very fully handled 6 does he want the product clean this up fully to fn vgis or yourself get to fn or get an auditor to unsnarl this 1457 can he get the products in 2 above out how will he whats he need to know get him fully settled on this point 8 will it be in volume what volume is that enough to bother with or will it have to be greater volume or is he being optimistic whats real whats viable 9 what quality is necessary what would he have to do to attain that to attain it in volume 10 can he get others to want the product or products as in 2 above what would he have to do to do this 11 how do his products fit into the unit or section or department or division or the org get this all traced 12 now trace the blocks or barriers he may believe are on this line get what he can do about these 13 what does he have to have to get his product out alert for unreasonable have to have before he can do blocks 14 now does he feel he can get his product or products out signature of est or clearer now he really can be hatted ________ brushoff quickie handling is very very bad fault quickie means brushoff lick and promise like wiping the windshield on the drivers side when really one would have to work at it to get whole clean car so dont quickie product if this is poorly done on them there goes the old balloon hatting wont be possible orders will have to be poured in on this terminal devt will generate overt products will occur not good ones and it wont be worthwhile disagreement there can be lot of disagreement amongst product officers and est on what products are to be hammered out in such case or in any case one can get disagreements check done in dept of personnel enhancement who should look up how to do one this is somewhat extreme way to settle an argument and should only be when all else fails it is best to take the whole product pattern of the org apart with the person starting from the biggest product of the org and working back to the persons product 146almost always there will be an outpoint in reasoning an exec who only wants gi can be trial as he is violating exchange as an org is paid usually before it delivers it is easy to get the org in trouble by backlogs or bad repute for nondelivery an org that has credit payments due it that arent paid maybe didnt deliver but div iii may soften up collections for some reason like that and then where would the org be vol 0 of the oec course gives an excellent background of how basic org works as one goes to higher orgs lower orgs are depended upon to continue to flow upward to them see hco pl 9 mar 72 issue i finance series 11 income flows and pools study of vol 0 oec and full understanding of its basic flows and adapting these to higher orgs will unsnarl lot of odd ideas about product the est has to be very clear on these points or he could mishat person usually however this is very obvious product officers heads of orgs and divisions have had to organize so long they get stuck in it they will try to order the est this comes about because they do not know their products or the est is not following 1 and 2 above and does not know his own product the product officer may try to treat the est as sort of organizing officer or program officer if the est is not hatting to get production b the product officer is not cleared on product so it comes back to the 1 and 2 first mentioned you can look over it now and see that if one is not doing these two things devt non viability and orders will occur so where you have devt down stats and orders flying around you know one thing that will resolve it something will have to be ironed out about product when it all looks impossible go to this point and get to work on 1 2 lrhnerd l ron hubbard copyright 1972 founder by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 147hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco policy letter of 23 march 1972 remimeo establishment officer series 11 full product clearing long form reference hco pl 13 mar 72 est series 5 must be done on an est before he does it on staff if you ask some people what their product is you usually get doingness there are three conditions of existence they are be do and have all products fall under have the oddities you will get instead of proper product are many thus it is possible to clear products without any real result product clearing form _____________________ _____________________ org persons name _____________________ date _____________________ post the 14 points of est series 5 are done in this fashion with meter used to check words step one do not take for granted that the person knows what product means get it and every word in the definition looked up clear the word product dictionaries give variety of definitions make sure you get useable definition that the person understands and which he understands all the words in he can be hung up on that or is in the definition itself believe it or not b have the person use the word product 10 times in sentences of his own invention and use it correctly each time c now clear up be do have the conditions of existence people often think be is product or do it is always something someone can have 148clear the words be do have by dictionary especially have d write these on sheet of paper be do have tell the person to name product out in the world car book cured dog etc put an arrow into the word do if he gives you do into be if he gives you be instead of have mark have with an arrow each time he gives right have product when he can rapidly name product that is something that one can have without comm lag go on to next step clear up this question on meter method 4 see hco b 22 feb 72 word clearing series 32 word clearing method 4 have i used any word so far you did not understand get it clean f now give the person copy of hco pl 29 october 70 org series 10 have him read the policy letter g clear by method 4 word clearing this question are there any words in the policy letter you did not understand get it cleaned up if there were any have him reread the policy letter until he says he has it h drill the pc on products 1 2 3 and 4 write product 1 product 2 product 3 product 4 on sheet of paper let him retain and consult the hco pl 29 oct 70 org series 10 put the point of your pen on one of the products product 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 and say name product 1 name product 3 name product 4 name product 2 do this until pc has it now take the pl away from him and repeat the drill when your product 1 etc is all blacked up with ballpoint spots and the person is quick at it thank him tell him he has it and go on to next step 149step two look up the hat and org board of the post of the person being product cleared and get some idea of what the posts product would have to be to fit in with the rest of the scene it wont necessarily be in former hat writeups what the post produces must be worked out write down what it possibly may be b get the person to tell you what his post produces have him work the wording around until it is totally satisfactory to him and is not incorrect by step 2 be very careful indeed that you dont get wrong product or you could throw the whole lineup of the org out beware of high stat or bonus or gi as these are items received in exchange not the persons produced product once more resort to be do have to be sure he is not giving doingness and point this out until he actually has have write down the product on the worksheet c ask if there are any more products to the post if the person is wearing several hats he would have product for each hat list each hat and get the product of each hat written after it d now take the principal product of the post and see if it is really three products of different degrees or kinds example an auditor has well pc one who has been gotten over psychosomatic illness b person who is physically active and well and will continue to be well and c being with greatly increased abilities super has trained student b course graduate c person who successfully applies the skills taught note the above are rough wordings the b c you will notice fit roughly into be b do c have if the person has trouble with this write be do have on the worksheet find out if the person has had these confused one with another or if he is trying for when his product was c or any other mixup see if he has to first get be then do to finally achieve have when he has all this straight he should cognite on what product he is going for on his post with vgis f tell the person thats it for the step and verify the products with product officer be sure its product officer who has had his product clearing if this is the product officer of the org see if it compares to the valuable final products of an org see hco pl 8 nov 73ra revised 9 mar 74 the vfps and gdss of the divisions of an org if the products are not all right check the person on meter for us and do steps 1 and 2 again if okay proceed to step 3 step three give the person hco pl 27 nov 71 executive series 3 and hco pl 3 dec 71 executive series 4 have him read them 150b return and do method 4 on the pls and clean up any misunderstood word if these are found and looked up and used then have the person read the pls again c now that the person has it exchange objects with him have him now explain exchange until he sees clearly what it is step four now write his product on the lefthand side of your worksheet and draw an arrow from it to the right his product and one to the left below it have him tell you what internally in the org he could get in exchange for producing his product and getting it out have him clear up why he might not get that b have him look at worksheet picture overt act injury injury overt act self product others nothing nothing as cycle be sure he grasps that c have him look at worksheet picture overt product upset upset overt and have him grasp that cycle d now have him draw various such cycles having to do with the products he has been getting out such as bad product dissatisfied bad feelings ethics but using various versions of products do this until he has it untangled and feels good have him write down his product on the left arrow to the right what comes back on the right and what occurs on the left if he has this now tell him thats fine step five all in big clay demos have him work out what theft is in terms of exchange and arrows b have him show how his product contributes to the orgs product 151c have him work out how the orgs product as relates to his division is then exchanged with society outside the org and scn and what society exchanges back to the org d have him work out how his product contributes to orgs product outward and outside the org and scn and then from the society outside back to the org and org back to him this may have more than two vias each way have him work out the combined staff products into an org product and then out into the society and then the exchange back into the org and to clos and upper management and to org staff f when the demos are all okay and big tell him thats fine and go on to next step step six metered find out if person wants his product not the exchange if not find out who might suppress it and times who might invalidate it and earlier times 2wc it to fn cog vgis b establish now if the person wants his product if bogs turn over to cs and auditor for ruds and completion step seven metered can the person get his product out b handle by 2wc to fn step eight metered what will his product be in volume is that enough to bother about or will it have to be in greater volume what would be viable as to volume clean up rushed or failures to fn cog vgis step nine metered what quality would be necessary 152get various degrees of quality stated what would he have to do to attain that quality what volume could he attain what would he have to do to attain that to fn cog vgis step ten metered can he get others to want the products he put out what would he have to do to attain this step eleven in big clay this is progressive clay demo added to at each step how does his product or products fit into the framework of his section requires he work out the section product if his is not it then fit his to it b how does his product fit into the department requires he work out the departments product and fit his to it if his is not the depts product c how does his product fit into the divisions products he will have to work out the divs product or consult hco pl 8 nov 73fa revised 9 mar 74 the vfps and gdss of the divisions of an org d how does the divisions product

mesrd l ron hubbard copyright 1972 founder by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 155hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco policy letter of 4 april 1972 remimeo establishment officer series 14 ethics the normal level of an unhatted devt nonproducing org is out ethics the reason you see so many heavy ethics actions occurringor situations where heavy ethics actions should occur if they arentin such an org is that it has its exchange flows messed up it is important to know this fact as this factor alone can sometimes be employed to handle persons in the area whose ethics are out criminality unless we want to go on living in far nowhere some of the facts of scenes have to be confronted an inability to confront evil leads people into disregarding it or discounting it or not seeing it at all reversely there can be type of person who like an oldtime preacher sees nothing but evil in everything and possibly looking into his own heart for model believes all men are evil man however as you can read in hco b 28 nov 70 cs series 22 psychosis is basically good when going upon some evil course he attempts to restrain himself and caves himself in the chart of human evaluation in science of survival was right enough and such people also can be found by the oxford capacity analysis where the graph is low and well below center line on the right this sort of thing can be handled of course by auditing but the est does not depend on that to handle his staffs problems criminal actions proceed from such people unless checked by more duress from without not to do an evil act than they themselves have pressure from within to do it criminality is in most instances restrained by just such an imbalance of pressures if you have ethics presence in an org then criminality shows its head such people lie rather than be made to confront they false reportthey even use pr which means public relations to cover upand in our slang talk pr means putting up lot of false reports to serve as smoke screen for idleness or bad actions unless you get ethics in you will never get tech in if you cant get tech in you wont get admin in 156so the lack of ethics permits the criminal impulse to go unchecked yes it could be handled with tech but to get money you have to have admin in unless there is ethics and ways to get it in matter how distasteful it may seem you will never get tech and admin in of course there is always the element of possible injustice but this is provided against see hco pl 24 feb 72 injustice when ethics is being applied by criminal hands as happens in some governments it can get pretty grim but even then ethics serves as restraint to just outright slaughter omitting to handle criminality can make one as guilty of the resulting crimes as if one committed them so criminality as factor has to be handled it is standardly handled by the basic ethics pls and the ethics officer system exchange the unhatted unproducing staff member who is not really criminal or psychotic can be made to go criminal this joins him to the criminal ranks the ethics system also applies to him however there is something an est can do about it that is truly est tech this lies in the field of exchange if you recall your product clearing you will see that exchange is something for something criminal exchange is nothing from the criminal for something from another whether theft or threat or fraud is used the criminal think is to get something without putting out anything that is obvious staff member can be coaxed into this kind of thinking by permitting him to receive without his contributing this unlocks by the way an ageold riddle of the philosophers as to what is right or wrong honesty is the road to sanity you can prove that and do prove it every time you make somebody well by pulling his withholds the insane are just one seething mass of overt acts and withholds and they are very physically sick people when you let somebody be dishonest you are setting him up to become physically ill and unhappy traditional sea org ethics labeled noncompliance as liability and false report as doubt and its true enough 157when you let person give nothing for something you are factually encouraging crime dont be surprised that welfare districts are full of robbery and murder people there give nothing for something when exchange is out the whole social balance goes out every full scholarship ever given by an org wound up in messy scene when you hire professional pc who just sits around making doless motions while people audit him and contribute to him do not be surprised if he gets sicker and sicker he is contributing nothing in return and winds up in overwhelm similarly if you actively prevented someone from contributing in return you could also make him arc broken and sick it is exchange which maintains the inflow and outflow that gives person space around him and keeps the bank off of him there are numbers of ways these flows of exchange can be unbalanced it does not go same out as comes in equal amounts are factor who can measure good will or friendship who can actually calculate the value of saving being from death in each lifetime who can measure the reward of pride in doing job well or praise for all these things are of different values to different people in the material world the person whose exchange factor is out may think he makes money only government or counterfeiter makes money one has to produce something to exchange for money right there the exchange factor is out if he gives nothing in return for what he gets the money does not belong to him in product clearing many people it was found that some considered their food clothing bed and allowance were not theirs because they produced they were theirs just by being there this funny logic covered up the fact that these people produced little or nothing on post yet they were the first to howl when not getting expensive to the org auditing or courses or tech thus such person not hatted or made to produce will get ill it is interesting that when person becomes productive his morale improves reversely it should be rather plain to you that person who doesnt produce becomes mentally or physically ill for his exchange factor is out so when you reward downstat you not only deprive upstats you also cave the downstat in i dont think welfare states have anything else in mind the riots of the ancient city of rome were caused by these factors there they gave away corn and games to populace that eventually became so savage it could only enjoy torture and gruesome death in the arena 158a lot of this exchange imbalance comes from child psychology where the child is not contributing anything and is not permitted to contribute it is this which first overwhelms him with feelings of obligation to his parents and then bursts out as total revolt in his teens children who are permitted to contribute not as cute thing to do but actually make non contributing children of the same age look like raving maniacs it is the cruel sadism of modern times to destroy the next generation this way dont think it isnt intended i have examined the ocas of parents who do it so if person is brought up this life with the exchange all awry the est has his hands full sometimes he is dealing with trainedin criminality what he can do the remedy is rather simple first one has to know all about exchange as covered in the product clearing policy letters then he has to specially clear this up with people who do not produce he should get them to work on it as it relates to all their dynamics in relationship to every other dynamic that means he has to clear up the definitions of dynamics with care and then have the person draw big chart of his own and say what he gives the 1st dynamic and what it gives him then what he gives the second dynamic and what it gives him and so on up the dynamics now have him consider his own second dynamic what does his second dynamic give his first dynamic what does his second dynamic give the second dynamic and what does it give him and so on until you have network of these exchange arrows each both ways somewhere along the way if your trs are good and you have his attention and he is willing to talk to you he will have quite cognition that if its big one is the end phenomena of it and dont be surprised if you see person now and then change his physical face shape conditions by dynamics an ethics type action can be done by giving the person the conditions formulas pages 189 237 245 247 249 of vol 0 basic staff hat hco pl 14 mar 68page 247gives one the table method 4 the person on the table of conditions and pick up any other misunderstoods have the person study the formula of each of these conditions in the table so that he knows what they are and what the formulas are 159when he has all this now with misunderstood words you must clear up the words related to his dynamics 1 to 8 and what they are now youre ready for the billion dollar question ask him what is his condition on the first dynamic have him study the formulas dont buy any glib pr dont evaluate or invalidate when hes completely sure of what his condition really is on the first dynamic he will cognite now take up the second dynamic by its partssex family children get condition for each similarly go on up each one of the dynamics until you have condition for each one now begin with the first dynamic again continue to work this way you will be amazed to find he will come out of false high down to low and back up again on each dynamic somewhere along the line he will start to change markedly when you have person in continual heavy ethics or who is outethics ethics bait we say and who is floundering around you can do an s d on him and quite often save his future for him when you have such person you do this one first before you do the exchange by dynamics in other words you use this on ethics bait and then when hes come out of such you do exchange by dynamics on him summary when all looks black and you are getting false reports and the things said done were not done and what was really being done were overt products and despite all your work the stats just wont go up you still have three answers 1 get in ethics on the org 2 get exchange done on individuals 3 get in conditions by dynamics on the ethics bait and after that keep strong just division 1 dept 3 youll be amazed l ron hubbard founder lrhsbrd copyright 1972 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 160hubbard communications office saint hill manor east

executive series 12 ethics and executives any person holding an executive post head of department or above is deemed an executive evaluation has revealed that the breakdown in many orgs is failure on the part of executives to wear their ethics and justice hats it has been found that below administrative whys there is usually an ethics situation as well which unhandled causes the administrative why not to function or raise stats in an area which is downstat it is the duty of an executive to investigate and find any outethics situation and get it corrected ethics is personal thing in relation to group unethical people are those who do not have ethics in on themselves personally it is the responsibility of the executive to see to it that persons under his control and in his area get their personal ethics in and keep them in dishonesty false reports an outethics personal life should be looked for and by persuasion should be corrected when an executive sees such things he or she must do all he can to get the person to get his own ethics in when an area is downstat the executive must at once suspect an outethics scene with one or more of the personnel and must investigate and persuade the person to be more honest and ethical and correct the outethics condition found if this does not correct and if the person or area remains downstat the executive must declare the person or area in danger and apply hco pl 9 apr 72 correct danger condition handling the situation if it does not correct thereafter becomes matter of full group justice with courts and comm evs persons whose ethics have remained out must be replaced the seniors of an executive are bound to enforce this policy and to use it on any executives whose personal ethics are out and who fail to apply it it will be found that those who do not apply this policy letter have themselves certain dishonesties or outethics situations it is vital to any organization to be strong and effective to be ethical 166the most important zone of ethical conduct in an organization is at or near the top ethical failure at the top or just below it can destroy an organization and make it downstat historical examples are many therefore it is policy that an executive must keep ethics in on himself and those below him or be disciplined or comm eved and removed from any post of authority and someone found who is himself ethical and can keep ethics in on those under his authority the charge in any such case for staff member or executive is failure to uphold or set an example of high ethical standards such offenses are composed of 1 dishonesty 2 use of false statements to cover up situation 3 representing scene to be different than it actually is to cover up crimes and escape discipline 4 irregular 2d connections and practices 5 drug or alcoholic addiction 6 encouraging outethics 7 condoning or failing to effectively handle an outethics situation in self or others as an in charge officer or executive technical people with outethics withholds cannot see this is proven by the brilliant return of perception of the environment in people audited effectively and at length on such processes such people also seek to place false environment there and actually see false environment people whose ethics are low will enturbulate and upset group as they are seeking to justify their harmful acts against the group and this leads to more harmful acts outethics people go rapidly into treason against the group person whose ethics have been out over long period goes out of valence they are not themselves happiness is only attained by those who are honest with themselves and others group prospers only when each member in it has his own personal ethics in even in pts potential trouble source person there must have been outethics conduct toward the suppressive personality he or she is connected with for the person to have become pts in the first place 167people who are physically ill are pts and are outethics toward the person or thing they are pts to thus group to be happy and well and for the group to prosper and endure its individual members must have their own ethics in it is up to the executive or officer to see that this is the case and to do the actions necessary to make it come about and the group an ethical group exec or officers steps for getting in ethics on staff member step one inform the person personally he is in danger condition by reason of acts or omissions downstats false reports or absence or 2d or whatever the circumstances are he is in fact in danger because somebody is going to act sooner or later to hit him he may be involved already in some other assignment of condition but this is between you and him he is in danger because you are having to bypass him to get his ethics in thing he should do himself if he cooperates and completes this rundown and it comes out all right you will help him if he doesnt cooperate you will have to use group justice procedures this is his chance to get ethics in on himself with your help before he really crashes when he accepts this fact step 1 is done go to step 2 step 2 ethics is gotten in by definition on the person get in the definitions fully understood the following words must be method 4 word cleared on all the words and the words in their definitions on the person being handled ethics the study of the general nature of morals morals plural noun the principles of right and wrong conduct and the specific moral choices to be made by the individual in his relationship with others the rules or standards governing the conduct of the members of profession justice 1 moral rightness equity 2 honor fairness 3 good reason 4 fair handling due reward or treatment 5 the administration and procedure of the law false contrary to fact or truth without grounds incorrect without meaning or sincerity deceiving not keeping faith treacherous resembling and being identified as similar or related entity 168dishonest disposed to lie cheat defraud or deceive pretense false reason or excuse mere show without reality betray to be disloyal or faithless to outethics an action or situation in which an individual is involved contrary to the ideals and best interests of his group an act or situation or relationship contrary to the ethics standards codes or ideals of the group or other members of the group an act of omission or commission by an individual that could or has reduced the general effectiveness of group or its other members an individual act of omission or commission which impedes the general wellbeing of group or impedes it in achieving its goals do not go to step 3 of this until all the above words are cleared by method 4 word clearing step 3 ask the person what outethics situation he or she is involved in it may take the person some time to think of it or he may suppress it and be afraid to say it for fear of consequences reassure him that you are only trying to help him he may have brought it up in session but did not apply it as outethics coax him through this if his conduct and actions are poor or downstat he for sure will be able to come up with an outethics personal scene sometimes the person is secretly pts and is connected to suppressive or antagonistic person or group or thing in such an instance he will rollercoaster as case or on post or have accidents or be ill frequently see pts tech for material on this and for future handling checksheet hco pl 9 april 72 revised correct danger condition handling but go on handling with these steps sometimes the person just uses pr brags it up and wont come clean in this case an auditing session is required if the person gets involved in self listing get him audited on hco b 20 apr 72 cs series 78 which gives the auditing session procedure person can become very upset over wrong item it is easily repaired but it must be repaired if this happens by your own 2wc or whatever means or repair get this step 3 to clearcut outethics situation clearly stated do not forget to go on with this eventually if there is delay in completing it gis will be in if correct step 4 have the person work out how the outethics situation in which he or she is involved would be betrayal of the group or make them false to the group or its ideals do not make the person guilty just get them to see it themselves when they have seen this clearly and have cognited on it completely go to next step step 5 169the person is now ready to apply the first dynamic danger formula to himself give him this formula and explain it to him first dynamic formula the formula is converted for the 1st dynamic to 1st 1 bypass habits or normal routines 1st 2 handle the situation and any danger in it 1st 3 assign self danger condition 1st 4 get in your own personal ethics by finding what you are doing that is out ethics and use selfdiscipline to correct it and get honest and straight 1st 5 reorganize your life so that the dangerous situation is not continually happening to you 1st 6 formulate and adopt firm policy that will hereafter detect and prevent the same situation from continuing to occur now usually the person is already involved in another group situation of downstats or overt products or bad appearance or low conditions courts comm evs for something it does not matter what other condition he was in from you he is in danger so 1st 1 and 1st 2 above apply to the group situation he finds himself in he has to assign himself danger condition as he recognizes now he has been in danger from himself 1st 4 has been begun by this rundown it is up to him or her to finish off 1st 4 by applying the material in steps 2 and 3 he or she has to use selfdiscipline to correct his own outethics scene and get it honest and straight with himself and the group 1st 5 is obvious if he doesnt he will just crash again 1st 6 in formulating and adopting firm policy he must be sure it aligns with the group endeavor when he has worked all this out and demonstrated it in life he has completed the personal danger rundown he can then assign himself emergency and follow the emergency formula hco pl 23 sept 67 pg 189190 vol 0 oec emergency step 6 review the person and his stats and appearance and personal life 170satisfy yourself that the steps above and the outethics found were all of it that wrong item has been found that the person is not pts handle what you find but if you find that the person did not improve and gave it all brushoff you must now take the groups point of view and administer group justice your protection of the person is at end because he had his chance and is apparently one of those people who depend on others to keep his ethics in for him and cant keep them in himself so use group justice procedures thereafter if the person made it and didnt fall on his head and is moving on up now as shown by honest stats and condition of his post you have had nice win and things will go much much better and thats win for everybody l ron hubbard founder lrhmesrd copyright 1972 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 171hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 10 may 1972 remimeo robotism reference hcob 28 nov 1970 cs series 22 psychosis technical advance has been made in relation to the inactivity slowness or incompetence of human beings this discovery proceeds from two and half year intense study of aberration as it affects the ability to function as group member the ideal group member is capable of working causatively in full cooperation with his fellows in the achievement of group goals and the realization of his own happiness the primary human failing is an inability to function as himself or contribute to group achievements wars political upsets organizational duress growing crime rates increasingly heavy justice growing demands for excessive welfare economic failure and other age long and repeating conditions find common denominator in the inability of human beings to coordinate the current political answer in vogue in this century and growing is totalitarianism where the state orders the whole life of the individual the production figures of such states are very low and their crimes against the individual are numerous discovery therefore of what this factor is that makes the humanoid the victim of oppression would be valuable one the opening lines of dianetics the modern science of mental health comment on mans lack of an answer for himself the group needs such an answer in order to survive and for its individual members to be happy scale pandetermined selfdetermined otherdetermined oblivious insanerobot band needing orders the exact mechanism of needing orders is to be found as an outgrowth of the mental condition outlined in hcob 28 nov 1970 psychosis 172the individual with an evil purpose has to withhold himself because he may do destructive things when he fails to withhold himself he commits overt acts on his fellows or other dynamics and occasionally loses control and does so this of course makes him quite inactive to overcome this he refuses any responsibility for his own actions any motion he makes must be on the responsibility of others he operates then only when given orders thus he must have orders to operate therefore one could term such person robot and the malady could be called robotism perception studies of perception undertaken since hcob 28 nov 70 reveal that sight hearing and other channels of awareness decrease in proportion to the number of overt actsand therefore withholdswhich the person has committed on the whole track by relieving these sight has been remarkably brightened therefore person who is withholding himself from committing overt acts because of his own undesired purposes has very poor perception he does not see the environment around him thus combined with his unwillingness to act on his own initiative there is blindness to the environment overt products see pl 14 nov 70 org series 14 since he does not act upon orders he is taking responsibility for he executes orders without fully understanding them further he executes them in an environment he does not see thus when forced to produce he will produce overt products these are called so because they are not in actual fact useful products but something one wants and are overt acts in themselvessuch as inedible biscuits or repair that is just further breakage slowness the person is slow because he is moving on otherdeterminism is carefully withholding himself and cannot see anyway thus he feels lost confused or unsafe and cannot move positively because he produces overt products he gets slapped around or goes unthanked and so begins decline 173he cannot move swiftly and if he does has accidents so he teaches himself to be careful and cautious justice group justice is of some use but all it really does is make the person withhold himself even harder and while necessary restraint nevertheless does not itself bring lasting improvement threats and heads on pike meaning examples of discipline do however jar the person into giving his attention and channeling his actions into more desirable path from the group viewpoint justice is necessary in society of such people but it is not remedy for improvement malice despite the viciousness of the truly insane there is little or real malice in the robot the truly insane cannot control or withhold their evil purposes and dramatize them at least covertly the insane are not always visible but they are visible enough and they are malicious the robot on the other hand does control his evil impulses to great extent he is not malicious his danger mainly stems from the incompetent things he does the time of others he consumes the waste of time and material and the brakes he puts on the general group endeavor he does not do all these things intentionally he does not really know he is doing them he looks in wounded surprise at the wrath he generates when he breaks things wrecks programs and gets in the way he does not know he is doing these things for he cannot see that he is he may go along for some time doing slowly wasteful well and then carelessly smashes the exact thing that wrecks the whole activity people suppose he cunningly intended to do so he seldom does he winds up even more convinced he cant be trusted and that he should withhold harder false reports the robot gives many false reports unable to see how can he know what is true he seeks to fend off wrath and attract good will by pr public relations boasts without realizing he is giving false reports morale the robot goes into morale declines easily since production is the basis of morale and since he does not really produce much left to his own devices his morale sags heavily 174physical inertia the body is physical object it is not the being himself as body has mass it tends to remain motionless unless moved and tends to keep going in certain direction unless steered as he is not really running his body the robot has to be moved when not moving or diverted if moving on wrong course thus anyone with one or more of such beings around him tends to get exhausted with shoving them into motion or halting them when they go wrong exhaustion only occurs when one does not understand the robot it is the exasperation that exhausts one with understanding one is not exasperated because he can handle the situation but only if he knows what it is pts potential trouble sources are not necessarily robots pts person generally is withholding himself from suppressive person or group or thing toward that sp person or group or thing he is robot he takes orders from them if only in opposites his overts on the sp person make him blind and nonselfdetermined basic why the basic reason behind persons who cannot function are slow or inactive or incompetent and who do not produce is withholding self from doing destructive things and thus unwilling to take responsibility and therefore needing orders the exact wording of this why must be done by the individual himself after examining and grasping this principle if one writes this principle down on the top of sheet and then asks the person to word it exactly as it applies to himself one will attain the individual why for inaction and incompetence it will produce gis and fn at the examiner processing physical work in the physical universe general confronting reach and withdraw and objective processes go far in remedying this condition touch assists regularly and correctly given to proper end phenomena will handle illnesses of such persons 175word clearing is vital tech to open the persons comm lines wipe out earlier misunderstoods and increase his understanding pts tech will handle the persons robotism toward sp individuals groups or things to this and the pts rundown can be added the why above as it relates to the things or beings found as suppressive as last step the why above can be used in danger formula work such as hco pl 9 april 72 correct danger formula and hco pl 3 may 72 ethics and executives other individual whys can exist in these instances expanded dianetics the miracle of well done perfectly executed expanded dianetics eradicates both insanity and robotism drug handling and other actions may be necessary end product the end product when one has fully handled robotism is not person who cannot follow orders or who operates solely on his own totalitarian states fear any relief of the condition as they foolishly actively promote and hope for such beings but this is only deficiency in their own causes and their lack of experience with fully selfdetermined beings yet education advertising and amusements have been designed only for robots even religions existed to suppress mans evil nature lacking any examples or understanding many have feared to free the robot to his own control and think even with horror on it but you see beings are not basically robots they are miserable when they are basically they prosper only when they are selfdetermined and can be pandetermined to help in the

false ta couple of years ago some auditors were solving high ta problems by putting hand cream on the pcs hands when they were calloused and talcum powder on pcs hands when they were too wet since research had been done they were censured research has now been done on this matter of dry and wet hands apparently when person has taken certain medicines or chemicals or uses detergent soaps or is in contact with certain chemicals such as those in some furniture polishes the ordinary skin oils vanish these oils are needed to make an electrical contact with the cans when these oils are absent there is adequate electrical contact and the ta is high when person is deficient in certain minerals or vitamins such as magnesium or b complex his hands can be excessively wet either of these two conditions in hands or feet can produce an incorrect ta position the dry condition produces false high ta the overly wet condition produces false low ta the ta depends on normally moist hands this does not mean the meter works on sweat it does mean the meter works only when there is correct electrical contact too much and too greasy hand cream could produce too low ta too much powder or drier could produce too high ta therefore one must not go to extremes dry hands the excessively dry hand is seen as shiny or polished looking it feels very dry the correct treatment is to use vanishing cream obtainable from any cosmetics store not greasy hand cream the vanishing cream is so called because it rubs all the way into the skin and leaves excess grease this restores normal electrical contact there are many such creams it makes difference which is used so long as it vanishes into the skin 183it is doubtful if it would have to be applied more than onceat session startas it lasts for long while this would apply to some footplate cases as well whose hands are defective or too heavily calloused if cream leaves smears on can it is too heavily applied or too little absorbed vanishing type cream is usually smeared on rubbed in and can then be thoroughly wiped off the hands or feet will usually produce then normal ta and meter response wet hands antiperspirants can be applied to too wet hands there are many brands of these often powder or spray it can be wiped off after application and should work for two or three hours it can be applied to hands or feet for footplates if the ta

overts they do not occur in all cases by long ways but they do occur on few cases these are continuous missed withholds and continuous overts this is not quite the same as the continuing overt act hco b 29 september 65 in that type the person is repeating overt acts against something usually named the continuous missed wh continuous missed withhold occurs when person feels some way and anyone who sees him misses it example doctor feels very unconfident of his skill every patient who sees him misses the fact that he is not confident this reacts as missed withhold it is of course based upon some bad incident that destroyed his confidence usually of an engramic intensity but as the person actively withholds this then those seeing him miss the withhold this could work in thousands of variations woman feels continuous disdain for her child but withholds it the child therefore continuously misses withhold all the phenomena of the missed wh would continuously react against the child probably all dishonest social conduct brings about continuous missed withhold the politician who hates people the minister who longer believes in god the mechanic who privately believes he is jinx on machinery these all then set up the phenomena of missed withholds on themselves and can dramatize it in their conduct the continuous overt person who believes he is harmful to others may also believe that many of his common ordinary actions are harmful he may feel he is committing continuous overt on others 186example clothing model believes she is committing fraud on older women by displaying clothing to them in which they will look poorly in her estimation this is continuous overt act of course all older women miss it on her appearance just being alive can be considered by some as an overt missed withhold phenomena will result degraded beings the continuous withhold and continuous overt are probably basis of feeling degraded degraded beings as described in admin knowhowalteris and degraded beings hco b 22 mar 67 are that way at least in part because they have some continuous missed withhold or fancied continuous overt act this makes them feel degraded and act that way handling one can add to any program check for continuous missed withhold or continuous overt as an additional version of rudiments master question which could be broken down into three lists which would have to be done by the laws of ln would be when anyone looks at you what feeling action attitude of yours do they miss then when was it missed who missed it and what did he do that made you believe it had been missed another approach less dangerous in that lists arent made would be for continuous missed withhold the question could be is there some way you feel that others dont realize and with 2wc uncover it then ask who misses this with answer followed by when has someone missed it with to an earlier time followed by what did he or she do that made you think he or she knew this will key it out and can

that the phenomenon of mutual out ruds existed this means two or more people who mutually have ruds out on the wider group or other dynamics and do not get them in example husbandwife coaudit team never run ows on the rest of the family because both of them have similar overts and so consider it usual example prisoners engaged in coauditing as in narconon may have similar overts withholds arc brks andor problems with the rest of society and so do not think of handling them as outruds example two top class auditors coauditing have similar overts on the junior auditors and the org and so never think to get them in this can stall cases cs has to take this factor into account wherever he has possibility of its occurring in one instance mutual out ruds went so far as four auditors coauditing agreeing never to put their overts down on wses so they would not lose reputation needless to say all four eventually blew if the cs had done routine check for mutual out ruds this whole scene would have been prevented and four beings would not have ruined each other in any situation where small portion of larger group is engaged in coaudit the cs must check routinely for mutual out ruds this could even apply to an org or vessel which was separate from the rest of society around it its members could develop mutual out ruds from the rest of society and cases could fail on this

this was actually done years ago rses an rs or rock slam is defined as crazy irregular slashing motion of the needle it can be as narrow as one inch or more than full dial in width but its crazy it slams back and forth it is actually quite startling to see one it is very different from other meter phenomena recently auditors arriving on flag were found not to know what an rs was but were calling dirty needles dirty reads rocket reads even ticks as rses that comes from never having been trained on what an rs is and never having seen one rses are unique in appearance actually this is quite serious matter because pcs get labelled as rsers and get run on evil purposes connected with this rs that isnt one you can really foul up pc that way believe real rs also has crazy meter it doesnt read then it does this happens because the meter reads just below pcs reality if the pc has reality on the subject then the meter wont read so you get faulty meter it doesnt read on what it should then it reads then it doesnt rock slammers in group of 400 the actual percentage of rsers is low its about 8 in 400 or 2212 those figures should seem familiar they are the same percentage for sps and

mentioned as means of easing convulsions actually practice since 1968 has shown that objective trs scientology process described in detail in hco bs 11 june 1957 training and cch processes 15 july

supplementary way of handling withdrawal symptoms this does not replace objective trs and at this writing is theoretical being in research phase but so terrible can be withdrawal symptoms and so lacking in success has the medical and psychiatric field been that the data should be released muscular spasms are caused by lack of calcium nervous reactions are diminished by magnesium calcium does not go into solution in the body and is not utilized unless it is in an acid magnesium is alkaline working on this in 1973 for other uses than drug reactions i found the means of getting calcium into solution in the body along with magnesium so that the results of both could be achieved this was the calmag formula calmag formula 1 put one level tablespoon of calcium gluconate in normal sized glass 2 add 12 level teaspoon of magnesium carbonate 3 add i tablespoon of cider vinegar at least 5 acidity 4 stir it well 1945 add 12 glass of boiling water and stir until all the powder is dissolved and the liquid is clear if this doesnt occur it could be from poor grade or old magnesium carbonate 6 fill the remainder of glass with lukewarm or cold water and cover they will stay good for 2 days it can be made wrongly so that it does not dissolve variations from the above produce an unsuccessful mix that can taste pretty horrible anything from 1 to 3 glasses of this day with or after meals replaces any tranquilizer it does not produce the drugged effects of tranquilizers which are quite deadly the application to handle muscular spasms and tics is now quite well established using this to combat withdrawal symptoms is experimental the theory is that withdrawal symptoms are muscular spasms the matter should be given tests where persons suffering from withdrawal symptoms are available this does not supplant objective trs these work but it may be that calmag would assist those suffering where competent auditing is available as calcium and magnesium are minerals not drugs they form

administering of note this data is given for information alone and is not intended to prescribe or otherwise treat an individual all prescriptions and treatments should be done in due accordance with the medical laws of any country in which person seeks treatment there are several antibiotics these are moulds or chemical compounds which cause bacteria germs to be unable to reproduce themselves hits their 2d while not destroying the cells of the body at least that is one of the leading theories of why they work antibiotic means anti against biotic living beings such as bacteria so its against bugs disease is said to be caused by germs or virus germs are microscopic cells which breed and have bad effect on body cells and fluids virus is germ that is too small to be seen in microscope thus there are germ infections and virus infections usually one type of germ equals one disease ie typhoid fever however an illness can be compound of several types of germs but this is not usual virus diseases respond very badly to most antibiotics in fact in the presence of penicillin virus sort of suspends action without any real temperature change while the penicillin is present and gets busy again when the penicillin is gone the effect of most antibiotics on virus is zero some claims are made for some against virus measles is virus illness so antibiotics are mainly effective against germs venereal disease pneumonia wound infections and long parade of diseases can be cured by antibiotics when illness is accompanied by temperature antibiotics is usually the first thought antibiotics can however be grossly misadministered and in fact usually are even in hospitals the trick is to get the temperature subnormal with antibiotics within the blood leveling period blood leveling means when the antibiotic has gotten into the blood and is actually holding the infection stopping the bacterias 2d from continuing more of the same anti biotic is given approx 2 hours prior to blood leveling time this then brings the temperature right on down to subnormal continue the antibiotic so that it keeps the temperature subnormal until it just cant keep it subnormal any more and it comes up to normal it will be found that the patient is now well and not likely to relapse if blood leveling time is reached the time is always stated on the instructions and contraindications writeup and the temperature continues to rise you have not used the correct antibiotic and must at this point change to another kind of antibiotic each antibiotic has its own blood leveling time penicillin is 24 hours gephaloridine is 8 hours streptomycin is 6 hours etc 197before administering antibiotics you must ensure that you know exactly what toxicity it is toxic or poisonous quality the antibiotic has to the patient for example streptomycin can cause pregnant mothers to give birth to children who have impaired hearing renal kidneys having to do with them damage can be caused by certain antibiotics if the person has too much of certain kind of antibiotic therefore prior to administering any kind of antibiotic ensure that you know the patients full medical history as well as knowing exactly what the toxicity of the antibiotic is so that you do not damage the patient if not enough antibiotic is given or if it is the wrong kind for that disease the temperature will not be heavily affected or at best sinks to normal without going subnormal this condition can go on and on and on and the patient relapses also if antibiotics are given too briefly the temperature goes to subnormal the antibiotic ceases to be given the patient feels better then probably relapsesgets ill all over again the above important three error situations are not enough wrong kind stopped too soon to these can be added given too irregularly this last is almost always present when you give the patient the bottle this is common medical error the patients arent doctors seldom take the medicine correctly and often not at all antibiotics should be handed out and seen taken where there is large number ill the times can be standardized for the group for instance all get it at 300 to 330 900 to 930 etc or even 3 hourly can be done this way one takes the temperature before giving the pill glass of water or cigarette before temperature taking gives false report also in this way one can increase or decrease the dose depending on what the temperature was in very sick cases one has to watch the temperature more closely in this way every time the temperature starts to rise from the subnormal where you are holding it you immediately dose the patient an antibiotic all by itself cannot depress temperature its the reaction of the disease and body thats doing that temperature 986f or 37c is normal thermometer can be bit off 1 or 2 high or low and temperature can vary bit for normal one person to the next rising temperature above normal is reaction to disease lowered temperature below normal is reaction to disease being handled by the body or the antibiotic plus the body 100f or 378c is well above normal and is sick temperature 104f or 405c is dangerously possible die high 97f or 362c is very satisfactorily subnormal 198temperature rise is probably body mechanism to bum up disease possibly not but slight temperature few tenths high can make person feel really bad then when it gets up higher they feel drifty and with it very high go delirious subnormal temperature doesnt much affect how one feels chills come with high temperature administering doses the general rule when administering antibiotics is 1 one gives antibiotics until the temperature comes down past normal to subnormal and comes up to normal again with antibiotics after blood leveling time of the first antibiotic the temperature should break go normal or below the person going into sweat if it doesnt then its either not enough antibiotic or the wrong kind 2 after dosage if the temperature just came down bit from where it was that type of anti biotic probably will handle the illness but enough has not been given increase the amount being given if after blood leveling time from the first antibiotic the temperature did not go lower or even rose its the wrong antibiotic you change off to another and start all over again taking effect the blood leveling period of an antibiotic is always stated on the writeup of the anti biotic in the box accompanying the antibiotic the second administration is usually given 2 hours prior to the blood leveling period thus if the blood leveling period is 8 hours the second dose is given 6 hours after the first dose take the temperature before the dose and within the next 2 hours take the temperature again and you will know whether the antibiotic is working as the temperature should now be leveling andor falling if the temperature has not leveled or dropped at this period change the antibiotic when giving antibiotics fo 2187 medical charts must be followed if you dont have medical chart you dont know and cant see how the antibiotic is working past maladministration if person in the past has been treated wrongly with antibiotics ie got taken off as soon as temperature reached normal and was not continued as by rule 1 or 2 the germ remains dormant and the area may reinfect at later date if more antibiotics are then administered the temperature will go subnormal and then to normal with the antibiotic in other words the cycle will complete at this point the germ has been killed sessions before any session heavy dose of vitamins should be given if the person is on anti biotics 199key procedure when the temperature goes subnormal keep it subnormal until it just wont stay down with the person still taking the antibiotic the patient will then be well the faster you can get the temperature subnormal the better side effects antibiotics have side effects often very bad patient can be allergic to certain antibiotic meaning he goes red gets hives has bad reactions in varying degrees of severity if so get him on another antibiotic now you can test for allergy by scratching the skin and putting dab of antibiotic on it not the sugar or protective covering on bandaid after while if the person is allergic to it the area will get red and puffy this is not usually done unless you are being super cautious the chloro___and aureo___families can affect the sense of balance and early preparations destroyed the sense of balance forever all oral antibiotics sooner or later give the patient stomach ache and indigestion so they should be taken with milk or after meal never with just water the longer you keep them on an antibiotic the harder it is on the patients system the operating rule is give enough of the right kind to get fast cure if you started on the wrong kind get them on the right kind the moment you detect the error disease cycles diseases have their own cycles of action and time periods if not given antibiotics some run for days some for weeks some for lifetime gonorrhea for instance lasts year in man five years in woman syphilis has its own cure not an antibiotic which is ehrlichs magic bullet neoarsphenamine preparation 606 which is oneshot cure if done right and only kills i out of 10000 syphilis untreated is lifetime cycle and drives one crazy the condition being known as paresis perhaps modern antibiotics will include it as curative pneumonia runs about 6 weeks on its own if the patient lives these disease cycles do not hold true when antibiotics are used they take as long to cure as it takes to slam the temperature to subnormal and hold it there until it cant be held any longer 24 to 36 hours is the new cycle for lighter illnesses treated with properly dosed correct antibiotics more serious diseases require longer but mostly because the areas they infect have poorer blood circulation such as bone infections sulfa drugs the oldest antibiotics are the sulfa drugs these are white tablets usually enterovioform for stomach illness is sulfa drug they have very heavy side effect of dizziness and sometimes delusion spiders on the wall 200sulfathiazole is usually now used as powder to pour in open wounds and it and its brother sulfas are the only ones that can be used topically which means as surface treatment as different from internal they follow when taken internally all the rules of antibiotic administration gerontal trade name for watersoluble sulfa is excellent in kidney infections if the rules of antibiotics are followed it needs large quantities you can fall back on sulfa when all else fails sulfas are chemical compounds penicillin penicillin is the first of the antibiotics made from mould as in mouldy bread etc it is the usual antibiotic it is growing less effective due to diseases getting used to it and medical misadministration of it disease treated with an antibiotic which is not cured when communicated to another body becomes able in the new body to resist treatment thus new antibiotics are continually searched for however penicillin is the basic usual antibiotic to use oral penicillin is not only worthless but dangerous in that it has never cured anything yet taking it by mouth doesnt work and i dont know why companies sell it stomach juices kill it penicillin has to be shot with needle procaine penicillin in i cc or 2 cc amounts shot into the buttocks with the person lying down on his face muscles relaxed lasts for 24 hours when 2nd shot is given other types of penicillin can also work this way ordinary penicillin however has to be shot every 3 hours read the literature carefully there is 2nd type g for people allergic to the first type 2 types so one can be used if somebody is allergic to the other if somebody is allergic to it its pretty awful if shot of 24 or 36 hour penicillin hasnt worked in 8 hours to reduce the temperature at least somewhat use some other antibiotic at once penicillin is good even when shot for stomach or bowel complaints like dysentery it is excellent for other types of bacterial infection it is usually good for virus infections other antibiotics chloro____aureo____strepto____compounds are offered under variety of trade names the blank fills mycin or mycetin kemacetin or some such spelling is company trade name for chloro____ chlorofin is almost the same thing read the literature for the strength of each tablet or shot and what it is good for you can puzzle this out even in foreign language follow the literature 201if one doesnt work another will chloro or aureo___handles dysentery stomach and bowel upsets some viruses and lot of other things vitamins b1 should be given when giving antibiotics or the patient gets depressed as all the b1 gets eaten up by antibiotics just as alcohol or sleeping pills eat up b1 100 mg of b1 day is an absolute minimum for person taking antibiotics b2 is vital to give anyone with stomach and bowel complaints whether he is on anti biotics or not vitamin c is excellent for helping colds and infections 250 mg is the usual dose couple times day its much like fruit in that fruit contains lot of it if anyones teeth or gums get sore push in lots of vitamin c so b 1 and c are usual along with antibiotics b1 c and b2 are vital to help clear up stomach and bowel complaints along with antibiotics intestinal bacteria natural

rock on the pcs early timetrack the slam is description of the needle violence meaning it slams back and forth for time all left right motions of the needle were considered and called rockslams until it was found that smooth left right flow was symptom of release or key out and this became the floating needle there is yet another left right motion of the needle called the theta bop this occurs when the person has or is trying to exteriorize theta is the symbol for the person as spirit or goodness bop is an electronic term for slight hitch in the sweep of needle theta bop hitches evenly at each end of the sweep left and right and is very even in the middle of the sweep neither the floating needle nor the theta bop can be confused with rockslam the difference of the rockslam is uneven ragged agitation left and right even the distances traveled left and right are likely to be different in each swing from the last rockslam can be caused sometimes by leaving rings on the pcs fingers or by short circuit in the meter or by the cans electrodes touching something like dress these are the mechanical considerations and must be ruled out before the pc can be considered to have rockslammed if the pc is not wearing rings and if the meter needle is calm with the lead unplugged if the lead is okay and if the pc is not jiggling the ends of the cans against his clothes then the pcs rockslam is caused by the pcs bank one has to be very careful about the correctness of the pc actually having rockslammed while on the meter that it was actually observed that it was not mechanically caused as above one puts the rs down on the worksheet and also gives exactly what was asked and also that the mechanical points were checked without distracting the pc one must always report rockslam in the auditing report note it with session date and page inside the left cover of the pcs folder and report it to ethics including the question or subject which rockslammed phrased exactly why because the rockslam is the most important needle manifestation it gives the clue to the pcs case in 1970 i began fullscale research project into the subject of insanity and its relationship to cases and case gains and suppression it was only then that the full significance of the rockslam was unearthed this research developed into what is now called expanded dianetics series of special processes and actions with their drills and training which permits the auditor to handle specific case type this was by the way mans first system of 206positive detection and handling of psychosis and the first full understanding of what psychosis is while this bulletin is not in any way two minute course in or substitute for full training in expanded dianetics any auditor who audits sec checks or handles people on meter has to know what rockslam is and how it behaves and what he should do about it the first thing is to be able to recognize one and to quickly with the scan of the eye and unplug of the meter cord without any distraction of or notice by the pc make the checks for mechanical rockslam as given above you can make meter rockslam with pc or cord connected to it by turning it on b put the sensitivity at perhaps 2 c put the needle at set d rapidly very rapidly move the ta back and forth maybe quarter of an inch and do it unevenly that if you did it very fast and unevenly would be something that resembled rockslam but matter how fast you made your fingers move real rs is trifle faster if you do that you will see what an rs looks like the needle in this experiment is not made to hit the sides of the meter now if you take the same setup and smoothly slowly move the tone arm back and forth about 2 times second without any roughness and the same distance right and left you will have floating needle note it very well as this comes at time of release and is the thing good auditor hopes to see and gives him the endoff signal for process it has to be well known as you never bypass one in session and to do so makes an uncomfortable pc the pc will often cogniteand get realization about himself or life at this point and one does not stop him from doing this this is the thing you indicate to the pc you dont ever indicate rockslams or theta bops when you see it and without stopping or interrupting the pcs cognition you always say your needle is floating now the theta bop can also be shown to yourself by you set up the meter as above only this time you smoothly swing it to the right and give it tiny twitch in the same direction then you smoothly at once swing it to the left and give it tiny twitch in the same direction then do it to the right and so on this is theta bop it is different than floating needle only in that it hitches at each end of the swing so learn to recognize it there is vicious smooth right direction slash that occurs when pc hits certain area of the bank that is called rocket read and there is of course the small fall long fall which both go to the right and indicate charged question or reaction and there is the gradual rise to the left but these do not repeat back and forth which is the characteristic of the rockslam floating needle and theta bop all right so we know exactly what it looks like when we talk about rockslam as read of the meter we know how it can be mechanically caused and we know what we have to record and report when it is seen but exactly what does rockslam mean with regards to the pc if you dont know this you can miss on the pc on the case on the org and humanity rockslam means hidden evil intention on the subject or question under discussion or auditing two things underlie insanity or to be more specific there are two causes and conditions both of which have been lumped together by man and called insanity he could not of course define it as he didnt know what caused it the first of these two things does not concern us overly much here and is the subject of separate checksheet training and is called pts or potential trouble source handling pts is person who has been or is connected with somebody who has evil intentions pts can 207feel uncomfortable in life or be neurotic or go insane because of the actions upon him of person with evil intentions most of the people in institutions are probable ptses the second of these two things is insanity caused to the individual himself let alone others by hidden evil intentions the extent of these intentions and what the person will do and hide in order to carry them out is quite shocking these people are covert or overt criminals and many of them are insanemeaning beyond all rationality in their acts because their evil intentions are hidden and because they are often very plausible such individuals are what make behavior so mysterious and man looks so evil when you see what mankind does and all sorts of fallacies it is this last type the chronic heavy rockslammer which expanded dianetics handles one rockslam doesnt make psychotic or total menace to everyone but it does mean there could be more and it might in rare cases mean you have seeing enough of these rses very dangerous person on your hands and in your vicinity and that person must be handled by expanded dianetics you wont see great many rockslams in auditing people so you could be totally thrown off by surprise when you see one and mess it all up because you are surprised so know what it is and dont get all quivery and make mistakes and blow your confront just carry on if you dont note the exact question that was asked and the exactly worded statement the pc made when the rs was seen you can muck it up for the expanded dianetics guys they wont be able to get it turned back on again easily and will lose lot of time so you have to be sure your auditing report is accurate that the rs is written big on the column and circled and matter what else you do in the session you have to get it recorded in the left front cover of the folder giving the date and page of the session and you have to report it to ethics and also you dont third party the pc and give him bad time in the session because of it now rses most easily turn on during sec checks or integrity processing or when pulling withholds or trying to investigate something so the people who see these most often are those engaged in that activity and not routine auditing when they can also but more rarely turn on further the most likely person to collide with needing to be sec checked is an rser which again increases the numbers of rses seen in these activities compared to routine auditing but very heavy rser will also turn them on in routine auditing it is the exact point of the rs in the session the exact question that was asked and the exact subject or phrase where the rs turned on that are important and these are very important as then the person can be fully handled with full expanded dianetics rundown by qualified expanded dianetics specialist when of course the person gets to that point on his grade chart the grade chart points are after dianetics like drug rds etc but before grades after grades but before power after power but before solo and after ot iii or after any single grade above ot iii these are the only points where expanded dianetics can be delivered and the rs fully and completely handled now here is how you can turn off an rs and mistakenly think it is handled 1 the overtmotivator sequence has two sides one is what the person has done overt and what is done to the person motivator you can ask when the person rses on something if anyone has ever invalidated him on that subject or action he will find some and the rs will turn off and wont even be faintly handled but only submerged one can believe he had handled the rs not true he has just turned it off and maybe made it harder to find next time one can ask what the person has done to the subject mentioned and while this may unburden the case and make the 208person bit better the rs is not handled only turned off or submerged its almost as if there are so many overts and motivators on this subject or in this area that the pushpull of it makes the needle go wild rs and indeed this may be the energy cause in the bank of the needle reaction but neither overt nor motivator handles an rs finally because the cause of the rs is an intention to harm and it isnt all that likely the basic intention will be reached 2 another apparent way the rs can get handled and isnt is to take the rser earlier similar on the subject of the rs the rs will probably cease go clean but in actual fact it is still there hidden 3 the third way an rs can be falsely handled is to direct the persons attention to something else if when this is done the exact subject of the rs is not noted by the auditor it will be difficult to find it again when the person goes into expanded dianetic auditing 4 yet another and probably the last way to falsely handle an rs is to abuse the person about his conduct or behavior or the rs or to educate him to do better or to modify his behavior with shocks or surgery or other tortures like the psychiatrists do in other words one can seek to suppress the rs in numerous ways maybe the rs wont occur being too overburdened now but it is still there buried very deep and possibly beyond reach now so if you understand the above four points you will see that although you can ease off the rs you have not handled it it has merely gone out of sight all right what then does handle an rs i warned you that this isnt two minute course on expanded dianetics and it isnt an rs is handled by fully qualified expanded dianetics auditor delivering full expanded dianetics to the person at that point on the grade chart where expanded dianetics is supposed to be delivered if anyone thinks it can be done effectively any other way or if he cses it to be done and the auditor is stupid enough to try to do that cs then its committees of evidence and suspended certificates all around with that warning and only with that warning i can briefly state what has to be done with the case this is not what you do if you are not delivering full expanded dianetics at the right point on the grade chart it is brief statement so that you can understand what lies under that rs the pc with an rs on any given subject and who rses while discussing that or related subjects has an evil intention toward the subject discussed or some closely related subject the pc intends that subject or area of life nothing but calculating covert underhanded harm which will be at all times carefully hidden from that subject thus the expanded dianetics specialist in handling that case at the proper point on the grade chart has to be able to locate each and every subject and question and rs in that persons folder as noted by sec checkers and previous auditors or cramming officers or why finders he has to have the complete list of rs subjects if they are noted as to session date and page and if all sec checking papers and cramming papers are in that persons folder then the expanded dianetics specialist can do full and complete job otherwise he has to do lot of other time wasting actions to get the rses found and turned on again what the expanded dianetics specialist actually does is locate exactly the actual evil intention for every rs on the case and handle each one to total conclusion when he is 209finished if he has done his job well the persons behavior will be magically improved and as to his social presence menace and conduct well that will be toward survival when you see an rs if you are not an expanded dianetic specialist doing expanded dianetics at the correct point on the grade chart you dont say hey youve got an evil intention and you dont ask say whats that evil intention or do corny things like that because youll get the pc self listing you may get wrong item you wont know what to do with it and youre just likely to get the auditing room wrapped around your neck right there you quietly note it make sure it isnt mechanical fault write it big on the worksheet write down everything the pc is saying swiftly note what question you were asking and let the pc talk and ack him and go on with what you are doing with the pc at the time and after session you note it in the lefthand cover of the folder and send report to ethics and some day when hes done his drug rundown or gotten to one of the points on the grade chart where full xdn can be done why then it will be handled and good cs will program or tip the case for that to be done so thats the knowhow you have to know about rses to really help the guy and the society and your group were not in the business of curing psychos the governments at this writing pay the psychiatrists billions year to torture and kill because of rses they dont know anything about the crime in the society out there is caused by people who rs stalin hitler napoleon and caesar were probably the most loaded rsers of all time unless it was jack the ripper or your local friendly psychiatrist so know what you are seeing when you see it and know what to do about it and dont kid yourself or vilify or mow down people who rs were not in that business and the expanded dianetic specialist and the pc someday will love you dearly for knowing your job and doing it right l ron

officer issue ii ptssp checksheet pts handling once in while i hear of pts handlings that didnt work or still pts or some such or ill come across such extremes as pts is virtually an incurable leper to be shunned and kept isolated or almost everyone is pts to some degree so what can you really do about it the basic thing to realize is that ptsness like any other case condition afflicting man responds to plain old standard tech but one has to have studied and understood that tech to apply it naturally i recall years ago in handling ptses that none of them at first knew what pts really meant or what it was all about even when they used the term freely so i recently called for pilot to see what would be the effect of study method of curing ptses first pilot before the final pilot was done an earlier pilot was attempted by an aide which was not conducted as laid down cs5 reviewed the failed pilot to find why so many failed on it 4 out of 6 were never completed and the 2 that did failed cs5 reported what i found on these was that they uniformly were not pts in the first place or were pts but that was not the major trouble with the person three of the cases 2 on auditing and i on study were outethics rsing exp dn cases who were trying to use pts as the reason for their behavior thus handling their ptsness would not resolve anything the most interesting case here was the study one who realized that he was not pts and that that had been wrong indication and that what was really wrong with him was that he had bad intentions and was committing overts one of the audited cases had similar realization but has not done as well on post and did get very sick 2 months or so later of the other 3 pilot cases in this first batch one could only come up with intheorg terminals so is another exp dn case and the other 2 assigned to study were severely bugged students so never got off the ground one has now finished the course 4 months later so thats what happened to the original pilot the second pilot was then ordered to determine the original possibility that people could study their way out of being pts second pilot three were put onto the ptssp checksheet to study and three were handled by internes who had done the ptssp checksheet themselves the cases handled by auditinginterview steps completed their handlings within 10 hours the study cases averaged 46 weeks of parttime study two studiers from the original pilot also completed the course all were then watched for bad originations to the examiner medical reports ethics trouble or trouble on post in all cases including those not yet complete on study none of these indicators showed up one case originated case troubles but this turned out to be one of the exp dn cases not ptsness on the study pilot the daily reports and success stories on completion uniformly mention more certainty more stability and being more at cause with the data of particular interest is that three of the participants cogged they were not actually pts yet evidence of real pts sits had 211gotten them on the project but while they were studying they would align past pts handlings they didnt fully understand at the time spot why past pts terminals were correct or incorrect spot terminals who gave them hard time in the past and see why certain people behaved the way they did in short it appears the studiers were blowing charge on their past pts handlings and on terminals in their life almost like an auditing session and while they were saying not pts longer pts now that they had the data is probably closer to the truth all are reported to be doing well on post with illness rollercoaster or ethics trouble the pts handlers who had done the ptssp pack were of particular use where the person had study bug that needed handling before study could be done and assisting in working out the handlings for pts sits that were uncovered also sds and 10 aug hcob handlings and pts interviews are not solo actions and it takes hours not intensives to handle false pts as noted from the first pilot false ptsness must be watched for as unhattedness ignorance of scientology basics for handling life past bad auditing uncorrected as well as unhandled bad intentions and personal outethics can be mistaken for ptsness and wont resolve as ptsness this should be suspected when your ptses start going above 20 of staff and public summary we have had the tech of ptsness for years but it wasnt being fully used and then got mixed in with exp dn ptsness can be handled routinely when the tech is fully known and applied pts person can be brought to cause over his situation through study of the pts tech this is vitally important for staff we can handle and the person himself can handle there is substitute for

quotation marks it has recently been discovered that auditors have been mishandling false ta by assessing with the meter to find what the cause of the false ta is instead of directly checking the pc themselves recent example of this is the false ta checklist hcob 29 feb 72ra revised 23 april 75 was being used by assessment on the meter to try to find the pcs false ta cause the false ta was not remedied as the auditor never even felt the pcs hands never even checked the pcs grip never felt what the pcs hands felt like with cream on them the auditor just checked the lines on the meter and when read was obtained the pc was asked and nothing came of it the false ta now being unhandled due to the auditors confusion caused the pc to be audited over further false ta and drove the pc into desperation i had to jump in and handle this one all i did was check the grip and i found that the can size was way too big and part of the pcs hand the palm cup was not touching the can thus causing the ta to read higher false ta the cans had to be reduced to 1 14 inch diameter aluminum tubing this particular pc was also misapplying hand cream the quantity was incorrect and the way the pc was putting it on was not handling the false ta this pc needed to put vaseline intensive care on extensively then wipe off the hands with kleenex and then put bit more on and rub it all over the hands and ensure that the thumbs were being covered one more factor that messed up the case was the sensitivity was set too high and consequently fns were missed and the ta shot up another example of this was we had pc who constantly had low ta fns upon checking his grip we discovered that he held the cans so tight that it caused his hands to sweat and part of the hand was actually off the cans adjusting the grip handled the false ta this pc then started to cognite that he was really fast pc after all and there was nothing wrong with him we had another interesting one this particular pc crossed her legs and had cans that were too big by having her uncross her legs and recognizing that the can size was off and needed changing to 1 34 diameter aluminum tubing remedied her false ta so you have to watch it make sure that the sensitivity is set correctly for that pc so you dont miss the fns 214none of this was done by auditor assessing list it was done by observing the pcs handling of cans and positions and seeing what it did to ta position the main point here was the auditor thought that false ta was think and would register on the meter that is as silly as asking the meter if you should buy ice cream today or not the meter cant answer when the answer is required of the preclear how the hell would the meter know if the pcs hands were dry or cold the auditor has to feel them touch them check for dryness by feeling them do they feel dry do they feel cold are the pcs feet so cold that circulation gets through do you know without feeling them does the hand cream you are using dry up how do you know without feeling the pcs hands i have known pc to say it hasnt dried up because the pc hated wearing cream and didnt want to put more on so feel the hands dont just ask the pc and then assume that that is it you will mess up cases and wont handle the false ta false ta is in the physical universe it is something that really exists when you start checking for meter reads you are violating this law it is in the physical universe not the pcs think or bank it can badly mess up case to not find the cause of false tas and then carry on with auditing understanding the meter and what the meter reads on and understanding false ta and what causes it are the basics behind finding false ta and remedying it so that the pc can happily continue on with auditing and advance if you think that you have solved false ta yet the pc still has high or low ta fns then you havent solved it at all and you had better roll up your sleeves and get bright and go in there and find it and the way you do this is to check the pc what do the hands feel like what type of clothing is the pc wearing feel for tight clothes dont just take the pcs word maybe they like wearing tight shoes but look at that 45 fn let them wear tight shoes out of session but get rid of those tight shoes in session so you can get an accurate reading meter dont use this to hassle pcs and interject it into sessions whenever you please when you see false ta phenomena note it down and the cs will include it in the program to be handled this is covered in hcob 10 dec 76 fn and ta position there is pc on this planet or any planet that wants to experience overrepair and misery due to false tas you will be doing them great service to handle it for them so they can happily be audited after that dont qa with the pcs

all auditors all supervisors all interneships urgent and important tech correction roundup auditors and scientologists for 27 years have tended to be suspicious of hcobs and policy letters not written by myself until few months ago my opinion was that this while flattering was not entirely justified however these last few months have sharply changed my belief into total agreement with all those who have expressed some fear of reinterpretations of bulletins by others i have been engaged for some months now in roundup of out tech issues and i have found i am sorry to say that mice have been gnawing at the pillars of the bridge putting up traffic barriers and false detour signs i have been finding serious out tech issues and correcting them whether because of misunderstood words the commonest cause of out tech alterations or other reasons there have been staggering number of tech sectors that have been corrupted by issues by others that alterised the corrections i have been doing have been are being or will be issued shortly however not all auditors and scientologists keep pace with current issues and so i am here giving you rapid summary of the gross departures from standard tech which have occurred in the past 3 or 4 years and their corrections so you were right very few people 3 or 4 have wittingly or unwittingly brought about outnesses which could easily make the difference between successful case handling and failed cases action has been taken to handle them and there are great many good people at work now in compiling and reissuing the workable tech which i developed in the first place it is now forbidden to write an hcob or an hco pl and sign my name to it if anyone helped compile it or wrote it my name is followed by assisted by_____ the person who helped get it back together at my directions also board technical bulletin may cancel an hcob so from here on you are relatively safe i am always the first to tell you and this is exception 216tech corrections there follows here long list of incorrect procedures or data found to have been issued also brief rundown of the correct procedure will be found which is the correct and standard tech what makes tech correct when it doesnt get results it is incorrect when it gets the expected result it is correct my own writings and researches are based wholly upon things that got and get results when another through misunderstood words or other reasons interprets or changes the original tech it has been the general experience that results are not obtained by studying this list you may very well find some alterised points which caused you to have trouble or which caused confusion therefore the subjects themselves are described in summary form not all issues are out yet which accomplish full correction their hcob numbers therefore cannot be given some of the issues are not yet released but will be soon however there is reason to deny you the essence of the material and so i am giving you the full list to date i trust this list and hcob restore some stability i hope that any failures you may have had due to alterised materials will be spotted by you and that you will be able to apply some of these right now and get the full materials later i like results you like results and the following may include some of the reasons you may have had hard time with some sessions i am sorry for that i have come back on tech lines especially to correct it and have spent seven months spotting areas where there has been trouble or failures evaluating them and discovering the alteris of original materials and issues in many cases the alteris sure was hidden this completes 7 months of search for tech outnesses here is the list pts handling the first shock which actually began this current search for out tech issues was the discovery that pts conditions were going unhandled across the world and had been for some time pts means potential trouble source and means the person is affected adversely by suppressive in his life pts person can be lot of trouble to himself and to others the condition is not too difficult to handle and to find that all the tech of handling it was in disuse explained why there had been lot of trouble and upset on various lines after great deal of search it was found that pts handling and another rundown the vital information rundown had been restricted only to expanded dianetics thus one would find on pcs programs that they were supposed to go all the way through dianetics and their grades before their pts condition was handled in actual fact person who is pts cannot be audited on anything else until the ptsness has been straightened out this was operating as an effective barrier to cases the first thing you do for pc in any grade or without grades is handle his ptsness 217as long as the subject was hot i decided to look further into it to make sure that the actual tech was still available and to get pilot done to verify its use in actual practice since few had had any pts handling for couple of years i initiated pilot project and it was well executed by cs5 the results of this project are found in hcob 20 oct 1976 the outcome of this further research as contained in that hcob was that the person for full handling should be gotten through his ptsness and then should study the complete pack of ptssp checksheet bpl 31 may 71rc so that he knows the full mechanics that had been wrecking his life this is contained in hco pl of 20 oct 1976 while the above named checksheet is quite adequate project is now in progress to collect up all original lrh case supervisor notes cses and handwritten materials on ptsness so that additional issues may be brought out and the checksheet extended the reason for this is that there is sector of nonaudited handling of ptsness which has never been fully released this comes under the heading of additional material and the existing pts material is not only workable but is vital so this scene was rounded up and ptsness is again being handled successfully over the world as an additional note cassette is now being made for general distribution and sale which will soon be released so that pts people can get one and send it or play it to persons antagonistic to their leading better life b org delivery auditing is technical situation the ability to procure auditing has considerable bearing on peoples case progressnaturally it was found that some organizations were slow in delivery and were backlogging which tends to create auditing situation amongst pcs to remedy this backlog the technical secretary of every org was given new statistic value of services delivered this gives an index of the delivery of the org and brings backlogs into view and will serve as means of alleviating auditing situation in the field where it exists as it calls the fact spectacularly to the attention of all management local and international this is hco pl 12 nov 76 along with this another situation came to view which again was matter of other people writing hcobs the director of processing had been given in hcob 16 june 1972r statistic which encouraged him to simply route pcs out of the org once they had completed small part of their processing accordingly the statistic of the director of processing in an org was revised in hcob 16 june 1972ra to the number of pcs routed back into the lines the director of tech services was given stat of getting actions completed on pcs with these two stats operating one after the other auditing situation in an area is further alleviated 218people do not sufficiently consider auditing as the most basic failure of cases it seems so of course that it gets entirely overlooked yet it can cause great deal of trouble c hsdc redo the first inkling that the hubbard standard dianetics course curriculum had gone adrift was noticing that two key drills had been omitted and even cancelled by others even though they were vital to an auditors skill in handling dianetic session these drills were dianetic training drills 101 102 103 and 104 these have to do with student auditors remembering their commands in session making him practiced in using commands while handling his meter and admin training him to use the right command in the right place according to what the pc does and finally training him to use commands and handle the session in spite of any and all distractions or reactions from pc obviously if dianetic auditor cannot do these things he cannot run dianetic session these drills now have been emphatically reinstated in hcob 19 july 1969r reissued 9 dec 1976 they are for use in all dianetic training looking into this further i found that there was new unauthorized dianetics course which supposedly was based on dianetics today being issued which would be sort of competitive course to an hsdc in following this further it was found that even the most fundamental formats of the hsdc which i personally developed and piloted had been grossly alterised that number of persons had been writing hcobs on the subject and that the format had been lost the original hsdc is being gathered together at this time with all instructions cses and drills in the pattern and format which was originally developed and which did make great auditors so you can expect considerable resurgence in the quality of dianetic auditing some time in the future at the same time new course which makes senior dianetic auditor is being put together which is postgraduate step after person has become an hsdc this will take in all the materials found in dianetics today and should cover areas of special dianetic application d rock slams rock slam rs is defined as crazy irregular slashing motion of the needle this particular meter reaction was found to be relatively unknown to auditors on an examination i made of some worksheets they were calling dirty needles dirty reads rocket reads body motion and even ticks as rses they were also missing real rses as the rs is probably the single most important and dangerous read on the meter clarifications of this were in order accordingly i wrote hcob 10 aug 1976 rses what they mean and caused to be written from my notes hcob 1 nov 1974r rock slams and rock slammers for pc to be branded as an rser is very serious thing also for real rser to be overlooked by an auditor is catastrophe both to the pc and to those around that particular person therefore this is very dangerous ground to have wrong these issues will help to clarify that 219at the same time im currently at work on video tape which will be available in academies some time in the future which gives all meter reads meanwhile dont make any mistakes on rses read those bulletins another confusion in this sector was how to define and identify list 1 rser all characteristics given in list issued as hcob 1 nov 74 and signed by another with my name were stated to have to be present before person was list 1 rser the incorrect hcob is on page 344 vol viii of the hcob volumes and will be corrected in later editions list 1 refers to scientology related terminals as found on page 57 of the book of emeter drills the additional characteristics on this list only help to look for list 1 rs i issued hcob 1 nov 1974r revised 30 dec 1976 which now corrects this error list 1 rser is simply one who rses on list 1 sec checking and integrity processing following down the trail of auditors missing rses it was found that sec checking had become nearly lost art sec checking means unfortunately security checking that it was so misnamed in its origins obscures the fact that confessionals have been part and parcel of religion nearly as long as religion has existed in actual fact the meter simply gets pastor or minister over the very dangerous situation of missing withhold on his parishioner person with missed withhold can become very upset with the person who misses it the meter properly operated makes sure that none are missed in an effort to get around what was thought to be public relations scene the name security checking was changed to integrity processing this was also pr error because the actual truth of the matter is it originated as confessional and should have simply been changed back to handling of confessions this administrative demand of name alteration threw the original issues on sec checking into disuse additionally integrity processing did not include all the tech of sec checking and some even thought they were different subjects the loss of sec checking more properly called confessionals and the failure to use meter to verify withholds resulted in many student blows dropouts and has permitted the continuance of great deal of natter and upset which are simply the result of missing withholds on people when you realize that lot of the trouble of the roman catholic church probably arose through not having meter to verify the completeness of confessionals you can see what the loss of sec checking would do to our own churches and organizations in other words we were about to repeat history all this original sec checking properly confessional tech is being rounded up again and will be issued in checksheet form and there will be courses in the handling of 220confessionals but even before you receive these you should resume the use of this metered tech as it will save you having people mad at you simply because you have missed withholds on them it is highly selfprotective both from the viewpoint of the auditor and the organization to have the proper metered handling of confessionals fully in btb 31 aug 1972ra hco confessional procedure clarified the matter but this bulletin was on very limited distribution and is not known it contains the tech i developed on sec checking in the autumn of 72 there should be further confusion in this matter sec checking integrity processing and confessionals are all the exact same procedure and any materials on these subjects is interchangeable under these titles the materials when all recollected and consolidated and reissued will be under the title of confessionals but even before that reaches you you had better determine to become an expert in it since an auditors inability to handle this is fast route to how to win enemies and wrongly influence people f expanded dianetics overhaul expanded dianetics began in development in 1970 it is very fully developed subject however for some reason or another the total materials of expanded dianetics were never packaged and exported even when it was reported that they had been thus auditors who have been trained as expanded dianetics auditors had been denied considerable key materials and have even lost the reason for expanded dianetics contributing to this was the removal of sec checking confessionals materials from the expanded dianetics course to make up the integrity processing rundown thus the course was stripped even further for an expanded dianetics auditor has to be very expert in the handling of confessionals the actual extent of expanded dianetics can be described as follows ex dn consists of all the work i did on psychos and very difficult cases from 1970 forward my cses case histories any tape lectures or notes which includes as well all data known to date on confessionals and all data on ptses the product of the course is an auditor who can handle psychos rsers and any persons evil intentions as well as any ptses that would be the full extent and skill of an expanded dianetics auditor there is considerable data connected with the subject and it is the only data proven workable data man has on the subject of neurosis and psychosis and is the first breakthrough made in this field as to its actual cause this also embraces criminality while we are very far from being in the business of handling psychos not all psychos are in institutions or classified as psychos in this society furthermore pts persons become pts to people who are usually psycho thus this whole scope and breadth of expanded dianetics has to be and is being recompiled and issued furthermore the position of expanded dianetics on the grade and class chart was muddied up actually expanded dianetics can be given after drug rundown after standard dianetics after scientology grades after power after ot iii and at any point upwards after completion of grade ot iii 221a pts rundown can be given without regard to whether the person had had expanded dianetics or not pts rundown can be given anywhere and better had be an auditor is trained on expanded dianetics after he has become an hsdc class iv auditor an auditor does not have to be an expanded dianetics auditor in order to deliver pts rundown all he has to do is complete the pts checksheet and should be class iv in order to audit it there are even some portions of the pts checksheet particularly as it would be revised which can be delivered by person who is not trained as an auditor at all but this would be nonaudited handling which consists mainly of coaching the person as to how to handle his scene the complete expanded dianetics tech is as i have said being recompiled issued and gotten back in g word clearing having discovered an executive who had been word cleared by word clearer but who then required more than 4 12 hours to clear the first two pages of the same material when handled by higher classed auditor i investigated the extent of word clearing training and use being out study of the word clearing series was ordered and it was found that there was little concentration on metering and trs these seem to have been slighted because word clearing starts with the phrase i am not auditing you and this apparently has been taken to mean that one didnt have to know his meter and trs in order to word clear hcob 10 january 1977 word clearing series 55 how to win with word clearing is result of this investigation and should be given particular importance another factor was spotted and is handled in board technical bulletin 12 january 1977 revised 16 january 1977 which was issued as result of my having found that word clearers had wrong stat the stat of well done auditing hours would not apply to word clearer their stat is now number of misunderstood words honestly found and fully handled in applicable materials another action is found in hco policy letter 10 january 1977 ethics and word clearing wherein any word clearer who word cleared materials on which misunderstoods have been found at later date shall be summoned to court of ethics the phrase i am not auditing you does not excuse ignorance on the word clearers part of meter or poor command of trs of course this must also include his knowledge of word clearing tech his trs and metering must be excellent the marvelous wins that can be gotten with word clearing had been lost and with this should now be recovered h fn ta position the subject of missing fns floating needles on pcs is very important as pc who has had an fn missed becomes overrun and can be very upset and his case can even be stalled the first instance i ran into of this some years ago had to do with the sensitivity setting on the meter most auditors apparently simply would set sensitivity knob on 5 and leave it there regardless of how the pc advanced and regardless of who they were auditing this would give them extremely wide fns which would hit the pin on one or both sides and hang 222up as they were unable to keep the needle on set the correct way to go about this is to always set the sensitivity knob by pc can squeeze when the pc squeezes the cans the sensitivity knob should give about third of dial drop more less only in that way can you keep needle on the set mark on the dial otherwise fns get missed some pcs have to go up to 128 32 which is front face meter setting to get such fall on can squeeze and i have just noted pc who had such wide fn swing that the sensitivity had to be set at 1 32 which is about as low as the meter can go without turning off and even then this pc got half dial can squeeze fall and so had to be watched very carefully so that fns were not missed i mention this in case it has dropped out again the current discovery which just dropped with clang was that in one interneship an interne supervisor was using verbal tech which had then spread all over the world to the effect that you must not call an fn an fn unless it were between 2 and 3 on the tone arm dial and that any fn type motion which occurred with the ta above 3 or below 2 could not possibly be called an fn this was his own craziness and he wished it off with bunch of verbal tech on an awful lot of auditors and caused an enormous amount of pcs subsequently to be very unhappy the result and remedy of this is contained in hcob 10 december 1976 which is marked urgent and important it is marked that way because apparently there are very few pcs around right now who havent had fns missed on them this hcob should be very carefully studied however in brief the correct procedure for out of range above 3 or below 2 fns is 1 look at the pcs indicators 2 call the fn regardless of its range if the indicators are alright 3 mark down the actual ta position when the fn is indicated 4 handle the false ta at the earliest opportunity when it will not intrude into the current cycle of auditing 5 on any pc you suspect has had his fns disregarded because of false ta you cs for and get run repair and rehab of points in his auditing when fns were missed on him in other words have your sensitivity correct and when an fn occurs outside of the range between 2 and 3 know that it is an fn by the needle motion and by the pc s indicators and call it indicate it and put it down on the worksheet note the actual ta position then before the next session or after you have finished crucial cycle of auditing on the pc in the next several sessions go into the whole subject of his false ta and handle it missing an fn is very cruel on pc because it invalidates his having released the charge on the subject on which he is being audited and tends to tell him that he is not better even though he feels better there is one historic case of an auditor having gotten an fn in the first ten minutes of auditing and then because it occurred slightly above 3 auditing the pc for an additional three hours with the ta climbing the pc unhappy and results being obtained from the processing this sort of thing is pretty gruesome verbal tech is substitute for hcobs i false ta 223having written the hcob just above telling auditors that they call the fn regardless of where it was providing the pcs indicators were ok and then handle the ta on the pc i found that issues on correcting false ta had been messed up in both hcob 29 feb 1972r revised 23 nov 1973 and its successor hcob 29 feb 1972ra revised 23 apr 1975 careless reading could imply that the false ta checklist was audited on the pc like any other prepared list in other words this idiocy set in that the meter reads were going to be used to divine whether or not the meter knew whether or not the pc was responding properly the list actually is list of things the auditor manually mechanically checks on the pc he does not consult reads and he does not assess anything on the pc he simply personally does checklist and this was the checklist it was not assessed to find reading item therefore an auditor trying to correct false ta and get the ta to read between 2 and 3 by using meter to assess the list would never find out what was going on and would be unable to get the meter into that position accordingly hcob 13 jan 1977 was directed to be written and the full and entire checklist to be done by the auditor on the pc recompiled and updated it is being issued as hcob 21 jan 1977 therefore it will now be very easy for an auditor to correct the false ta on pc and he will be able to get the meter tone arm properly between 2 and 3 you know dont you that ta goes up more than division when you start using onehand electrode this is not false ta that you can correct solo auditors using just one hand have their tas riding around 37 and 45 on the tone arm this is not case of false ta it is always checked by using both hands on the cans at the start and end of session but here again false ta can occur if the hands are too dry or too wet or the can size is wrong you shouldnt have very much trouble with this actually its very simple matter but the outnesses in this sector have caused an awful lot of trouble and i was very happy to be able to find the erroneous issues and get it straight for you video which will eventually become available in academies will also cover false ta handling j incomplete auditing folders for some time word clearers sec checkers ethics officers and cramming officers have neglected to include their worksheets in the pcs actual folder this causes considerable difficulty for case supervisor since the person may have wrong lists in why finding may have rsed on sec check may have had incomplete or incorrect word clearing and other tech outnesses in between regular sessions where these folder omissions occur an feser folder error summary maker is often prevented from finding where the case went wrong then there is the matter of folders at all somebody has lost them or mislaid them yet some auditor needs them desperately to find out lists or to actually verify grades attained the preservation and availability of auditing folders to the next auditor or case supervisor years up the track is of very great importance accordingly hco pl 28 oct 1976 and hcob 28 oct 1976 cs series 98 which are both the same equal texts were written by to remedy these very dangerous tech outnesses k falsifying auditor reports 224along with missing reports it was found that there had been some difficult situations created by the falsification of auditing reports from the small matter of saying that the ta was at 30 when actually is at 45 when the fn occurred thus obscuring the fact that false ta had to be handled up to the very large crime of faking the fact that certain processes had been run when they had not just to get completion or bonus and up to falsifying the data or text which the pc gave this matter of false auditor reports can cause enormous amounts of trouble the consequences and detection of the falsification of auditing reports is now contained in hco policy letter 26 oct 1976 issue 1 the same text issued as hcob 26 oct 1976 issue 1 cs series 97 this makes even the minor falsification of an auditing report matter of comm ev and if the crime is proven beyond reasonable doubt there can result cancellation of all certificates and awards declare and an expulsion order if you think this is unnecessarily harsh think of the poor pc l checklist for fesers it can happen that pc is taken up into new grades without having completed earlier more basic grades and without being set up for the later grade this can result in somebody going through several grades just to cure mild somatic or ptp it can also throw pc in over his head for long time there have been checklists showing the requirements for most major grades recent instance of pc going all the way through to ot iii who had not completed anything caused to investigate the reasons behind this it was discovered that very few case supervisors ever check folder to find out if the pc has actually made the grades lower than the one that he is about to be put on further check showed that few cses ever looked up the earlier history of the case and this resulted in pcs being put up through levels for which they have not been set up and past levels they have not made further investigation showed that these checklists were not in existence for every grade and action it became obvious that the people who should be using these checklists would be the folder error summary auditors these fesers are the only ones who thoroughly go through the folders and case supervisors depend on them thus if the feser is not required to verify whether the pc has properly attained the level he is about to go onto and if he has been set up for the level then nobody is going to check this over and great many pcs are going to be audited on skipped gradients without setups and will get into difficulty i have ordered that checklists be made up for fesers to use for each major grade so that they can check off the requisites for each grade and thus handle this out gradient situation these checklists are being worked on at this time and will be issued in the near future in the meantime it is the duty of the feser to indicate whether or not the pc has actually reached each grade to which he has attested and whether or not he is properly set up for the grade he is about to be embarked upon m auditor recovery 225it can happen here and there that an auditor who has been auditing eases off and ceases to audit there are various reasons for this one of the common ones is skipped gradient in his training another one is misunderstood words and the commonest one is overts of omission or commission on the subject of auditing or pcs which have not been handled an lrh ed 176rb int originally issued on 24 april 1972 was unfortunately revised 2 or 3 times by other people and lost its punch i reworked this and restored it to its earlier form on 7 nov 1976 and this is available as lrh ed 176rb int the investigation and reissue being assisted by cs7 it is available in this form and in the near future will be issued as an hcob n study tech during an investigation of pricing i discovered that the student hat had disappeared from use and in its place had been put an optional basic study manual the fact is that the basic study manual has its own uses and is very valuable but it does not begin to replace the student hat this meant actually that study tech had more or less disappeared in academies and was not in general use the actions taken were to make the student hat mandatory on onetime basis before the next major course person took and to include it free as bonus to the person taking that course the student hat has been restored in totality as requisite for study tech this will make study much more positive and much faster the basic study manual was put forward sometime ago as means of getting staffs hatted on their hat materials and as fast method of getting people reading the materials of their posts i suppose that is how it drifted over onto major courses where it has business thus the student hat is back full force and if there are any blown students around you should realize that the reason for their blow is either lack of study tech or undisclosed overts the thing to do is to get them back and push them through the student hat so they can win at their studies and get their overts off so they can look their fellow man in the eye there has been another training outness found which i will mention in passing in some interneships the entire qual staff of the org has been employed in checking out students actually such checkouts are done by the students themselves on each other where starrates are required in interneships it has also been found that twinning on theory occasionally creeps back in people have not noticed that twinning on theory meaning two students always study together went out many years ago and has been cancelled it makes noisy classroom and prevents students from getting through their courses rapidly twinning on theory sets up too many difficulties such as the loss of ones twin by reason of graduation or transfer being sent to cramming an odd number of people on the course so that one is without twin and so on practical is another matter in practical drilling is done on the twin basis the theory and practical are never in the same room they must be in different rooms the theory room must be very very quiet where student can concentrate and the practical room 226must be so situated as to allow students to make noise if any academy has noisy theory classroom or if the academy is difficult to study in this is probably what is in violation probably the twinning is going on in theory or the theory rooms are noisy only practical room can be made noisy the two issues putting twinning in on theory have now been revised and cancelled they are hcob 26 nov 71 tape course series 10 wcing series 26 handling misunderstood words on tape recorded materials which has been revised and cancelled by

practical actions elsewhere and also dont hang up people on theory because they lose their twins practical twins are highly interchangeable professional rates it was found in some cases that pcs would enroll on courses and then never take them just so they could have professional rates in their auditing this not only denied them the training they paid for but it was also making organizations short of auditors accordingly hco pl 13 nov 1976 was issued which clarified professional rates which makes it necessary for an auditor to be fully classed in the class of that org from which he is seeking service in order to qualify for 50 professional discount in auditing this does not apply to his family whats the matter with becoming an auditor there are 2 or 3 billion pcs out there and only few of us auditors have heart and also lend hand furthermore how do you know what good auditing is unless youre trained p senior case supervisor line it was recently found that the senior case supervisor in at least one large org spent most of his time giving advice to executives on personnel case requirements for the crew this is so far from the duties of snr cs that the hco pl outlining their duties has been rewritten and has become hco pl of 26 sept 1974r revised and reissued 21 jan 1977 which tells snr cs in effect to look after the tech quality in his org there is another modification on snr case supervisors previously it was necessary for someone to go to distant org and become class viii before he could be qualified as the snr case supervisor of an org this is longer necessary hco pl 24 oct 76 issue iii modifies these requirements so that snr case supervisor can be trained by his local org in this same policy letter the award of dean of technology is outlined these would be gold certificate case supervisors they are saint hill special briefing course class viii course auditors who have attained the case level to the class of his org and has uniform record of case supervision this general overhaul of the snr case supervisor and his lines and duties is in effort to correct out tech and establish excellent tech in any org and its area 227q interneships it was found that very few interneships were now being taught and an investigation undertaken by the action aide flag bureau at my orders finally uncovered that interneship checksheets had been added to and added to and stirred about until they had become checksheets within checksheets thus making interneships interminable as result of this special mission was put on the job of reforming interneship checksheets these checksheets have now been issued and exist for every level as board policy letters issued from 10 nov 76 up through bpl 25 nov 76 issue 1 they have been greatly simplified and have made interneships into very worthwhile actions these new simplified interneship checksheets are in full use at this time along with this interneship program hco policy letter of 25 oct 1976 has been issued which requires that all past provisional certificates which have not been validated by an interneship and which are one year or more old from the date of course completion are cancelled it states such students should be notified and should be enrolled on the interneship for the class if properly conducted interneship is satisfactorily completed their permanent certificate may be reissued all of this is in an effort to get auditors straightened out getting wins and making them really proficient and professional in all areas of the world r illegal pcs it has occasionally happened that an auditor has had pushed off on him by persuasion or pressure cases who should not have been accepted by the org hcob 6 dec 1976 also hco pl 6 dec 76 identical texts make this high crime certain types of cases may not therefore be forced off on auditors by anyone and anyone seeking to force such pc upon an auditor against policy is actionable by committee of evidence s expanded grades being redone it has been found that some processes were left out of expanded grades 0 to iv and that in some cases these grades had been quickied therefore all expanded grades checklists are being reissued and will contain more extensive processes until you have the new expanded grades checklists the ones you are using are still ok t repair list revised through an oversight an incomplete board technical bulletin 11 aug 1972ra revised 18 dec 1974 cs series 83ra was included on page 230 of volume x of the hcob volumes far more extensive writeup lrh ed 257 int of 1 dec 1974 existed which gave much more data and many more prepared lists as repair tools for the auditor the lrh ed has now been issued as hcob of 24 oct 1976 cs series 96 delivery repair lists 228although this issue has been updated to some degree there are still one or two repair lists omitted therefore this is about to be issued again as cs series 96r which will include the additional and valuable lists u routing forms and staff statuses it has been found that staff status 0 1 11 sea org products 0 1 11 and org routing forms were not in full agreement with one another this is taking lot of straightening out and is very much in need of it as in one major org it was found to be impossible for new staff member to route onto post this is under full coordination rewrite and will be issued in the near future v staff section officer i have for some time been concerned about the lack of care some orgs had been giving their own staff members as result hco pl 22 may 1976 was issued which established the post of staff section officer who was responsible for the training and the processing of staff members to further enforce this the qual divisions of orgs were given new gross divisional statistic in hco pl of 4 nov 1976 this gave the dominant qual divisional statistic as fully qualified and trained staff members in the org cumulative additionally in hco pl of 10 nov 1976 certain staff courses were made mandatory in orgs so as not to neglect staff cases even when auditors were absent whole new project has been released concerning coaudits this is actually recovery of lost tech there used to be coaudits very successful ones and they had their own special technology tech mission to the uk reassembled the tech and got staff coaudits going with rave wins all of this technology and how it is done has been issued as board technical bulletins dated around early december 1976 under the title of coaudit series both the coaudit tech and group processing fell under the category of lost tech but have been restored polished up and are being issued for full use w unissued rundowns it came to my attention in july of 76 that about 5 years worth of my developments on flag had never been fully packaged up or issued for use the reason for this is that the tech compilations units which had previously worked on this were disbanded in 1972 by the then cs4 and was not reestablished several years worth of intensive research and development are therefore backlogged in being issued 229only one of these areas of development is restricted to flag as it is the famous l series of rundowns which require such technical accuracy that they can only be audited by class xii the rest of the rundowns however are fully capable of being fully compiled from the notes lectures issues and my case supervision notes and released including the repackaging necessary for the hsdc expanded dianetics and reissue of expanded grades all mentioned above there were 9 rundowns in all which were never compiled or exported for that matter the much earlier class vial course was added to and varied and it also is being repackaged in its original form and exported and is now being taught again in advanced orgs the remaining rundowns are being worked on for issue as never having seen the light of day in class iv saint hill and advanced orgs all this is now being done so soon this important new tech will appear and be available in orgs x advanced grades for number of years people have wondered when ot viii would be released well to tell you the honest truth ot viii has been in existence all those several years and to it has been added very large number of ot grades none of them have been issued notes for all these grades are in existence what i have been waiting for is 2 or 3 months of free time to go over these materials and write them up and make them available through advanced organizations now i will make bargain with you if you get all the tech straightened out and the orgs and flaps and emergencies off my lines and get your training in and your word clearing in and everything flying and this civilization even more thoroughly pointed in civilized direction you will buy those 3 months worth of time so i will be able to afford the time to write up all these advanced levels i have researched do your job well and buy these three months is it bargain lrhactlfnt l ron hubbard copyright

scs hcos hases sec checkers cs series 100 case supervisors staff section officers jokers and degraders it is an old principle that people who do not understand something occasionally make fun of it recent investigation however into the backgrounds and case condition of small handful of people who were joking about their posts and those around them showed somewhat more sinister scene each of these persons fell into one or more of the following categories 1 were rock slammers some list 1 2 were institutional type cases 3 were ncg meaning case gain the only cause of which is continuous present time overts 4 were severely pts potential trouble source connected to rock slammers it might be supposed that misunderstood word phenomena could also be part of this the rebellious student in universities is usually handled by clearing up his misunderstoods or curing his hopelessness for his future however the investigation did not find that any of these jokers or degraders were acting that way solely because of misunderstood words but the possibility cannot be ruled out the four categories above were however fully verified all the persons investigated were found to be the subject of declining statistics both having them and causing them their areas were enturbulated at least one of the jokers was physically driving basic course students out of an org in some cultural areas wit and humor are looked upon as healthy release however in the case of orgs this was not found to be the case intentional destruction of the org or fellow staff members was the direct purpose therefore all executives hco personnel and case supervisors as well as qual personnel and staff section officers have valuable indicator where they have joker or degrader on their hands they also have one or more of the above four conditions in that person this opens the door to handling such people properly assigned and then fully done conditions are the correct ethics handlings 232correctly done expanded dianetics which includes confessionals and fully done pts handlings are the case remedies where ethics tech itself is not known or neglected and where there are hcos one can of course not expect the matter to be handled and this would be too bad because the case gain and life improvement available in proper ethics handlings when fully followed through can be quite miraculous where rock slammers have been undermining the tech and it is not fully known or used or is altered into unworkability one cannot expect confessionals to be properly done or expanded dianetics to be known and properly applied the joker is advertising his symptoms he is also advertising an area of the org where there is enturbulation and down statistics as well as staff members being victimized therefore this is an administrative and technical indicator which cannot be overlooked and should be followed up spotted investigated and handled this can be the beginning of an upward spiral for an organization where someone is driving ethics out tech is not likely to go in you have to get in ethics and tech before you can begin to get in admin the next time you as an executive wonder why you are working so hard look for the joker in the deck humor is one thing destroyed orgs and human beings are quite something else it is our business to get the show on the road and get the job done l ron

individual versus the society or his family its what people would consider reprehensible that makes withhold in catholic society not having kept mass would be reprehensible action in noncatholic society nobody would think twice about it so most of our confessionals are aimed at transgressions against the mores of the group that is the basic center line of the confessional you can have special mores between the and the mother special mores between the husband and the wife just as you have special mores of course between the auditor and the preclear its moral code that you are processing in one way or the other you are straightening out somebody on moral code the now im supposed tos theyve transgressed on series of now im supposed tos having so transgressed they are now individuated if their individuation is too obsessive they snap in and become the terminal all of these cycles exist around the idea of the transgression against the now im supposed tos that is what confessional clears up and that is all it clears up its great deal more than withhold you would go straight to persons handling of masses and changes of space on lacking clue in that direction you would go into

hidden standard is he would get about more could he find himself getting about more he would know that scientology was working you find what area he was in before he was twenty staying in the house is cure for something so you put him on an emeter you cant find areas of moving heavy masses or changes in spaces before he was twenty because he wasnt working it probably lies in the zone of maybe he was in the service maybe he was in boarding school 235so all of sudden you hit the jackpot and you find an area of considerable activity youre looking for the area of considerable activity which lies prior to the difficulty then you run confessional on that area of activity you trace it back to boarding school theres one boarding school that he absolutely detests he suddenly remembers thats what you do the confessional on every question you ask has to do with this boarding school just add up the factors how many things can go on in boarding school how many people are present what is there in boarding school there are students boys instructors coaches headmasters buildings athletic equipment and probably transport from there to home etc find out all the types of crimes that he might have been able to commit against these items you can dream up whole form one of the ways of doing it is taking an existing confessional form and just moving it over to the zone of the school that is not as satisfactory as just putting down all the things he really did in this school that he is never going to tell anybody it inevitably is going to be an area of tight mores he has cut up against those mores so has individuated himself against the school so he cannot asis any part of the track hes trapped in that particular zone and activity any set of cut sensory perception will operate as overt bait forget is version of not know so that any sensory perceptive cut off is an effort not to know and you have target take everything that youve worked up to right there and now do confessional on it eventually youll get what do you know hes too in the thing to see it you can see it because youre outside of it you write up every noun you could possibly think of on the subject of the zone or dynamic that he is having difficulty with and which he fails to cognite on in any way shape or form you can immediately assume that if he doesnt cognite on that zone or area that hes really pinned down and that he has withholds from you and from the area on the subject of the area that not even he knows cognition is totally dependent upon the freedom to know overts and withholds are dedicated to another thing these are dedicated to not knowingness so if the person doesnt cognite you can immediately assume that he has large area of not knowingness on the subject that he doesnt even suspect you as an outsider to his case can suspect where this fellow is having trouble you dream up confessional to match it the formula for making up confessional is just make up list of all the items you can think of which have anything to do with that target lets say his family hes always had family trouble you can get this from pcs ptps if you look at the type of ptp that the pc has youll know that it is present time problem of long duration if it adds up to three or four times in row of ptps with his family it must be problem of long duration the hottest way to get rid of that particular zone is to do confessional on it again the way to do confessional is to make list of all the nouns and all the doingnesses which you can think of and just ask the person if he has overts against any of them has he done anything to has he interfered with anything about eg have you ever interfered with schooling have you ever done anything to schooling have you ever prevented schooling its little by little that this cognition will take place its not all going to take place in one bang 236in the long run it will be bang but the bang only took place because you took the pebbles off the top when youve finally got the thing uncoveredhe can look at it and blow it this is the rule any zone or activity with which person is having difficulty in life or has had difficulty with in life is fruitful area for confessional you will find out every time hes got withholds in that zone or area one of the indicators of that is present time problem therefore you know its problem of long duration three problems of short duration equals one problem of long duration its good detector mechanism the rule in confessionals is break the problem down to its most fundamental expression then write down those nouns associated with it and those basic doingnesses associated with the fundamental expression and then just phrase your confessional questions on the basis have you ever and any other verb you want to put in have you ever done anything to have you ever prevented you dont have to be fancy as the needles going to fall every time you come close to it any area where person is having difficulty in he is stupid in stupidity is not knowingness this is through overts but the overt has to be hidden so it must be an overt that is withheld so these withholds then add up to stupidity and he of course has

revisions in this type style more on drugs drug users are apparently sitting on the idea that if youre numb nothing can hurt you and its probably defense against the physical universe thats probably why objectives pull them out of it drugs are an impression of fear on the physical universe and what it might do to person that is why objectives work it reassures them they arent going to get bit thats the ambition of the drug culture there are several more sensible ways of handling the same problem the first of these is exteriorization one exteriorizes before the impact yet drugs often make it impossible to exteriorize second way is to simply control the nerves so they dont transmit third is not to be in such protest against pain as it increases the intensity of the thing it is fact that pain is sort of havingness and if person is processed on wasting and having pain he finds it is just another sensation and he can have it and doesnt need these other remedies and that it is not that much of problem there are other unwanted sensations that drugs block off but there is whole sector of desirable sensations and drugs block off all sensations in spite of the propaganda to the contrary even sexual sensation is blocked off with drugs and this is true even after drugs have apparently heightened it for one or two times after that it is dead dead dead the only brief that can be held out for drugs is that they give short quick oblivion from immediate agony and permit the handling of person to effect repair but even then this is applicable to persons who have other system to handle their pain dexterity ability and alertness are the main things that prevent getting into painful situations and primary target of these all vanish with drugs so drugs set you up to get into situations which are truly disastrous and keep you that way one has choice between being dead with drugs or being alive without them drugs rob life of the sensations and joys which are the only reasons for living anyhow lrhgidr l ron hubbard copyright 1978 founder by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 243hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 1 december 1978

needless stops for the person who has made dianetic clear it will also help handle the person who hasnt made it so that he may achieve all the gains available to him unacknowledged dianetic clears person who has reached the state of dianetic clear without it being acknowledged can run into difficulties afterwards you may find that hes been in ethics trouble or had low oca or poor case gain since that point its not only lack of acknowledgement but also invalidation by running certain processes that clear wouldnt respond to such as engrams or continuing to run the grades or continuing goals processing etc also with clears and ots who went clear before they did the clearing course and never knew it or spotted it bypassed charge results because they are running something which is trying to achieve what they have already achieved it serves as an overrun in the case where pc has this unacknowledged invalidated dianetic clear state you would most likely find point in his auditing where it looks as if he had made it and slump occurred afterwards this point could have occurred many years back if you dont see resurgence of the state in an interview or session when the pc mentions when he went dianetic clear the cs would be to datelocate it ref hcob 15 nov 78 dating and locating ethics the fact that person may currently be in ethics trouble is basis on which to adjudicate whether or not he has achieved the state of clear it is not criterion to be used to refuse to allow the person to attest clear is clear when clear is audited on r3ra when the state is invalidated or goes unacknowledged he can get into trouble so apply this to your understanding and analysis of cases 245the maa interview and to j check on the dianetic clear routing form is not to imply hes outethics but will furnish the cs with data on the case which may or may not come up in d of p interview it will also detect the rare case where the person is attempting to attest in order to save money or for status reasons in one instance it was discovered that the person routing through was actually plant these last examples are very very small percentage of the cases meter phenomena when the state of dianetic clear has been acknowledged and any inval cleaned off the line youll see very floppy needle at low sensitivity an fn that nothing can break up and in many cases floating ta low sensitivity setting i to 4 will be needed to even keep the needle on the dial and the ta will be riding between 20 and 30 youll find in many cases that the meter now reads on the pcs postulatesie clears postulates read as surge read therefore does not mean invariably yes or that the question is charged can read if the pc says it or thinks it to himself as an answer to question ref hcob 18 april 68 needle reactions above grade iv bear in mind that you might not get the above meter phenomena immediately on dianetic clear where the state has been bypassed even though the state is valid in some cases the ta and needle can be packed up prior to datelocate of the exact time the pc went clear the pc may have outint to be handled the handling of outint on dianetic clear is the end of

of dianetic clear and keyedout clear in hcob 24 sep 78 iss iii dianetic clear replace the definitions in the tech dictionary the person who attested to dianetic clear or keyedout clear in past years would not necessarily qualify as dianetic clear now though the chances are good he did make it any pc who has attested to dianetic clear or keyedout clear in the past should be called in for an interview and any necessary csing to ascertain the state this must be adjudicated by an ao cs or by an org cs who is clear you will find that many of those who attested to dianetic clear earlier on actually did make it and after confirmation of this they will need to be issued clear certs and clear numbers and be properly programmed to move on up the bridge see hcob 1 dec 78 programming the dianetic clear for his next step additionally where the cs knows of case where it looks very likely from folder study that the pc went dianetic clear but it was unsuspected at the time and never originated he should have such pcs also called in for confirmation the person who hasnt made it 246where it is obvious that person who has already been allowed to attest hasnt attained dianetic clear give the pc good rfactor that the person handling the attest cycle didnt have all the data he must also be given the rfactor that he is being programmed so as not to be denied any of the gains on the grade chart and so that he will be adequately prepared to do the ot levels the cs then programs the case so that this can occur and the pc is informed he should continue with his auditing program in the case where the person wanting to attest clearly hasnt made it you tell him so there may be some state he did achieve that he may wish to attest to and he should be allowed to do so in both the above cases the person very likely has made some big gain or achieved new ability so validate that and give him an appropriate acknowledgement on his win next step for dianetic clears use hcob 1 dec 78 programming the dianetic clear for his next step as guide when programming the dianetic clear for his next action summary keep in mind that good percentage of the cases you see who by origination want to attest to dianetic clear will have achieved the state if you follow these guidelines and apply the hcobs on the subject both those who have attained dianetic clear and those who havent will be able to move on swiftly up the bridge on the right gradient cses should maintain their ivory towers and use the above data and all will go well in this area it is already going well and this

cannot be drilled into confronting he has to have his withholds pulled that he has committed overts and doesnt want them exposed apparently causes him to withhold his attention and the result is his ability to confront is lessened also where person has overts on subject and is withholding he has tendency to complicate that subject and cannot get down to its basic simplicities the world looks very complicated to him probably because his attention is wrapped up in his withholds instead of on his real problems or the subject the new discovery here is that person who has overts and withholds on subject cannot perform in that area and introduces complexities for of course they cant confront it where person cannot take responsibility for his withholds and he is not benefiting casewise from giving them up he is half dead as being it is vicious circle he began to commit overts because he couldnt confront things and then withheld what he had done because he had withholds and could not confront he began to take heavy drugs and alcohol these pushed him toward deadness and further worsened his ability to confront and even caused him to commit further overts which he then withheld and this further deteriorated his ability to confront and all this traces back to the fact that he couldnt confront in the first place there is nothing more irresponsible than dead man and when confront drops and withholds enter in one has entered the death slide as being this vicious circle can be handled in processing at various levels and will unsnarl and the person will become alive and able to confront but the first steps of it and ones which could carry him well up the ladder are the drills of the tr course if done properly and over and over in rotation each time to win on each particular

evaluation _____ if someone is nattery about cramming qual correction actions or qual use the assessment above on the subject of their complaint eg you could assess have you been word cleared over if the above does not resolve the matter fully use the cramming repair assessment list hcob 2 jun 78r or other specific list such as the word clearing correction list wccl cramming officer qualifications because the cramming officer is required to do these actions he or she must get checked out on how to do them possibly reason why some did not fly the ruds despite hcob 15 oct 74 cramming over outruds is that the cramming officer did not know how to fly ruds and had not gotten himself trained to do so then either didnt fly ruds before he attempted to do the cramming order or did not do the cramming order at all because the ruds were out both of these errors show an effect attitude that real cramming officer or scientologist for that matter would be guilty of cramming officers get tech in and being applied staff members successful and winning on their post and are therefore very causative cramming officer must get checked out on flying ruds and overts as these are vital tech of the cramming hat if classed auditor he must get checked out on use of correction lists such as the cramming repair assessment list wccl etc failure to check out on and use the tech of the post is an ethics matter worksheets the worksheets wses of all such actions ie ruds word clearing crammings cramming repair lists product debug assessments and any other qual corrective action are put in the pc folder and sent to the case supervisor cs the cs will correct any outtech or failure to fully handle and in the case of fn at exams or other outtech red tags the folder until the matter is fully repaired these worksheets must be complete accurate and legible in the case of non fn exam or other bad indicator these have rush priority and must be handled fast all the rules regarding worksheets apply to cramming and any other qual corrective actions 258is cs needed before flying ruds in cramming someone may wonder if he needs to get cs to fly the ruds before doing so in cramming action the answer is you do not need to get the pcs folder to the cs before you fly the ruds in cramming to do so would make an unnecessary delay and you dont need cs to fly somebodys ruds the cs case supervisor instruction is contained in this issue and that is what you do folder check before cramming sometimes staff member has been known to have been started on and left incomplete on several different actions eg the staff member is started on cramming order but before this is complete someone starts doing crashing misunderstood handling on him they end for lunch and after lunch someone tries to start yet another action on the staff member this is serious situation indeed and it could be enough to spin somebody so it is mandatory that before starting an action you must check the folder first cramming orders and flying ruds in cramming and other qual corrective actions do not require cs ok before doing them as this would put an unnecessary and arbitrary delay on the line and could be used as an excuse not to do the action eg i couldnt fly his ruds because i didnt have cs to fly the ruds so i didnt do anything but since one would not start new cycle in the middle of another incomplete cycle and would not try to fly ruds or word clear over mutant or outlists provided these really were out and not just false or protest read the folder must be checked by the person who is going to do the action this only takes minute to do before starting cramming or other qual corrective action look in the folder to ensure the person isnt in the middle of another qual corrective action or csed to get flubbed action repaired after the cramming or other qual corrective action send the folder to the case supervisor with legible worksheets on what you did and the exam form fesing if person has been crammed or has had other qual corrective actions and has gotten worse or made improvement then get all qual corrective actions done on the person fesed by the case supervisor and program and cs to repair these and get that program done comm ev anyone who interrupts or crossorders or prevents such program from being done as that would be suppressive such program has the priority of repairing flubbed session and the folder is red tagged until handled use the tech there are several new qual corrective actions as well as all the earlier tools of cramming these produce spectacular results when done correctly use this tech to make greatly enhanced staff members your cramming will be many times more effective and popular if you do it with the correct tech lrhdmgal l ron hubbard copyright

and class reasons for this are given in hcob 23 jul ad19 which also sets the policy therefore it is policy not to assign an auditor whose grade and class is less than that of the pc this policy becomes even more important when handling assignments on preots because if the auditor were of lower case grade it would prevent the preot from communicating to the auditor and the auditor not being aware of or trained on the materials of the level of case of the preot would not be able to audit that preot and would risk disaster for the preot as well as himself as cramming officers fly ruds in cramming and as some of the cramming and qual corrective actions can get into persons case this policy is extended to apply to cramming officers as well as auditors therefore the following policies apply 1 it is policy not to assign an auditor whose grade and class is less than that of the pc hcob 23 jul ad19 2 it is policy to assign only good proven auditors to good auditors hcob 23 jul ad19 3 it is policy not to assign nonot cramming officers to ots and the cramming officer must not be of lower case level than the ot 4 person who has been audited on ned for ots may only be audited or crammed by ned for ots auditor the terms auditor and cramming officer in these policies above are intended to include anyone acting in the capacity of an auditor or cramming officer and the fact that one is not trained or posted auditor or cramming officer does not permit one to do auditing or qual corrective actions in violation of the policies above these policies apply to any auditing actions and to qual corrective actions such as why finding metered debug actions false data stripping confessionals whether done in qual or 262hco clay table auditing and these policies are intended to apply to any new qual corrective actions released in the future subjective questions and metered actions which lead into persons case are not ok on ots such actions are not advised on lower level cases either unless these have been csed for and are part of standard tech otherwise this type of action is only covert way of auditing the person while not calling it auditing and is forbidden in cs series 29 case actions offline nonstandard actions or interviews done by untrained persons whose trs and metering are out are especially forbidden as detrimental to cases definition of subjective consultation with the preclears own universe with his mock ups and with his own thoughts and considerations coha page 167 recall think remember or return on the time track processes are subjective hcob 2 nov 57ra there are actions which are ok to do in cramming these are not related to the persons case they relate to his post and performance these are objective questions or actions definition of objective of or having to do with material object as distinguished from mental concept idea or belief dictionary means here and now objects in pt as opposed to subjective hcob 2 nov 57ra questions or actions by the cramming officer which are objective and pertain to the persons post the materials which cover his post or that he is studying clearing words misunderstood hatting actions and post or product debugs provided subjective questions are not asked on ots are all ok the most usual and successful cramming action is simply to take the materials or text that covers the subject of the cramming order and word clear and cram those materials this is always safe and ok to do the only other caution is not to give verbal data nor to evaluate or invalidate or throw the persons ruds out while doing the cram it is not that ots are difficult to handle to the contrary ots are far easier and faster to handle than nonots but ot cases must be handled as ot cases or the person doing the handling risks invalidation of case level of the ot and could get into aspects of the case that heshe knows nothing about and is thus incapable of handling or repairing ots when handled on the

fingers on pulses the first mathison meter wasnt built as modified wheatstone bridge until meters were developed people thought such galvanometers were reading sweat not thought because the earlier galvanometers were so insensitive engineers and electronics men in scientology have not always recognized the possibility of meter that directly reads electric thoughtimpulses not the physical results of these thoughtimpulses homemade emeters built by people who do know something about psychogalvanometers often have builtin lag which is meant to protect the movement the needle is damped down so reads are late you read sweat etc hence instant reads the first mathison meter wouldnt read on large percentage of people so lrh got mathison to expand it by the end of 1952 we had pretty good meter the very first meter had tiny electrodes little metal bars and didnt give mental reads lrh and jim elliot got the idea of using soup cans which did result in being able to get reads the emeter can detect whether pc is auditable it is coincidence that it just happens that when you can read pc on meter that pc is in good shape when persons needle is in constant agitated rockslam eg with real manicdepressive or schitzophrenic psychotic metered process works on them anyway cchs are all you can use fortunately they are available if you can read the meter on him he can be audited on think process eg prepchecking the meter ran us into complete culdesac we had had knowledge of the whole track before but the meter made it clear how many engrams there were this made dianetics look wrong as long as you audited only this lifetime you could make someone look very good but it was obviously impossible to run out every engram on the whole track because the number is infinite lrh in the past had refused to let pcs be subjected to experimental processes because they might get their heads blown off sometimes he used himself as guinea pig for that reason the board of the first dianetic foundation started to resign when lrh started looking at whole track they discovered at that point that hubbard could get mad his attitude was that one was going to say what could or could not be researched they decided that he must not be clear at that time which was the time of early research with the emeter and history of man 1952 lrh and msh went down to the library and started looking up words they came up with scio and ology this seemed to express what we wanted moving out of the field of the mind into the field of knowing the mind is only vessel of knowledge so new approach was required exteriorization started coming up lrh and msh went to phoenix one night evans farber showed up and wouldnt go away lrh finally asked him what he wanted and found that he had discovered the process try not to be three feet back of your head as an exteriorization process that was practically the end of the emeter because you cant read thetan who is out of his head lrh tried to develop thetameter the trouble was that it detected the auditor as well as the thetan who was the pc because it didnt require one to be exterior to read on it it was very simple electronically it used magic eye type detector in about 1955 or 1956 emeters went out of use they revived after the clearing acc probably in 5802c07 19acc15 help how to get started and 5802c13 19acc19 other processes the help button other tape titles from this acc may be more relevant but i dont have them in the us when lrh assessed people with the meter don breeding joe wallace pinkham and others were working on meters and one of them 264designed transistorized emeter in 1957 it was found to be very useful in clearing people it was used with fiveway help bracket to clear fifteen or twenty out of seventy people as long as lrh did the assessment we know now that the people who went clear were those who had beingness goal and chose the terminal of that beingness goal to run on the fiveway help they made first dynamic keyedout clear that is you could clear anyone with help whose terminal was also his goal the trick of assessment was to find the rock which would sometimes coincide with the wording of goal this got meters back in when it became clear that you wouldnt clear anyone without meter this was horrible because lrh had never been able to teach an auditor to use one not that he had tried very hard the step six phenomenon that was run into not long afterwards was the result of running someone on button that wasnt on his goal line not from creativeness beefing up the bank per if his goal was run out or desensitized you could then run any creative process with bad effect otherwise the button of alteration of creativeness can get activated which is the bankcreator see pp 285287 above when bank starts to go solid thats fun the difficulties of auditors finding correct rock loomed enormously we now had two factors that were missing 1 we needed technology that would unwind any accidental out of this package of clearing so there would be unknown data 2 we needed to get to the point where an auditor could interpret the data we did find the first british meters were copies of american meters fowler and allen built them at first with idea of what they were building one day lrh sat allen down and ran responsibility process on him on whatever he was looking at put him on the meter located his dead war companion that he felt he had overts on and found that he was looking at window surrounded by blackness he ran responsibility for this scene and got more and more room in the picture suddenly he got the whole sequence with full kinesthesia all sensations and more stuck picture lrh explained bits and pieces about the emeter to fowler and allen they went on to build the mark ii iii and eventually the mark iv with an improved circuit they also worked on an ot meter the job of the meter is still what it always was to detect what the pc has in the reactive bank it is incidental that the meter detects ruds problems or what the pc is thinking or doing or whatever what we need most is to know what he has in the bank so that the bank can be assessed the emeter has been designed and must be designed to detect the pcs prime postulate otherwise you wont clear anyone if meter wont detect prime postulate in an individual it is useless even if it could be used to get ruds in good meter must be very sensitive yet not pick up everything that the pc is doing physically but this has not been the main liability of meters the liability has always been auditor reading now that this has been singled out as the weakest point in auditing it can get fixed also more is known now about meter reads and auditor ability all the auditor is missing on is certainty on whether the needle read or is clean trouble with knowing when it read is solved by not looking until you say the last syllable and by drilling on when the needle is or isnt reading so all auditors must learn to read an emeter or they simply cannot audit you have to be able to detect the thing in the mind that is keeping the pc from being clear you ve got to learn to read meters good safe auditor can read

all cl iv auditors it has been found that the correction of lists very vital piece of tech has been source of confusion in the field as it apparently has never been written up in an issue it really is simple if you know your laws of l n verifying list the correct procedure for verifyingcorrecting past l ns is to check the items as to whether or not they are correct then do an l4bra on each list where the item is found to be incorrect you would have to orient the pc to the listing question and the item you do not direct the question to see if it read and dont just do an l4bra and then not find the right item for the pc as part of the handling unless the question proves to be uncharged or some such nulling list one nulls list when he doesnt get bd fn item on listing the laws of l n strictly apply an l4bra would be used if the action bogs with still item found one would also null lists the pc made where item had been found such as 2wc which turned into listing action with the pc giving off items or list the pc somehow made while not on meter in these cases there is item to verify with the pc as correct just cull the items into list work out with the pc what the question was if its not already noted and null the list reconstructing list sometimes you just dont have the list and cant get it or its an old why finding or pts interview for which there are worksheets in this case you get from the pc what the question was and then get him to give you the items that were already on the list as the item probably was already on the list and you dont want the pc to get into newly listing the question in pt and then getting into an overlisting situation just get him to give you the items he had already put on the list and more often than not you will get bd fn item if you dont get the item that way then you can extend the list selflisting watch it on these as every random stray thought person has about why this or that does not mean its selflist but do look for it on person who is manifesting the horrendous bpc an out list can generate who is introspected or has been trying to figure out who is doing him in after just having seen the ethics officer just dont get into trying to make list out of some nonstandard listing question that wont give you an item and actually the usual reason for selflisting is prior wrong l n item or an item not found people will selflist to try to find the right item so find and correct the earlier out list 266list correction blowup when you are going along correcting lists and suddenly you get big pc blowup and it is not resolving on the list you are correcting you had better quickly realize that you probably are not correcting the list that is out and youd better find out which list it is there is usually an earlier out list to be found if the list you are correcting does not resolve the upset lists not reading when you start getting key lists such as grades iii and iv not reading and items found its time for that auditor to get thorough overhaul on his metering eyesight and to get off all his mus on l n you also could be setting the pc up for selflisting situation as he has been given the listing question but item has been found so be very sure the question did not read even with suppress and inval and trs were in before getting off key l n process use of l4bra the prepared list l4bra corrects l n lists it can be run on old lists current lists general listing when pc is ill after listing and nulling session or up to 3 days after always suspect that listing action done on the pc had an error in it and get those lists corrected sometimes it is obvious what the error was per the laws of listing and nulling for example there could be two reading items left on the list in which case you would know to extend the list as it has been underlisted if this didnt go then an l4bra would be done on the list handling an l4bra you handle reading questions on the l4bra by the directions under the question that read you dont just 2wc these questions for example say question 4 read on the l4bra is list incomplete sf you then ask the pc what list is incomplete locate it and get it completed to bd fn item you dont just 2wc incomplete lists to an fn and leave it at that by the way the l4bra is missing line which is was it the first item on the list this is being added as its quite common that it is the first item and is most often missed do it right an out list can create more concentrated hell with pc than any other single auditing error so its imperative that listing errors get properly corrected the best thing to do is to have the laws of listing and nulling drilled line by line and down cold and just do it right in the first place then you will also see at once where old lists violated these laws and you will not be yourself doing lists that have to be corrected later l ron hubbard founder assisted by cs45 lrhjedr copyright 1977 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved

reactions from pc that you would get on wrongly done list the reason for pc upsets in twc is hidden as it is not apparently listing process rarely gets the correction bad list would get asking who or what or which during twc after the main question can also turn it into listing and nulling process twc questions must be limited to feelings reactions significances they must never ask for terminals or locations example who upset you in twc causes the pc to give items this is list what are you upset about does the same thing which town were you happiest in is also listing question not twc question any of these results in the pc giving items they are not then nulled or correctly indicated the pc can get very upset just as he would with wrong list yet the session is not listing session so never gets corrected example how are you doing lately is an example of correct twc question it gets off charge and gets list items are you better these days than you used to be how have you been

finding whys for danger formula or post purposes or post products as called for in the est system you will get certain amount of error and case disturbance such upsets also come from word clearing by incompetent persons the cs should look for these especially when such campaigns are in progress he should suspect them as possibility when case bogs cs must be sure all such papers and worksheets get

the words in some engram as implants are actually just engrams handle it with an l3b listing any item found out of session or by nonauditor is suspect of being listing and nulling ln error even though list was made today correct ln item must bd and fn so treat such items as you would list errors and try to reconstruct the list and either confirm the item or locate the real item may have been invalidated and suppressed or extend the list and get the real item the real item will bd fn one can establish what the situation is with post purpose why or product or any other such item by doing an

error has been made reaction nothing produces as much case upset as wrong list item or wrong list even rarely dianetic list can produce wrong list reactions ask the pc for his somatics and he blows up or goes into apathy or blows or attacks the auditor all of the more violent or bad reactions on the part of the pc come from out lists nothing else produces such sharp deterioration in case or even illness out lists therefore when one gets sharp change in case like lowered tone violence blows determination to go on in spite of the supervisor long notes from pcs self csing etc etc the cs suspects an out list this outness can occur in regular sessions even when the item was said to bd fn it can occur in coffee shop out of session auditing of someone or by est or poorly trained or untrained staff members or even in life pts when such actions as finding items by nonauditors are done on pts people the situation can be bad so one also suspects the person to be pts to someone or something pts does not communicate well in an assessment question so one says someone or something is hostile to you and you are connected to someone or something that doesnt agree with dianetics or scientology repairs the main things to know when doing such repairs are that such situations as wrong lists or upset people can occur in an org where untrained people are also using meters and b that it is up to the cs to suspect detect and get them handled in regular session do not ignore the possible bad influence as the good outweighs the bad in such cases it is not correct answer to forbid such actions it is correct answer to require all such actions and worksheets become part of the folder one can also persuade the d of t or qual to gen in the people doing such actions and do not ignore the effect such actions can have on cases and do not neglect to include them in cses before going on with the regular program they can all be repaired lrhntrd l ron hubbard copyright 1972 founder by l ron

auditing or training program and must be handled speedily and well to get the person back on his course of auditing or training many preclears new to scientology require pts handling as one of their first actions auditing or training must not be continued over an unhandled pts sit as processing or study under the duress of suppression will not produce results you do not go on hoping or ignore it or call it something else or do any other action except handle handling ptsness is too easy to allow for any justification or excuse for not doing so and the steps given below lay out the many handlings which can be used to bring about full resolution of all ptsness in all pcs education person who is pts is often the last person to suspect it he may have become temporarily or momentarily so and he may have become so very slightly or he may be even pts and have been so for long time but he is nevertheless pts and we must educate him into the subject pts cs1 the pts cs1 given in hcob 31 dec 78 iii educating the potential trouble source the first step toward handling pts cs1 must be done before any other pts handling is begun this action sets person up to understand his pts sit and the mechanics of it thorough pts cs1 is the basis of all successful pts handling pts interview metered pts interview per hcob 24 apr 72 1 cs series 79 pts interviews or 10 august handling per hcob 10 aug 73 pts handling done by an auditor in session or an maa d of p or sso will in most cases assist the person to spot the antagonistic or sp element once spotted the potential trouble source can be assisted in working out handling for that terminal or more rarely in deciding to disconnect from that person if all difficulty is encountered on this step or if the sp cannot easily be found the preclear or student is probably not pts type i and should be turned over to an auditor qualified to handle type ii pts situations with more advanced pts tech 276handling once the antagonistic terminal has been located handling is done to move the pts person from effect to slight gentle cause over his situation this handling will include whatever is needed to accomplish the result and will of course vary depending on the person and his circumstances good roads good weather approach to the antagonistic terminal is usually what is needed the handling must be agreed upon by the potential trouble source and the person assisting him and must be tailored to put the person at cause over his particular situation handling may include coaching him along to see how he himself actually precipitated the pts condition in the first place by not applying or by misapplying scientology basics to his life and relationship with the now antagonistic terminal per bpl 5 apr 72rc pts type handling

of very new scientologist who then misinforms others the book what is scientology is very useful tool the preclear can send copy of it to persons antagonistic to him and it will give them hope that the person will respond better to life or if they are antagonistic to scientology can show them what theyre being antagonistic to recommendations that the pts person obtain and use this book or anyone else who wants to inform his friends or get them on the right road as the book was not written for the purpose of deptsing people should be made by the interviewing officer the book was specially priced so it would be more generally available despite the high cost of publishing it is large and imposing book and contains the true answers to all the questions people might ask and so saves the pts person or any other person great deal of explanation time it is quite formidable weapon when used in that fashion besides being good book that scientologists should own in its own right can we ever be friends extraordinary successes in handling pts situations with the can we ever be friends cassette and booklet occur when these are used parents friends relatives of scientologists who due to misunderstoods or misinformation thought they were opposed to scientology and its aims have discovered after listening to this cassette that they are in full agreement with it and now give scientology their support this action is vital and must not be omitted the results available with this cassette cannot be underestimated it can be used by itself when communication has really broken down between the two terminals or in conjunction with other pts handling 277program as result of interview and the various actions connected with it as given above and in the referenced issues the interviewer must give the person program to be done by the person if the person does not do the program or report his actions on it or the program results in real change in the situation the interviewing officer must require the person to have auditing on the subject ruds can be flown andor pts rd must be given by qualified auditor in the hgc clears and ots can have ruds flown and can do all the pts rd except engram handling this is usually followed by suppressed person rd rudiments flying ruds and overts triple or quad flow on the antagonistic terminal is often done to get ruds in and enable the pc to better confront the pts situation he is faced with this would of course be done only in session by qualified auditor when so ordered by the case supervisor the pts rundown the pts rundown is done when

handling when you find you have potential trouble source on your hands the very first thing you must do is educate him on the fundamentals of ptssp tech do not begin any other pts handling on any pts person until he has completed the basic education steps of the pts cs1 given in this hcob in the absence of education into the basics of pts tech you will have pts students and pcs asserting theyre not pts you will have upsets protest recurrences of once handled ptsness ptses will not cognite will not take action to handle the antagonistic terminal will not recover failure to educate simply doesnt work so very thorough job must be done at this point to guarantee the success of any pts handlings which follow 280now people and circumstances and pts sits vary and you may wish to carry the education steps of the pts person beyond what is given here before you begin any other handling on him i will leave that to your educated judgment however the steps of the pts cs1 given in this hcob must be done on all pts students and pcs before any sort of pts interview or 10 august handling or any pts auditing is undertaken the person should of course study the complete ptssp detection routing and handling course so that he understands the full mechanics that had been upsetting his life but the pts cs1 will give sufficient data and understanding so that he or she can begin handling the pts scene pts cs1 the following pts cs1 is not long action and can and should be accomplished speedily its purpose is to give to any pts student or pc the necessary data and rfactor on the basics of ptssp tech so that he understands and is able and willing to successfully handle his pts situation it can be done by an auditor in session or in the course room under the supervision of the word clearer and course supervisor note some pcs and students who have been trained or who have in the past received pts handling may protest that they know the terms and issues if this happens acknowledge with excellent trs and without invalidation or evaluation and tell them that this action is intended to make pts handling effective for all and is required step of the handling if the auditor or word clearer uses excellent trs and good rfactor arc breaks will occur and the person will have tremendous wins the auditor or word clearer should be fully familiar with this issue as well as all issues in the ptssp course pack he will need to take very thorough look at what has to be covered with the pc in this cs1 and know his materials very well and have them ready for reference and clearing any

questions or misunderstoods as you go along and ensure any such get handled so the pc or student winds up with clear understanding of the word 281dont settle for glibness that does not show

of remedy remedy b and s and ds remember that the real suppressive person sp was the one that wove dangerous environment around the pc to find that person is to open up the pcs present time perception or space its like pulling wrapping of wool off the pc the sp persuaded or caused the pc to believe the environment was dangerous and that it was always dangerous and so made the pc pull in and occupy less space and reach less when the sp is really located and indicated the pc feels this impulse not to reach diminish and so his space opens up the difference between safe environment and dangerous environment is only that person is willing to reach and expand in safe environment and reaches less and contracts in dangerous environment an sp wants the other person to reach less sometimes this is done by forcing the person to reach into danger and get hurt so that the person will thereafter reach less the sp wants smaller less powerful beings the sp thinks that if another became powerful that one would attack the sp the sp is totally insecure and is battling constantly in covert ways to make others less powerful and less able hcob 5 feb 66 s and d warning 287hubbard communications officer

course policies similar to those regarding physical illness and insanity exist for types of persons who have caused us considerable trouble these persons can be grouped under sources of trouble they include persons intimately connected with persons such as marital or familialties of known antagonism to mental or spiritual treatment or scientology in practice such persons even when they approach scientology in friendly fashion have such pressure continually brought to bear upon them by persons with undue influence over them that they make very poor gains in processing and their interest is solely devoted to proving the antagonistic element wrong they by experience produce great deal of trouble in the long run as their own condition does not improve adequately under such stresses to effectively combat the antagonism their present time problem cannot be reached as it is continuous and so long as it remains so they should not be accepted for auditing by any organization or auditor b criminals with proven criminal records otten continue to commit so many undetected harmful acts between sessions that they do not make adequate case gains and therefore should not be accepted for processing by organizations or auditors c persons who have ever threatened to sue or embarrass or attack or who have publicly attacked scientology or been party to an attack and all their immediate families should never be accepted for processing by central organization or auditor they have history of only serving other ends than case gain and commonly again turn on the organization or auditor they have already barred themselves out by their own overts against scientology and are thereafter too difficult to help since they cannot openly accept help from those they have tried to injure d responsibleforcondition cases have been traced back to other causes tar their condition too often to be acceptable by responsibleforcondition cases is meant the person who insists book or some auditor is wholly responsible for the terrible condition i am in such cases demand unusual favours free auditing tremendous effort on the part of auditors review of these cases show that they were in the same or worse condition long before auditing that they are losing planned campaign to obtain auditing for nothing that they are not as bad off as they claim and that their antagonism extends to anyone who seeks to help them even their own families establish the rights of the matter and decide accordingly persons who are not being audited on their own determinism are liability as they are forced into being processed by some other person and have personal desire to become better quite on the contrary they usually want only to prove the person who wants them audited wrong and so do not get better until personally determined goal to be processed occurs the person will not benefit f persons who want to be processed to see if scientology works as their only reason for being audited have never been known to make gains as they do not participate news reporters fall into this category they should not be audited 288g persons who claim that if you help such and such case at great and l oar expense because somebody is rich and hlfluelltial or the neigllbours would be electrified should be ignored processing is designed for bettering individuals not progressing by stunts or giving cases undue importance process only at convenience and usual arrangements make extraordinary effort at the expense of other persons who do want processing for normal reasons not one of these arrangements has ever come off successfully as it has the unworthy goal of notoriety not betterments h persons who have an open mind but personal hopes or desires for auditing of knowingness should be ignored as they really dont have all open mind at all but lack of ability to decide about things and are seldom found to be very responsible and waste anyones efforts to convince them i persons who do not believe anything or anyone can get better they have purpose far being audited entirely contrary to the auditors and so in this conflict do not benefit when such persons are trained they use their training to degrade others thus they should not be accepted for training or auditing j persons attempting to sit in judgemellt on scientology in hearings or attempting to investigate scientology should be given undue importance one should not seek to instruct or assist them in any way this includes judges boards newspaper reporters magazine writers etc all efforts to be helpful or instructive have done nothing beneficial as their first idea is firm i dont know and this usually ends with an equally firm i dont know if person cant see tor himself or judge from the obvious then he does not have sufficient powers of observation even to sort out actual evidence in legal matters only take the obvious effective stepscarry on crusades in court in the matter of reporters etc it is not worth while to give them ally time contrary to popular belief they are given their story before they leave their editorial rooms and you only strengthen what they have to say by saying anything they are public communication line that says much policy is very definite ignore to summarize troublesome persons the policy in general is to cut communication as the longer it is extended the more trouble they are i know of instance where the types of persons listed above were handled by auditing or instruction i know of many instances where they were handled by just ignoring them until they change their minds or just turning ones back in applying policy of cutcommunication one must also use judgement as there are exceptions in all things and to fail to handle persons momentary upset in life or with us can be quite fatal so these policies refer to nonscientology persons in the main or persons who appear on the outer fringes and push toward us when such person bears any of the above designations we and the many are better off to ignore them scientology works you dont have to prove it to everyone people dont deserve to have scientology as divine right you know they have to earn it this has been true in every philosophy that sought to better man all the above sources of trouble are also forbidden training and when person being trained or audited is detected to belong under the above headings to j he or she should be advised to terminate and accept refund which must be paid at once and the full explanation should be given them at that time thus the few may not in their own turmoil impede service to and the advance of the many and the less enturbulence you put on your lines the better and the more people you will eventually help lrhcseird l ron hubbard copyright 1969

of p pts pack pts potential trouble source there are two stable data which anyone has to have understand and know are true in order to obtain results in handling the person connected to suppressives these data are 1 that all illness in greater or lesser degree and all foulups stem directly and only from pts condition 2 that getting rid of the condition requires three basic actions discover b handle or disconnect persons called upon to handle pts people can do so very easily far more easily than they believe their basic stumbling block is thinking that there are exceptions or that there is other tech or that the two above data have modifiers or are not sweeping the moment person who is trying to handle ptss gets persuaded there are other conditions or reasons or tech he is at once lost and will lose the game and not obtain results and this is very too bad because it is not difficult and the results are there to be obtained to turn someone who may be pts over to an auditor just to have him mechanically audited may not be enough in the first place this person may not have clue what is meant by pts and may be missing all manner of technical data on life and may be so overwhelmed by suppressive person or group that he is quite incoherent thus just mechanically doing process may miss the whole show as it misses the persons understanding of why it is being done pts person is rarely psychotic but all psychotics are pts if only to themselves pts person may be in state of deficiency or pathology which prevents ready recovery but at the same time he will not fully recover unless the pts condition is also handled for he became prone to deficiency or pathological illness because he was pts and unless the condition is relieved matter what medication or nutrition he may be given he might not recover and certainly will not recover permanently this seems to indicate that there are other illnesses or reasons for illness besides being pts to be sure there are deficiencies and illnesses just as there are accidents and injuries but strangely enough the person himself precipitates them because being pts predisposes him to them in more garbled way the medicos and nutritionists are always talking about stress causing illness lacking full tech they yet have an inkling that this is so because they see it is somehow true they cannot handle it yet they recognize it and they state that it is senior situation to various illnesses and accidents well we have the tech of this in more ways than one what is this thing called stress it is more than the medico defines ithe usually says it comes from operational or physical shock and in this he has too limited view person under stress is actually under suppression on one or more dynamics if that suppression is located and the person handles or disconnects the condition diminishes if he also has all the engrams and arc breaks problems overts and withholds 290audited out triple flow and if all such areas of suppression are thus handled the person would recover from anything caused by stress usually the person has insufficient understanding of life or any dynamic to grasp his own situation he is confused he believes all his illnesses are true because they occur in such heavy books at some time he was predisposed to illness or accidents when serious suppression then occurred he suffered precipitation or occurrence of the accident or illness and then with repeated similar suppressions on the same chain the illness or tendency to accidents became prolonged or chronic to say then that person is pts to his current environment would be very limited as diagnosis if he continues to do or be something to which the suppressive person or group objected he may become or continue to be ill or have accidents actually the problem of pts is not very complicated once you have grasped the two data first given the rest of it becomes simply an analysis of how they apply to this particular person pts person can be markedly helped in three ways gaining an understanding of the tech of the condition b discovering to what or to whom he is pts c handling or disconnecting someone with the wish or duty to find and handle ptss has an additional prior step he must know how to recognize pts and how to handle them when recognized thus it is rather waste of time to engage in this hunt unless one has been checked out on all the material on suppressives and ptss and grasps it without misunderstoods in other words the first step of the person is to get grasp of the subject and its tech this is not difficult to do it may be bit more difficult to learn to run an emeter and considerably more difficult to learn how to list for items but there again this is possible and is much easier than trying to grope around guessing with this step done person has real trouble recognizing pts people and can have success in handling them which is very gratifying and rewarding let us consider the easiest level of approach i give the person the simpler hco bs on the subject and let him study them so that he knows the elements like pts and suppressive he may just cognite right there and be much better it has happened ii have him discuss the illness or accident or condition without much prodding or probing that he thinks now may be the result of suppression he will usually tell you it is right here and now or was short time ago and will be all set to explain it without any relief as stemming from his current environment or recent one if you let it go at that he would simply be bit unhappy and not get well as he is discussing usually late lock that has lot of earlier material below it iii ask when he recalls first having that illness or having such accidents he will at once begin to roll this back and realize that it has happened before you dont have to be auditing him as he is all too willing to talk about this in most informal manner he will get back to some early thislifetime point usually iv now ask him who it was he will usually tell you promptly and as you are not really auditing him and he isnt going backtrack and you are not trying to do more than key him out you dont probe any further v you will usually find that he has named person to whom he is still connected so you ask him whether he wants to handle or disconnect now as the sparks will really fly in his life if he dramatically disconnects and if he cant see how he can you persuade him to begin to handle on gradient scale this may consist of imposing some slight discipline on him such as 291requiring him to actually answer his mail or write the person pleasant good roads good weather note or to realistically look at how he estranged them in short what is required in the handling is low gradient all you are trying to do is move the pts person from effect over to slight gentle cause vi check with the person again if he is handling and coach him along always at gentle good roads and good weather level and h and r human emotion and reaction if you please that is simple handling you can get complexities such as person being pts to an unknown person in his immediate vicinity that he may have to find before he can handle or disconnect you can find people who cant remember more than few years back you can find anything you can find in case but simple handling ends when it looks pretty complex and thats when you call in the auditor but this simple handling will get you quite few stars in your crown you will be amazed to find that while some of them dont instantly recover medication vitamins minerals will now work when before they wouldnt you may also get some instant recovers but realize that if they dont you have not failed the auditor can do 3 sds after this with much more effect as he isnt working with completely uninformed person 3 sds only fail because of wrong items or because the auditor did not then put in triple rudiments on the items and then audit them out as engrams triple flow being is rather complex he may have lot of sources of suppression and it may take lot of very light auditing to get him up to where he can do work on suppressives since these were after all the source of his overwhelm and what he did to them might be more important than what they did to him but unless you unburden him he may not get around to realizing that you can run into person who can only be handled by expanded dianetics but you have made an entrance and you have stirred things up and gotten him more aware and just that way you will find he is more at cause his illness or proneness to accidents may not be slight you may succeed only to the point where he now has chance by nutrition vitamins minerals medication treatment and above all auditing of getting well unless you jogged this condition he had chance at all for becoming pts is the first thing that happened to him on the subject of illness or accidents further if the person has had lot of auditing and yet isnt progressing too well your simple handling may all of sudden cause him to line up his case so do not underestimate what you or an auditor can do for pts and dont sell pts tech short or neglect it and dont continue to transfer or push off or even worse tolerate pts conditions in people you can do something about it and so can they lrhntrd l ron hubbard copyright 1973 founder by l ron hubbard all

or something somewhere somewhat suppressive pc will find the good hats suppressive this does not relieve his condition he is pts to sp people groups things or locations matter how sp he is he can have been audited by someone he knew in an earlier life and who goofed the session few auditors have since been declared not because they goofed but because they were sp however some pts pc will make trouble for good people because that is what pts means potential trouble source so do not buy all the good people he is pts to further when you do get the person or group or thing or location the pts person will fn vgi and begin to get well the pts condition is actually problem and mystery and withdrawal so it is sometimes hard to find and has to be specially processed 3 sds to locate it usually it is quite visible dont have sick rollercoaster pc appear for interview and then say not pts its false report it only means the interviewer did not find it the pc sometimes begins to list in such an

this bpl clearing up any misunderstood words or definitions in it and making certain the person knows what pts really means part of any handling may include the person being required to take course that is usually called the ptssp checksheet but in any case and in any handling one cannot permit the person to go on being pts as it can ruin his life definition per hco policy letter of 7 may 69 pts meaning potential trouble source type is person intimately connected with persons such as marital or familial ties of known antagonism to mental or spiritual treatment or scientology in practice such persons even when they approach scientology in friendly fashion have such pressure continually 295brought to bear upon them by persons with undue influence over them that they make very poor gains in processing and their interest is solely devoted to proving the antagonistic element wrong source of trouble such persons with antagonistic family members are source of trouble to scientology because their family members are not inactive in fact from direct experience with inquiry after inquiry into scientology it has been found that those who have created the conditions which brought about the inquiry in the first place and those who testified before same have been the wives husbands mothers fathers brothers sisters or grandparents of some scientologist their testimony has been full of such statements as my completely changed after he went into scientology he longer was respectful to my daughter gave up wonder reer as hairdresser to go into scientology my sister got these funny staring eyes the way all scientologists have their testimony was illogical and their descriptions of what occurred were untrue but the point of the matter is that such persons did cause scientology scientology orgs and fellow scientologists great deal of trouble and difficulty dont create antagonism many scientologists in their misunderstanding and misapplication of scientology create the conditions that bring about the antagonism in the first place few illustrations of how this is done are as follows scientologist to mother i now know where you are on the tone scale 11 boy are you sneaky evaluation and invalidation father to scientologist now i dont want you to borrow the car again without my permission i have told you time and time scientologist to father okay fine okay good thank you i got that not an acknowledgement but an effort to shut up the father scientologist to older brother you murdered in past life you dirty dog evaluation and invalidation mother to scientologist whatever are you doing scientologist to mother im trying to confront your dreadful bank invalidation there are so many ways to misuse tech and to invalidat and evaluate for others in destructive fashion to bring about bypassed charge arc breaks and upset that they can not all be possibly listed the idea is not to do so why create trouble for yourself and for your fellow scientologists as nothing will have been gained but illwill the why per hco policy letter of march 7 1965 it is crime to be or become pts without reporting it or taking action or to receive processing while pts further as per hco policy letter of october 27 1964 pts may not be trained this means that person who is pts may not receive processing or training while pts and it also means that they had better do something to handle their condition as per older now cancelled policy the pts individual was required to handle or disconnect from the antagonistic family member before he or she could continue with their training or processing many took the easy course and merely disconnected as such disconnection was only temporary for the time of 296their training or processing and so they did not in actual fact handle the condition in their life which was upsetting to them as scientologists scientology executives have had to promise the new zealand government that the policy of disconnection from families would be cancelled this was done but since that time we have had more pts trouble than before therefore what is needed is legal and more sensible way to handle using recent technology contained in the data series policy letters new procedure is possible each pts individual should report to ethics and with the assistance of ethics find why as to their familial antagonism and then set about actually handling the situation the why could be that his parents wanted him to be lawyer and so blame scientology that he is not one rather than the fact that he flunked out of law school and couldnt stand the thought of being lawyer or perhaps the why is that the scientologist keeps writing her parents for money or the why could be that the mother has just read an heta newspaper article in any case the why should be found and the pts individual should then do whatever is necessary to handle see the data series pls must be word cleared on the user to find out how to find why this is not mandatory for doing the ptssp detection checksheet bpl 31 may 1971rg handling the person who is pts should be declared as such by ethics and should not receive scientology training or processing until the situation has been handled the exception to this is full pts rundown done in the hgc the handling could be as simple as writing to ones father and saying i do not complain that you are janitor please do not complain that i am scientologist the important thing is that i am your and that i love and respect you i know you love but please learn to respect as an adult individual who knows what he wants in life or it could be as follows i am writing to you daddy because mother keeps sending these dreadful newspaper clippings and they are upsetting to because i know they are not true you do not do this and so it is easier for to write to you again there are as many ways of handling as there are whys found each case is individual remember too there is always the possibility of situation and if the person thinks hes pts and isnt he can get sick or if he insists he isnt and is he can also get upset so find if there is situation first it is the purpose of ethics to ensure that the situation is handled csg for l ron hubbard founder revised by lrh tech expeditor lrhmshpajm revised 291278 by copyright 1972197519771978 by l ron hubbard l ron hubbard all

majority of the technology on how to handle ptses is already covered in the pts and sp detection routing and handling course the following lrh tips on handling pts type situations have been excerpted from an lrh lecture as additional data for your use i coached pc one time as to how to talk to his parents i coached him very very carefully this is sort of an maa job not cs job i made him repeat everything after very carefully and when your mother says to you so and so and so and so what are you going to say it was just good roads and good weather i forced on him at pain of being squashed to follow this exact patter with his parents hello mama how are you hows papa etc simply good roads and good weather and she says yeow yeow yeow yeow yeow yeow and you wha wha wha wha wha why just say well alright alright and dont answer back and dont engage in any argument of any kind whatsoever give it an acknowledgement i told him you are calling them up just because youre passing through and you were interested in how they are and that is your whole story and he did and that was the end of the whole situation the pc came back to battery relationships with the parents went totally normal in other words he was keeping it going by his worry his upset his letters trying to answer their questions his conversation with them whereas i cut it all into just the pattern of something on the order of about tone 35 straight across the boards that was the end of the pts condition pts condition also has outside handling steps but you as an auditor or you as cs are possibly limited by the fact that you dont have an maa or you do not have somebody who is sufficiently skilled in order to do this job for you and it winds up blowing everybodys head off in such an instance just get hold of the guy coach him in exactly what hes going to say oh but shed never listen she wont she hasnt talked to for seven years she wont talk to in any way shape or form well alright alright alright thats fine good then you get little bit inventive and you say well when is her birthday or something like that and the pc says well as matter of fact it was month or two ago and you say well alright why dont you send her birthday card remember to tell her its belated day card and that you remembered her birthday and always had kind thoughts of her now the incoming comm may blow his head off and you just cool him off dont engage in any corner of this this is not the game youre playing you simply acknowledge any nice part that you can find papa went hunting and youre dirty dog and ive never seen the like of you and youre an ungrateful brat and so on and why dont you be like your great uncle oscar who is now doing time in sing sing and will be executed next week and so forth and you say i hope daddy had fine hunting trip its the only part of it you answer you coach him into twoway comm that is well above 20 on the tone scale that mostly consists of acknowledgements and mild interest in whats gotng on you will find out these conditions will evaporate if you can prevent the backflash from being responded to by the pts person in other words there are ways to handle this in real life you will find great many people who are pts are antagonizing the people theyre antagonizing them beyond belief and theyre telling them whats wrong with them and theyre 298telling them this and theyre telling them that and so on and the person eventually gets very resentful well even that can be patched up you are not doing snything at the other end of the line you cool off the pt scene

bulletin of 24 november 1965 remimeo required for level iv students to review auditors level iv search and discovery prerequisite knowledge of ethics definitions and purposes the process called search and discovery requires as well good knowledge of ethics one must know what suppressive person is what potential trouble source is and the mechanism of how and why case roller coasters and what that is all this data exists in ethics policy letters and should be studied well before one attempts search and discovery or further study of this hcob ethics is not merely legal actionit handles the whole phenomena of case worsening roller coaster after processing and without this technology an auditor easily becomes baffled and tends to plunge and squirrel the only reason case roller coasters after good standard auditing is the pts phenomena and suppressive is present three types there are three types of pts type one is the easy one the sp on the case is right in present time actively suppressing the person type two is harder for the apparent suppressive person in present time is only restimulator for the actual suppressive type three is beyond the facilities of orgs not equipped with hospitals as these are entirely psychotic handling type one pts the type one is normally handled by an ethics officer in the course of hearing the person is asked if anyone is invalidating him or his gains or scientology and if the pc answers with name and is then told to handle or disconnect from that person the good indicators come in promptly and the person is quite satisfied if however there is success in finding the sp on the case or if the person starts naming org personnel or other unlikely persons as sp the ethics officer must realize that he is handling type two pts and because the auditing will consume time sends the person to tech or qual for search and discovery it is easy to tell type one pts from type two the type one brightens up at once and ceases to roller coaster the moment the present time sp is spotted the pc ceases to roller coaster the pc does not go back on it and begin to beg off the pc does not begin to worry 300about the consequences of disconnection if the pc does any of these things then the pc is type two it can be seen that ethics handles the majority of ptss in fast manner there is trouble about it all goes smoothly it can also be seen that ethics cannot afford the time to handle type two pts and there is reason the type two should not pay well for the auditing therefore when ethics finds its type one approach does not work quickly ethics must send the person to the proper division that is handling search and discovery type two the pc who isnt sure wont disconnect or still roller coasters or who doesnt brighten up cant name any sp at all is type two only search and discovery will help search and discovery the first thing to know is that case worsening is caused only by pts situation there never will be any other reason as soon as you doubt this datum and think about other causes or try to explain it some other way you longer prevent cases from worsening and longer rescue those who have worsened the second thing to know is that suppressive is always person being or group of beings suppressive is not condition problem postulate problems and counterpostulates come into the matter but the sp as being or group must always be located as being or group not as merely an idea as the technology is close to and similar to that of service facsimile poorly trained auditor can get confused between them and produce condition he says is the cause persons who cannot confront and who therefore see persons as ideas not people are the ones most likely to fail in doing search and discovery the third thing to know is that there can be an actual sp and another person or being similar to the actual one who is only an apparent sp an actual sp actually suppresses another an apparent sp only reminds the pc of the actual one and so is restimulated into being pts the actual sp can be in present time type one pts or is in the past or distant type two pts the type two always has an apparent sp who is not the sp on the case is confusing the two and is acting pts only because of restimulation not because of suppression search and discovery as process is done exactly by the general rules of listing one lists for persons or groups who are or have suppressed the pc the list is complete when only one item reads on nulling and this is the item 301if the item turns out to be group one does second list of who or what would represent that group gets the list long enough to leave on nulling only one item reading and that is the sp an incident is not person or group condition is not person or group and group is not person what you want is one being the emeter signs are unmistakable and the good indicators come in strongly when the actual sp is found this is the entire action it is liable to the various ills and errors of writing and nulling list such as overlisting underlisting arc breaking the pc by bypassing the item or getting an incomplete list these are avoided by knowing ones business as an auditor and being able to handle an emeter with skill and confidence when one goofs on search and discovery and finds the wrong actual sp the signs are the same as those where type two is handled as type onenot sure good indicators roller coasters again etc the actual sp can be back track but it is seldom vital to go far out of pt and usual for lifetime person to turn up done correctly the pcs good indicators come in at once the pc cognites the meter reacts very well with blowdowns and repeated long falls and the pc ceases to roller coaster care should be taken not to get too enthusiastic in going far back track on the pc as you run into whole track implants etc easily handleable only at level v the pc can get over whumped if you go too far back and youll wish you hadnt this normally happens however only when the pc has been arc broken by the auditor when the right item has been by passed and the list is overlong or when 2 or 3 items are still reading on the list incomplete list locating service facsimile is quite similar to search and discovery but they are different processes entirely only the doingness is similar in search and discovery the end product is being in service facsimile the end product is an item or concept or idea dont get the two mixed handling type three the type three pts is mostly in institutions or would be in this case the type twos apparent sp is spread all over the world and is often more than all the people there arefor the person sometimes has ghosts about him or demons and they are just more apparent sps but imaginary as beings as well all institutional cases are ptss the whole of insanity is wrapped up in this one fact the insane is not just bad off being the insane is being who has been overwhelmed by an actual sp until too many persons are apparent sps this makes the person roller coaster continually in life the roller coaster is even cyclic repetitive as cycle handling an insane person as type two might work but probably not case for case one might get enough wins on few to make one fail completely by so many loses on the many 302just as you tell type two to disconnect from the actual sp wherever found on the track you must disconnect the person from the environment putting the person in current institution puts him in bedlam and when also treated it may finish him for he will roller coaster from any treatment given until made into type two and given search and discovery the task with type three is not treatment as such it is to provide relatively safe environment and quiet and rest and treatment of mental nature at all giving him quiet court with motionless object in it might do the trick if he is permitted to sit there unmolested medical care of very unbrutal nature is necessary as intravenous feeding and soporifics sleeping and quietening drugs may be necessary such persons are sometimes also physically ill from an illness with known medical cure treatment with drugs shock operation is just more suppression the person will not really get well will relapse etc standard auditing on such person is subject to the roller coaster phenomena they get worse after getting better successes are sporadic enough to lead one on and usually worsen again since these people are pts but removed from apparent sps kept in quiet surroundings not pestered or threatened or put in fear the person comes up to type two and search and discovery should end the matter but there will always be some failures as the insane sometimes withdraw into rigid unawareness as final defense sometimes cant be kept alive and sometimes are too hectic and distraught to ever become quiet the extremes of too quiet and never quiet have number of psychiatric names such as catatonia withdrawn totally and manic too hectic classification is interesting but nonproductive since they are all pts all will roller coaster and none can be trained or processed with any idea of lasting result matter the temporary miracle remove type three pts from the environment give him or her rest and quiet do search and discovery when rest and quiet have made the person type two note these paragraphs on the type three make good promise given in dianetics the modern science of mental health to develop institutional dianetics the modern mental hospital with its brutality and suppressive treatments is not the way to give psychotic quiet and rest before anything effective can be done in this field proper institution would have to be provided offering only rest quiet and medical assistance for intravenous feedings and sleeping draughts where necessary but not as treatment and where treatment is attempted until the person looks recovered and only then search and discovery as above under type two l ron hubbard lrhepcden

that read most first test one of these items in these two questions to see which question then reads best who or what has attempted to you who or what have you tried to list the best reading question by the laws of listing and nulling be exact in following those laws or youll make the person even sicker use each of the 3 this way prepcheck any item that does not fn until it fns or proves not to be the correct one in which event correct the list if the list item does not fn on being found and indicated you prepcheck it to fn dianetics 305the new era dianetics hcobs fully cover assists and dianetic handling of body problems and illnesses this rundown is what could be known as beating an illness to death handling it medically and spiritually should bring home winner every time this full

has not been handled to ep on being pts these people by the way will tell you oh im not pts but your father is suing the org oh yes i know but it doesnt bother besides my illness is from something i ate last year and i rollercoaster because i dont like the examiner but im not pts the mystery is solved when you find they havent clue what the letters mean or what the condition is so give them copy

who is not hdc class iv okay to audit hgc by competent interneship to attempt pts rundown would be very risky for the pc as it needs exact listing exact trs exact metering exact code keeping and very honest auditing and competent csing development earlier discovery and development of the pts theory is extensively covered the recent wrapup came about through my ot research in november 1971 the principal breakthrough was realizing one should not invalidate having known certain people before this is similar to the past life discovery in 1950 some people thinking this was unpopular frowned on it some others were only famous characters so flagrantly that past lives were easily invalidated but people who dont go past track in dianetics dont recover even running them as imaginary as in science of survival advices suddenly breaks through for stalled dianetic case in this same way with young men and girls using i knew you when you were____ for 2d advantage tended to invalidate having known certain individuals before this life 310but now it turns out that the only pts situation that is serious and lasting and can cause rollercoaster comes from having known the person before this life possibly in the last life or earlier lives one knew persons before that life too this however shows up in the 3 s and ds breakdown there are only four points of breakdown of the pts rundown 1 improperly audited auditor not able to always do correct list trs out metering out poor r3r just plain untrained or not totally familiar with this rundown 2 pc not completely set up like has ta trouble but cs 53 done is change case but gf 40r done old auditing not repaired by gf and proper programming or cs 54 or too tired or too ill for the r3r 3 the rundown not fully and completely done but chopped or left incomplete pc will still rollercoaster 4 people who cant run engramswhich means druggie who hasnt had full drug rundown there is nothing especially tricky about the auditing of the pts rundown except that all auditing should be of flubless quality and when the pts rd is flubbed by bad lists or poor r3r or out trs or poor metering it really is mess the rd is so powerful that errors in csing and auditing it are especially rough currently sick pcs should not be run on the pts rundown as standard practice it is what they need but you can easily overwhelm sick pc with engram running the time to run pts rd is when the pc is set up and when it is noted the pc rollercoasters not when he collapses with temperature rollercoaster can also be caused by bad interiorization rd or int repair out lists bypassed charge of other descriptions these should be gotten rid of before pts rd is attempted behavior of rd valence shifts occur rapidly and frequently in pts rds and should be noted on the worksheet the r3r can sometimes be bit of long haul on basic incident be sure with an l3b but get an erasure of basic matter how hard you have to work at it in the pts rd incidents can develop missing pieces can appear whole new slant can occur on the subject when one goes to f2 after finishing f1 chronic somatics are likely to appear and be handled on this rundown and case conditions not previously remedied by other means can be remedied by this rundown end phenomena there is point where the pc is absolutely sure he knew the person before this life this is not the ep 311a pc can exteriorize on this rd that is not the ep but requires an int rd if none has been done before going on the ep is pc who is getting and keeping case gains and never again rollercoasters parts there are four parts to the rd present and past sds collect them up handle each valid item with r3r triple arc brk ptp wh and overts each triple if sds exist do 3 sds and r3r and ruds as above if folder get the pc to tell you any past sd items b 2wc who the pc has known this lifetime who has troubled or worried him include father mother wife or wives husband brothers sisters aunts uncles grandparents lovers treat any that read as likely ask if the pc has known person before this life if read r3r triple ruds overts triple c 2wc ask the pc who he has been after this life get various names ask if known before any that so read r3r triple ruds overts triple d 2wc ask pc places and planets known before this lifetime get some r3r triple ruds overts triple that is the extent of the rundown flows you cannot use flow 1 as any old direction to or from pc to do this fouls it up flow 1 is to the pc flow 2 is pc to the person or place flow 3 is the person or place to others if you did f1 r3r as locate time you knew____ you might get to the pc pc to the person or the person to others you would not get clean motivator f1 this would leave the pts chain partially run this is also true of the ruds redos if the pc does not recover then reasons for failure 1 to 4 above should be checked into then the lists and r3r should be handled with l4b and l3b then an overlooked item or person or place should be scouted for and handled there is question of the validity of the rundown it might have missed true love might have been passed over as unlikely but such obsessive attraction is always based on having known and probably done in the other person then the true ep will be attained where it only appeared to be before the commands 312see 3 sds hco bs 13 january 1968 sds 19 jan 6816 aug

communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 29 december 1978 remimeo cl iv grad checksheet class vi checksheet css class iv grad auditors ethics officers the suppressed person rundown magical new rundown at times the results of ordinary scientology tech are extremely impressive even to i am by this time quite accustomed to miracles as usual but magic is not quite so commonplace an occurrence even these days and is worthy of special note many times the suppressive person to whom the pc is pts exists in present time and is still capable of causing trouble or upset for the pc it is to this situation that the suppressed person rundown is addressed this new rundown the suppressed person rundown produces the wondrous result of changing the disposition of an antagonistic terminal at distance by auditing the pts preclear where this terminal was antagonistic invalidative hostile or downright suppressive he will suddenly have change of heart and seek to make peace with the pts pc this rundown is not considered complete until the magic occurs that is on this rundown we take pts pc and we audit this pc and audit him and audit him on problems processes until major change occurs in the antagonistic persons universe which prompts him to make friendly overture to or concerning the pc this friendly and unprompted origination or attempt at origination from the antagonistic terminal to or concerning the pc will occur in all cases if problems processes are run and are fully flattened this happens matter how out of comm the two terminals have been or what length of time has intervened between their last communication the rundown is continued until the ep occurs each problem process is run to its own ep when the pts rundown engram running has to be omitted because of clear or ot this suppressed person rundown can be substituted for the engram part of the pts rundown but if so it is still run to the full ep of the suppressed person rundown this is how it works the pc due to some act or acts previously committed has gone the effect of the antagonistic terminal the terminal then attempts to suppress the pc the pc already the effect of the terminal becomes the effect of the suppression so the pcs own postulate to improve himself and his conditions is countered by the suppressive terminals counterpostulate and he is thus given present time problem of sufficient magnitude to prevent case gain as only present time problem will halt the progress of case to the present time problem are added arc breaks with the antagonistic terminal and as only arc breaks will worsen case the result is gain or deterioration of case by reason of the suppressive connection in the environment 319a possible simple explanation for what occurs is the pc on running problems processes comes up to cause on his problems with the terminal and when he is continued on problems he will break through and actually run out the antagonistic terminals problems which he has given to him when this occurs the formerly antagonistic terminal will get into communication with the pc or by communicating in friendly way to others about the pc he will write letter to make peace or he will make phone call to say all is well or he will tell aunt sally he feels much better about the pc and has decided to let bygones be bygones it sometimes occurs that the antago person does not know where the pc is but he will still try to communicate this friendly origination by the antagonistic terminal is the ep of the rundown if the terminal hasnt yet originated you havent run enough problems processes the only time this doesnt work is when you havent run all possible problems processes or have run them with outtech such as broken meter when the rundown is done the suppressed person rundown is done after the education step laid out in hcob 31 dec 78 iii educating the potential trouble source the first step toward handling pts cs1 and after pts interview or 10 august interview or an sd has located the antagonistic terminal and handlings on that terminal have been done and after the pts rundown has been done this procedure is run on the antagonistic terminal in all instances even when the pts scene has apparently been relieved for the pc on earlier pts handling always run this problems procedure matter how successful earlier handlings were this rd is to repair the relationship the pc is given the rfactor to let the auditor know of any communication he receives from or about the antagonistic terminal he should not however be told what the ep of the rundown is how the rundown is done the problems processes used in the suppressed person rundown are given in hcob 30 dec 78 suppressed person rundownproblems processes and are run triple or quad flow in the order they are given each flow is checked for read before running and each charged flow is taken to the ep of fn cog vgis the ep of the rundown has been reached when the antagonistic terminal originates in friendly way to the preclear or seeks to communicate to the pc in friendly manner its not just cessation of hostilities its more than that even if the antagonistic terminal doesnt know the pcs address he will find out or he will put word out and the pc will hear from or about the antagonistic terminal and it will be friendly message even if the antagonistic terminal doesnt know the pcs address news will reach the pc that the antagonistic terminal wishes bygones to be bygones that is the ep you are aiming for and you continue to audit problems processes on the pc on the antagonistic terminal until that occurs it is very important not to underrun the rundown some auditors will be tempted to end off the rundown because the pc has had major win or ability regained or some such when the pc has had major win you would of course let him have his win and would leave him off auditing until the persistent fn dies down but you do not accept as the ep of the rundown anything other than the formerly antagonistic terminal originating with coaxing in friendly way to or about the pc you keep running problems until the ep is attained you do want to see the magic dont you and the only way this rundown can fail is by not continuing to run problems processes until this ep is attained 320who the rundown can be done on the suppressed person rundown can be done on any pts person of any case level it is run with good success on clears ots and dianetic clears as well as pcs just beginning their auditing the only requirement is that any pc who receives the rundown must first have received the pts cs1 per hcob 31 dec 78 iii and must if previously unindoctrinated have been educated into the procedures of scientology auditing by scientology cs1 per hcob 15 jul 78 scientology auditing cs1 and of course like any other auditing it is done with the pcs rudiments in auditor and cs note one of the many advantages of the suppressed person rundown is its simplicity there are very few places where it can go off the rails this rundown does however require expert metering and very standard handling and the cs should be alert to the following 1 the auditor must realize that the target of this rundown is not just the pc the target is the antagonistic terminal the pc is connected to and the ep is not just change in the pc but change in the antagonistic terminal of positive friendly communication to the pc the auditor and cs must realize that the above is the target and ep for this rundown 2 all problems processes must be run on the antagonistic terminal and failure to run enough problems processes is the only thing that will prevent this rundown from working 3 metering the auditor who does this rundown must be skilled at metering so he doesnt miss reads and fail to run reading flows or attempt to run unreading flows imprecise metering can undermine the results of the rundown as the running of all charged flows on problems is vital the auditor must be able to read meter and must take instant reads which occur instantly on calling the command reference hcob 5 aug 78 instant reads 4 eps each reading flow of each problems process must be taken to its full ep which is cog fn and vgis the cs should ensure that the processes are indeed taken to ep and should suspect if there is trouble attaining the rundown ep that one or more problems processes have been left underrun unflat or unrun some auditors may say theyve done the rundown and the pcs in beautiful shape and hes had tremendous gains and now the suppressed person rundown is complete your answer to this is finish the rundown continue until the terminal gets in touch with the pc to make peace and sure enough day or two or three later the pc in utter amazement will report that her sister who hasnt spoken to her for 10 years has just sent her an affectionate letter or that his father who disowned him when he got into scientology has just called to say hello and that they had great chat just like old times it always happens when problems processes are fully run so there you have it the suppressed person rundown quite an amazing magical feat and very easily achieved with good standard auditing use it well and fully and youll get smashing oneforone successes on pts pcs lrhjk l ron hubbard copyright

rundown pab 84 15 may 56 the reason why hcob 31 mar 60 the present time problem hcob 20 aug 58 present time problemrunning of pab 126 15 dec 57 problems handling and running this bulletin contains the problems processes to be run on the suppressed person rundown definition of problem the first and most vital action to begin the suppressed person rundown is to fully clear problem with the pc as problem not as condition or situation the war of purposes gives us what we call problems problem has the anatomy of purposes problem consists of two or more purposes opposed it does not matter what problem you face or have faced the basic anatomy of that problem is purposecounterpurpose the definition of problem is intention versus intention or two or more opposing and conflicting views on the same subject the dominant operating action of this rundown is knowing what problem is without the auditor feeding the pc cog he must clear the definition of problem with the pc so that it is fully understood and the pc can easily make up examples of problems youll get place on the rundown unless both auditor and pc understand what problem is running problems comes under gradient scale of confront and can go on and on before the pc gets up to an awareness of anything its really fascinating phenomenon the person is being harassed all over the place by something or somebody and he will eventually name it and identify it which is an achievement right there but when you first start to run problems on it youll find he does not have anything to do with it its all by itself floating out in space someplace the problem has nothing to do with him or anything else example auditor tell problem with your mother 322pc shes never home shes never home is not problem problem is twoterminaled the problem as the pc has given it in the example above does not contain anything live its just condition but gradually as problems processes are run he will come up to an actual statement that the problem is something that has to be solved and that it has something to do with him now were getting someplace problems processes the processes are taken up in the order they are given each flow of each process is checked for read before running it using the name of the terminal antagonistic to the pc each flow taken up is then run to the ep of cognition fn and vgis copy of this process sheet is placed in the folder of the pc being run on the suppressed person rundown and the flows of each process run are initialed and dated by the auditor when they have been taken to full ep end phenomena the suppressed person rundown is taken to the ep of friendly and unprompted origination to or about the pc by the antagonistic terminal this ep will occur when enough problems processes have been fully run on that terminal the auditors metering must be excellent as to miss reads and leave charged flows unrun can prevent the pc from attaining the ep of this rundown reference hcob 5 aug 78 instant reads hcob 3 dec 78 unreading flows if the pc has big win end off the session and let him have his win do not try to audit over persistent floating needle or you will end up leaving charged flows unhandled due to the needle having floated all the way through them so give the pc some time off auditing to let him have his win then resume his sessions so he can be taken to the full and magical ep of this rundown the only time this rundown doesnt work is when you havent fully run all possible problems processes 1 ref creation of human ability r234 f1 can you recall problem about

cases by long ways but they do occur on few cases these are continuous missed withholds and continuous overts this is not quite the same as the continuing overt act hco b 29 september 65 in that type the person is repeating overt acts against something usually named the continuous missed wh continuous missed withhold occurs when person feels some way and anyone who sees him misses it example doctor feels very unconfident of his skill every patient who sees him misses the fact that he is not confident this reacts as missed withhold it is of course based upon some bad incident that destroyed his confidence usually of an engramic intensity but as the person actively withholds this then those seeing him miss the withhold this could work in thousands of variations woman feels continuous disdain for her child but withholds it the child therefore continuously misses withhold all the phenomena of the missed wh would continuously react against the child probably all dishonest social conduct brings about continuous missed withhold the politician who hates people the minister who longer believes in god the mechanic who privately believes he is jinx on machinery these all then set up the phenomena of missed withholds on themselves and can dramatize it in their conduct the continuous overt person who believes he is harmful to others may also believe that many of his common ordinary actions are harmful he may feel he is committing continuous overt on others example clothing model believes she is committing fraud on older women by displaying clothing to them in which they will look poorly in her estimation this is continuous overt act of course all older women miss it on her 335appearance just being alive can be considered by some as an overt missed withhold phenomena will result degraded beings the continuous withhold and continuous overt are probably basis of feeling degraded degraded beings as described in admin knowhowalteris and degraded beings hco b 22 mar 67 are that way at least in part because they have some continuous missed withhold or fancied continuous overt act this makes them feel degraded and act that way handling one can add to any program check for continuous missed withhold or continuous overt as an additional version of rudiments master question which could be broken down into three lists which would have to be done by the laws of ln would be when anyone looks at you what feeling action attitude of yours do they miss then when was it missed who missed it and what did he do that made you believe it had been missed another approach less dangerous in that lists arent made would be for continuous missed withhold the question could be is there some way you feel that others dont realize and with 2wc uncover it then ask who misses this with answer followed by when has someone missed it with to an earlier time followed by what did he or she do that made you think he or she knew this will key it out and can change behavior for continuous overt act it would be is there something you do that others do not know about with 2wc to cover it and get what it is then ask who has not found out about it with an answer and then when did someone almost find out what did he or she do that made you think he or she knew each of the above questions should be fned motion people who have continuous withholds or overts tend to be very slow flubby and impositive they have to be very careful and they make mistakes slowness or robotness are keys to the presence of continuous missed withholds or overts pts quite often case is falsely labeled pts when in fact it is really matter of continuous missed withholds and continuous overts when pts person does not respond to pts handling easily then you know you are dealing with continuous missed withholds andor continuous overts 336summary these conditions are not present in all cases when they are you have degraded being when pts person does not respond to pts handling try continuous missed withholds and continuous overts you can prevent blows handle much he and r and change character in this way lrhntrd l ron hubbard copyright 1973 founder by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 337hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 20 october 1976 remimeo dpe ethics officer issue ii ptssp checksheet pts handling once in while i hear of pts handlings that didnt work or still pts or some such or ill come across such extremes as pts is virtually an incurable leper to be shunned and kept isolated or almost everyone is pts to some degree so what can you really do about it the basic thing to realize is that ptsness like any other case condition afflicting man responds to plain old standard tech but one has to have studied and understood that tech to apply it naturally i recall years ago in handling ptses that none of them at first knew what pts really meant or what it was all about even when they used the term freely so i recently called for pilot to see what would be the effect of study method of curing ptses first pilot before the final pilot was done an earlier pilot was attempted by an aide which was not conducted as laid down cs5 reviewed the failed pilot to find why so many failed on it 4 out of 6 were never completed and the 2 that did failed cs5 reported what i found on these was that they uniformly were not pts in the first place or were pts but that was not the major trouble with the person three of the cases 2 on auditing and i on study were outethics rsing exp dn cases who were trying to use pts as the reason for their behavior thus handling their ptsness would not resolve anything the most interesting case here was the study one who realized that he was not pts and that that had been wrong indication and that what was really wrong with him was that he had bad intentions and was committing overts one of the audited cases had similar realization but has not done as well on post and did get very sick 2 months or so later of the other 3 pilot cases in this first batch one could only come up with intheorg terminals so is another exp dn case and the other 2 assigned to study were severely bugged students so never got off the ground one has now finished the course 4 months later so thats what happened to the original pilot the second pilot was then ordered to determine the original possibility that people could study their way out of being pts second pilot three were put onto the ptssp checksheet to study and three were handled by internes who had done the ptssp checksheet themselves the cases handled by auditinginterview steps completed their handlings within 10 hours the study cases averaged 46 weeks of parttime study two studiers from the original pilot also completed the course all were then watched for bad originations to the examiner medical reports ethics trouble or trouble on post in all cases including those not yet complete on study none of these indicators showed up one case originated case troubles but this turned out to be one of the exp dn cases not ptsness on the study pilot the daily reports and success stories on completion uniformly mention more certainty more stability and being more at cause with the data of particular interest is that three of the participants cogged they were not actually pts yet evidence of real pts sits had 338gotten them on the project but while they were studying they would align past pts handlings they didnt fully understand at the time spot why past pts terminals were correct or incorrect spot terminals who gave them hard time in the past and see why certain people behaved the way they did in short it appears the studiers were blowing charge on their past pts handlings and on terminals in their life almost like an auditing session and while they were saying not pts longer pts now that they had the data is probably closer to the truth all are reported to be doing well on post with illness rollercoaster or ethics trouble the pts handlers who had done the ptssp pack were of particular use where the person had study bug that needed handling before study could be done and assisting in working out the handlings for pts sits that were uncovered also sds and 10 aug hcob handlings and pts interviews are not solo actions and it takes hours not intensives to handle false pts as noted from the first pilot false ptsness must be watched for as unhattedness ignorance of scientology basics for handling life past bad auditing uncorrected as well as unhandled bad intentions and personal outethics can be mistaken for ptsness and wont resolve as ptsness this should be suspected when your ptses start going above 20 of staff and public summary we have had the tech of ptsness for years but it wasnt being fully used and then got mixed in with exp dn ptsness can be handled routinely when the tech is fully known and applied pts person can be brought to cause over his situation through study of the pts tech this is vitally important for staff we can handle and the person himself can handle there is substitute for understanding lrhjent l ron hubbard copyright 1976 founder by

urgentimportant the end of endless int repair rundown exteriorization exteriorization is defined as the act of moving out of the body with or without full perception it is the fact of this act which proves that the individual is not body but an individual this discovery in 1952 proved beyond any question the existence of thetan that the individual was thetan not body and disproved that man was an animal and proved that he was spiritual being timeless and deathless _________ the issues on exteriorization and interiorization and the handling of outint have now been collected into the interiorization rundown series we have had the remedy for outint the interiorization rundown for some years now but we have also had pcs who ran into the need for excessive repair of the remedy itself much of this need for repair has stemmed from auditor errors in running or repairing int and these have been enumerated on other bulletins whatever the reasons for repair simple effective method of repairing int was needed this need has now been filled with the release of the new end of endless int repair rundown with the research that was done to develop this repair rundown which uses recalls i have also had the opportunity to reevaluate the original int rundown itself the result is newly revised int rundown so we have two very effective new tools for handling int 1 simplified interiorization rundown 2 the end of endless int repair rundown which handles int repair smoothly and terminatedly by special method of assessment and running it on recall flows the full steps of both of these rundowns are included in issues in the interiorization rundown series 340note per hcob 12 sep 78 urgent important dianetics forbidden on clears and ots dianetic clears scn clears and ots are not to be audited on the int rundown as it uses dianetics they may be run on the end of endless int repair rd hcob 24 sep 78 i int rd series 4 as it runs int on recalls additionally the basics on exteriorization and interiorization are covered quite fully in the int rd series particularly in hcob 4 jan 71r exteriorization and high ta the interiorization rundown revised any auditor who is going to go near an int rundown or an int repair action must know those fundamentals cold he must understand that it is the first of chain or the first part of an experience or first experience basic on the chain of incidents that has to be run for the chain or incident to erase in other words he must understand the principle of getting the earlier beginning to an incident or an earlier incident in order to erase chains as in r3ra he must understand that if one is in something he must have gotten into it and that therefore the beginning of an exteriorization is an interiorization the full theory on this also is covered in the above hcob 4 jan 71r which the auditor should be fully familiar with there is some further data which you should have on the subject of int and flows basically int is compound of stuck flows and prior incidents there is stuck flow of obsessively going in in most of the pcs int engrams youve got an operating trigger that puts him into them the earlier beginning is always in these must be audited out blown before youre through with int the way this trigger works is for example pc may blow out of his head with fn vgis on tuesday but he has not erased the basic on int he went out on reaction flow on tuesday on friday he comes in with his ta at 5 what has happened is the flow has retriggered hes now blown back in on rereaction flow any regular auditing and he will plow in deeper so youve got to handle his int terminatedly prior to now an int rundown has been done by clearing and then assessing the int buttons went in and go in if one of them read the int button was first run on recall triple or quad flows next on secondaries triple or quad flows and then on engrams triple or quad flows this handled int for many many pcs but it is probable that one reason we also got so many int repairs was that in many of these repair cases the pc never ran any basic beginning the int rundown with recalls with the stuck flow of going in still in operation you could get keyout keyin keyout keyin repeatedly and not get to the basic we had an exteriorization command in the early years which was try not to be three feet back of your head and it exteriorized people but all that did was unstick the flow and trigger the person out of his head youre likely to get the same result if you run int by recall first crack you give the command recall time and boom hes out but he hasnt run the basic on int so if you entered an int rundown on recall basis you could get some of that mechanism cutting in and you could get repetitive int with the engrams he didnt run out keying in there is another phenomenon that can occur time itself can be stuck flow you get certain number of pcs who cant move back on the time track more than minutes they get stuck on the stuck flow of time on recall commands such pc may fn 341very quickly or even on an r3ra command locate time when you went in he may run shallow he may run only locks and fn quickly then suddenly he hits the skids and goes hurtling backtrack the flow is reversed and he doesnt fire out of his head he fires backwards on the time track on restim and youll have outint repeating itself all over again thats the rest of the mechanism addressed in r3ra engram auditing properly done always getting the earlier beginning andor the earlier incident these chains of incidents on the stuck flow of going in can be audited out in an orderly fashion on the majority of pcs you erase the engrams and you dissolve the obsessive stuck flow of going in and you have the ep of int or at some point in the engram auditing the flow gets unstuck enough to heave into reverse it heaves in the opposite direction and it erases itself and the whole package blows that too is an ep for int which must not be ignored by the auditor see hcob 4 jan 71r thereafter the pc will usually have more trouble or concern with int so we are safer entering the int rundown by running engrams to begin with and running only engrams on that rundown and that is how the revised int rundown has now been set up we had better run the engram chains and their basics out first and then if repair is needed repair them with recalls using the end of endless int repair rundown more on recalls entering int with recalls has its liabilities as described above but there are also definite advantages in having recalls as tool to use as necessary in running int on some cases you are going to encounter some few isolated instances where the pc cant run engrams for one reason or another such pcs can then be audited by the recall method as given in the end of endless int repair rundown using the rundown not as repair but as process dianetic clears scn clears and ots can be handled on outint with this method it can also be used to relieve outint on weak or ill pcs until they are up to running engrams it is not fast method using the recall system per end of endless int repair rd to run outint can go on and on in time though by taking the pc up on gradient you can eventually get him to point where he is actually asising engrams blowing them by inspection the revised int rundown is by far the swifter route for handling pc initially on outint however the use of recalls is ideal in the handling of repair of int when it is necessary after an int rundown has been done the end of endless int repair rundown gives the exact method for assessment of the int buttons and flows and running these on recalls as repair action and here we get smooth run on the recall flows and the resolving of any int troubles thus from this research we get new simplified version of the int rundown and an invaluable process for any int repair further issues in the int rundown series cover these and other technical data relating to int l

outint on these pcs and preots is hcob 24 sep 781 int rd series 4 urgent important the end of endless int repair rundown for long while we have known that if you audit person after he or she has exteriorized you often get high tone arm somatics and an upset case the answer has been to cease to audit person after exteriorization has occurred 343this is so much fact that five out of five in trouble cases i recently examined had every one of them been audited for some time after they exteriorized the ta had or had not gone high but the cases were bogged they revived at once when the fact of exteriorization was located fn vgis and when rehabbed by counting number of times somatics ceased the rule has beendont audit after pc has exteriorized this is one of those very fundamental things that seems to defy research and yet if not solved will keep things messed up persons who exteriorize on lower grades need their upper grades and yet if audited further may mess up this places limit on auditing and yet the person may still have aberrations and somatics but the fact of having exteriorized bars the road so i got to work and made breakthrough on it hurrah it has now been fully vindicated by long tests and is now released for general use exteriorization exteriorization is defined as the act of moving out of the body with or without full perception it is the fact of this act which proves that the individual is not body but an individual this discovery in 1952 proved beyond any question the existence of thetan that the individual was thetan not body and disproved that man was an animal and that he was spiritual being timeless and deathless techniques have existed since 1952 that exteriorize person these are not now used because the person still being aberrated and not clear soon returns to his body and b when audited thereafter has trouble this is major problem thetan sometimes has at death how to exteriorize he makes it eventually of course but he should be able to do so at once but in my research i found it unreasonable that person would be hard to audit just because he had exteriorized and had reinteriorized for he has obviously done just that at every death and birth and must have done so hundreds of billions of times so why should recent exteriorization then make him hard to audit yet it did my asking of that question was the first breakthrough the rest soon followed engram behavior we know in dianetics that if you continue to run the last part of an engram which has in fact an earlier beginning which isnt being run and is ignored the ta will go up the reason for this is that the first of chain or the first part of an experience or first experience basic on chain of incidents has to be run for the chain or incident to erase if you only ran the end of incidents you would get high ta and erasure if you only ran incidents late on the chain you would get high ta pcs are uncomfortable feel under pressure when their ta is high above 35 or up 344if you dont erase incidents or chains of incidents when auditing or key them out as in release you get perpetually high ta high ta cases have been overrun on something that however is very oversimplified explanation the truth is that they have been run on something that didnt erase the something has an earlier beginning than was detected or an earlier incident in life one having engrams about it adds new incidents in living until something is overrun or done too often the ta is therefore high ta records mass mental mass has higher electrical resistance and so measures more ohms of resistance an electrical term for the trouble electricity has in passing through something the more resistance the more units of resistance are recorded on the meter the ta actually measures resistance thus the end of an incident can be restimulated if the beginning of it is never touched then one will just accumulate more and more mass the missed beginning what has happened here as regards exteriorization is that we have concentrated on exteriorization if one is in something he must have gotten into it therefore the beginning of an exteriorization is the interiorization the being went into something before he went out of it exteriorization occurs at death thats an engram interiorization occurs at birth thats an engram so when somebody goes exterior he is actually liable to keyin having gone interior in the first place get it so when you exteriorize somebody or he exteriorizes during auditing he gets keyedin bit and without having audited earlier interiorizations he has been put in the last part exteriorization of an incident which began with interiorization not only are you touching on something exteriorization late on chain which has hundreds of billions of like incidents ahead of it you are also touching something which is late in the incident which began with interiorization on both counts then the ta may go high the remedy the remedy is to audit out interiorizations ie times the person went in using the correctly assessed int button if this is done then the pc can be audited all you want after exteriorization auditing the interiorizations with r3ra quad or triple flows restores the possibility of auditing pc after an exteriorization has occurred in auditing 345int rundown revised by steps based on recent researches the original int rundown has been newly revised and simplified full array of int buttons has been added the recall and secondary steps have been deleted so the pc gets to the basic of any int trouble on faster route int chains are run using simpler r3ra command for int and each chain taken to full new era dianetics ep the revised rundown follows the process the interiorization rundown revised the case supervision directions for an interiorization rd are to be done by scientology auditor who is also hubbard new era dianetics auditor he must have an excellent command of metering trs r3ra the theory of int and the int rd commands and he must know and be able to recognize an fn postulate and full dianetic ep when these occur 1 omit ruds of any kind and do not attempt rapid l1c the ta will just go up out the roof on any type of ruds or list simply start the session and go right onto the following steps 2 with the pc on the meter have him read pages 13 of this bulletin hcob 4 jan fir through the section entitled the remedy cear up any confusion handle any misunderstood words help the pc do simple demo of the theory that in is the earlier beginning or the earlier similar incident of out this is not to be clay demo nor complex keep it simple just ensure the pc gets it 3 clear exteriorization with the pc as the act of moving out of the body with or without full perception make certain hes got it demo it if necessary 4 check for having been audited after exteriorization ta should come down and fn cog vgis 5 rehab rehabilitate this condition by getting or counting the number of times exteriorized you should get fn cog vgis 6 assess the following list of int buttons do not clear the buttons first int buttons go in went in put in interiorized into something 346want to go in cant get in kicked out of spaces cant go in being trapped forced in pulled in if none of the int buttons read on this assessment get in suppress invalidate and misunderstood on the int button list do not omit this basic rule of assessment ref hcob 15 oct 73ra cs series 87ra nulling and fning prepared lists 7 then clear and demo only the button that reads if the pc seems disinterested or unhappy with the button that reads check false caution the pc may have an mu which caused particular button to read thus ensure the button is not reading on an mu and if button has read on an mu then clear it and reassess it dont give the pc wrong item or even monkey around with wrong item the above actions help you ensure getting the correct int button it is important in clearing the reading buttons that the pc understands you will be auditing times he went in or was being trapped etc and not was in or was already trapped or was stuck in etc you will be auditing the actual times the action of moving in occurred the above clearing steps are vital as the pc will not be able to do the int rd over misunderstoods or on misassessed int button to audit him over mus constitutes breach of the auditors code on the other hand do not overdo these clear ing actions as you already have pc on your hands who is in trouble note if none of the int buttons read even when suppress invalidate and misunderstood are applied do not clear them and do not continue the int rundown steps 8 when the largest reading button has been cleared per step 7 take that button and run it r3ra quad triple if pc is only triple each flow is taken to full dianetic ep using the command locate time when you int button example int button with largest read forced in run fl 1 locate time when you were forced in to full dn ep fl 2 locate time when you forced another in to full dn ep fl 3 locate time when others forced others in to full dn ep 347fl 0 locate time when you forced yourself in to full dn ep notethe quad command wordings for each of the int buttons are listed on hcob 25 sep 781 int rd series 5 quad commands for int buttons do not ever run pc on flow zero for the first time on int triple pc can be quaded up after int handling is complete but it is never done on int handling or int repair 9 when all four flows on the reading button have each been run to full ep reassess the int button list per step 6 if another button now reads repeat steps 7 and 8 should you have persistent fn after the four flows on the first button have been run reassess the next day per step 6 and if any button then reads repeat steps 7 and 8 if on the other hand you now have an fning int button list it is safe to end off the int rundown 10 otherwise you continue to assess the int button list per step 6 and to run any reading item r3ra quad or triple per steps 7 and 8 until the entire int button list is fning on assessment do not overrun the int rundown see section below on vital data on int rd end phenomena caution any flow on any reading button must be run to ep in one session and the int rundown must be completed in as few sessions as possible 11 the final step which is done after the final session preferably on another later day is 2way comm session on intext ref hcob 30 may 70r int rd series 3 interiorization intensive 2way comm running int with r3ra the r3ra steps and procedure are standard except that they address the subject of interiorization expressed as any one of the buttons on the int button list note that new era dianetics preassessment is not included in the revised int rundown nor is the running of aesps see hcob 24 sep 78 ii int rd series 13 preassessment aesps and int in running the int chain or chains it is important to run the actual going in action which would be near or at the beginning of the incident thus if the pc is running an incident where he is already in ensure you check for an earlier beginning to the incident to pick up the going in type of action the questions to find an earlier beginning when running r3ra are is there an earlier beginning to this incident or does the one were running start earlier or does there seem to be an earlier starting point to this incident the earlier similar command when running r3ra is is there an earlier incident when you int button 348each flow must be taken to basic and the full dianetic ep of fn postulate postulate off

routine 3ra engram running b cha ins vital data on int rd end phenomena exteriorization is not the ep of the int rundown if it happens that the pc goes exterior during the rd you end off gently as in any other auditing but that is not the ep and you may have to pick him up again later and complete the int rd or handle it with the end of endless int repair rundown the ep of the int rundown is more concern or trouble with exteriorization or interiorization this is generally accomplished by auditing the pc to an fning int button list but there is another phenomenon that can occur while running int it is vital that an auditor does not miss this should it happen it goes like this youre auditing along and suddenly some mass discharges down comes the ta you suddenly have floating ta and thats it the pc has hit the ep if you proceed past that point youre in trouble you dont then reassess the int button list and you dont continue running quad flows even if all the flows have not yet been run on one reading button you do nothing but take your paws off the meter and gently end the session if you do otherwise you can mess up case it isnt exteriorization exteriorization could occur at the same time however we could not care less because exteriorization is not the ep of the process but at any point at which the above phenomenon occurs on the int rdmass moves off the ta comes crashing down and you cant keep the needle on the dial because the ta itself is floatingyou end off the rundown because you have the ep what has happened here is that youve blown the stuck flow of going in int sends the ta up because the person has plowed deeper into more and more mass and come out of less and less mass you have been auditing the pc on what has been for eons stuck flow of obsessively going in at any point in the auditing that stuck flow can suddenly give way it heaves in the opposite direction and the stuck flow of going in vanishes when that happens its the end of the process as that is all you want to accomplish with the int rundown if you were then to check the int button list which you do not do at this point you would find the int buttons all fning future auditing 349when the pc has attained the ep of int either on the above phenomenon or by reassessing the int buttons and running them on the flows to an fning int button list one should now be able to audit the pc even after exteriorization however hcob 7 mar 75 ext and ending session would still be applied warning the int rundown is major case action and should only be run when the pc is rested and in good physical

it complements it when necessary as it runs int by recalls we audit out the int engrams on the int rundown then if repair is needed the end of endless int repair rd can be used to clean it up smoothly with recalls it is the answer to overrepair of int on any pc additionally it can be used for handling int repair on clears ots and dianetic clears the above hcob 24 sep 78 i fully covers the purpose and use of this valuable new repair rundown summary if pc goes exterior on dianetics or any scientology auditing you must as his next session check the int buttons for read and if any read clear them and do the new vastly simplified and revised int rundown using the above cs with this done the pc can go on being audited and if repair is needed the end of endless int repair rundown is the answer these new developments and refinements give us simpler more thorough tech for resolving int than we have ever had before the way is open to more powerful ots all fundamental discoveries are

intensive 2way comm the interiorization rundown revised hcob of 4 jan 71r exteriorization and high tas the interiorization rundown revised is always followed by final session with 2way comm on interiorizationexteriorization if the interiorization auditing has to be repaired that is done first of course but an interiorization rundown is never complete until an additional later session is given on 2way comm on interior exterior cs in repairing cases should always look to see if pc 1 has exteriorized at some time during auditing 2 if the pc has exteriorized and has not had an int rd int must be checked per hcob 4 jan 71r and if charged the only cs that can now be done is the interiorization rundown except on cears or above who get the recall version 3 if an int rundown has been given then the cs must check to see if later session was given on 2way comm intext 4 if this 2way comm was omitted or not in separate session then 2way comm on intext must be ordered even if there have been several intervening sessions the process as an auditor you would give the pc an rfactor that you are going to go over the subject of interiorization and exteriorization with him get him to tell you how he feels about these based on the int buttons that was assessed and run and on the subject of int in general the twoway comm session is always taken to fn cog 351it is usually the case that the pc did not fully cognite when he had the int rundown his ta may stay high after an int session or is of little use to get it down whats missing is the 2way comm session in it the pc usually cognites and things then go right the current cs and auditor error is trying to do everything briefly and all at once ordering an int rundown and 2way comm on it in the same session would be part of such an erroneous trend the 2way comm must be another session preferably on another later day it is flagrant cs error to omit 2way comm intext after an interiorization rundown session the signal to order check on interiorization per hcob 4 jan 71r is pc went exterior in auditing or has been found to have gone exterior auditing will not run well when the pc is audited past or after exteriorizing if charged an int rundown must now be ordered if unsuccessful it must be repaired successful or repaired an int rundown must be followed by the 2way comm session twoway comm must be done with exact trs the auditor must not q and he must not evaluate tell the pc what its all about twoway comm is precision process the pc is kept talking not by giving him commands he is kept on the subject of intext or the 2way comm subject not encouraged to leap about by q and you cannot consider an interiorization rundown complete unless followed by 2way comm if the case hasnt had it following his int rundown he must be ordered to it l ron hubbard founder lrhdzkardkjm copyright 1970 1978 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 352hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 24 september 1978ra issue i remimeo revised 21 february 1979 auditors cl iv grad all changes are in this type style checksheet ellipses indicate deletions techqual note some auditors have had trouble with this rundown it has therefore been extensively revised as per this issue before running pc on this rundown get the auditor m9ed and m4ed and starrated on the rd also make sure that he can operate meter and do trs if he has trouble with it in the future these changes in this rd are considerable and are for immediate use and the earlier rendition of it is not to be used outint as case condition along with r3ra audited over and beyond dianetic clear are primary reasons for case bogs the percentage of outint may be as much as 75 in any given area therefore the int rd run with ned on nonclears and the end of endless int repair rundown are the most important single auditing actions an auditor can do and will produce the most surprising results when the condition is present and is expertly audited interiorization rundown series 4ra urgentimportant the end of endless int repair rundown we needed rundown that would handle what for some pcs has been an endless trail of repair of repair of repair of int i have now fully researched and developed the process to handle this and can release it for broad use the end of endless int repair rundown is just that it is the answer to int troubles the rundown consists of running int by recall by very precise and simple method at first glance it would not seem possible that such process would handle the more resistiveappearing int repair problems which keep coming up on some pcs this appearance is deceptive however as the process is very very effective it runs lightly and easily on pcs but with farreaching results skillfully handled it quite miraculously smooths out and resolves int on both new pcs and those pcs on whom int repeatedly kicks in of course an int rundown has to be run per hcob 4 jan 71r but when it is later found that the int rundown must be repaired then this rundown is used it does not replace the original int rundown which has been newly revised with several more buttons and new era dianetics commands added hcob 4 jan 71r rather it complements it 353the end of endless int repair rd can be run on dianetic clears as it addresses int with recalls note it can not be run on any pc or preot in the noninterference zone those between r6 solo and ot iii attest as the end of endless int repair rd is major action not repair action it is forbidden to be run on anyone in the noninterference zone where person in the noninterference zone has been run on end of endless int he should finish up his current solo level as feasible and get onto his next solo level anyone who has been run on end of endless int while on ot iii should be finished up as feasible on solo ot iii and gotten onto ned for ots in certain isolated cases this process could be used as preliminary method for handling int on pcs who are weak or ill and not immediately up to running engrams or secondaries or it could be used to cool down outint on new pc who exteriorizes on objectives and has not yet had dn cs1 or any ned auditing but it is not substitute for the revised int rundown and in the above instances you may find the pc may eventually need the revised int rundown itself the prime purpose and use of the end of endless int repair rundown is exactly as its name implies to handle an endless repair of repair of repair of int if regular int rundown has been done and int continues to kick in after fully standard int correction the end of endless int repair rundown is the answer it effectively resolves persistent int problems when to run an end of endless int rundown when an auditor or cs encounters outint on case there is choice of what action to take to handle it the choice depends on what actions have been taken previously on the case on the subject of int the first thing to determine is whether or not int is actually out you cannot audit person on anything else besides int if int is out you also cannot run anything which is not charged reading as to do so hangs the pc with wronguncharged item an auditor getting read on the int section of the cs 53 must be careful to verify that this is valid read and not false read or protest read this is very important as you must not audit pc on int if it is not charged and you must not audit pc on anything else if int is out you determine whether the pc has already had an int rundown and whether it was correctly done or flubbed if it was flubbed were dianetic errors repaired with an l3rf on the dianetic chains has the pc had an int rundown correction list these must be determined because the end of endless int rundown is not substitute for the int rundown and it does not substitute for an int rundown correction list dianetic errors must be repaired with an l3rf these must be determined by folder study and fes of the int rundown and any repairs of int rundown if the pc has had an int rundown and it has been flubbed you would do an int rundown correction list and handle all of the various actions necessary providing this is within the normal time span of the rundown dont try this months or years later the end of endless int rundown will not repair flagrant dianetic errors if the pc is having or was recently given an int rundown which has bogged or failed then an int rundown correction list including repair of any dianetic errors is to be done if the pc still has outint despite having had the int rundown and it has been repaired and all that is usual and ordinary has been done then you would do the end of endless int rundown 354you must determine whether the pc is dianetic clear or whether he has become one somewhere along the line if the pc has had dianetic clear rehabbed since the original int rd check the dates to determine whether the pc was run on the int rd by r3r or r3ra when he was dianetic clear if so this can be repaired by indicating to the pc that he was run on the int rd on r3r or r3ra after dianetic cear if these int dianetic chains are now reading repair them by assessing an l3rf and indicating do not get into running or continuing any r3r or r3ra on dianetic clear if the person is dianetic clear and int is still out for some peculiar reason best known to man or beast the only choice we have is the end of endless int rundown the way to determine whether int is out is normally by assessment of the cs 53 buttons and it is on this prepared list that outint is most often detected you dont flatten the button or try to handle the button that was found on the cs 53 this is the one exception on the cs 53 whereby you do not just fn it on the cs 53 and go on we have to examine the condition of the person on the subject of int as above to determine which way to go therefore you stop right there with cs 53 being careful to verify the fact that you actually have read on int and not false read or protest read and remember that some pcs especially when int has been run or repaired when it wasnt charged can get so protesty on the subject that int will now give false read whenever it is mentioned due to protest an auditors trs metering and obnosis of the pc and whether the pc is in session or not have to be bad for this to occur or for the auditor to now fail to determine whether it is valid or false read on int having determined that you do have valid read on int you would not proceed with the cs 53 but end off the session int rundown table the following table tells the auditor and cs which way to go when handling outint once filled out this table should be kept with the pc folder summary in front inside of the pc folder beneath the pgm and the table should be updated yes ais the read on int valid read ____ ____ is there any evidence of the pc having been run on int due to false or protest read ____ ____ any evidence of the read being caused by misu word ____ ____ if yes on above get false read and protest cleaned up or the misu cleared and recheck the buttons on section of cs 53 to find out if int is charged b has the pc had full int rundown ____ ____ if or incomplete it would have to be repaired and completed note the int rd would not be run on dianetic clear clear or ot as they are not to be run on dianetics in any form c has the pc had an int rundown correction list ____ ____ if not and there is any evidence of errors or lack of expected result this should be done before continuing the int rd or doing end of endless int rundown and if the pc has had several int rundown correction lists realize that either the auditor cant make list read or is only getting false reads 355d have any r3r or r3ra dianetic errors on the int rundown been corrected with an l3rf ____ ____ if not get these repaired as continuing the rd or doing end of endless int rundown wont solve r3r or r3ra errors eis the pc dianetic clear or above ____ ____ was the pc dianetic clear when the int rd was run on him by r3r or r3ra ____ ____ if yes to either above you must not run any dianetics but if int is still out after repairing any errors the end of endless int rundown can be done on dianetic clear it can not be done between r6 solo and ot iii attest if the pc was run on dianetics on the int rd after dn cear the first action is to indicate the error of running dianetics after clear and then repair any reading dianetic int chain with an l3rf taking care to handle the reading lines by indication only and not get into any running of dianetics this action alone will often cure any int trouble on dn clear but if int is still reading you can now handle it with the end of endless int rundown the end of endless int rundown procedure having determined that you are going to do the end of endless int rundown from the table above you proceed as follows 1 the auditor has the pc demonstrate the various flows remember that this must not be arduous because it is actually almost auditing to do this and the persons int is out if the pc is triple pc have him demonstrate flows 1 2 3 if the pc is quad pc have him demonstrate flows 1 2 3 0 do not engage in flying ruds word clearing touch assists havingness or any other auditing over outint 2 assess the end of endless int rundown buttons take the largest read 3 you then proceed to run this button with the end of endless int rundown this is done by assessing the flows take the flow that reads the largest and using the recall process that applies to that flow run it until an fn is achieved 4 then reassess all flows youll find the one you ran will be fning another flow will be reading run the best reading flow by the recall process until it fns you repeat this procedure until all flows fn if during the period you are running these flows on that button the pc has large cog fn gis remember that you may have blown all flows at that moment without interrupting the pcs cognition you realize that you are finished with assessing the flows of this button for cautions sake you check the button to see if it now reads of course it will fn 5 you now reassess the whole end of endless int rundown button list the whole list might fn at this point on the other hand it might not if you get read on this assessment you treat it exactly the same as you did priorly steps 3 4 5 you keep this up until you get an fning assessment of the int buttons 3566 you then wait week and reassess the int buttons list again if you get read check for false read check for protest make sure it is valid read that you have and if it is you treat that button exactly the same as above and proceed per steps 3 4 5 when you get an fning assessment of the int buttons after the one week wait the end of endless int rundown is complete and the pc is sent to declare the int buttons go in went in put in interiorized into something want to go in cant get in kicked out of spaces cant go in being trapped forced in pulled in pushed in example int button assessed put in assess the four flows with the wordings for that button but without using the word recall f1 you were put in something x f2 you put another in something f3 others put others in something x f0 you put yourself in something sf flow 2 reads best so run flow 2 to fn using the entire recall command ie recall time when you put another in something reassess all four flows as above using the same int button 357examples of the running commands for put in would be if f1 reads recall time when you were put in something to fn if f2 reads recall time when you put another in something to fn if f3 reads recall time when others put others in something to fn if f0 reads recall time when you put yourself in something to fn cautions and cs tips the only time you check the button again while assessing flows is when the pc has had cog fn gis at which time you must suspect that the whole button has blown this by the way happens in int rundowns and is the commonest cause of overrun int there is another way of addressing this if the pc isnt getting cognitions to amount to anything when you get all flows on button fning you can end off the session and check the next day to see if the flows are still fning it some times happens where you have not very responsive pc that it takes several days of assessment of the flows which fned yesterday to carry the fn through whole day these flows often read again the next day this is because you are running recall processes and recall processes are simply keyouts therefore you are getting something keying in and keying out and keying in and keying out this is eventually overcome where you are doing this daytoday handling of the same button it would be vital to check the button for read before you assessed the flows on it the next day the oneweek wait is compromise for the 3 to 10 day keyout period you cant say wait for 3 to 10 days so it is set at one week during the rundown there may have been momentary stirup of some kind such as tiny ripple on an auditors trs rendition or badly mishandled origin that could cause an arc break needle or something like this could happen so if you wait week such trouble will key out before you assess the buttons list again or you may have been riding win persistent fn on one button when the whole subject of int is not handled and you will get environmental restimulation remember you are only handling recalls and little more recalls run will probably blow it for good so you are waiting week to see if the environment keys him in again you reassess week later and if the buttons are all clean fine but if something reads on the week later assessment that must mean an engram or something is pretty close to the surface still you then handle it again and this time the little point that was missed will turn up and that will be the end of that you handle the buttons to fning assessment and then that is the end of that the end of endless int repair there is second wait for another week now of course if during the oneweek wait the pc gets keyedin again or originates or by reason of bis or manifestation that int is still out you would not robotically wait out the whole week before giving the next session as you now know he is not on persistent fn and you know there is more to handle and on the reassessment of the buttons after the week wait the auditor must again be sure that it is valid read on int and not false or protest read before he launches off into running anything again false reads on the assessment protest reads or the pc suffering from something else entirely besides outint can cause false read on assessment of the int buttons hence the necessity to be sure you have valid read before you proceed and if the pc is caved in or bis about it there is little checklist that tells cs what to do about that too the things that could go wrong are rather simple and are few in number these are int wasnt out in the first place 358b the pc has been run on false reads c the pc was suffering from something else entirely other than outint d the auditors trs are bad or broke the auditors code the auditors metering was bad giving wrong assessments f the auditor overran fns or reran flow that just fned invalidating the fn just gotten g pc had misu on the word recall and was trying to run through engrams on the recall process h the pc had major cog on the subject of int blowing the whole thing and the auditor went on overrunning the int rundown or end of endless int rundown i pc was audited on some other action other than int while int was outsuch as rudiments touch assists word clearing or any other auditing or assist action including illegal 2way comms about his case or auditing coffee shop or eval or inval by his friends or others between sessions j errors on the original int rd werent repaired before starting the end of endless int rundown if cs cant tell by folder inspection which of these it is he can have the pc interviewed by d of p to find out or even get the above assessed to find out which it is vital data on int rd end phenomena exteriorization is not the ep of the int rundown if it happens that the pc goes exterior during the rd you end off gently as in any other auditing but that is not the ep and you may have to pick him up again later and complete the int rd or handle it with the end of endless int repair rundown the ep of the int rundown is more concern or trouble with exteriorization or interiorization this is generally accomplished by auditing the pc to an fning int button list but there is another phenomenon that can occur while running int it is vital that an auditor does not miss this should it happen it goes like this youre auditing along and suddenly some mass discharges down comes the ta you suddenly have floating ta and thats it the pc has hit the ep if you proceed past that point youre in trouble you dont then reassess the int button list and you dont continue running quad flows even if all the flows have not yet been run on one reading button you do nothing but take your paws off the meter and gently end the session if you do otherwise you can mess up case it isnt exteriorization exteriorization could occur at the same time however we could not care less because exteriorization is not the ep of the process 359but at any point at which the above phenomenon occurs on the int rdmass moves off the ta comes crashing down and you cant keep the needle on the dial because the ta itself is floatingyou end off the rundown because you have the ep what has happened here is that youve blown the stuck flow of going in int sends the ta up because the person has plowed deeper into more and more mass and come out of less and less mass you have been auditing the pc on what has been for eons stuck flow of obsessively going in at any point in the auditing that stuck flow can suddenly give way it heaves in the opposite direction and the stuck flow of going in vanishes when that happens its the end of the process as that is all you want to accomplish with the int rundown if you were then to check the int button list which you do not do at this point you would find the int buttons all fning repairing repair over the years int auditing has tended to be flubby int repair has been far too frequent and even repetitive on some pcs some auditors and cses have decided int rds were delicate or difficult or very special well int is special and sometimes delicate but its not difficult if an auditor is going to audit the int rundown successfully he must be skilled at metering he must be flubless on r3ra and the commands of the process and understand the theory of int he must know what an fn is and what dianetic ep is and be able to recognize these when they occur much of the int repair needed stems from errors made by auditors or cses running int when it was not needed running it with the idea it would exteriorize the pc auditing the rd over misunderstoods overrunning the rd these are all violations of the auditors code many of them then further complicated by dianetic errors in running or repairing int there is another factor regarding the original int rundown which must not be overlooked although it comes under the heading of overrunning the int rundown it is sometimes neither seen nor understood in doing the original int rundown it can occur that it completes before all flows are run example the auditor runs flow i on engrams on the revised int rd then flow 2 and suddenly gets wide persistent fn and dramatic resurge of the pc the ta goes into lower range and the pc is bright and smiling then the auditor if hes an idiot proceeds to robotically run flow 3 and flow 0 the ta goes back up the pcs chronic headache turns back on and the pc is set up for an endless repair of int i have seen this happen several times the int rundown finished itself and nobody noticed except the pc this is probably the most flagrant cause of int repair and is peculiar to this rundown the way to handle this is to rehab the point of completion as best you can and then run the recall version as given above and you will find that it usually comes out straight the best way to handle of course is to do it right in the first place but if added to any or all of the above you get an int correction list misassessed so that whats really wrong is missed and falsely reading item taken up you wind up with mess 360there is excuse for overrunning the rundown for auditors code breaks poor metering or flubby dianetic auditing on the other hand interiorization like any other condition connected with engrams may have many chains connected with it thus the process of daytoday living can restimulate those chains and throw int out cs faced with the possibility of any or all of the above being wrong could find himself staring into maze and he could err and order correction list after correction list ad infinitum the rule is the correct action to take first if someone is having trouble with int is to always get thorough fes done on the original int rd itself and any int repairs that have been donebefore another correction list is ordered very often the answer to the puzzle then leaps out get the errors corrected correctly any misassessed lists misrun dianetic chains code breaksget it all cleaned up by an auditor who can read meter and run and repair dianetics flublessly dont let any auditor who isnt flubless on these points near an int pc with the errors truly and standardly handled and out of the way if int then continues to kick in its not another int rd or another int correction list its the end of endless int repair rundown you use run it to its ep and that will be the end of the trail of endless int repair if the cs is in doubt about all this and gets into mess trying to repair chains he can cut directly onto this repair rundown as above with simply the recall processes and he will get someplace after an int rd or end of endless int rundown has been com pleted on case and declared the next action must be cs 53 assessed and handled to fning list this must be done as the next action and may not be left not done the reason for this is that there are other things that can be wrong with case all of which are covered on the cs 53 and these too must be handled there is reason now for any pc or cs to continue to be plagued with int troubles we have here rundown which is easily and simply done which can be run on dianetic cear or preot who is not on ot iii or anywhere between r6 solo and ot iii

reading button run on quad or triple flows and with reassessment of the int buttons the one session rule may not be workable without quickieing the rundown which must not be done thus allowance must be made for sufficient time to get the rundown done fully while still completing it as rapidly as possible to safeguard against outruds situations cropping up before it is complete the safest way to accomplish this is to ensure that the int rundown 3721 is completed in as few sessions as possible 2 after the first session each succeeding session is given on the next consecutive day 3 plenty of

an mu on the word yet was run hcob 4 jan 71r this classifies as running an unreading item common int error is that the pc is not cleared on the concept of interiorization and the words and commands so he is being audited over misunderstoods or the int rd could have been overrun the ep is reached on f2 let us say the auditor keeps on going past the win this will hang up the rundown one of the ways an overrun occurs is the pc goes exterior during it yet the auditor keeps on another way is pc has big cog big win auditor keeps going on with the rd when pc is exteriorized by auditing and is then

then finds out if it was overrun unflat or unnecessary and handles per this drill if d unnecessary the auditor indicates it was an unnecessary action and gets an fn 6 the int rd was overrun and the flat point has been established per step 5 the auditor tells the pc were going to date that point in years months etc ago until something blows offsome mass or energy etc i want you to tell as soon as that happens alright 7 if the pc is confused about blow the auditor can do demo by putting his hand on the pcs arm and taking it away suddenly 8 when the pc understands whats expected of him the auditor establishes the order of magnitude by asking the pc was it years or months ago 9 the auditor gets the years months days hours minutes seconds and fractions of seconds ago to point when something blows and fns if the pc gives up on this only then does the auditor meter date the flat point to blowfn 10 if big bd occurs and the auditor suspects blow but the pc will not originate it the auditor can ask the pc if it blew 11 if blow occurs the auditor verifies each part of the date and corrects where necessary to blowfn if still blowfn the auditor then checks for an earlier flat point if there is one the auditor dates that point to blowfn if still blowfn the auditor does an l3rf on your int rd and handles fully 12 when the date has gone to blowfn and the fn has been indicated the auditor tells the pc now were going to spot the exact location where that flat point occurred until something blows off i want you to tell when that happens alright the auditor is getting the past physical universe location 13 the auditor clears the words stars planet galaxy location point if this is the first time datelocate is being done on the pc 14 when the pc understands whats expected of him the auditor begins the locate steps 38415 the auditor says point to that location the pc points with his finger until he is satisfied he has the exact direction then the auditor goes down the rest of the steps to blowfn distance exact what galaxy what star what planet what country what city what street what house position on street what room distance from front of house where in the room how far from each wall how far off the floor how far from the ceiling note this step is not rote use the questions that apply for example if it occurred next door you wouldnt ask what galaxy etc 16 if while locating the pc starts running the incident or gives too much scene the auditor has the pc point again then continues from where he left off on the locate steps 17 if at some point on these steps the location turns out to be in the middle of the ocean or in field etc the auditor uses available landmarks or reference points to get the location ie distance from nearest point of land or distance from the big rock down to blowfn 18 if blowfn the auditor verifies each part of the locate step and corrects any necessary to blowfn 19 if the auditor suspects blow but the pc doesnt originate it the auditor asks did something blow if the auditor suspects hes gone past blow he can check did it blow previously if so and fn the auditor rehabs by asking the pc how long ago that happened and gets the fn 20 if blow after verifying the location or after checking for an earlier location blow the auditor then has to do an l3rf on your int rd and handle fully 385note blow is definite manifestation and the pc must say something blew or it disappeared or its gone or it vanished not i feel lighter important the datelocate steps must not be done robotically one has to understand the mechanics of how its done and why if the pc says two years ago on dating one doesnt then ask what galaxy on the locate step as of course its this one or what star etc either if you start asking what galaxy on an incident on earth the pc is thrown back track if it happened outside town in the open you wouldnt ask what city house or street or room either on dating its ago or it is an actual date when the pc has it the auditor doesnt then alteris it in sequence found by yearsmonthsdayshours minutesseconds and fractions one doesnt then call it by day year month as it tangles the pc its called back in the same order and in dating one calls the date found back to the pc if there was instant blow while it was being found it usually blows on the call of it after its known and in locating the same thing occurs if blow and it seems correct then the location is called back to the pc the essence of the drill is to bring pc to pt by erasing the date by spotting and the location by spotting as the pc is out of pt fixed by both date and location if the theory is not understood nobody could do it rotely this is highly precise action to be done smoothly with good trs its results

rundown uses new era dianetics r3ra commands with the assessed int button as the running item the rundown and its repair do not include the use of new era dianetics preassessment nor any form of aesps in int you can only address int preassessment addresses something else wins are sometimes reported on the use of preassessment on int but it is dangerous and dicey procedure it isnt really directly addressing int that actually violates the law that when handling int you run only int nothing else using preassessment whereas you might have one win youll have five failures along with it sure somebody got some wins on it but the next five guys will cave right in and go over the cliff the apparency of the win is this int flattened and this went unnoticed and then they were running an original item having to do with headaches or some other symptom this was then preassessed and the person was on the line with r3ra which of course can be run after youve done an int rundown so the apparency here is that the use of preassessment handled int whereas int probably had actually flattened first and then the person was able to get gains from the preassessment and auditing that was done this could go in the opposite direction for example with int still unflat you go into preassessment and youre not now addressing the subject of int itself you are now into chains that are not int chains with the int chains themselves restimulated but not yet run or not fully run so it is actually violation of basic tech and it would very swiftly get into tangled mess the rule is when handling int you address only int nothing else and you do not run preassessment or aesps on int we have new simplified int rundown with which to handle it and an extremely workable process in the end of endless int repair rundown which resolves any persistent int trouble r3ra and preassessment can be run in full by the book exactly per the new era dianetics series after int handling has been

audited on dianetics the remedy would be the end of endless int repair rd the int rundown is not to be sold or passed off as method of exteriorizing pc nor is the end of endless int repair rundown this is very important it is general auditing on usual dianetics and scientology actions that brings about exteriorization 404when the pc goes or is found to be exterior and int proves to be charged on checking one then orders the interiorization rundown otherwise the ta will misbehave the rundown is remedy used after exteriorization has occurred by reason of general auditing anxiety to get exterior will prompt pc to buy and registrar to sell an interiorization rundown it is in effect just more auditing as far as the registrar is concerned when pc has gone exterior the registrar can insist on his buying enough hours for the remedy the int rundown stabilizes the exteriorization and makes it possible to audit the pc further disability if an auditor cant smoothly audit rundown as simple as an int rundown then he is exposed as being unable to run standard dianetics and should be cleared of his misunderstoods and overts and retrained the only real trouble one gets into on an int rundown stems from the inability of the auditor to run smooth good tred r3ra session pcs are not hard to run on it cs wins cs cannot win at all if he is continually having to make up for flubby auditing by the auditor therefore the cs must be very sure his auditors are fully checked out on things they are to run before running them if there is qual staff training officer or cramming cs can fully afford to do the training and cramming himself otherwise he will lose far more than that time in csing for auditors not checked out by the skill of his auditors you know the cs not by his

series 102 cs checklist of int errors there are two major errors that occur most frequently on int handling which cs must be on the alert for 1 doing or running anything else before an int rundown when one is needed 2 overrunning the int rundown by far the commonest error is number one above it happens most often at the very beginning of session on int itself by the auditor engaging in twoway comm or ruds or belabored and overcomplicated clearing of commands or some other action than getting right onto the running of int this is flagrant when i was csing it is what i kept running intothe auditor doing all kinds of preliminary steps before starting int it boils down to auditing over outint and it cant be done youll get the auditor who says but all i did was ask him how he was feeling thats enough thats twoway comm and you cant run anything else but int when int is out and that includes twoway comm you dont ask the pc how he feels about anything you just start the int rundown so thats the first major error to watch for somebody trying to run something else before the int rundown itself the second is overrun pc has big cognition big win ta blowdown and the auditor misses it goes right on past it and continues auditing or the pc exteriorizes and the auditor continues past exterior there is vital data on the end phenomena of int on hcob 4 jan 71r int rd series 2 and both cs and auditor must have this data and know and be able to recognize the ep of int when it occurs otherwise it will really mess up case those are the two major violations cs and an auditor must not permit in the running of int if it is to be successful because they are the most major errors they have been included first on the checklist below cs checklist for detecting errors on int 406the following is checklist to be used in the csing of int the cs checks bogged session or any session on int against this list to detect the exact cause of the trouble or an error that could be the source of future trouble in ensuing sessions 1 doing or running anything else before an int rundown when one is needed includes ruds 2way comm l1c anything 2 auditing over outint 3 overrunning the int rundown 4 auditing past exterior 5 overdoing the clearing steps preceding the actual rundown 6 running an int button that only read on an mu or false read failure to clear an int button before running it 7 clearing all of the int buttons before assessment instead of clearing only the button with the largest valid read 8 failure to use suppress invalidate and misunderstood on an unreading int button list 9 misassessment of the int button list 10 doing an int rundown when none of the buttons have read constitutes running an unreading item 11 auditor cant get reads or make list read 12 not taking

71 fn everything use any authorized published list green form for general review l1c for arc brks l4b for listed items list errors method 3 use meter at sensitivity so meter needle is loose but it is easy to keep needle at set if sensitivity is too high the needle will be in constant motion as one tries to set the ta if too low the instant read will not be visible 5 is usual for upper grade cases 16 is usual for lower grade or dianetic cases have your meter in position line of sight so you can see the list and the needle or you can see the needle and the pc the meter position is important hold the mimeoed list close beside the meter have your worksheet more to the right keep record on your worksheet mark the pcs name and date on it mark what list it is on the ws with time it remains in the folder stapled to the ws read the question on the list note if it reads do not read it while looking at the pc do not read it to yourself and then say it while looking at the pc these are the l10 actions and are called method 6 not method 3 it is more important to see the pcs cans than his face as can fiddle can fake or upset reads tr 1 must be good so the pc clearly hears it you are looking for an instant read that occurs at the end of the exact last syllable of the question if it does not read mark the list x if the list is being done through an fn and the fn just continues mark the question fn 412if the question reads do not say that reads mark the read at once tick sf f lf lfbd rs transfer the number of the q to the ws and look expectantly at the pc you can repeat the q by just saying it again if pc doesnt begin to talk he has probably already begun to answer as the q was live in his bank as noted by the meter take down the pcs remarks in shortened form on the ws note any ta changes on the ws if the pcs answer results in an fn cog vgis sometimes follow gis always accompany real fn mark it rapidly on the ws and say thank you i would like to indicate your needle is floating do not wait endlessly for the pc to say more if you do he will go into doubt and find more also do not chop what he is saying both are tr errors that are very bad if there is fn at the first pause that looks like the pc thinks he has said it ask for an earlier similar_____whatever the question concerned do not change the q do not fail to repeat what the question is was there an earlier similar restimulation of rejected affinity this is the part of it you do not leave such question merely clean it does not matter now if you look at the pc when you say it or not but you can look at the pc when you say it the pc will answer if he comes to looks like he thinks he said it and fn you ask the same q as above you ask this q was there an earlier similar______ until you finally get an fn and gis you indicate the fn that is the last of that particular question you mark fn on the list and call the next question on the list you call this and other questions without looking at the pc those that do not read you x as out the next question that reads you mark it on the list transfer the question number to the ws take the pcs answer follow the above procedure as needed until you get an fn and gis for the question ack indicate and return to the mimeoed list you keep this up until you have done the whole list in this fashion if you got read on the list question but the pc volunteers some answer to an unreading question do not take it up just ack and carry on with your mimeoed list believe your meter do not take up things that dont read dont get hunches dont let the pc run his own case by answering nonreading items and then the auditor taking them up also dont let pc fiddle the cans to get false read or to obscure real one very rare but these two actions have happened big win 413if half way down prepared list the last part not yet done the pc on some question gets wide fn big cog vgis the auditor is justified in calling the list complete and going to the next cs action or ending the session there are two reasons for thisone the fn will usually just persist and cant be read through and further action will tend to invalidate the win the auditor can also carry on to the end of the prepared list if he thinks there may be something else on it gf and method 3 when gf is taken up method 3 item by item one at time and fned it can occur that the ta will go suddenly high the pc feels he is being repaired that the clearing up of the first item on the gf handled it and protests it is the protest that sends the ta up this is not true of any other list thus gf is best done by method 5 once through for reads then the reads handled l1c and l4b l7 and other such lists are best done by method 3 the above steps and actions are exactly how you do auditing by list today any earlier data contrary to this is cancelled only 2 points changewe fn everything that reads by or process to handle l3b requires processes not to get an fin and we never tell the pc that it read or didnt read thus putting his attention on the meter we still indicate fns to the pc as form of completion l1c and method 3 are not used on high or very low tas to get them down or up the purpose of these lists is to clean up bypassed charge ________ an auditor also indicates when he has finished with the list an auditor should dummy drill this action both on doll and bullbait ________ the action is very successful when precisely done l ron hubbard founder lrhntrd copyright 1971 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 414hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 14 march 1971r corrected reissued 25 july 1973 remimeo all levels fn everything whenever an auditor gets read on an item from ruds or prepared list lib l3a l4b etc etc it must be carried to an fn to fail to do so is to leave the pc with bypassed charge when pc has had several reads on various lists which were none of them carried to fn it can occur that he will become upset or depressed without any other apparent reason as one has done the lists without fning each item one now has the mystery of what is wrong the error is reading items from ruds or prepared lists cleaned to read but not carried to fn this action amongst many such refinements is what makes flag auditing so smooth and indeed makes it flag auditing when an auditor first tries this he may well think it is impossible yet it is simplicity itself if you know bank structure you know it is necessary to find an earlier item if something does not release what has been found as read on prepared list would fn if it were the basic lock so if it doesnt fn then there is an earlier or an earlier or an earlier lock which is preventing it from fning so the rule never walk off from reading item on rudiment or prepared repair list before you carry it down earlier similar to an fn example arc brk reads pc says what it is auditor does arcu cdei if fn auditor asks for an earlier similar arc brk gets it arcu cdei etc until he gets an fn example ptp reads carry it earlier similar until ptp fns example l4b has an item been denied you reads answered fn is there an earlier similar denied item answered fn go on to next reading item on the list example gf assessed once through for reads the next cs must take every item on it that read by 2wc or other process to an fn so there is much more general rule every item that reads must fn in dianetics you get the fn when you run secondaries or engrams to an erasure fn cog vgis in rudiments every out rud you get read on is run to fn 415on prepared list you take each read to an fn or to fn on an lx list you run each flow chain to an fn on gf you get by whatever process an fn on listing by the laws of listing and nulling your eventual item listed must fn so another rule every major and minor action must be carried to an fn there are exceptions any exception leaves bypassed charge on the pc also every fn is indicated at the conclusion of the action when cog is obtained you take too soon an fn first twitch you cut the cognition and leave bypassed charge withheld cognition i could take any folder and simply write out the ruds and prepared list reading items and then audit the pc and carry each one to fn and correct every list so disclosed and wind up with very shining cool calm pc so have reading items been left charged would be key question on case using lists or ruds on high or low tas that are not meant for high or low tas will get you reading items that wont fn so another rule never try to fly ruds or do lib on high or low ta one can talk the ta down see hco b on talking the ta down or one can assess l4b about the only prepared lists one can assess are the new hilo ta hco b 13 mar 71 and possibly gf40 once through for biggest read the biggest read will have blowdown on it and can possibly be brought to fn if this occurs then one also handles all other items that read the most frequent errors in all this are not taking read earlier similar but just checking it and leaving it as clean not using suppress and false on items and of course leaving pc thinking things are still charged by failing to indicate the fn indicating an fn before cog not going back through the folder to handle ruds and items that read but were called clean or were simply abandoned pc audited under tension of poor trs has hard time and does not fn sometimes inviting overrun 416the rules then to happy pcs are good trs fn everything found on ruds and lists audit with ta in normal range or repair it so it is in normal range l ron

many years ago i developed system called prepared lists these isolated the trouble the pc was having in auditing without taxing anyones imagination and sending the auditor into figurefigure on the pc these prepared lists were assessed on an emeter one took up the biggest read first and then cleaned up all other reads time has gone on the system of prepared lists has been expanded to include not only pcs but students and staff it may have gone overlooked that such lists now include anything that could happen to pc or student in other words prepared lists have become very thorough who can use the only reason ever found for prepared lists not working was an auditors weak tr 1 and inability to read meter even this difficulty has been handled by qual okay to audit checksheets before an auditor should be let near prepared list he should be put through at least six okay to audit short checksheets in qual qual is not fast flow things done in qual are method 4 word cleared and starrated

original list of course int problems cause high ta headaches and general upset ive begun to think after seeing lot of headache cases that maybe only intext problems cause headaches instead of repairing int sometimes auditors will run it again and again also int can go flat to cog vvgis on an early flow even recall flow then if one insists on finishing the int rd one has trouble and i mean trouble so this is valuable list 4 hco bulletin 15 december 1968r l4br for assessment of all listing errors an out list meaning one done by listing and nulling not prepared list can raise more concentrated hell with pc than any other single auditing error the amount of misemotion or illness which wrong list generates has to be seen to be believed when pc is ill after session or up to 3 days after always suspect that listing action done on the pc had an error in it it must be corrected the prepared list l4br corrects lists of the listing and nulling variety it can be run on old lists

list of these word lists is being issued as hcob i dec 74 so that you can match them to the prepared lists in this bulletin other lists there is whole package of processing mainly by prepared lists in integrity processing issued as its own series and now being reissued there are great solo lists for solo repair used on advance courses and from time to time when need for prepared list is found new ones will be issued on different subjects 421one can repair pc or student or staff member one can also forward case into new areas with other prepared lists mimeo some orgs backlog their mimeos the availability of lists to auditors is something which should not be neglected it is highly uneconomical as one loses resigns and students and staff when prepared lists are in non existence in an org or even short supply tech is the atomic fuel an org runs on keep prepared lists in supply for use translated issues in nonenglish speaking orgs lists must be very carefully translated and mimeoed for use in such orgs more than any others great care must be taken to have and use lists as they keep tech straight where it tends to go hearsay and verbal so thats quite an array of prepared lists isnt it if they are not in full use in your org dont wonder about your delivery stats why or your org and cf problems its lack of full use of this tech hidden in these prepared lists is wealth of tech that

vital prepared lists king of these is the green form the additional 40 items are the original seven resistive cases the best way to do gf 40 is method 5 once through lengths of reads and bds marked and cs to then write cs for it hilo ta is also such list also done method 5 any such prepared list can be done method 5 and the cs to then write cs but l4b lists correction l3b dianetic errors and l1c arc brks and bypassed charge are usually done method 3 auditor assesses to read gets the action done andor earlier similar to an fn not going on until his action has resulted in an fn and then going on to complete handling and fning each read he gets when the cs has list assessed method 5 he expects usually to get it back with the reads and then write the cs for it sometimes he asks for gf 40 and hilo ta both to be done method 5 now the question comes up which reads does the cs write up to be handled first and second and third etc in other words how does he arrange the cs the auditor is to do now what sequence are the items handled in these rules apply handle an out int rd first handle anything connected with lists meaning listing and nulling lists first if int isnt out like listed past right item reads the cs would get that handled first always handle list errors first and usually do an l4b additionally auditor to handle pc can get sick after listing error and you cant get auditing done when lists are out doesnt want auditing why is then handled if it read next cs to handle anything to do with rudiments arc brks ptps and whs take precedence in that order listing errors are first before arc brks because an apparent arc break after listing error can only be handled by getting the charge off the list anything that looks like withhold comes next 423after that one just takes the lengths or bd of reads take the biggest reads before you take the smaller ones once you have csed for lists doesnt want auditing and ruds and evident other withholds the only confusion that one can get into is very high ta but list errors can cause high tas next in frequency is withholds never cs to take ta down with an arc brk rud or an l1c never you can cs to talk ta down only when there are list errors or withholds reading on gf of course an interiorization rundown error is primary target but you dont have that once its handled you will get soaring ta if int is out l3b is potent tool to order for int outnesses the auditor handling as he goes method 3 so the above gives you the rules by which you cs from assessed prepared lists basicallywhen int is out auditing will drive the ta up when lists are out nothing will handle but lists and l1c wont nor will ruds when ruds are out nothing else will straighten up and you mustnt order auditors to audit with out ruds doesnt want auditing can come from bad l n list or out int or out ruds previous bad auditing can be cured by l1c on previous bad auditing the craziest out auditing i ever ran into was an auditor using reads and fns when there were none and failing to take up or flatten reads he did get so there can be variations on bad auditing and there can be to our shame false auditing reports the best cs is to find what auditor and find out what the error was bad trs on poor tr course where the pc was student false passes and invalidated wins can also cause doesnt want auditing protest is frequent reason for high ta and is cousin to doesnt want auditing and is handled by checking lists for read and doing an l4b if it reads or finding the out ruds or other bpc as in l1c as there are so many combinations of reading items from prepared lists you have to cs according to these general principles these rules serve as steadying guide that youll find win for you lrhsbrd l ron hubbard copyright 1971 founder by l ron hubbard

class iv grad above auditors cs series 53 use of the cs series 53 short form is the basic prepared list used by auditors to get ta up or down into normal range or to correct case outnesses it contains every element that could be wrong with the mind it is written the way it is because we just want to know if subject reads in the pcs mind and if so you handle it to fn the cs series 53 long form is exactly the same as the short form except that it puts the items into full questions so that less educated pc can understand what is being asked the questions actually limit its use bit but are needed with uneducated pcs the limit comes about through making the questions bit too specific whereas the general questions of the short form dont say to what they apply so are less limited both the short form and the long form are assessed method 5 this means going down the list calling off the items or questions to the pc watching the meter and marking any tick small fall fall long fall long fall blowdown to what ta do not take up instant fns you can program instant fns but not off cs 53 the order the reads must be taken up is built into the list itself you cant audit case on anything if int is out auditing must be very limited if list is out if you audit over an arc break very long the pc will go into sad effect if you audit over problem the pc wont make case gain if you audit over withhold the pc will get mad at you if you look at this and compare it to the cs 53 you will see that the list itself is built on declining order of urgency it is true of the remaining items on the list there are two ways of using cs 53 the first is to simply assess it and indicate the largest read this is sort of brushoff but is very useful in handling blown students or pcs will get off charge and get them back into the org or more comfortable the other way is its proper use in session you simply start at the first read and handle it go to the next read and handle it etc note that this is at variance with the general handling of prepared lists where you simply take the largest read and next largest read and so forth that an item reads with the exception of int does not mean you have to do full rundown at that point you just have to fn it if further actions are needed to take an item to full handling get it onto the pcs advance program this includes drug handling etc but not as ive said int if int reads you handle it fully because auditing can take place over outint if he has already had full int rd you would run the end of endless int repair rundown if he or she is already clear or ot and has not had an int rd you would run the end of endless int repair rundown as the primary action the object of the cs 53 is to key out things that are bothering the pc and get anything you found on the list to an fn that something read except int does not mean the auditor 432doing the cs 53 must at once run up 110 hours of auditing before he can finish the cs 53 to an fning list auditors who dont realize this can get stuck in on cs 53 mostly because they misconceive cs 53 to be wholly case analysis list its primary purpose is to get the case rolling so you can do something else that is scheduled on the pcs program because it can be made to serve as case analysis and is sometimes called for by cs to help him do repair or advance program or to confirm it sometimes misleads the auditor into believing he is not sup posed to fn the list i have even used cs 53 in d of p interview when the pc wasnt speaking up then by getting the reads i could program the pc and unless it was int reading i would conclude the interview simply by indicating the largest read which would get my fn and let the pc go away happy while we really got to work on him in the cs department so the cs 53 is child of many uses as it does after all contain all the elements known to us that bring about case foulups clears and ots sections d and of the cs 53 can be assessed on clears and ots and dianetic clears however do not engage in any activity that brings about further engram running the correct way to handle clears and ots if you get read in section d is indicate and let him tell you about it if he wishes to get an fn on section you can do an l3rf but you must not do more than indicate the item you must not engage in engram running ref hcob 12 sep 78 dianetics forbidden on clears and ots you realize of course that lsd and some other drugs can apparently stay in the physiological body and release themselves now and then if clear ot or dianetic clear got read on section d drugs etc and it didnt clear up easily you would program the person for sweat program and even objectives you would not however do any engram running on the drugs even recalls might be bit dicey the sweat program and objectives would however handle if you got into the goofy situation of heavy or persistent section d reads on clear ot or dianetic clear it would not be very usual but you better know about it on section engrams and masses etc if you got reads on clear ot or dianetic clear you could indicate them and if they didnt clear to fn you could do an l3rf remembering that the instructions on the l3rf handlings do not apply your actions as an auditor would simply be to indicate the read and you would probably get your fn providing of course your read wasnt false the way to program persistent read on this would be to get the person up to ot i ii and iii fast and then program ned for ots but whatever you do dont try to run these reads out with dianetics the rest of the cs 53 except d and as above is quite valid on clears ots and dianetic clears as it is mostly concerned with think environment and practices fning cs 53 unless you run into the necessity to do an int handling or you goof or get false reads you can fn whole cs 53 rather rapidly cs 53 to fning list getting cs 53 to an fning list is done by method 5ing it handling any int rd necessary and handling the rest of the items each to fn 433you then method 5 the whole cs 53 again you may pick up an additional read or two you fn these hopefully if int is now handled properly if it did read in the first place it wont read again but if it does you have the end of endless int repair rd which if done already may not have been carried to ep so you simply get it carried to ep which is an fning int button list you then method 5 the cs 53 again you will probably get an fning assessment throughout if you dont you simply method 5 it again the eventual ep of getting prepared list to fn will occur unless the meter the auditors metering or trs or use of the list are badly out the thing to do in that event is to get another auditor or get liberally crammed or retreaded as frankly fning cs 53 is piece of cake fning cs 53 to fning list is relatively easy to do and can produce remarkable resurgence of case its an easy and simple way to do setup for major rundown bug some pcs particularly those who have false ta have gotten so bugged by cs 53s being done on them that when they see an auditor reach for one they react adversely the way to handle this is 2wc the cs 53 itself taking the fns and ignore ing the ta position and then do full false ta handling on the pc per hcob 21 jan 77ra false ta checklist in essence what you have discovered is the biggest reading item of all without even looking at your meter further repair is needed than the above as cs 53 will now work like clock and can be done smoothly and correctly it will even pick up the latent charge of endless cs 53s if you do the above the cs 53 series is wonderful tool and like any tool can be well handled or mishandled part of its proper use is understanding exactly what it is and handling it with good meter good metering and good trs there is other document in history that has rounded up so completely the factors which can be wrong with the mind and also put it in its short form on one sheet of paper l ron hubbard founder

revisions in this type style pc setups and cs 53 ref cs series 1 10 the original issue of this hcob stated pc setup before major action must include cs 53rl to fning list it then named various flagonly rundowns it was not intended for distribution to orgs outside flag and has been misimplemented to create shortage of pcs for ned course students and internes and class iv course students and interned by requiring that these must not audit pcs who have not first had cs 53 to fning list but every major action does not require cs 53 to fning list as setup therefore this clarification is issued pa must be set up before major action what this setup consists of is covered in cs series 1 10 it does not have to include cs 53 to fning list cs 53 to fning list is the most thorough way to set up case or to repair case who has had rough auditing this is because the cs 53 is masterpiece in that it contains everything that could be wrong with the mind pc who has had much auditing especially if any of the auditing was not skillfully delivered will get remarkable case resurgence from cs 53 done to fning list but pa who is already flying or who has not had much auditing does not require cs 53 to fning list and possibly would not even understand many of the cs 53 lines it does not have to be done before every major action to do so would violate the rules of csing and programming of cases and is an arbitrary it is very poor show to enter or use arbitraries as these prevent getting any tech done at all and not requiring cs 53 to fning list does not mean that you can audit pc who is not set up follow the rules of programming and csing cases already very adequately covered in the cs series especially in cs series 1 10 it is very easy to do l ron hubbard founder as

and other implant type therapies often key in and jam the track these characters here on any other planet and on the whole track dramatize implanting the therapy involved would be temporary relief brought by suggestion the wrong data of the science itself operates as whole track lie getting well or able depends on establishing truth these scientific lies are alterations of actual laws we often note electronics men have rough case time this traces to the lies man uses for his electrical science as the subject is based on false assumptions it itself tends to aberrate therefore we get out of the road any former therapy we can rehab any moment of release in it handle any overrun etc we also do new style remedy b to get old therapies spotted and run back the only cases which hang up are 1 unaudited cases lies about grades etc 2 drug cases who seek in processing the delusions or madness which exhilarated them on drugs 3 former therapy cases in this or past lives 4 out of valence cases 5 cases who continue to commit overts on scn 6 cases audited with their ruds or grades out 7 seriously physically ill cases where the illness makes too much ptp in pt 436of all these the former therapy case is apt to be the roughest as any auditing session can be reactively mistaken for the treatment the next roughest is the drug case as false exteriorization often occurs on an enforced basis and may go into restim some drug takers go plowing back into early implants and drug therapies so the two get crossed up on case to isolate the reason for highly resistive case or high ta you can assess the above 7 items and get clue dont limit it to this lifetime and dont do it so as to key the person in hard on things he wasnt in and dont do it unless the case is very hard to get gain on engram running of crude sort can be found hundreds thousands or billions of years ago and consists if it appears of an overrun they didnt know much about it and overran them badly implants psychoanalysis psychiatry hypnotism get all snarled up with sex as these birds would commonly and do stage insane sex scenes they violate the children and wives of officials even today to produce degrade and to make scene so insane that the patient if he remembers it really thinks he is insane and if he tries to tell anybody or if she tries to tell her husband its prompt mess so these practitioners hide their activities in this fashion the trouble with such former therapies and electric shock etc is that it groups track by the command of the practitioner b sends the pc to the start of track way back and sticks him there out of pt the keynote of piloting through messes like this is to know what kind of mess it is and b dont ever force pc back track or into anything he doesnt want to confront easily drugs force the person back into these messes and stick him one of these former therapy or drug messes is only hard to untangle because they are full of incredibles the pc doesnt accept them or just try to see whats in them the basic rule in any case is reality is proportional to the amount of charge removed and so reality can be increased simply by removing charge these surges of the needle as well as the bds of the ta are charge coming off anything eventually resolves if the pc just keeps on getting charge off the earliest charge is the most important charge off the exact grades is the most valuable but any charge off will make it even on former therapies l ron hubbard founder lrhntbhrd copyright 1971 1974 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 437hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 9 june 1960 fran hldrs central orgs hcos the basic assumptions of scientology versus overts the entire secret of all overtwithhold mechanisms is valences i have known for long while that profile on our tests is picture of valence if the preclear were in valence but was himself completely he would have perfect test response and would be wholly clear in this statement we have one of the background structure points of scientology this was an assumption point for some time point of departure like conservation of energy in physics is the primary assumption point of 19th century physicsif we assume this point then we have the truths axioms and other data in elementary physics the point assumed and never proven and not even well phrased is the start point in physics from which all deductions are made it is an understood nonexamined theory physics was demonstrable truth but only in limited and finite sense the moment nuclear physics my dear companion that haunted my college days came into action the assumption point began to crumble and is not now considered to be truth hence while elementary physics works in finite limited sense it is not considered true science any longerit is only elementary science freud for instance had as his start point or assumption point the libido theory of 1894 in which he based all on sex it is rare that science ever embraces its own assumption point and resolves it freud was stuck with his libido theory just as newtons successors were stuck with conservation of energy so long as elementary physicists were concerned only with energy which could not be destroyed or created they treadmilled themselves into deadend mirrored in such things as inadequate costly engines difficult construction and complete lock out from space and other planets the great einstein not physicist but mathematician established new science which deserved the name of the physical science physics name already purloined by the natural philosophy of the 1 9th century old time physics was the science of the age of fire and ended with the age of fire it died to whimpering embers under the down blast of atomic fission we are longer scientifically nor politically in the age of fire we are in the age of freed energy we do not yet have an atomic physical science we have only number of guestimates like the bronze worker of early greece who knew nothing of the facts of fire metallurgy the fire age begun by prometheus whoever he really was is ending on earth the raw energy age has begun with all the teething troubles of any new era called the atomic age just now it started with hints of others before einstein but was actually born when einstein wrote his theory of relativity this crude guestimate was yet great departure point in the history of this planet it has unlocked space to man promised him new engines widened his scope unhappily it has also unlocked vast opportunities for political bunglingbut i would rather say that it exposed political diplomacy as bungling subject which must now urgently improve nations can longer afford political ineptness now the assumption point of physics the science of the fire age became disproved and the science is in question and the fire age is in fact over the holes in physics have begun to glare some day new science will be organized from the assumption point of einsteins work 438no matter if hes debunked forgotten or becomes legend like prometheus the professors of tomorrow can teach as myth einstein stole the secret of eternal fission from heaven named princeton where the goals and ages hence somebody will prove or expose the basic assumption and the fission age will resurge or die depending on whether or not the assumption is found to be true or false in freuds case in lesser sense short and ineffective but highly interesting age of psychotherapy began with the libido theory in 1894 and began to disintegrate through lack of progress and development about 1920 although the subject itself became an intellectual football in the late 20s an artists cross in the early 30s and teenagers subject in the late 50s his contemporaries added nothing effective to freuds work and the subject like psychology which originated in 1879 and assumed men were animals failed in all fields but wide popularity back of all work on mental states however lie various assumption points most of them hidden or undelineated from which the remainder of the subject evolves and grows if the cornerstone is proven only relatively factual long enduring career is guaranteed to the subject freud used as his assumption point more than his libido theory that all impulses and behaviors are sexmotivated he assumed that if one were sexmotivated then if one unblocked this drive by removing an early traumatic sex experience that was impeding the drive the patient would recover from neurosis all manner of interesting complications proceed from this art being considered sublimation or aberration of the sex drive had to be considered wholly neurotic success being most desirable as sexual success was product of blessed neurosis if achieved in any other field as treatment it was common for freudian practitioner to cut through the gordian knot by ordering patient to go out and have sex with everyone prove his or her prowess and thus become well and happy while this secured the popularity of the subject it did little to reduce asylum statistics as these were on the increase throughout the freudian age and were highest at its end and indeed were higher in freudian dominated areas than in others where freudian treatment was not used not my propaganda just recorded fact the psychiatrist following russian science has more basic and brutal assumption point which is that shock cures aberration the idea goes back very long way making psychiatry long if sporadic age psychiatry ebbs and rises in use since it is dramatization rather than science it springs from the same impulse that assumes punishment cures wrong doing the limited workability of this is apparent around us on every hand we could do nothing socially about crime so we inhibited crime by striking at criminals this gave us suppressed criminality and more criminals but it must be said that lacking any solution that worked well then any solution that even seemed to work occasionally was considered better than nothing perhaps at some early date in whole history this worked better but all expedient cures tend to become new illness alcohol in any alcoholic once cured something but now produces with amazing similarity the malady it once cured these are stopgap cures that do this not cures in any absolute sense as the earliest punishment was the production of shock in the offender whole track history continues to repeat the treatment for misbehavior as dramatized action not an intellectual undertaking if person misbehaves he should be punished thus if person misbehaves insanely he must be punished psychiatry is not then science but legalized at present dramatization and this is the very dramatization that makes this cruel universe when it is punishment is unworkable as all the statistics show punish the criminal and he becomes too often confirmed and hardened criminal all this however is based on yet earlier lie the last two years of my researches have been devoted to establishing or not as the case may be whether anything could actually be done to person or whether it was not the person himself who did it i knew the latter was theoretically true but i had not found means to demonstrate itand indeed was quite prepared to 439discover that something could be done to person without his being prior cause this work will be found under all 195859 data released all overts and withholds the earlier assumption to punishment is that something can be done to another being by evidences to date odd as it may seem it appears by all processing tests that one becomes aberrated only by means of his own not anothers actions i do not say that nothing can be done to person or being by another person or being obviously communication exists i am only saying that all aberrative effects of action are created by the person who has them indeed none could be processed successfully through burn or engram unless he himself were holding the aberration therefor the fire location and other people are not consulted and are not even there in fact at the time of processing preclear being audited on past incident can recover from its ill effects therefore it seems conclusive that he himself must be causing the ill effects in present time or he could not eradicate them since the sources are not present thus they must not have been the sources of his ill effects the preclear must have been inspecting the assumption points of dianetics and scientology one finds now that what was originally assumed is fact thus we are to be here as science for very long time as science before ever proved its assumption point that i know about we are suddenly unique in that our results tend to verify more than our basic truths the further we go forward in other words the more basic are the assumption points unlike then physics or psychoanalysis or other sciences we have examined and improved our assumption points we assumed in dianetics that if we removed engrams life would resurge and become good this assumed that being was all right until injured and that eradicating the injury would find him all right again this is not the same as freud for freud never assumed goodness or rightness in man but on the contrary seemed to warn that we had better not go too far art and all that depending on the madness of us all as god seems to be blamed for most of the art work in this universe this seems most impudent evaluation of gods sanity on freuds part although i do not think he ever displayed an actual professional sign saying s freud psychotherapist by appointment to god the dianetic assumption that man is basically good and is damaged by punishment holds valid in practical practice and in some tens of thousands of cases and were the only ones in history that validated our findings by strict long long precise testing on cases we find that the more we process successfully the kinder and more ethical our people become that disposes of the vile nature of man by staggering poundage of evidence the assumption that all art is derived from aberration is discounted by the numbers of singers and artists who sang better and painted better after they were made saner by us the basic psychiatric assumption that enough punishment will restore sanity is disproven not only by psychiatric statistics but by actual observation and removal of the effects of punishment by processing that being without aberration would be good ethical artistic and powerful is still basic assumption in scientology it has just been demonstrated as factual for our practice this is news our assumption point has just become basic truth it is not just an assumption therefore we will now find ourselves on new plane of progress perhaps with new teething troubles certainly with even further goals the truth was demonstrated in this wise i knew valences those mocked up otherbeingnesses person thinks he is were the source of test profile patterns when we rid the pc of an undesirable valence his profile rose on the graph and he felt and acted better when we did not alter the valence in tested cases the profile remained much the 440same if the preclear were driven into undesirable valences by experiment his profile worsened apparently although this is more difficult to verify since the tone of the existing valence was undoubtedly dropped as well now from this i have found the mechanism by which being gives himself pain that is actually selfinflicted but is apparently otherinflicted and this is vast stride for it resolves ows and we can consider it broadly completed cycle of research ending two years with victory for our assumption point by being valence not himself person confuses the source of pain inflicting it himself upon the valence he is in and by experiencing the pain from the valence being can counterfeit the effect of being an effect of punishment by being valence he can conceive the environment is guilty of striking valence but as this is in fact an overt by himself against valence if only by failing to protect it he feels the pain of valence as he thinks of himself as valence he can then feel his own pain the conclusion is that to feel pain and for pain to persist one must be in valence the remedy for pain illness aberration insanity and the lot then is to free the preclear of valences apparently freed of all valences of an unconscious level the preclear would yet be able to experience but would not be involved with pain etc except by postulate the way to free him of all valences or unconscious counterfeit beingness is not the purpose of this paper here i only wish to examine with you the aspects of assumption points of subjects and sciences each of which has one usually unknown to the originator and to pass along the interesting intelligence that our former assumption point of remove the aberration and you have worthwhile person has become demonstrable in practice and can be considered truth this means new level has opened to the future with new certainty an overt recoils upon one because one is already in valence similar to that of the being against whom the overt is leveled the mechanism is exposed and as it is exposed we find it is not needed since being without valences is basically good only being with valences has his overts recoil upon him only being with valences commits overts harmful to others as he is behaving as he supposes the evil valence would behave but as unvalenced being does l ron hubbard lrhjsrd copyright

there are now three lx lists lx3attitudes lx2emotions lx1conditions originally they were called x because they were experimental they still are to some extent so the x is retained these serve to isolate reasons being is charged up to such an extent that he is out of valence when person is out of valence he does not easily asis his bank these lists are assessed method 5 the best reading item and then subsequently reading items are taken up and run by 3way or quad recalls 3 way or quad engrams r3ra end phenomena we now have new discovery i have found that person who is out of valence ex periences when run on lx1 lists and now the others above lx2 and lx3 and 220h remarkable valence shift if he is run on enough items in one fashion or another he comments on this in session this is the end phenomena of out of valence processes the lx items and 220h it is always attained if enough items are run 445quite ordinary cases are out of valence if their folder gets too fat you can assume they are out of valence perverts suppressives and critical snide ruthless arrogant or contemptuous per sonalities are always out of valence person who is in treason on the 1st dynamic is always out of valence so whether gf 40 h out of valence reads or not if the folder is fat you play safe and assess and run lx items until the person has the valence cognition without being coached person who is out of valence always has the cognition if he is run on enough items and 220h use of lists one begins with lx3 he assesses it method 5 and takes the item that read best handles it then the item that read next best and so on down the list if ep lx2 is taken up and handled in the same manner then lx1 220h is the last step of out of valence handling if the ep has not yet been reached today you can assume safely that anyone out of valence can be put in valence quietly and efficiently with lx items and 220h if he is audited and if the auditing is standard this is quite worthwhile development as it resolves the heavily overcharged case symptom of heavily charged case is fning too quickly to be processed well using these lists on pc is not critical action even and especially children are too

it is not intended to correct session errors or cure high or low ta it specializes in picking up the peculiarities and elements of pcs life which are out of view in normal auditing and which cause case to behave unusually the case may not be particularly resistive just bugged or not making sense and the green form is the list to use to sort it out it is an excellent cs tool for getting an estimate of case and getting it untangled you can assess it method 3 and handle not going beyond the first fn when ruds wont fly at the start of session but its real use is to assess method 5 and then send to the cs for programming if the case appears to be resistive or hasnt sorted out after full handling of all reading items has been done on the green form then the 40 question called the resistive cases assessment is assessed method 5 resistive cases each item on the resistive cases assessment has corresponding section on the expanded green form 40rd when an item reads on the resistive cases assessment you go to the section of the expanded green form 40rd which corresponds by letter and assess method 5 that section you assess one section of the expanded green form 40rd for each resistive cases assessment item that reads for example on the resistive cases assessment item c audited with ruds out and item 12 has taken drugs read the auditor will now go to the expanded green form 40rd assess all of section c audited with ruds out and all of section i has taken drugs then depending on cs instructions the auditor will l return the folder to the cs for programming of the case based on the reads he has just gotten or if he has cs okay 2 handle the reads per the instructions given for each reading question handling reads the sections of the expanded green form 40rd have been arranged in the order in which they are to be taken up if reading 453occasionally an item may read on the resistive cases assessment but give reads on the assessment of the appropriate section of the exgf 40rd example section g seriously physically ill reads on the resistive cases assessment but when the auditor assesses section g on the exgf 40rd even after putting in the buttons there are reads if this occurs check false and protest and take the item to an fn clears ots and dianetic clears the green form and especially the expanded green form 40rd call for dianetic handlings r3ra on many items in using these lists on someone who is clear ot or dianetic clear dianetic handlings are done on any items nor is ant activity to be engaged in which brings about further engram running where dianetic handlings are called for on items there are given additional special handlings for clears ots and dianetic clears which consist of indicating the bypassed charge letting the person tell you about it if he wishes and indicating the fn this of course cannot be considered full handling for many items and the clear ot or dianetic clear should be programmed for ned for ots as soon as possible to fully handle any areas of case which due to his case state are beyond the scope of new era dianetics drugs if unhandled drugs are reading drugs must be fully handled with the ned drug rundown as soon as the exgf 40rd is complete if clear ot or dianetic clear is being resistive case due to unhandled drugs the answer is to program the person for sweat program and even objectives you do not run engrams the sweat program and objectives will handle drugs where they are hanging up clear ot or dianetic clear end phenomena otherwise unless you have missed read you will have handled the resistiveness of the pcs case upon completion of the exgf 40rd the green form used by itself or with the exgf 40rd will solve cases that other list will handle they will get pc winning who has
