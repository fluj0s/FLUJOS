unusual circumstance of not knowing the winner of the election for president for several weeks the public scrutiny resulting from that experience exposed wide range of weaknesses with the american system of elections many of the weaknesses had been known for years by election administrators but they had been unsuccessful at drawing sufficient attention to them to effe ct the needed changes in october 2002 congress enacted the help america v ote act v pl 107252 which addressed many of those weaknesses it created new federal agency the election assistance commission eac with election administration responsibilities it set requirements for voting and voterregistration systems and certain other aspects of election administration and it provided federal funding but it did not supplant state and local control over election administration the establishment of the eac was delayed for several months beyond the statutory deadline and it was initially funded at fraction of the authorized level as result many of the tasks assigned to it by v were also delayed although the agency has since been more successful at fulfilling its statutory tasks v established several grant and payment programs for various purposes and congress has appropriated more than 3 billion altogether for them it is uncertain if current levels of funding are sufficient to meet v goals and requirements one of the innovations in v is the establishment for the first time of federal requirements for several aspects of election administration voting systems provisional ballots voter information voter registration and identification for certain voters those requirements are now in effect many states have changed voting systems to meet them controversy has arisen over the reliability and security of electronic voting leading many states to adopt requirements for paper ballots the provisional ballot requirement was one of four that went into effect in 2004 and it was also somewhat controversial there is also still some question about implementation of computerized statewide voterregistration lists in some states in addition to funding issues for the 110 th congress include voterverifiable paper audit trails and possibly photo identification poll worker training and prohibiting deceptive practices despite considerable effort by congress to alleviate difficulties for military and

knowing the winner of the election for president for several weeks the results in florida were contested and the contest did not end until decision by the us supreme court1 the public scrutiny resulting from that experience exposed wide range of weak nesses with the american system of elections among them were poorly designed and outdated voting technology inefficient and poorly administered registration systems insufficient professionalism in the election workforce especially pollworkers problems with absentee voting confusing array of administrative procedures across jurisdictions inadequate funding problems with the processes for conducting election audits and recounts and suspicions among many of alarming levels of voter fraud and intimidation although many jurisdictions suffered from few if any of these problems they were sufficiently prevalent to cause widespread concern after the realization that they could at least in some circumstances have significant impact on major elections many of the weaknesses had been known for years by election administrators but they had been unsuccessful at drawing sufficient attention to them to effect the needed improvements the situation began changing when several commissions and studies examined what had happened in florida and made recommendations 2 both the house and the senate held several hearings during the first session of the 107th congress some states made plans or began to replace voting equipment and adopt other improvements in december 2001 the house passed hr 3295 the help america vote act in early 2002 the senate debated and passed s 565 the martin luther king jr equal protection of v oting rights act after adopting 40 amendments 3 after conference negotiations compromise bi ll the help america vote act of 2002 va pl 107252 was enacted in october the act created new federal agency with election administration responsibilities set requirements for voting and

httpwwweacgov to replace the office of election administration oea of the federal election commission fec and also to perform new functions the eac is an independent bipartisan federal agency v authorized funding for it only through fy2005 but the agency has continued to be funded at or above authorized levels5 members are appointed to fouryear terms and may be reappointed once the act also established two boards with broadbased state and local membership and technical committee to address aspects of voting system standards and certification the main duties of the eac include carrying out grant programs providing for testing and certification of voting systems studying election issues and issuing voluntary guidelines for voting systems and the requirements in the act the commission does not have any new rulemaking authority and does not enforce v requirements the law provides for technical support and participation by the national institute of standards and technology nist see httpvotenistgov in relevant commission activities including the technical committee g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 the initial establishment of the eac was delayed for more than nine months beyond the statutory deadline of february 25 2003 and funding for the commission for fy2004 was less than one fifth the authorized level of 10 million as result the commissioners did not hold their first public meeting until march 2004 and the eac was significantly limited in its ability to provide assistance to states in preparation for the november 2004 election it also had to delay beginning many of the tasks assigned to it by v it has subsequently however been staffed more fully and has engaged in major activities under its v mandate among them are recommended set of best practices for local election administrators released in august 2004 6 release of the 4 in addition new national commission was formed chaired by former president jimmy carter and former secretary of state james baker

programs for various purposes8 payments to states authorized by v included 650 million under title i to improve election administration and to replace punchcard and levermachine voting systems and 3 billion over three years under title ii to meet requirements established by the act see below the first program was fully funded and all payments have been made the second was funded at close to the 24 billion authorized through fy2004 but additional funding was appropriated since then until fy2008 when congress provided an additional 115 million other prog rams provide funding through the department of health and human services to make polling places accessible to persons with disabilities and for state protection and advocacy systems to ensure electoral participation by persons with disabilities v also provided 20 million in grants for research and 10 million for pilot programs to improve voting technology although neither of those programs have been specifically funded three small programs to encourage student participation in the voting and election process were established by the act and they have received some funding g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 the remaining authorization for payments to he lp states meet the v requirements may continue to be an issue especially given the concerns of election officials about v as impact on the costs of elections9 whether the levels of payments provided to states are sufficient to fund v requirements is uncertain also contributing to this funding uncertainty is the continuing controversy over the security and reliability of the electronic voting systems promoted by v as accessibility requirements see below funding for all major programs was authorized by v only through fy2005 however congress has continued to provide funding in subsequent fiscal years g10g3g24g3g561g344g342g342g346g561g20g142g154g158g146g155g142g150g142g151g157g156g561 one of the innovations in v is the establishment for the first time

ballot this is separate ballot that is set aside along with relevant information about the voter so that election officials can determine whether the person is entitled to vote 2 any ballots cast during courtordered extension of polling hours must be provisional 3 sample ballot and other voter information must be posted at the polling place on election day 4 firsttime voters who register by mail must provide specified identification either when submitting their registration or when voting also the seven states that received title i payments to replace lever machines or punchcard voting systems and did not request waiver were required to replace all those systems statewide in time for the november 2004 federal election g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 the provisional ballot requirement has been somewhat controversial although broader use of such ballots was called for by all the major reports stemming from the 2000 election controversy see above and was included in both the original house and senatepassed versions of v states vary in how this requirement is implemented and some of those interpretations have been subject to litigation 11 in some states ballot is counted at least for some contests even if cast outside the voters home precinct12 in other states provisional ballots are counted only if they are cast in the home precinct13 if the policy governing provisional ballots is unclear to voters or pollworkers in jurisdiction voter might be unintentionally disenfranchised for example by inadvertently voting in the wrong precinct provisional ballots may be especially at issue in some close contests where the outcome may not be known until provisional ballots are processed which can take several days and may be subject to litigation congress could consider modifying this requirement to clarify its applicability to federal contests for ballots that are cast outside the home precinct also provisional balloting may become less important as states continue to implement and gain experience with the statewide computerized registration lists that v requires see below the voteridentification requirement was the subject of some controversy in the 2002 senate debate on v causing delay of several weeks in floor action it does not however appear to have been particularly controversial in implementation so far however many states have broader identification requirements and some of those have been controversial 14 some questions have been raised about photographic identification requirements in particular however the us supreme court has ruled that such voteridentification requirements are permissible15 continued obtained waiver until 2006 11 for detailed discussion of state implementation and issues see crs report rl32653 state election laws overview of statutes providing for provisional ballot tabulation by l paige whitaker and arthur traldi 12 this approach can help ensure for example that voter who is detained at work on election day until just before the polls close can vote at the nearest polling place rather than risk arriving at the home polling place after it has closed it may also help properly registered voter who inadvertently goes to the wrong polling place and is unable to obtain information from the central election office about where the correct polling pl ace is located for example because of busy phone lines 13 this can help to reduce problems in counting ballots and may also reduce the risk of certain kinds of fraud 14 see for example crs report rs22505 voter identification and citizenship

correction by voters either directly or via voter education and instruction manual auditing for the voting system accessibility to disabled persons at least one fully accessible machine per polling place and alternative languages and needed to meet federal machine errorrate standards systems were also required to maintain voter privacy and ballot confidentiality and states were required to adopt uniform standards for what constitutes vote on each system while v does require paper record that can be used for manual audit of voting system it does not require paper ballots also states using voter registration needed to employ computerized statewide voter registration systems that are accurately maintained 16 the 23 states that received title i payments to replace lever machines and punchcard systems and that requested waiver of the 2004 deadline were required to replace those systems statewide before the first election for federal office in 2006 finally beginning in 2007 all new voting systems purchased with title ii requirements payments were required to be fully accessible for persons with disabilities g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 many states began changing voting systems well before the va requirements went into effect for example both maryland and georgia adopted statewide directrecording electronic dre voting systems which meet the errorcorrection and accessibility requirements of v and facilitate meeting the standard for what constitutes vote however separate controversy has arisen over the reliability and security of dres 17 resulting in the adoption of requirement for paper ballots in many states in the case of dres paper ballots can be produced parallel to the electronic ballot and are available for inspection by the voter before the ballot is cast this approach is called voterverified paper audit trail or vvpa t alternatively states may adopt paperbased opticalscan voting system starting in the 108 th congress bills have been introduced that would require the use of paper ballots in federal elections whether congress will enact such requirement remains uncertain meanwhile the eacs technical committee in the 2007 draft of the voluntary voting system guidelines or vvsg discussed below has proposed that certified voting systems be required to provide means of auditing the vote that is independent of the software used by the voting system18 the proposal is consistent with v as use of performance rather than design standards in its voting system provisions 301a while paper ballots would meet this proposed requirement it also permits the development of new systems that could provide levels of verifiability security and accessibility that are not possible with paper ballots specific design standard such as that contained in most of the introduced bills would preclude the use of such 16 this was 2004 requirement that was extendable to 2006 and most states opted to delay implementation 17 for indepth discussion of the

however such specific design standard is arguably easier to implement and enforce than performance standard some states have had difficulty replacing voting equipment to meet v requirements or to meet the conditions of title i v payments they received to replace equipment19 problems may also arise in other states that are changing voting systems given the logistical complexities of the changeover in some cases20 most states waived the 2004 v deadline for developing computerized statewide voter registration lists and were therefore required to implement the new systems by january 2006 at least 11 states missed that deadline although most claimed that they would be compliant before the first election of 200621 in addition the absence of clear national standard for the lists has led to uncertainties about implementation22 given the increase in newvoter registration in recent elections and recent closely contested presidential elections some other issues have also arisen among them are questions about the validity of new registrations concerns about various kinds of fraud and abuse and the impacts of attempts to challenge the validity of voters registrations at polling places making informed decisions about the above and other issues depends in part on the availability of accurate and comparable information from jurisdictions however state and local jurisdictions vary in what data they collect and make publicly available while the eac is responsible under v for performing research on various aspects of election administration it has authority to ensure that the necessary data are provided by jurisdictions if those data prove difficult for the eac to obtain congress might wish to consider providing the agency with the authority needed to acquire them 23 for fy2008 congress provided the eac w ith 10 million for grants to states to improve data collection 19 the us department of justice sued the state of new york in early 2006 for failing to meet two hava

before the november 2004 election the president si gned the ronald w reagan national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2005 pl 108 375 which included provisions to ease the use of the federal writein ballot substitute under certain conditions for the states regular absentee ballots24 g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 despite considerable effort by congress to alleviate difficulties for military and overseas voters there remain number of hurdles to participation the most prominent are timing and the reliance on military and overseas mail to receive and return registration and ballot applications and the ballots themselves some states permit returning voting materials by fax but privacy concerns have been raised about this option the defense authorization act for 2005 expanded the use of the federal writein ballot to those in the military who were not deployed abroad but were away from their voting jurisdiction because they are on active duty nonetheless delays in printing absentee ballots because of lateoccurring primaries delays in sending out ballots from the states and delays with the mail reportedly continued with primary and general elections in 2004 problems continued in the 2006 elections as the eac reported that only 33 of ballots requested by military and overseas voters were counted in the election with 70 having been returned to election officials as undeliverable 25 there are few options to fix timing problems but congress could consider requiring an information campaign well in advance of the election to alleviate the glut of registration and ballot applications that typically arrive within two months of election day improvement in this area might be expected following the october 2007 launch of the overseas v ote foundations website to assist uoca v voters with registration and ballot requests 26 and while each state was required to designate single office to administer the law an additional requirement for hotline telephone number in each state could ease difficulties for individual voters the federal v oting assistance program provides both domestic and ov erseas tollfree numbers expanded use of the federal blank ballot without restrictions could eliminate the problem of waiting for the state absentee ballot but would limit voting to federa l offices only unless state decided otherwise

have been identified had been certified as conforming to the vss31 the vvsg have been criticized on the one hand as placing an undue burden on manufacturers to comply with the two year implementation window and on the other as being insufficiently comprehensive revising only part of the vss the provisions in the 2007 revision of the vvsg relating to security concerns about dres and its extensive revision to conform more closely to international standards and address other concerns with the earlier version have also generated some controversy in addition there have been calls for increased

and the number of states using early voting is growing according to the ncsl 23 states had some form of it in 200432 whereas 13 states offered early voting in 2000 in some states voter can cast ballot at multiple locations in the jurisdiction before election day while in other states the voter must visit the election officials office to do so the days and hours for voting vary as well g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 some observers have criticized early voting as distorting to the electoral process and being open to certain kinds of fraud and abuse one disadvantage concerns lateoccurring developments or issues in campaign about which an early voter might have knowledge also because early voting is form of remote voting as opposed to casting ballot at an assigned precinct greater possibility of committing fraud arguably exists proponents argue that early voting can increase turnout and lessen the risk of certain kinds of distortions the increase in the number of states offering early voting suggests that the trend will continue if the 110 th congress takes up the issue it may consider legislation to require all states to establish early voting programs or to require that voter rolls at polling places indicate which voters have cast ballots before election day 32 in addition seven states that do not offer early voting offer noexcuse absentee voting

at the po lling place emerged as an issue in the 2004 election although v is silent on this issue and state laws vary considerably with respect to who may challenge and under what circumstances in some states challenges may be made except by poll worker while in others partisan workers may be admitted to the polling place to observe the voting and may challenge voters eligibility related issue

terrorist attacks of 2001 raised concerns before the 2004 elections that further attacks or other events might disrupt an election and even affect the outcome 46 questions were raised about both postponement of elections and enhancement of security the executive branch does not currently have authority to set or change the times of elections power reserved for congress under th constitution although congress may be able to delegate such authority either congress or the states might also pass legislation in response to terrorist attack that would change the timing of any elections that were affected some states have enacted statutes providing for the temporar postponement of elections many state statutes also grant the governor the power to suspend certain state laws during an emergency 47 those statutes might also be able to be used to postpone the general presidential election in the state during an emergency however actual postponement of elections has occurred in

equal representation from each of the states against population differences the us constitution in article ii section 1 clause 2 as amended by the 12th amendment together with series of implementing federal statutes provides the broad framework through which electors are appointed and by which they cast votes for president and vice president49 g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 nearly since its inception the electoral college has engendered calls for reform among the criticisms are the possibility that candidate achieves majority of electoral college votes resulting in election by the house of representatives as occurred in 1824 the election of president and vice president who win majority in the electoral college but do not win the popular vote as happened in 1824 1876 1888 and 2000 the assignment of electoral votes said to give less populous states an advantage because states vote equals the number of members of the house of representatives based on populati on and the senate not based on population and perceived advantage for ethnic voters whereby the concentrations of such voters in large states are said to benefit because of tendency to vote as group for single candidate thus increasing their comparative influence in recent years heightened interest in reformin g the electoral college tends to coincide with closely contested presidential elections wherein the possibility exists that the electoral college winner does not win the popular vote despite the circumstances of the 2000 election which focused national attention on the electoral college vote
