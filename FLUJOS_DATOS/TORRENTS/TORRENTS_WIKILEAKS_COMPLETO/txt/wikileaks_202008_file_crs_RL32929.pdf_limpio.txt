trade divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32929the reliable replacement warhead program background and current developments summary most current us nuclear warheads we re built in the 1970s and 1980s and are being retained longer than was planned yet they deteriorate and must be maintained to correct problems life extension pr ogram lep part of larger stockpile stewardship program ssp replaces com ponents modifying some components would require nuclear test but the unite d states has observed test moratorium since 1992 congress and the administration pr efer to avoid return to testing so lep rebuilds these components as closely as possible to original specifications with this approach the secretaries of defense and energy have certif ied stockpile safety and reliability for the past 12 years without nuclear testing the national nuclear security administration nnsa which operates the us nuclear weapons program would velop the reliable replacement warhead rrw for fy2005 congress provided an unrequested 90 million to start rrw the fy2006 rrw appropriation was 248 million and the fy2007 operating plan had 358 million for fy2008 the request was 888 million for nnsa and 300 million for the navy congress appropr iated rrw funds for nnsa and 15 million for the navy for fy2009 doe requests 100 million for rrw the navy requests 233 million for rrw but says it pr epared its request before congress eliminated nnsa rrw funds and that the na vy funds would not be used for rrw the house armed services committee in its report on h r 5658 the fy2009 defense authorization bill recommended eliminating the navy and nnsa rrw funds while adding funds for the navy and nnsa for related purposes the house defeated an amendment to add 100 million in nnsa rrw funds to hr 5658 the senate armed services committee recommended retaining nnsas request for rrw but eliminating the navys request both appropriations committees recommended eliminating nns rrw funds for fy2009 the senate defense appropriations subcommittee recommended deleting navy rrw funds its house counterpart reportedly did likewise nnsa argues it will become harder to certify current warheads with lep because small changes may undermine conf idence in warheads perhaps leading to nuclear testing whereas newdesign replacement warheads created by the rrw program will be easier to certify without testing critics believe lep and ssp can maintain the stockpile indefinitely they worry that untested rrws may make testing more likely and question cost saving s given high investment cost they note that there are military requirements for ne w weapons others feel that neither lep nor rrw can provide high confidence over th long term and would resume testing another point of view is that either p or rrw will work w ithout nuclear testing issues facing the 110th congress include how best to maintain the nuclear stockpile whether to continue rrw or cancel it in favor of lep and how rrw might link

extension program details 20 such goals to achieve them rrw would trade characteristics important during the cold war for those of current importance as described below the department of defense dod has approved this tradeoff it would be impossible to meet all the goals simultaneously by modifying existing warheads in part because their designs are so tight that nnsa is concerned that even minor changes might reduce confidence in the reliability of these warheads over the long term as such the rrw program would design new warheads to replace existing ones in contrast lep makes changes chiefly to ma intain weapons and in par ticular minimizes changes to the nuclear explosive package see appendix rrw is sharply debated supporters anticipate that rrw will permit replacing large stockpile of nondeployed nuclear warheads with fewer warheads in which dod can have greater confidence over the l ong term and restructuring the nuclear weapons complex the complex see appendix to be smaller safer more efficient and less costly defense scie nce board task force finds that lep is clearly not sustainable approach and recommended proceeding with rrw4 nnsa argued that rrws will be redesigned for

relationship of the reliable replacement warhead program within the stockpile stewardship program ssp and its impact on the current stockpile life extension programs and rrws feasibility and implementation the re port was delivered to congress on may 5 200813 it concluded doe and the dod firmly believe that it is time for the united states to seek an alternative to the current strategy of extending the lives of legacy warheads indefinitely and to ensure the viability of its nuclear deterrent the united states must initiate and invest in the rrw program now so there will be disconnect between todays credible deterrent and the one required for the future14 4 pl 110181 fy2008 national defe nse authorization act section 3121 required nnsa to report on using exis ting pits for rrw the report was due on july 28 2008 and was submitted on augu st 8 it concluded the multiple objectives of the rrw program would be best met by newly manufactured pits until we can achieve adequa pit production capacity we must plan on using existing pits for any warhead replacement or life extension programs further gravity bomb designs due to the large av ailable weight and volume allow the most opportunitie s for desired improvements and are therefore the most technically feasible candidates for pit reuse15 as discussed under congressional action on th fy2008 rrw request below several fy2008

lawrence livermore nati onal laboratory ucid20990 february 1987 pp 45on service life16 while the service life of other parts may be unknown or revealed only by multiple inspections of warhead type over time 1983 report argued that maintenance requires nuclear testing certain chemically reactive materials are inherently required in nuclear weapons such as uranium or plutonium high explosives and plastics the fissile materials both plutonium and uranium are subject to corrosion plasticbonded high explosives and other plastics tend to decompose over extended periods of time portions of materials can dissoci ate into simpler substances vapors given off by one material can migrate to another region of the weapon and react chemically there materials in the warhead electrical systems can produce effluents that can migrate to regions in the nuclear explosive portion of the weapon the characteristics of high expl osives can change with time vital electrical components can change in character17 1987 report written to rebut the cont ention of the foregoing report that nuclear testing is needed to maintain warheads agreed that aging affects components it should also be noted that nuclear weapons engineering has benefitted from quarter century of experience in dealing with corrosion deterioration and creep since the time that the w45 w47 and w52 warheads entered the stockpile in the early sixties just after the test moratorium of 19581961 most of the reliability problems in the past have resulted from either an incomplete testing program during the development phase of weapon or the aging and deterioration of weapon co mponents during deployment18 some feel that deteriora tion while potential problem has been overstated scientific panel wr iting in 1999 stated there is such thing as design life the designers were not asked or permitted to design nuclear weapon that would go bad after 20 years they did their best on combination of performance and endurance and after experience with the weapon in storage there is certainly reason to expect all of the nuclear weapons of given type to become unusable after 20 or 25 years in fact one of the main goals of sbss science based stockpile stewardship an earlier term for the stockpile stewardship progra m discussed below is to predict the life of the components so that remanufacture may be scheduled and results to date indicate margin of surety extending for decades until now clear evidence of warhead deterioration has not been seen in the enduring stockpilehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32929crs6 19 sidney drell

april 4 2005 22 for example if designers calculated that certain amount of plutonium was the minimum continuedbut the plans for remanufacture still assume that deterioration is inevitable on the timescale of the old arbitrarily defined design lives19 the deterioration noted bove pertained to warheads designed in the 1950s and early 1960s that are longer deployed newer warheads correct some of these problems as knowledge of warhead perfo rmance materials and deterioration increases the labs can correct some problems and forestall others still other aging problems have turned out to occur more slow ly than was feared in particular it was long recognized that plutonium would teriorate as it aged but it was not known how long it would take for terioration to impair performance of the pit the fissile core of nuclear weapons primary stag see appendix nnsa had estimated that that would take at least 45 to 60 years but november 2006 study found there is degradation in performance of primaries of stockpile systems ie warheads due to plutonium aging that would be cause for nearterm concern regarding their safety and reliability mo st primary types have credible minimum lifetimes in excess of 100 years as regards aging of plutonium those with assessed minimum lifetimes of 100 years or less have clear mitigation paths that are proposed andor being implemented20 during the cold war any deterioration problems were limited in their duration because this nation introduced generations of longrange nucleararmed bombers and ballistic missiles each of wh ich would typically carry new warhead tailored to its mission new warheads were usually intr oduced long before the warheads they replaced reached the end of their service lives three trends concerning deterioration have emerged since the end of the cold war 1 ssp and other tools described below have greatly increased nnsas unde rstanding of warhead deterioration and how to deal with or prevent it 2 by maintaining the current set of warhead designs for many years design and production erro rs have been subjected to systematic identification and elimination 3 nuclear warheads have much more time to age as warheads that were expected to remain in the stockpile for at most 20 years are now being retained indefinite ly the net of these trends is that understanding of deterioration while imp roving is not perfect so terioration remains concern current warheads were designed to meet an exacting set of constraints such as safety parameters yield nd conditions such as temperature that they would encounter in their lifetimes design compromises were made to meet these constraints ambassador linton brooks nnsa administrator said that to meet requirements we designed these systems very close to performance cliffs21 that is designs approached points at which warheads would fail22 many parts were hardhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32929crs7 22 continued at which the warhead would work they might add only small extra

approach increased the difficulty of repli cating some components and of maintaining warheads ambassador brooks said it is becoming more difficult and costly to certify warhead remanufacture the evolution away from tested designs resulting from the inevitable accumulations of small changes over the extended lifetimes of these systems means that we can count on increasing uncertainty in the longterm certification of warheads in the stockpile23 at issue is whether warheads can be maintained despite the absence of nuclear testing by replacing deteriorated compone nts with newly made ones built as close as possible to the original specifications this debate has been going on for decades in 1978 letter to president carter three w eapons scientists argued that the united states could go to great lengths in remanufacturing weapon components it is sometimes claimed that remanufacture may become impossible because of increasingly severe restrictions by ep or osha to protect the environment of the worker if the workers environment acceptable til now for the use of asbestos spray adhesives or bery llium should be forbidden by osha regulations those few workers needed to continue operations with such material could wear plasticfilm suits it would be wise also to stockpile in appropriate storage facilities certain commercial materials used in weapons manufacture which might in the future disappear from the commercial scene24 however 1987 report by lawrence li vermore national laboratory stated exact replication especially of older systems is impossible material batches are never quite the same some materials become unavailable and quivalent materials are ne ver exactly equivalent improved parts often have new unexpected failure modes vendors go out of business documentation has never been sufficiently exact to ensure replication we have never known nough about every detail to specify everything that may be important the most important aspect of any product certification is testing it provides the data for valid certification25httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32929crs8 25 continued reliability weapon remanufacture and the role of nuclear testing lawrence

fix problems through the life extension program lep which attempts to extend the expected stockpile lifetime of warhead or warhead components at least 20 years with goal of 30 years29 beyond the originallyanticipated service life warheads components may be divided in to two categories those that are part of the nuclear explosive package nep and those that are not as described in the appendix the nep is the part of the warhead that explodes as distinct from the more numerous components like the outer case or arming system because nonnep components can be subjected to extens ive experiments and nonnuclear laboratory tests they can be modifi ed as needed under lep to incorporate more advanced electronics or safer materials in cont rast nep components cannot be subjected to nuclear tests because the united states has observed moratorium on nuclear testing since 1992 as result lep seeks to re plicate these components using original designs and insofar as possible original materials in this way it is hoped components will be close to the originals so that they can be qualified for use in warheads because nep components cannot be tested while other components can be longterm concern focuses on the former warheads contain several thousand com ponents while not all need to be refurbished in an lep some are difficult to fabricate and assembly may be difficult as discussed earlier as result the lep for an individual warhead type is major campaign requiring extensive preparator analysis and detailed work on many components that can take many years fo r example nnsa describes the lep for the w76 warhead for trident submarinelaunched ballistic missiles as follows the w76 lep will extend the life of the w 76 for an additional 30 years with the first production unit fpu targeted

original emphasis 32 for further discussion of this point see u s congress congressional research service comprehensive nucleartestban treaty issues and arguments crs report rl34394 by jonathan medalia section titled can the united states maintain the nuclear weapons enterprise without testing 33 k henry obrien et sustaining the nuclear enterprise new approach published continuedstockpile stewardship has made great strides in unde rstanding weapons science in predicting how weapons will age and in predicting how they will fail many agree with the following assessment by nnsa administrator thomas dagostino the stockpile stewardship program is working todays stockpile remains safe and reliable and does not require nuclear testing this assessment is based on foundation of past nuclear tests augmented by cutting edge scientific and engineering experiments and analysis nd improved warhead surveillance most importantly it derives from the professi onal and independent judgment of our laboratory directors advised by their weapon program staffs31 others reply that the united states cannot have confiden ce in stockpile stewardship without conducting nuclear test s to validate the tools and computer models in this view it is easier to fit computer models to data from past nuclear tests than to predict results of future tests32 is lep satisfactory for the long term in the turmoil following the end of the cold war it is scarcely surprising that the method chosen to maintain the stockpile task that had to be performed in the face of the many changes affecting th complex and the many unknowns about its future was to minimize changes now with ssp well established nnsa feels that it is appropriate to use different approach to warhead maintenance one that builds on the success of ssp and challenges the notion underlying lep that changes must be held to minimum advocates of rrw recognize that lep has worked well and concede that it can probably maintain warheads over the short term their concern is with maintaining reliability of warheads over the long term they assert that lep is not suited to the task because it w ill become harder to make it work as the tec hnology under which current warheads were created becomes increasingly archaic and as materials equipment processes and skills become unavailable they maintain that if the labs were to lose confidence that they could replicate nep components to nearoriginal designs using nearoriginal materials nd processes the united states could ultimately face choice between resu ming nuclear tests or accepting reduced confidence in reliability instead for exampl the three nuclear weapons laboratories alamos livermore and sandia argu that vision of sustainable warheads with sustainable nuclear enterprise can best be achieved by shifting from program of warhead refurbishment to one of warhead replacement33httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32929crs11 33 continued jointly by lawrence livermore alamos

between 1979 and 1989 was designed to deter and if necessary defeat the sovi et union the threat strategy and missions have changed leaving the united states with the wrong stockpile for current circumstances ambassador brooks said that current warh eads are wrong technically because we would now manage technical risk differen tly for example by trading warhead size and weight for increased performance margins system longevity and ease of manufacture these warheads were not designed for longevity or to minimize cost and may be wrong milita rily because yields are too high and do not lend themselves to reduced collateral damage they also lack capabilities against buried targets or biological and chemical muniti ons and they do not take full advantage of precision guidance34 furthermore leps critics believe the stockpile is wrong politically because it is too large we retain hedge warheads in large part due to the inability of either todays nuclear infrastructure or the infrastructur we expect to have when the stockpile reductions are fully implemented in 2012 to manufacture in timely way warheads for replacement or for force augmentation or to act to correct unexpected technical problems35 finally they believe the stockpile is wrong in terms of physical security because it was not designed for scenario in which terrorists seize control of nuclear weapon and try to detonate it in place accord ing to brooks if we were designing the stockpile today we would apply new technologies and pproaches to warheadlevel use control as means to reduce physical security costs36 advocates

performance margins of current warheads are adequate and can be improved somewhat if needed such as by new systems to deliver boost gas they question the argument that rrw would reduce physical security costs on grounds that terrorist attempt to seize and detonate nuclear warhead in place is most unlikely given the high level of security currently in place and doubt that congress or nnsa would reduce the guard force because of rrw rrw and the transformati on of nuclear warheads the nuclear stockpile was designed to meet cold war requirements for example high explosive yield per unit of warhead weight the yieldtoweight ratio was critically important while co st ease of manufacture and reduction of hazardous material were ss so now yieldtoweigh t has become less important the others just mentioned have become more important ne w constraints have appeared in the wake of 911 and warheads must continue to be safe and reliable as result rrw advocates claim it is possible and

targets higher yield made each warhead better able to destroy its target and high yieldtoweight enabled these goals to be met at the same time for example the w88 warhead for the trident ii d5 submarinelaunched ballistic missile uses conve ntional high explosive che that is more sensitive to impact than insensitive high explosive ihe used on many other warhead types ihe is safer to handle but che packed more energy per unit weight missile could carry the lighter che warheads to greater distance so submarine could stand off farther from its targets increased ocean patrol area forced the soviet union to spread out its antisubmarine assets improving submarine survivability hardto manufacture designs hazardous material s and other undesirable features were deemed acceptable tradeoffs to maximize yieldtoweight now ballistic missiles carry fewer warheads than they did during the cold war so each warhead can be heavier40 in particular the firs t rrw wr1 which is to replace some w76 warheads now on the tr ident ii submarinelaunched ballistic missile will have the yield of the w76 but the higher weight of the w88 resulting in less yield per unit weight the added we ight is

parameters that past nuclear tests have validate d and building in high margins rrw advocates express concern that current warheads were designed with thin margins and that minor changes as result of leps can erode these margins further possibly reducing confidence in thes warheads that could testing to restore advocates of lep have high confidence in current warheads and believe that this confidence is growing despite the absence of testing as noted earlier the jason study on pit aging in this view delays by decades the time when pits would have to be manufactured for current warhead s thus delaying potentially large risk factor that could lead to testing in contrast rrw missile warheads such as wr1 would require the manufacture of new pits and any new product runs the risk of design or manufacturing fects which in this case could lead to testing others hold that neither rrw nor lep provides confidence in the stockpile in this view rrw uses untested designs while the many changes introduced by leps move current warheads away from test ed designs so the only way to restore confidence is to resume nuclear test program that would meet current needs with much lower rate and yield of testing than during the cold war performance schedule and cost tradeoffs performance has always been the dominant consideration for nuclear weapons weapons must meet standards for safety and reliab ility and meet other military characteristics during the cold war schedule was also critical with new missiles and nuclearcapable aircraft entering the force at sustained pace warheads and bombs had to be ready on schedule dictated by their delivery systems as result our nuclear warheads were not designed to minimize doe and dod costs44 now reducing cost has higher priority cost reduction is also more feasible performance is still dominant but imminent external threat drives the schedule wr1 offers many features that its backers claim will reduce costs over its life cycle it

with basic desi gn parameters by using to the extent practicable components that are well unde rstood or are certifiable without the need to resume underground nuclear testing 4 to ensure that the united states velops nuclear weapons infrastructure that can respond to unforeseen problems to include the ability to produce replacement warheads that are safer to manufacture more costeffective to produce and less costly to main tain than existing warheads 5 to achieve reductions in the future size of the nuclear weapons stockpile based on increased reliability of the reliable replacement warheads 6 to use the design certification and production expertise resident in the nuclear complex to develop reliable replacement components to fulf ill current mission requirements of the existing stockpile and 7 to serve as complement to and potentially more costeffective and reliable longterm replacement for the current stockpile life extension programs the committees report pp 464 465 described these objec tives in more detail section 3111 of hr 1815 also required th nuclear weapons council to submit an interim report on rrw by march 1 2006 and final re port by march 1 2007 the final report is to assess characteristics of warheads to replace existing ones discuss the relationship of rrw within ssp and its impact on leps assess the extent to which rrw if successful could lead

of the committees 28 democra tic members 23 signed statement of additional views hrept 10989 pp 511512 accordin g to the statement democrats are willing to explore the concept of the rrw program but do not yet embrace it they felt that to merit support rrw must reduce or eliminate the need for nuclear testing lead to dramatic reductions in the arse nal avoid introducing new mission or weapon requirements deemphasize nuclear weapons military utility increase nuclear security and lead to ratification and try into force of the comprehensive test ban treaty on the latter point they maintained that successful rrw program should erase the main rationale against the treaty uncertainty about the reliability of the nuclear arsenal therefore we believe strongly that ratification of the ctbt

increasing warhead security and reliability developing replacement components that can be manufactured more easily using materials that are more readily available and more environmentally benign developing replacement components that provide high confidence in warhead safety and reliability developing these components on schedule that would reduce the need to conduct nuclear test to address reliability problem reducing the cost and increasing the responsiveness of the infrastructure and increasing confidence in the stoc kpile enough to permit reductions in nondeployed warheads the committee supports these goals and this modest investment in feasibility studies it required nnsas administrator to submit report to the congressional defense committees by february 6 2006 d escribing

the committee recommended 660 million for nnsa for rrw in order to complete phase 2a it made clear that it was not committed to proceeding with phase 3 but wanted more vigorous analysis and debat first it wanted more information to help with this decision such as character istics of the future stockpile the possible effects of rrw on us nuclear nonprolifer ation efforts and comparative costs of rrw vs lep to this end it favored bipartisan congressionallycreated commission to evaluate and make recomme ndations on the role of nuclear weapons in our future strategic posture that commission report can form the basis of information and advice from which the president and the congress can make decisions about the future of rrw and othe r weapons programs at the same time it will be incumbent upon nnsa to provide specific details as to how many rrw weapons will be manufactured how the department of defe nse intends to integrate the system into the stockpile and how ma ny weapons from the existing deterrent can be retired although the committee recomme nded funds to continue phase 2a work on the first rrw type it barred the use of funds for initial research on second rrw

fully fund rrw for fy2008111 they stressed the essential role that nuclear weapons play in maintainin g deterrence argued that it becomes increasingly difficult to certify the existin g stockpile of wea pons and said that pursuit of rrw is critical to sustaining longterm confidence in our deterrent capability further delays on rrw also raise the prospect of having to return to underground testing to certify existing wea pons responding to this statement representatives skelton and tauscher wrote letter to the secretaries stating in part we see promise in the proposed rrw program but we take issue with your assertion that any delay in rrw would force the united states to maintain large stockpile of nuclear weapons and stain it through increasingly costly and risky life extension programs and raise the prospect of having to return to underground nuclear testing to certify existing weapons as we stated in the report accompanying the national defense authorization act for fy 2008 it is too early to know whether rrw can deliver on the objectives that have been established for the program and the prudent course at this point is rigorous study of the feasibility of achieving those objectives112 representatives hobson and visclosky so responded to the statement they said the joint statement reads as desc ription of the status quo and continued the joint statement goes so far as to im ply that rrw is the only available option for addressing the concerns about the existing stockpile of legacy nuclear weapons particularly troubling is th direct link between resumption of nuclear testing and the prov ision of funding for rrw delays on rrw also raise the prospect of having to return to underground nuclear testing to certify existing weapons it is irresponsible for the administration to make such an assertion there is record of congressional testimony or reports sent to congress by the administration claiming that the safety security or reliability of the existing

recommended steps to ensure that the new manufacturing processes proposed for rw1 do not have dele terious effect on wr1 performance and made several recommendations to establish peer review to establish confidence in the warheads design such as having the ffectiveness of the peer review mechanism examined periodically by an independent organization and having the review team broadly constituted with authority to pose formal tests of computational or experimental nature to the design team119 nnsa lauded the report saying that it confirmed that nnsas approach towards developing reliable replacement warhead rrw was proceeding with appropriate scientific principles and c oncluded that nnsas current approach with additional technical experime ntal and peer review enha ncements could determine that rrw can be certified for the stoc kpile without the need to conduct an underground nuclear test further nnsa administrator thomas dagostino said i am pleased that the jason panel

critics respond that work on leps exercises laboratory and production plant expertise they anticipate that leps will enable the united states to retain and maintain its current warheads for decades more they see point in proceeding with rrw in 2008 instead they sugges t waiting for the next administration to decide how it wants to proceed on strategi c policy and what nuclear weapons it wants in order to support that policy congre ss could reconsider rrw at that point examine the link between rrw and reconfigured complex some argue that the complex must be streamlin ed and consolidated to support rrw and that rrw will permit sma ller and less costly comple x because rrw components will be easier to manufacture and assemble and will use ss hazardous material on the other hand revising the complex woul d be very costly as would production of perhaps thousands of rrws and the p it aging study may provide grounds for delaying decision on complex reconfigur ation congress may wish to determine how long it would take for savings from rrw and reconfigured complex to exceed the investment costs with both figures adjusted for net present value to reflect the time value of money152 congress may also consider what upgrades the complex would need in order to support leps consider how to handle moving wr1 to more advanced phase of development nuclear weapons development proceeds in carefullydefined phases this process dates back at least to 1953 agreement between the atomic energy commission predecessor agency of doe and dod that numbers the phases as follows 1 weapon concepti on 2 program study 3 development engineering 4 producti on engineering 5 fi rst production 6 quan tity production and stockpile153 the nuclear weapons council updated this agreement in 2000 with guidelines for phase 6x process in which the phases in the 1953 agreement were applied to refurbishment of existin g weapons ie those in phase 6154 thus phase 61 was concept assessment for refurbis hing an existing weapon the 2000 update included phase 62a design definition and cost study by extension phase 2a is design definition and cost study for new warheadhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32929crs49

staff provided the following inform ation in april 2007 the plan was for the first rrw to enter phase 2a in early may 2007 with goal of completing that phase by the end of december 2007 the weapon would then be ready for decision by the nuclear weapons council on moving to phase 3 if the council approved during fy2008 of beginning rrw phase 3 nnsa might ask the armed services and appropriations committees fo r approval to reprogram funds for that purpose most of the 888 million requested for rrw for fy2008 was for work on phase 2a with small portion of the m oney for phase 3 work as noted the fy2008 consolidated appropriations act elimin ated fy2008 funds for nnsa to develop rrw but that does not necessar ily terminate the program as result any decision to resume rrw would be important for congress beyond that any decision to move rrw to phase 3 would also be important for congress phase 3 involves considerably more money than does phase 2a in addition while phase 2a is study the results of which might lead to the cancellation of weapon program phase 3 ca rries much stronger presumption that the weapon would proceed through deve lopment to production and deployment legislation reflects the importance of the move from phase 2a to phase 3 pl 107314 fy 2003 national defense authorization act section 3143 requirements for specific request for new or modified nuclear weapons requires that request for funds for each new weapon in phase 3 or higher or for each modified weapon in phase 63 or higher with exceptions such as for life extension programs be presented as separate line item while requests for funds for earlie r phases are to be combined into single line item pl 108136 fy2004 national defense authorization act section 3117 also highlights the importan ce of engineering development as congressional decision point by barring the secretary of energy from beginning engineering development or any subseque nt phase of the robust nuclear earth penetrator without specific congressional authorization should rrw be linked to the comprehensive test ban treaty ctbt the ctbt bars all nuclear explosions155 the united states and other nations signed it beginning in 1996 as of july 2008 178 nations have signed it and 144 have ratified156 however 44 specified nations must ratify for it to enter into force and 9 of them including the ited states have not ratified the senate rejected it in 1999 on such grounds as the capability of the stockpile stewardship program to maintain current warheads possi ble need for new warheads need for new security features questions about monito ring ability and the prospect that other nations might make militarily significant gains through clandestine testing since then congress has rejected new warhead s for new missions and some argue that stockpile stewardship has demonstrated its capability and that detection capability has improved greatly in this view the ctbt merits reconsideration others prefer to avoid nuclear testing but also do not want to enter the ctbt they would maintainhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32929crs50 157 walter pincus congress skeptical of warhead plan washington post april 22 2007 p

wwwstategovsecretaryrm200674669htmthe current moratorium still others argue that stockpile stewardship tools have not been verified by nuclear testing militarily significant clandestine cheating is still possible and some security features could be added only with testing they would resume testing at low pace and low yield rrws support in congress has by some accounts diminished157 so some favoring rrw see ctbtrrw link as possible quid pro quo similarly some favoring the ctbt also raise the prosp ect of quid pro quo arguing that nnsa claims that rrw will reduce the likelihood of need to return to testing on the other hand some rrw supporters see rrw as deserving approval on its merits and fear that the ctbt could impair us secu rity while some ctbt supporters feel that the prospects for ctbt ratification will increase over time and that rrw would undermine us ability to take the lead on nuclear nonproliferation advocates of both positions would reject ctbtrrw link will rrw weaken us nuclear nonproliferation efforts rrw advocates hold that lep will cause confidence in the stockpile to decline and with it us ability to assure allies that the u s deterrent is sound to dissuade competitors from beginning nuclear programs to deter adversaries and if necessary to defeat enemies as called for in the 2001 nuclear posture review in contrast they say rrw is designed as replacement wea pon rather than new weapon with new military capabilities and one that will be easier to manufacture maintain and certify than current warheads with wider performance margins to raise confidence that it will work as intended this confidence is important for nuc lear nonproliferation because it makes friends nd allies less inclined to develop their own nuclear weapons in re sponse to acti ons of potential proliferators like north korea or iran as japanese foreign minister taro aso sa id shortly after the north korean nuclear test of october 2006 there is need to arm ourselves with nuclear weapons either for japans own defense we have this mutual defense treaty with the united states and we have the commitment and that commitment has been reconfirmed by secretary rice that there is this commitment to make sure that the security system will work158 without confidence in us nuclear weapons it is argued that commitment becomes of questionable value moreover any nation seeking to manufacture nuclear weapons woul d require decadeslong effort that is insensitive to us actions according to john harvey director of nnsas policy planning staff the rrw effort itself has positive implications for non proliferation because these warheads would be designed with more favorable performance margins and be less sensitive to incremental aging effects they would reduce the possibility that the united states would ever be faced with need to conduct nuclear test to diagnose or remedy stockpile reliability problem further he notes that this nation has take n many actions consistent with article vi of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt in which the parties undertake to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of

operationallydeployed strategic nuclear weapons ta king steps to reduce the us nuclear stockpile and removing up to 200 metric tons of high ly enriched uranium from weapons use159 critics are concerned that other nations would perceive rrw as new weapon that is at odds with the reciprocity of obligations between nuclear and nonnuclear weapon states that is the core of the np t and particularly with us obligations under article vi as result in this vi ew rrw would make it harder to deal with iranian and north korean nuclear programs and those programs in turn could lead to followon wave of possible proliferator s for example if japan saudi arabia and egypt saw nuclear weapons spreading they might undertake nuclear programs of their own by signaling that the united states places heavy value on nuclear weapons through the rrw program instead of seeking to downplay and devalue these weapons these critics maintain the ited states undermines its ability to lead worldwide nuclear nonproliferation effort s former senator sam nunn said on the rrw itself if congress gives green light to this program in our current world environment and i stress in our current world environment i believe that this will be misunderst ood by our allies exploited by our adversaries complicate our work to prevent the spread and use of nuclear weapons and make resolution of the iran and north korea challenges all the more difficult also i think it will make it more difficult to discourage the many new countries that are right on the tipping point of beginning their enrichment process we will pay very high price in terms of our overall national security if congress goes forward with this pr ogram so i would not f und additional work on the rrw at this time certainly not development and going forward with deployment160 similarly former secretary of defense william perry said on balance i believe that we could defer action for many years on the rrw program and i have doubt that this would put us in stronger position to lead the international community in the continuing battle against nuclear pr oliferation which threatens us

nuclear weapons nuclear weapons complex and stockpile stewardship program this report refers to nuclear w eapons design opera tion and production throughout this appendix scribes key terms concepts and facilities as an aid to readers not familiar with them current strategic longrange and most tactical nuclear weapons are of two stage design162 the first stage the primary is an atomic bomb similar in principle to the bomb dropped on nagasaki the primary provides the energy needed to trigger the second stage or secondary the primary has at its center pit hollow core containing fissile material typically plutonium and containment she lls of other metals it is surrounded by chemical explosive shaped to generate symmetrical inwardmoving implosion shock front when the explosive is detonated the implosion compresses the plutonium increasing its density so much that it becomes supercritical and can sustain runaway nuclear chain reaction neutron generator injects neutrons into the plutonium the neutrons drive this reaction by splitting fissioning plutonium atoms repeatedly doubling the number of ne utrons released but the chain reaction can last only the briefest moment before th force of the nuclear explosion drives the plutonium outward so that it becomes subc ritical and can longer support chain reaction to increase the fraction of plut onium that is fissioned boosting the yield of the primary another system injects boost gas mixture of deuterium and tritium isotopes of hydrogen gases into the pit before the explosive is detonated the intense heat and pressure of the fissi on chain reaction cause this gas to undergo fusion while the fusion reaction generates energy its purpose is to generate great many neutrons and thus boost the fi ssion chain reaction to higher level metal radiation case channels the ener gy of the primary to the secondary which contains fission and fusion fuel the energy ignites the secondary which releases most of the energy of nuclear explosion th primary radiation case and secondary comprise the nuclear explos ive package thousands of nonnuclear components are also needed to make the nuclear explosive package into militarily usable weapon such as an arming firing and fuzing system an outer case and electrical and physical connecti ons linking bomb to an airplane or warhead to missile nuclear weapons were designed test ed and manufactured by the nuclear weapons complex which is composed of eight governmentowned contractor operated sites the alamos nationa l laboratory nm and lawrence livermore national laboratory ca which design nuclear explosive packages sandia national laboratories nm and ca which design s nonnuclear components y12 plant tn which produces uranium components and s econdaries kansas city plant mohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32929crs57 which produces many of the nonnuclear co mponents savannah river site sc which processes tritium from stockpiled weapons to rem ove decay products pantex plant tx which assemble s and disassembles nuclear weapons and the nevada test site which used to conduct nuclear tests but now conducts other weapons related experiments that do not produce nuc lear yield these sites are now involved in disassembly insp ection and refurb ishment of existing nuclear weapons the national nuclear security administratio n nnsa semiautonomous part of the department of energy manages the nuclear wea pons complex and program nnsa maintains nuclear weapons and associated expertise through the stockpile stewardship program ssp which congress created in the fy1994 national defense authoriza tion act pl 103160 section 3138 the legislation specified that the goal of ssp is to ensure the preservation of the core intellectual and technical compet encies of the united states in nuclear weapons through advanced computational capabilities boveground experiment s experiments not requiring nuclear testing and construction of large experimental facilities ssp has three main elements directed stockp ile work involves work directly on nuclear weapons in the stockpile such as mon itoring their condition maintaining them through refurbishment and modifications rd in support of specific warheads and dismantlement it includes the life extension program nd the rrw program campaigns provide focused scientific and engineerin g expertise in support of directed stockpile work in such areas as pit manufacturing and certification computation and study of the properties of materi als readiness in technical base and facilities funds infrastru cture and operations at th nuclear weapons complex sites while the legislation did not specify that ssp was not to involve nuclear testing that goal seems clear from the history and has become goal of the program nnsa does not rule out the possible need for testing such as if problem were to emerge in warhead type that could not be remedied in any other way but the united states has been able to maintain its nuclear stockpile without testing since 1992
