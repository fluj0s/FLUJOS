by anne w patterson reasons 14 b d 1 c summary on may 26 codel schiff us representatives adam schiff dca and allyson schwartz dpa met with pakistan peoples party ppp cochairman asif zardari foreign minister shah mehmood qureshi nsa ambassador mahmud ali durrani and ambassadordesignate to the us husain haqqani zardari thanked the codel for usg support of credible national elections as he has previously he committed pakistan to the war on terror insisting this was pakistans fight he argued more needed to be done by the us and international community to promote economic development in the frontier building on that point zardari suggested new blend of usg assistance increasing aid to civilian forces like the police and promoting civilian engagement he warned that public opinion was unalterably against president pervez musharraf and that for the sake of the new gop musharraf needed to contemplate an honorable exit end summary we are because of you 2 c meeting may 26 in islamabad us representatives schiff and schwartz met with ppp leader zardari and his foreign policy team zardari thanked the usg for its support of credible parliamentary elections which brought his party to power we are here because of you zardari noted that his late wife benazir bhutto maintained close relations with many of member of congress and he encouraged more codel visits to pakistan to improve mutual understanding pakistans war 3 c as he has before zardari stressed that the global war on terror gwot was pakistans war the fall of bhuttos second government was financed by osama bin laden he claimed noting that she and her father zulfiqar ali bhutto were assassinated by religious extremists but counterterrorism initiatives lacked popular pakistani support zardari lamented and terrorism fostered profiteers who had an interest in the struggle continuing 4 c zardari argued that pakistan muslim leaguen pmln leader nawaz sharif had walked into the vacuum as opposition leader when bhutto was assassinated just weeks before national elections for stability however the ppp continued to cooperate with the pmln at the federal and punjab provincial levels 5 c zardari described the general distrust of the us by the public and in political circles fearing you will leave us again post 911 however he believed this was longer an option the usg would have to make commitment of decades calling for marshall plan for pakistan there were already success stories noting that his progressive ppp even won national assembly seat from the federally administered tribal areas fata 6 c zardari advocated attacking the root cause of radical insurgency economic underdevelopment he lobbied the representatives to quickly take up and pass reconstruction opportunity zone roz legislation there should be us tax breaks for companies producing made in pakistan products noting that pakistans textile industry would be more competition to other countries than to us manufacturers without creating more jobs pakistan just could not match the talibans reported usd 300 per month to tribals in the frontier regions the tribals though wanted peace zardari claimed new blend 7 c asked if he felt usg assistance over the past seven years had been military heavy zardari noted that democracy promotion had been the smallest component of aid he quickly added that military aid was still badly needed but more should also go to civilian forces eg police usg assistance should support social development eg more higher education scholarships to pakistanis studying in the islamabad 00001998 002 of 002 us all in all he wanted to see more civilian engagement than militarytomilitary exchanges zardari also said he wanted the with support from the us and other western countries to establish compensatory fund for the families of the victims of terrorist acts on musharraf 8 c transitioning zardari blamed president pervez musharraf for not taking enough responsibility for the gwot in pakistan the public instead believed pakistanis were dying for the us zardari then said antius feelings will go away when the old faces go away adding that the usg should longer rely on just musharraf in fighting radicalism 9 c zardari admitted that his public statements in the last week had been more antimusharraf he was afraid that he and his party were losing popular support while nawaz was able to pretend to be the populist by supporting restoration of the prenovember 3 judges but he doesnt want the chief justice iftikhar chaudhry back in just musharraf out zardari revealed that he hoped to discuss privately with musharraf the possibility of an honorable exit and believed chief of army staff coas ashfaq kayani would stay out of such political discussions 10 c zardari feared however that musharraf was misguided by smoothtalking advisors who were protecting their own personal interests the public was against the president the institution and the man adding the ppp needed to change the face of pakistan or it too would be kicked out of power we wont act without consulting with you zardari concluded 11 u codel schiff did not clear this cable patterson
