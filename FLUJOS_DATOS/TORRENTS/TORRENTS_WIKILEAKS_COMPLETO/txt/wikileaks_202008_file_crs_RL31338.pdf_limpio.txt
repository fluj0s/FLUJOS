election day that there was not sufficient time under state electionadministration procedures to change the ballot and substitute another candidate leaving the name of deceased candidate on the ballot has raised questions and criticisms in some quarters concerning state authority to issue final ballot and to decline to add or substitute other candidates at some point prior to an election whether votes for the deceased candidate are legal or rather should not be counted since the deceased candidate is not qualified to serve in the office and whether vacancy in the office can be created in effect prospectively when and if the ineligible candidate receives the most votes or whether new special election must proceed immediately under the states constitutional times places and manner authority over federal elections the states may establish ballot procedures and administrative requirements courts have noted that states have compelling interest in setting deadlines and in finalizing the ballot so that general election ballots can be properly and timely prepared and distributed and have thus found that there is legal or constitutional problem with state finalizing its ballot and refusing to withdraw add or substitute names on the ballot within reasonable timeframe prior to an election such state deadlines for finalizing the ballot are not only common but are seen as absolute administrative necessities for orderly elections and for the prevention of disenfranchisement of military and other absentee voters with ballot deadlines common administrative requirement in the states it is not unprecedented for candidate to die in such proximity to an election that the ballots have been finalized resulting in the deceased candidates name remaining on the ballot for

writs of election but in the alternative the governor if authorized by state law may make temporary appointment until later election to fill the remainder of the term as directed by the state legislature the seventeenth amendment its history and express judicial interpretation indicate that the states have discretionary authority to provide for temporary appointment of senator by the

gives the most votes to candidate on the ballot who because of constitutional disqualification death or other disability is ineligible to serve in the senate or in the house introduction and background if candidate who has been elected to the united states house of representatives or the united states senate subsequent ly dies prior to taking the oath of office or later acquires or has discovered legal disability such that he or she is longer eligible to serve or to be seated in the house or the senate then precedent and practice indicate that vacancy in that office would be established such vacancy would then be filled according to the united states constitution however if candidate dies prior to general election for the house or senate but because of the imminence of the election the candidates name remains on the ballot under state election law procedures and that deceased candidate then receives the most votes in the election should this be treated as other than vacancy in the office which will occur at the beginning of the congressional session as expressly provided in the united states constitution at article i section 5 cl 1 the house and the senate each shall be the judge of the elections returns and qualifications of its own members in judging congressional elections the overwhelming weight of precedent in both the house and the senate has been to follow the socalled american rule whereby an absolute disability or ineligibility of candidate receiving the most votes in an election the majority candidate creates vacancy in the office which is then filled according to the constitution the next highest qualified votegetter in such an election is not deemed by the house or senate to be entitled to the seat under this american rule unlike under the so called british rule nor is the entire election considered nullity such that new election or doover must proceed immediately1 under congressional precedent and practice it has not mattered

appointments to fill senate seat until an election is held to fill the remainder of the term as directed by state law2 in the case of vacancies in the house of representatives the constitution does not authorize the governor of state to fill seat on an interim basis but rather instructs only that writs of election for special election shall be issued by the governor3 the timing of the election to fill vacancies for representative or delegate and thus how long the vacancy will continue is generally within the discretion of the individual states as matter of state law4 on the several occasions of the death of candidate for the united states house of representatives so close to the election that new candidate could not qualify in time to be printed on the general election ballot under applicable state election administration laws and that deceased candidate subsequently received the most votes in the election or when the majority candidate on the ballot was otherwise constitutionally ineligible for the office the socalled american rule was applied that is the receipt of the most votes by the deceased or otherwise ineligible candidate on the ballot was deemed to

finalization of the ballot and who then received the most votes in the election vacancy in the office of united states senator was deemed to have occurred in that state and such vacancy was filled as prescribed in the united states constitution and state law that is by an interim appointment by the governor former governor mel carnahan of missouri the democratic nominee for senator died in plane

sufficient number of votes are cast for the deceased candidate to entitle the candidate to election had the candidate not died vacancy shall exist in the office to be filled in the manner provided by

concerning deceased candidate on the ballot and such candidate receiving the most votes during the most recent case of the 2000 senate race in missouri there were arguments raised in certain quarters that it was in some way unconstitutional for the state to allow the name of deceased candidate to remain on the ballot for united states senator regardless of the timing of the candidates demise in relation to the election and that because the deceased candidate on the ballot could not actually hold the office of united states senator being deceased he was not an inhabitant of the state as required by article i section 3 cl 3 that either the election in which the deceased candidate received the most votes should be ignored or set aside and new election held immediately or that the minority candidate as being the qualified candidate who received the most votes should win12 these arguments in the first instance would appear to call into question the viability and constitutionality of states authority to set specific deadline for finalizing the ballot that is certain time or date prior to the day of an election after which the ballot for that election could not be changed to add remove or substitute the names of candidates secondly these arguments would appear to press the so called british rule upon the senate in judging the elections and qualifications of its members whereby the will of the plurality or majority of the voters of the state would be disregarded either by acting as if the election did not occur or by not counting the votes cast for the deceased or otherwise ineligible candidate and seating the minority candidate finally certain arguments were forwarded that even if it had not been improper to allow the deceased candidates name to remain on the ballot when the death of the candidate occurred in such proximity to the election the state should not be allowed to treat as prospective vacancy the death of the candidate who remains on the ballot under such argument if the deceased candidate received the most votes the governor would not be able to make temporary appointment to fill the vacant seat under the seventeenth amendment even if expressly authorized under the laws of the state as specifically provided for in the seventeenth amendment but rather could only issue writs of election for special election to fill vacancies in the office of united states senator which occur by virtue of the election of disqualified candidate13httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31338crs5 14powell v mccormack 395 us 486 1969 us term limits inc v

instrument which created those federal offices that is the united states constitution and are unalterable by the congress or by any state unilaterally14 the constitution expressly provides however that the individual states generally have the authority to administer elections even ones for federal congressional office15 while at the same time expressly providing that each house of congress has the authority to be the final judge of the results of those elections16 furthermore the constitution expressly provides that each house of congress is to be the judge of the three constitutional

preparation and printing of the ballots state must by necessity because of the exigencies of time and duties limit or establish timeframe or deadline by which the ballot must be set or finalized that is reasonable time before the general or primary election when more candidates may be placed on the ballot or programmed into the voting machines courts have noted that states have compelling interest in setting deadlines and in finalizing the ballot so that general election ballots can be properly and timely prepared and distributed19 one of the consequences of not having set ballot at some reasonable point prior to an election and of allowing lastminute changes in the candidates on the printed ballot and on voting machines would be the disenfranchisement of military and other absentee voters since such lastminute changes would not allow sufficient time before election day to prepare print mail out and then to receive back by mail new absentee ballots with such changes as found by one federal court with an election mere five weeks away even if plaintiffs had prevailed on the merits of their arguments against their exclusion from the ballot the court would have still refused to require the state to change its ballots by including petitioners names since the court recognized the overriding administrative necessities of deadlines to insure time available for election officials to complete their election preparations before the election20 the court noted the risk of substantial disruption of the electoral process that could ensue by changing ballot after the stateestablished administrative deadline for finalization of those ballots and noted the tight schedule of election officials and the myriad duties and responsibilities that are valid administrative reasons for reasonable deadlines for finalizing ballots last minute voter registrati on processing of many absentee ballot requests supervising the printing of voting machine ballots sample ballots tally sheets

with an election less than three weeks away federal court refused to require the changing of ballot to add petitioners names even on strong first amendment showing by petitioners since much of the ballot and voting machine preparation had already taken place and there needed to be balancing and proper weight given to the states needs and interests in an orderly election including the prevention of the possible disenfranchisement of absentee and military voters caused by eleventh hour changes to the ballot23 justice marshall on circuit turned down on october 1 request to order names to be printed on ballot for an upcoming november election citing among other reasons the states concern for the potential chaotic and disruptive effect upon the electoral process since the presidential and overseas ballots have already been printed some have been distributed the general absentee ballots are currently being printed24 the length of time before the election of deadline which fixes the ballot in relation to the administrative tasks that must be accomplished during that time is generally relevant in judging the reasonableness and necessity of such deadline the courts have noted that overly long deadlines for the filing of petitions by candidates such as march or april deadlines for november election may not be of such necessity as to overcome fourteenth amendment and first amendment complaints of unfair treatment of supporters of those candidates who must file petitions to gain ballot access as opposed to nominated party candidates who had much later deadlines25 in the context of deceased candidate it is conceivable or at least arguable that an issue of this nature could arise for example if deceased senatorial candidate whose name remains on the ballot is of different political party from that of the governor of the state and if there is an unusually long period of time before the general election when the ballot is fixed by state law in such situation voters affiliated with the deceased candidates party might argue that they have choice on the ballot to select someone of their own political persuasion for senator at least for the temporary period before the next election to fill the term that is just as vote for the other candidate on the ballot is vote for someone from the other party vote for the deceased candidate of their own party may

party since the governor would most likely appoint someone from his own political party to fill the vacancy there may in such cases be need to balance the constitutional rights and interests of voters and supporters of the political party of the deceased candidate26 with the right of the state to finalize its ballot for administrative purposes and the reasonableness and necessity of those time deadlines to perform such administrative duties as printing and distribution of ballots including absentee and overseas ballots preparing and programing voting machines preparing voter instructions and sample ballots and training of poll workers and officials27 in sum there has been found legal or constitutional problem with state finalizing its ballot and refusing to add substitute or withdraw names from the ballot within reasonable timeframe in proximity to an election such ballot deadlines are not only common in the states but are seen as absolute administrative necessities for fairness and orderly elections and for the prevention of disenfranchisement of military and other absentee voters all of which the courts have recognized as compelling state interests unfortunately it is therefore not unprecedented nor uncommon for candidate to die in such proximity to an election that the ballots have already been finalized and to have that deceased candidates name remain on the ballot for the election under the majority american rule recognized and followed by both the house and the senate for judging the elections of their members as well as most of the states for their own nonfederal offices28 votes for the deceased candidate are not illegal improper thrown away or otherwise deemed to be nullities nor is the election considered nonevent but rather if the deceased candidate receives the most votes such expression is considered indicative that the majority or plurality of the voters favored the creation of temporary vacancy in the office to be filled according to the constitution and the laws of the state the issue in an imminent federal election concerning the remaining on the ballot of the name of deceased candidate is clearly not whether the candidate who has died is or is not now qualified to be senator under article i section 3 clause 3 or representative under article i section 2 clause 2 of the united states constitution obviously the deceased candidate could not and will not serve in or hold the office to which he or she had aspired while alive nor has it ever been suggested that state intended to issue credentials to the deceased

certified when placed on the ballot timely contests were filed to challenge the candidates qualifications and ballot access at that time and the deadline established by state law for finalizing the ballots or for substituting candidates on the ballot by political parties had passed in this context the issue of qualifications for candidate receiving the most votes in congressional election would arise at the time memberelect with credentials from the state as result of either special election or an interim appointment in the case of senatorelect presents himself or herself to the house or to the senate for being sworn in and seated to fill the vacancy created by the death of the original majority candidate in the general election29 senate and house decisions on qualifications as noted while the states administer federal elections including such administrative housekeeping and procedural matters as ballot access and placement on the ballot the question of the qualifications of candidate for the united states congress is decided in the first instance exclusively as provided for in the united states constitution and then as to whether person has met such constitutional qualifications by each house of congress judging the elections returns and qualifications of its own members30 although there had been in the history of our country some debate over the nature of the authority of congress to judge general qualifications andor suitability of memberelect for office the extent of the authority to exclude memberelect by majority vote based on the memberelects qualifications was expressly and narrowly delineated by the supreme court in 1969 in powell v mccormack 31 the supreme court in that case clearly stated that in judging the qualifications of its members congress is limited to the standing qualifications prescribed in the constitution 32 that is the memberelects age citizenship and inhabitancy in the state from where elected33 the court noted that the house is without authority to exclude any person duly elected by his constituents who meets all the requirements for membership expressly prescribed in the constitution34 modern decisions in the house or senate on determinin g qualifications are fairly rare in part because of the clarification by the supreme court in powell vhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31338crs10 35the precedents of both the house and senate predatin g 1969 where memberelects character or preelection conduct was examined in judging qualifications to office are thus of limited relevance to modern congressional practice and

congress authority in judging qualifications to judge only the three express constitutional qualifications for office35 and because modern communications and media coverage make it more likely that an actual disqualifying condition such as candidates age or lack of citizenship would be revealed before nominations by major political party are made it should be noted that an appointment by the governor of california under the seventeenth amendment and the laws of california was challenged in 1964 on the basis of qualifications of the appointee pierre salinger under the laws of the state of california one needed to be qualified elector to be candidate for united states senate which would have required one to have resided in the state for particular amount of time some senators argued that salinger was not qualified to be chosen to fill the unexpired term of senator from california because under the laws of the state of california he had not resided in california long enough to meet the states qualifications of being an elector as required by state law for candidacy36 the senate found in accordance with the findings of the privileges and elections subcommittee of the committee on rules however that such state law would have force and effect only as to state and local offices and could not disqualify one from being chosen as united states senator state provisions cannot bind the senate in determining the constitutional qualifications for office of those presenting credentials for seating nor can state law add durational residency requirement to the inhabitancy qualification for senator set out in the united states constitution that is to be an inhabitant of the state when elected37 in the senate there has since the adoption of the seventeenth amendment been one other case in addition to the 2000 missouri election in which an ineligible candidate was on the ballot and then received the most votes in the election in that instance the senate candidate receiving the most votes was not yet eligible to serve in the senate at the time he was on the ballot for the general election nor at the time of the beginning of the new congressional session because he was only 29 years of age the senate found that since the issue of qualifications arises when the candidate or memberelect presents his credentials to the senate for seating the senate could and did allow the candidatememberelect to delay presenting his credentials until the time he was 30 years old and thus qualified38 the precedents in the house similarly indicate that the issue of qualifications would arise at the time member elect presents his or her credentials for seating generally at the commencement of the session and that the memberelect would have to meet the age and citizenship requirements at that time but must meet the inhabitancy requirement at the time of the election that is when elected the house has in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31338crs11 39in re

that is he was not citizen for seven years at the time he was on the ballot and elected in the november congressional election nor at the beginning of the first session of the new congress39 the house earlier in 1859 had apparently also allowed memberelect mr john brown of kentucky to defer taking the oath of office beyond the opening of the congress until the beginning of the next session in december of 1860 at which time mr brown met the constitutional age requirement40 judging elections in congress and the american rule as expressly provided in the constitution the house or the senate

constitutional qualific ations that is as stated by the supreme court each house may inquire and judge as to whether memberele ct was duly elected by his constituents41 the supreme court in roudebush

senate of an election and the election returns for the united states senate the senate is free to accept or reject the apparent winner in either count original or recount and if it chooses to conduct its own recount42 given the express textual commitment within the constitution to each house of congress to be the judge of its own members elections the congressional precedent and practice in this area although not technically binding on future congress is of primary importance43 furthermore given this express textual commitment within the constitution it is not surprising that there is

extended discussion of this point quite unnecessary the house did not need to rule on or confirm the majority opinion of the committee as the house found that the majority candidate was qualified seating the memberelect and dismissing the contestprovision would have entertained challenges to review congressional determinations on the elections of their own members44 the practice and experience in both the house and the senate on elections of ineligible candidates is clear and is remarkably consistent given the great potential for partisan division on this issue when it arises with respect to particular member elect the overwhelming weight of authority in both the senate and the house as well as the express statements of official senate and house procedural and parliamentary guides clearly indicate that the ineligibility of the majority candidate in congressional election whether because of death disability or other incapacity before or after the election gives title or right to the office to the runnerup candidate but rather merely creates vacancy in the office from that state45 this has been the case whether or not the law of the particular state in which the election was held would have under express state law or practice given the election to the runnerup in the indiana election case of lowery v white in the fiftieth congress notwithstanding the fact that indiana law at that time followed the minority english rule and would have awarded the election to the runnerup if the majority candidate was ineligible the majority of the committee on elections found that the clear and long line of congressional precedent follows the socalled american rule and that despite the state law the runnerup is not entitled to congressional seat upon the disqualification of the majority candidate46 as early as 1868 the house had under its consideration challenge to vacancy where the contesting candidate claimed seat by virtue of the fact that the winning candidate on the

committee held that contestant could have claim to seat declared vacant because of the constitutional disqualifications of the sitting member of inhabitancy in the state was immaterial to the challengers claim to the seat since the disqualification of the majority candidate on the ballot for lack of inhabitancy would merely create vacancy in the office and would not elect the minority or second place votegetter contestant further contended that mr mann was not at the time of his election an inhabitant of the state and was therefore ineligible the committee held that it was immaterial whether he was ineligible or not as under the principles already settled by the decisions of other cases the ineligibility of the majority candidate would give title to the minority candidate the committee were therefore unanimous in the opinion that mr jones was not elected and that the death of mr mann had caused vacancy47 in the senate it is plainly noted in the senates procedural treatise that in election cases the ineligibility of majority candidate for seat in the congress gives title to the candidate receiving the next highest number of votes48 senate precedents citing similar rulings in the house of representatives have stated the wellestablished senate rule that the ineligibility of the winning candidate gives title to the candidate receiving the next highest number of votes49 in the senate election case of henry d hatfield v rush d holt where the candidate on the ballot who had been elected by the people was only twentynine years old the senate reaffirmed that even if winning candidate was ruled ineligible the runnerup in the election would not be declared elected50 the committee on privileges and elections in the 74th congress explained as follows also that the said henry d hatfield by virtue of his having received the next highest number of eligible votes for united states senator in the general election held in and for the state of west virginia in november 1934 is not the duly elected senator from the state of west virginia the rule is well settled that in election cases the ineligibility of majority candidate for seat in the congress gives

and expressly rejected in favor of the american rule of representative democracy as explained in rowells digest the committee in that case found but the english rule had never been applied in this country and was hostile to the genius of our institutions mr cushing in stating the english parliamentary rule states that in his opinion the same rule applies in this country but he gives case to sustain his statement which is the best of evidence that there are none there had been numerous cases in the house and senate where members were deprived of their seats because of ineligibility but in case had it ever been claimed that any title was thereby given to the minority candidate53 the socalled american rule is based on principles of representative democracy that in such system the overriding issue in an election contest in the house or senate is to attempt to effectuate the will of the majority or plurality of the voters of that state or district usually in determining who was actually elected or duly elected by the people to represent them that is who has received the most votes54 under these principles one who has in fact lost an election that is has received fewer votes than someone else on the ballot is therefore not seated by the legislature in contravention of the choice of the people of the state or district upon finding by the legislature of an ineligibility and disqualification of the actual winner of the election when under the american rule majority or plurality of voters vote for candidate widely known to be ineligible such as in the case of candidate who dies shortly before the election but whose name remains on the ballot it is assumed that the will of the majority or plurality of voters was to choose vacancy in the case of senate races if the governor has already indicated the person whom he will appoint to fill the vacancy should the deceased candidate receive the most votes then the will of the electorate in giving the most votes to the deceased candidate would arguably have been expressed in favor of that proposed appointee over the other candidates on the ballot in one case in the senate concerning an anticipatory appointment where there arose an issue as to which governor the outgoing or incoming had the authority to appoint an interim senator to the vacancy created by the incoming governor who was giving up his senate seat to be governor the senate precedent indicates that the decision was made in part on recognition that the voters had known when they elected matthew neely governor that he intended to name his senate successor since he made his plan clear during the campaign55httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31338crs15 56viet ddinh dead men cant win the wall street journal november 9 2000 at a26 57some states require the

qualification for the senate additional to those established in the constitution 58rodriquez v popular democratic party 457 us 1 11 1982seventeenth amendment it was argued during the 2000 senate race in missouri that the seventeenth amendment adopted principally to provide for popular election of united states senators should limit governors authority and the authority of the state legislatures in empowering the governor to require governor to issue only writs of election for special election when there is vacancy which has been created by the election of candidate known to be disqualified or ineligible at the time of the election rather than making temporary appointment to fill such vacancy until later scheduled election56 although there are some interesting policy arguments concerning such proposed limitations on state governors authority to make temporary appointments in these circumstances particularly where the governor is of the same major political party as the surviving candidate57 there is nothing on the face of the language of the seventeenth amendment its enactment history nor any judicial interpretations or congressional precedents which support such restrictive construction of state authority under the amendment the language of the vacancy clause of the seventeenth amendment clearly provides distinctions as to when or how the vacancy in the office has been created when vacancies happen in the representation of any state in the senate the executive authority of such state shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies provided that the legislature of any state may empower the executive thereof to make temporary appointments until the people fill the vacancies by election as the legislature may direct the text and the actual language of the amendment clearly show therefore that there is express restriction on state legislatures or governors authority which is dependant or based upon any distinctions in the nature or the timing of how or when the senate vacancy occurs rather the language of the amendment appears to provide on its face two alternate ways for state to fill any vacancy in the states representation in the senate either the executive of the state shall issue writs of election for special election to fill the vacancy or if expressly authorize d by the legislature of the state the governor may make temporary appointment to fill the vacancy until the people select replacement for the remainder of the term in future election as the state legislature may direct as noted in dicta by the supreme court the seventeenth amendment permits state if it chooses to forgo special election in favor of temporary appointment to the united states senate 58 in practice most of the states provide for temporary

temporary appointment by the governor of state in cases of senate vacancies until an election is held providing quick and efficient method to fill senate vacancy may have been intended in part as an effort to address this problem 63representative tucker of virginia originally drafted and offered in 1892 the vacancy provision eventually adopted in 1912 as reported in the house one reason discretion was given to the state legislatures to allow temporary appointment until later election such as regularly scheduled statewide election was that mandatory special elections might be continuedalso provide for more immediate special election and authorize an appointment by the governor until the time of such election59 generally speaking in provisions such as the seventeen th amendment the plain meaning of the text and the words of the provision should be employed in discerning its import and intent unless there is some clear and express countervailing enactment history60 furthermore under longestablished principles of constitutional interpretation meaning must be given to all the words in provision and thus phrases and words in the text of the constitution may not be ignored61 thus while the principal purpose of the seventeenth amendment was certainly to provide for the popular election of senators the express discretion and authority delegated to the state legislatures to allow the governor of the state to make temporary appointments to fill senate vacancies can not be disregarded62 in the enactment history of the seventeenth amendment there is express indication that state is required to hold more immediate special election to fill vacancy created by the death or other ineligibility of the majority candidate in general election as opposed to using the alternative method of allowing temporary appointment by the governor until later election is held as directed by the state legislature in fact in the earliest formulations of the vacancy language used in what became the seventeenth amendment the drafter was cognizant of the expense of statewide elections and expressly intended to allow the state to be spared the expense of having to hold another statewide special election soon after or before regular statewide election63httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31338crs17 63continued hardship on the state which recently had or soon will have state

is also express indication in the enactment history that the amendment contrary to its express language was intended to limit or restrict the authority or power of state legislature over the details of the procedures of elections in their respective states to fill vacancies the enactment history of the seventeenth amendment in the united states congress shows serious debate and division concerning states rights with one of the major contentions in the debate being over provision adopted in one house which went so far as to remove entirely congress residual authority over the times places and manners of federal elections in the states under article i section 4 clause 1 of the constitution64 the author of the substitute amendment eventually adopted by congress senator bristow noted explicitly that the direct election provisions were not intended to add new powers of control to the federal government at the expense of the authority of the state legislatures over such elections65 the constitutional provision adopted expressly provides as to vacancies in fact that after temporary appointment the people of the state will fill the vacancy by election as the legislature may direct this is direct grant in the united states constitution of authority and discretion to the state legislatures66 limited only by the requirement that the governors appointment be temporary and there is indication of silent or implicit agenda to limit that authority or discretion when vacancies arise from the death of candidate or otherwise at the beginning of the term federal courts looking at the issue of whether the seventeenth amendment requires state to hold special election to fill senate vacancy have concluded that the constitution delegated to the state legislatures significant discretion and authority as to the mechani cs and procedures of how and when vacancies in the senate from their respective states are to be filled in valenti v rockefeller federal court in case expressly affirmed by the united states supreme court found that there is nothing in the seventeenth amendment nor its history that requires the state to hold special election to fill vacancy rather than to have temporary gubernatorial appointment even if such appointment extends because of the states statutory nominating procedures more than two years and thus beyond the next immediate statewide election67 the court noted there that the preseventeenth amendment history as well as the amendments enactment history provides support for plaintiffs contention that special elections are

confers upon the state legislatures discretion concerning the timing of vacancy elections if the legislature authorizes the governor to make temporary appointment the appointee may hold office until the people fill the vacancy by election as the legislature may direct we believe that we must give effect to the natural reading of the seventeenth amendment as adopted since there is indication that the congress which proposed the amendment or the state legislatures which ratified it intended different meaning this natural reading grants to the states some reasonable discretion concerning both the timing of vacancy elections and the procedures to be used in selecting candidates for such elections this interpretation gains support from art i 4 of the constitution which gives to the state legislatures the initial power to prescribe the times places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives if the drafters of the seventeenth amendment had intended to bring about radical departure from this normal rule of state discretion in the instance of the timing and manner of holding vacancy elections such as by requiring special elections it is likely that they would have employed clear language to that effect 69 the court found that the seventeenth amendment did place some limit on the discretion of the states by requiring that the governors appointment be temporary until an election is held70 the majority of the court did not however attempt to set an outer limit to that time in the case of the new york statutory provisions in effect and reviewed in valenti v rockefeller the temporary appointment by governor rockefeller after the death of senator robert kennedy worked out to 29 months71 in similar manner in trinsey v commonwealth of pennsylvania 72 the united states court of appeals found that the discretion granted to the state legislatures in the seventeenth amendment to establish the details of the procedures and timing of vacancy elections for the senate was so broad and significant that even though the seventeenth amendment itself required popular general elections for the senate the commonwealth of pennsylvania was within its authority under the vacancy clause to provide by statute that nominations for special election to fill senate vacancy may be made without popular primary election the court noted that the legislative history of the seventeenth amendment indicated that the congress was resistant to any change that would decrease the power and authority of the states and enlarge that of the federal government and that the explicit provision in the vacancy paragraphhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31338crs19 73id at 234of the seventeenth amendment vesting discretion in the state legislatures itself could
