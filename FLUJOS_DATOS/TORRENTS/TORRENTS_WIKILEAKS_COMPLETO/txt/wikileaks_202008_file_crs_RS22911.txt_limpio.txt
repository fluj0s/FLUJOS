employees may be exempt from federal income tax under section 127 and section 132 of the internal revenue code section 127 is the employer educational assistance exclusion section 132 the fringe benefit exclusion for working condition benefits eg jobrelated education among other benefits congress established the two tax provisions well before it enacted other higher education tax benefits meant to assist taxpayers their spouses and dependents regardless of employment status pay current educational expenses incurred while obtaining postsecondary degrees and undertaking lifelong learning recent focus of congress has been to add provisions to the internal revenue code irc to help families cope with the rapidly escalating expenses of students pursuing college degrees for example the lifetime learning credit llc and the hope scholarship credit were authorized permanently in the taxpayer relief act of 19971 either credit may be claimed for the tuition and related fees of eligible taxpayers their spouses and dependents who are in their first two years of postsecondary education at eligible institutions and enrolled at least halftime in program that grants recognized credential2 the llc also is available to eligible persons taking one or more courses at the undergraduate or graduate level to acquire or improve job skills this added feature of the llc allows it to be claimed

taxpayers meet current higher education expenses see crs report rl31129 higher education tax credits and deduction an overview of the benefits and their relationship to traditional student aid by linda levine and charmaine mercer 2 eligible educational institutions participate in student aid programs authorized under title iv of the higher education act which include most colleges and universities as well as many proprietary forprofit trade schools crs2 to for example enter new occupation or keep uptodate the skills required to maintain their current positions3 the tax benefits intended to help families pay higher education expenses at the time they are incurred joined longstanding provisions in the irc whose eligible population is defined by its employment relationship employer educational assistance was initiated in the revenue act of 1979 and the working condition fringe benefit in the deficit reduction act of 1984 according to the most recent data available 49 of employees in the private sector had access to workrelated educational assistance as part of the fringe benefit package offered by their firms many fewer workers 15 had access to nonworkrelated instruction in march 2007 employees in management professional and related occupations in fulltime jobs who belong to labor unions with average earnings of at least 15 per hour and work at large firms 100 or more employees are the most likely to have educational assistance benefits made available to them by their firms4 employers who offer their employees educational assistance can deduct its cost as httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22911 business expense in determining the firms income tax liability empirical research suggests that employers gain from sponsoring employee education and training because it increases employee retention5 economists theorize that there is less investment in human capital than is optimal for society because the benefits of education extend beyond those who choose to undertake and pay for it eg better health leading to lower medicare costs thus society also gains from employerprovided education to the extent it increases the educational attainment of the population and thereby compensates for the underinvestment in human capital6 any fringe benefits ie nonwage compensation such as employer expenditures on health insurance firms offer are taxable to employees unless by law the benefits are specifically excluded from gross income7 employerprovided educational assistance generally is included as part of taxable wages on the w2 statements employers send to employees each january except in the instances discussed below8 3 the deduction for higher education expenses also may be applied toward the tuition and fees associated with lifelong learning the deduction was authorized temporarily in the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 it most recently expired on january 1 2008 4 us bureau of labor statistics national

additional information on the taxation of fringe benefits see us department of the treasury internal revenue service employers tax guide to fringe benefits publication 15b 8 this report does not cover tuition reduction available through section 117 of the irc because educational organizations can offer the benefit to more than current and former employees eg dependent children and spouses of employees scholarships which also may be taxfree under continued crs3 the employer educational assistance exclusion congress authorized an exclusion from wages of up to 5250 annually at section 127 of the irc for employer payment or reimbursement of job and nonjobrelated educational expenses including tuition and fees books supplies and equipment incurred by employees under firms qualified educational assistance program and employer provision of job and nonjobrelated courses of instruction for employees including the cost of books supplies and equipment under such program the 5250 limit has been in place since 1986 for employees of multiple employers with qualified educational assistance programs the 5250 limit applies to the value of the benefit received from all employers the educational assistance exclusion was authorized at up to 5000 annually for five httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22911 years as part of the revenue act of 1978 pl 95600 effective to december 31 1983 before 1979 employers could exclude from employee taxable income only jobrelated educational assistance under another provision of the irc discussed in the next section the jobrelated requirement has been narrowly construed eg training to maintain or improve skills so employees retain their current jobs consequently the educational opportunities of employees in lower level positions have been limited compared to employees in higher level positions that typically have relatively broad job descriptions section 127 was intended in part to remedy this perceived inequity the jobrelated requirement also means that firms must make determinations about whether each course taken by employees is very closely linked to their current positions determinations with which the internal revenue service irs later might disagree section 127 thus simplified the tax code by enabling the exclusion from wages of expenses employees incur for virtually all education whether jobrelated or not9 the temporary employer educational assistance provision has been extended often retroactive to its expiration on numerous occasions10 most recently the economic 8 continued section 117 of the irc are not discussed as well because firms may establish grants for persons who lack an employment relationship with them eg persons who reside in the community in which business is located 9 however educational assistance does exclude payment for or provision of tools or supplies that employees may retain after the course is completed as well as meals lodging or transportation it also excludes reimbursement for courses involving sports games or hobbies unless related to the employers business or the courses are required as part of degree program 10 the education assistance programs pl 98611 reauthorized section 127 from january 1 1984 to december 31 1985 the tax reform act of 1986 pl 99514 further extended the provision from january 1 1986 to december 31 1987 while also raising the excludable maximum next the technical and miscellaneous revenue act of 1988 pl 100647 reauthorized the exclusion from january 1 1988 to december 31 1988 and longer covered continued crs4 growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra pl 10716 reauthorized the exclusion through december 30 2010 egtrra also reinstated temporarily the exclusion for graduate school expenses which last was eliminated in 1996 for the section 127 exclusion to apply the employer must have qualified educational assistance program this is defined as separate written plan that provides assistance exclusively to employees not their spouses or dependents at the employers option employees may be defined to include persons who have retired left on disability or been laidoff those on leave such as in the armed forces partner who performs services for partnership and firms owner if it is sole proprietorship the program must have restrictions against favoring highly compensated employees11 it also cannot provide more than 5 of payments to shareholders or owners and cannot offer employees choice between taxable income and the education benefit the firm must provide reasonable notice of the program to employees as well the educational assistance exclusion must be coordinated with other credits and deductions in other words employees cannot use the same educational expenses reimbursed through section 127 program as the basis for claiming other tax benefits httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22911 but for example employees whose employers have excluded 5250 in educational expenses from their wages may be able to claim the lifetime learning credit for any remaining tuition and fees up to the credits cap of 10000 per income tax return the joint committee on taxation estimates that the revenue loss attributable to the employer education assistance exclusion may be approximately 08 billion annually in fy2007 and fy2008 09 billion annually in fy2009 and fy2010 and 02 billion in fy201112 10 continued formerly eligible graduate course work the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1989 pl 101239 subsequently extended section 127 from january 1 1989 to september 30 1990 the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 pl 101508 then reauthorized the provision from october 1 1990 to december 31 1991 and again made graduate courses eligible the tax extension act of 1991 pl 102227 next extended the exclusion from january 1 1992 to june 30 1992 while the omnibus reconciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 reauthorized it from its july 1 1992 expiration date to december 31 1994 the small business job protection act of 1996 pl 104188 subsequently reauthorized the exclusion from january 1 1995 to may 31 1997 and once again made graduate courses ineligible after june 30 1996 the taxpayer relief act of 1997 pl 10534 then extended the provision to may 31 2000 the ticket to work and work incentives improvement act of 1999 pl 106170 to december 31 2001 the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 pl 10716 most recently extended and amended the tax provision as discussed in the above text 11 the nondiscrimination requirement may cause the programs to be expensive if utilized by many employees employers are permitted to impose course completion or grade requirements however similarly they may require employees to remain on the payroll for some period after course completion these allowable program features may limit its cost in addition employers are not required to fund existing educational assistance programs that effectively allows the companies to stop offering the benefit if they are in financial straits 12 joint committee on taxation estimates of federal tax expenditures for fiscal years 2007 2011 jcs307 2007 crs5 jobrelated education working condition fringe benefit if employers do not have qualified educational assistance program or if they surpass section 127s limit of 5250 employers still may exclude educational assistance from an employees wages if the education or training qualifies as working condition fringe benefit section 132 of the irc allows certain fringe benefits to be exempt from an employees taxable income eg qualified employee discounts moving expense reimbursement working condition benefits13 working condition benefits are products or services employers provide to employees that employees could deduct as business expense section 162 or depreciation expense section 167 on their individual tax returns had they paid for it14 the irs test for determining whether educational assistance is deductible business expense essentially require courses to be jobrelated the test consists of four questions displayed on the chart below as shown in the bottom portion of the chart education only is deductible business expense if it is required by employers or by law for employees to retain their current jobs or salaries or if the education maintains or improves the skills required for employees to perform their current jobs httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22911 the employer may pay an employees educational expenses directly to school or indirectly through employee reimbursement reimbursement must be through an accountable plan which requires employees to substantiate their business expenses to the employer and return any amounts that exceed substantiated expenses within reasonable 13 congress amended the tax code to exclude certain fringe benefits from the taxable income of employees in the deficit reduction act of 1984 pl 98369 14 examples of working condition benefits other than jobrelated education are outplacement services for terminated employees and use of demonstrator cars by auto sales personnel crs6 period of time whether paid directly or indirectly the educational assistance will be excluded from the earnings of employees on their w2 statements and the employees cannot apply these same expenses toward other credits or deductions on their individual income tax returns unlike the section 127 exclusion the working condition fringe benefit generally does not require employers to have separate written plan which means the benefit is exempt from plans nondiscrimination rules that restrict whom firms may assist under section 132 then company could for example offer the benefit to employees it wants to single out for special treatment or move quickly up the corporate ladder since the lack of written plan also means there are reporting requirements theres need to spread the word to other employees15 courses may be taken at the undergraduate and graduate levels under both section 127 and section 13216 the two provisions allow deductions for tuition and related fees books supplies tools and equipment but section 132 also allows the deduction to apply httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22911 to meals lodging and transportation expenses if the employee travels from home to obtain the education unlike the 5250 limit on educational assistance under section 127 the value of the working condition fringe benefit is not capped both sections of the irc may be offered to employees but not their spouses or dependents the definition of employee differs however current employees employees who have retired left on disability or been laidoff partner who performs services for partnership and firms owner if it is sole proprietorship may be eligible under section 127 current employees partner who performs services for partnership director of company and an independent contractor who performs services for firm may be eligible under section 132 the jobrelated educational expenses of employees that are reimbursed under nonaccountable plan are included in their gross income nonetheless employees may be able to deduct them on their own income tax returns as business expense under section 162 those employees who itemize deductions on schedule form 1040 may deduct educational assistance from taxable income provided the education meets the irs test depicted in the chart above and the educational assistance plus other miscellaneous deductions exceed 2 of adjusted gross income17 thus taxpayers who do not exceed the 2 floor may be unable to offset any or all of the tax on nonexcludable educational assistance and taxpayers who do not itemize deductions do not have this opportunity available to them 15 edmund d fenton jr employerprovided education
