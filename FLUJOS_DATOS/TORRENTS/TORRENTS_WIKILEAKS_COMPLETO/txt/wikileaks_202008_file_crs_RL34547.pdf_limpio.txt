significant changes in federal legislation as well as number of other assumptions to reach these estimates the following was assumed 1 congress authorizes oil and gas production from anwr 2 commercial quantitie s of oil will be found currently an unknown 3 the current revenue division of 90 to alaska and 10 to the fede ral government will be modified by congress to allow 5050 split of royalties 4

state waters are available for leasing5 federal revenues would cons ist primarily of corporat income taxes on profits earned by oil producers from the production and sale of anwr oil as landowner the federal government would also coll ect royalties from such production on federal lands which are included in the estimate s revenues from bonus bids from federal leases and rents on undeveloped leases however are not timated separately although congressional budget office cbo estimates of bonus bids are reported in addition the federal g overnment would collect in come tax revenues from the secondary feedback effects as result of the stimulus to general economic activity however these revenues are not included here due to the difficulty in estimation over an assumed 30year production horizon note that all estimate s of future revenues are not discounted to real 2008 dollars due to l ack of available data such discounting would result in much smaller revenue estimates6 estimates of technologically recoverable oil used in this report include the resources from the federal lands and assume the availability of resources in native lands in the refuge and offshore state lands however such availability is not within federal control the estima tes are based on 1999 usgs study of the quantity ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34547crs3 7 at very high oil prices this is likely to be the case

would take many years at least 10 years according to some estimates to build such pipeline to bring the gas to markettechnically recoverable oil and they assume that all technically recoverable oil is also economically recoverable7 the revenue projections below are very longterm forecasts of what might happen and not what will happen gi ven the methodology and the posited assumptions all of the data used in this estimation are provided by the us energy information administration eia as documen ted in the footnotes in particular the oil produc tion data draws from may 2000 eia report based on the resource assessment estimated by the us ge ological survey usgs in 19988 note also that according to the eia and the usgs it would take between 7 and 12 years after congressional approval to commence production if feasible from the anwr area further production from the area is ssumed to last at least 30 years9 also other major uncertainties in add ition to the production feasability starting date and the lands that mig ht be developed include 1 the size of the underlying reserve base 2 the underlying field structure 3 the co sts of development 4 the market price of oil 5 the average effective tax rate and 6 the terms of the authorizing legislation thus revenue projections are hi ghly uncertain projections of federal revenue represen t totals over the entire rec overy period until oil resources are longer recoverable thus they do not take into account any increased or decreased recovery based on changed ec onomic conditions or the annual flow of production finally the projections below exclude potentially large revenues from the development of natural gas which according to probab ility analysis may exist in large quantities in the anwr coastal pl ain particularly the 1002 federal area10 revenue projections from natural gas velopment are excluded because there is currently way to transport the gas to market pipeline or other means of transportation11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34547crs4 12 see us congress cong ressional budget office an analysis of the presidents budgetary proposals for fiscal year 2009 march 2008 p 15 under the

summarizes the results of our estimation procedure which is described in the remaining sections of this report it shows projected increase in corporate income tax revenues and cumulative estimated royalties projected over the estimated life of the anwr and other nearby proper ties from the production and sale of the estimated technically recoverable reserves of oil tables 2 and 3 show the corporate tax revenues and royalties separately table 1 presents 15 projections undiscount ed for the time value of money each corresponding to an oil price and produc tion scenario for instance if producers were able to recover 103 billi on barrels of oil over the life of the area there is an estimated 5050 chance that the anwr coasta l plain contains at least this amount of oil and if oil prices average 90ba rrel over the production lifetime of the area then the federal government is projecte d to collect nearly 138 billion in revenues over the production period estimated to be at least 30 years once production commences this would consist of nearly 95 billion in federal corporate income taxes table 2 and nearly 43 billion in federal royalties table 3 tables 2 and 3 are each presented below in the sections on the estimation procedure for corporate income taxes and royalties these estimates assume that all of the oil that is technically recoverable is also economically recoverable which is not necessarily the case the amount of economically recove rable oil depends on unknown variables such as market oil prices and oil finding and transport costs with regard to oil prices the higher the price the more the am ount of economically recoverable reserves approaches the magnitude of t echnically recoverable reserves the development of the anwr coastal plain would also generate federal revenues in the form of bonus bids from th leases on federal nds and income tax revenues from secondary feedback nd multiplier effects from an expanding economy bonus bids have been estimated by the congressional budget office for president bushs fy2009 budget proposal to lease the anwr coastal plain according to these estimates bonus bids could total 6 billion between fy2011 and fy201812 the additional federal income tax revenues both indi vidual and business from the secondary economic effects are more difficult to estimate because they would depend on the annual expenditures generated by oil development the geographic dispersion of those expenditures and the state of the general economy at the time neither bonus bids nor income tax revenues from secondary effects are included in table 1 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34547crs5 table 1 possible cumulative corporate income tax revenue and royalties from anwr coastal plain oil billions of estimated technically

ibidof the possible oil and natural gas liquids14 are estimated to be under federal lands and onefourth under native corporation lands and the adjacent offshore state lands15 estimates of technically recoverable oil are those quantities producible using current recovery practices but without regard to economic viability the 1999 usgs study and the may 2000 eia study were conduc ted when oil prices were much lower than today as oil prices rise the fraction of technically recoverable oil that is also economically recoverable rises at todays record oil pr ices most of the technically recoverable oil is likely also economically recoverable alt hough precise estimate is not available16 for each recoverable oil quantity and price combination scenario federal corporate income tax revenue was estimated by 1 multiplying the quantity times the price 2 subtracting production costs ope rating costs plus preciation depletion amortization and administra tion and 3 multiplying the result by the average effective federal corporate tax rate currently applicable to major us energy producers production costs projections of production co sts were based upon annual fi nancial data on oil and gas industry operations published by the eia in its performance profiles reports covering the major usbased energy producing companies17 an elevenyear average for 19952005 was used to remove the volatility of profits over business cycles and fluctuations in volatile market oil prices to reflect the longterm nature of oil development in the anwr coastal plain which if successful would be expected to produce oil for at least 30 years based upon the performance profiles data production costs of dom estic oil and gas producers averaged 69 of revenues over the 19952005 period and cons equently net pre tax profits for those companies averaged 31 of revenue18 that percentage was used to project net pretax profits from anwr output over the life of the wells the production cost percentage was based upon cost data for all domestic us operations rather than just for alaska which are not available the costs reflect the consolidated operations of largely majorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34547crs8 19 the may 2008 eia report provides some data indicating that production costs above the arctic circle are much higher than producti on costs elsewhere it estimates the costs of drilling the average deep well with the costs of drilling deep well in alaskas north slope see eias analysis of crude oil production in the arctic national wildlife refuge op cit p 7 20 the effective tax rates were based upon both nonvertically integrated companies and vertically integrated companies the eia data are not disaggregated 21 frontier areas op cit 22 the manner is which royalties are split between other states and the federal government differs for all states except alaska direct royalties under the mineral leasing act mla are divided equally 5050 between the stat in which the deposits are located and the federal government the mla also provides that all states except alaska also get back 40 from the reclamation fund established by the reclamation act of 1902 in effect giving each state 90 of the royalties and the federal government 10 alaska does not receive allocations from the reclamation fund so to equalize royalty treatment among the states the alaska statehood act and the federal land policy and management act provide that alaskas royalty share is 90 of the direct royalties rather than 50integrated producers rather than ju st production operations exploration and production costs above the arctic circle are far higher than in the lower 48 states but these are the only available data19 it was not possible to analyze factors that may increase production costs but some may be important time of year limitations need for ice roads the movement of equi pment across permafrost and so forth the effective federal corporate income tax rate also was estimated using eias performance profiles based upon data in those reports the average effective tax rate for the years 19982005 was 33 this wa s derived by subtracting from the us federal tax any foreign tax credit which would not be claimed on income from anwr operations and dividing by us pretax income20 this effective tax rate probably is an upper bound and the actual effective tax rate over the production horizon might end up being lower due to s ubstantial industry investments in anwr oil and gas development also the estimation of the effective tax rate assumes that current tax legislation rema ins unchanged any future am endments to current tax laws could of course either lower or raise effective tax rates federal royalties landowners typically collect royalties on minerals extracted from their lands by mineral operators and producer s likewise the federal g overnment earns royalties from production of oil and ga s on federal lands generally 125 of the oil and gas value the federal lands in anwr have been estimated by the usgs to contain 74 of the estimated technically recoverable reserves the remaining 26 of estimated total recoverable oil resides in stat and alaska native corporation lands21 the alaska statehood act allocates 90 of the royalties from oil and gas production on federal lands to alaska the federal governme nt retains the remaining 1022 however our revenue projections assume 5050 split of all royalties whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34547crs9 23 for more information see crs report rl33523 arctic national wildlife refuge anwr controversies for the 109th congress by m lynne corn bernard gelb and pamela baldwinis consistent with most current legislation23 many but not all bills that would approve development of anwr provide for 5050 division of the royalties some bills eg hr 39 in the 109th congress have been sile nt on revenue distribution thus the current 9010 split would retained obviously 9010 division of the

of the anwr federal leases assuming 5050 split with the state the same amount of re venues are projected to accrue to the state of alaska there would also be income to the state of alaska regardless of whether economically recoverable il is found this is because even if commercially recoverable oil were found the state of aska would likely share in the bonus bids and rents over the short term 510
