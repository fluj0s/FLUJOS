to communicate effectively with the local populace in the area of operations ao the use of interpreters is often the best or only option but must be considered less than satisfactory substitute for direct communication the proper use and supervision of interpreters can play decisive role in mission accomplishment impact this publication discusses terminology categories of interpreters and extensive planning considerations so that the end users have the appropriate interpreter support needed to aid in successful mission accomplishment this handbook contains lessons learned from operation iraqi freedom oif operation enduring freedom oef bright star operation joint forge bosnia and operation joint guard kosovo this information is divided into two sections section i is an overview of interpreter operations and section ii covers the employment of interpreters summary interpreter requirements must be identified early in the planning stages so interpreters can be acquired

at all levels of military operations for official use only viinterpreter operations handbooksection i overview 1 background most us military operations are conducted on foreign soil and service members typically lack the ability to communicate effectively with the local populace within the area of operations ao the use of interpreters and translators is often the best or only option but must be considered less than satisfactory substitute for direct communication therefore the proper use and supervision of interpreters and translators can play decisive role in the mission 2 definitions

need b military linguists linguists are members of the dod formally trained in language military linguists capabilities range from basic understanding of the language to fluency in that language military linguists are tested and receive rating from zero proficiency to five proficiency equal to that of an educated native speaker in reading listening and speaking skills not all receive speaking evaluations the defense language proficiency test dlpt rates reading and listening skills up to level three the dod standard is level two in listening and reading the majority of military linguists are american citizens whose familiarity with local dialects is limited c unofficial unofficial interpreters are personnel within dod who are serving in some other capacity and are heritage or native speakers of language such personnel have generally obtained their language skills from their family heritage and culture such personnel often work in other specialties and may not have proficiency in specific local dialects 6 responsibilities executive agent ea in accordance with the multiservice regulation ar 350 20opnavinst 15507bafr 5040mco 15504d the secretary of the army is the executive

foreign language program for more information concerning the delegated responsibilities of the ea see the multiservice regulation b joint task force jtf the jtf is responsible for 1 identifying requirements early 2 identifying languages and numbers 3 consolidating requirements and critiques for overlap 4 identifying the best methods to support requirements and notifying operations centers how to acquire resources when needed c unituser the following are examples of unit responsibilities when dealing with contractorprovided interpreters over an extended period note actual unit responsibilities will be determined when the contract is established 1 remember that the interpreters work for the contractor and are not employees of the government services are provided within the scope of work defined in the performance work statements pws and contractcenter for army lessons learned 4for official use only2 in accordance with federal acquisition regulations far 37104 units will not directly counsel or provide interpreters with any type of evaluation questions or comments regarding service or conduct are sent to the servicing cor 3 units will direct interpreters to their area supervisors for problem resolution units will not attempt to solve an interpreters problems if an interpreter reports an illegal or unethical act or situation that will negatively impact the us or its missions the unit will report the situation to the cor immediately 4 units will provide for the interpreters safety and security interpreters will not carry weapons or operate government vehicles and equipment 5 units generally will provide all required supplies and equipment for interpretation services including notebooks and pens computers and officework space 6 units are encouraged to welcome new interpreters by providing brief description of their responsibilities as well as unit and base camp policies 7 units are encouraged to provide nuclear biological and chemical nbc and force protection training as most interpreters have little to prior military experience 7 planning considerations research units planning to conduct overseas operations should research the language dialects and ethnic and cultural aspects of the local populace in order to better identify their interpreter requirements clearly identified requirements will facilitate getting the needed interpreter support b order timeline ordering timelines vary by contract specifications as general rule cat i interpreters should be available within seven days because of security access and clearance requirements cat ii and iii interpreters may take from 4590 days to begin contractual performance c determine users the first step in determining interpreter requirements is conducted during the mission analysis process determine prime users and mission requirements prime users include the commander and staff military intelligence military policesecurity forces civil affairs base operationssecurity special operations unit patrols and medical personnel in diverse society where multiple languages exist requesting interpreters with multilanguage capabilities may be more feasible d computer support these requirements apply primarily to units requiring translator support and include the following 1 fonts different alphabets require that appropriate fonts be loaded on unit computers in order to produce written documents and products 2 keyboard adapters these are guides indicating which keys represent which font when using different alphabets 3 programs some foreign language programs exist for translation and interpreter training purposes detailed search of the internet will identify what for official use only 5interpreter operations handbookis available in addition the defense language institute dli may have such material available 4 electronic translator equipment in past operations electronic translation devices have been tested for use at checkpoints and at other locations requiring limited interpretation this equipment is of value only for translating standard basic phrases these devices are not substitute for an interpreter simply looking up words and phrases without understanding the true meaning could prove harmful to units mission technical vocabulary requirements specific terms for specific tasks are necessary for proper understanding as rule interpreters are not subject matter experts in particular field specialized terminology jargon and acronyms should be explained in basic terms whenever possible some of the areas requiring specialized vocabulary in both english and the target language are the following 1 technical terms 2 medical terms 3 military terms 4 contractual terms 5 construction terms f cultural and religious considerations when supplying interpreters units should be aware of cultural and religious differences and local populace sensitivities to certain nationalitiesethnicities g behavior certain behavior patterns of us andor western nations may be offensive to other cultures units can more effectively use their interpreters and translators if they identify and avoid any potential offensive behaviors h command and control c2 1 interpreters hired by the unit without contractor involvement interpreters should be assigned based upon the demand and needs for their use b many units assign the task of overseeing interpreters and translators to the intelligence section sgj2 of military unit as they are often operational assets employed with operational forces interpreters can also be controlled at the unit operations sgj3 level c one technique to more effectively use interpreters is to maintain them in standing pool controlled at the unit headquarters level this technique works best when there are limited numbers of interpreters and multiple requests for their use the unit headquarters can then prioritize their use as needed center for army lessons learned 6for official use onlyd if sufficient numbers of interpreters are available they can be assigned to subordinate organizations one technique to assist units in managing pool of interpreters and translators is to identify one of them cat ii or cat iii only as coordinator units should carefully evaluate all the interpreters and translators before making such decision to ensure that ethnic personal cultural and other factors will not create problems with such decision such coordinators are administrative in nature and assist unit leaders in managing the daily work of the interpreters such positions are not meant to include pay or hiringfiring authority within the group 2 contractorprovided interpreterstranslators units should be provided contractor poc within the region for contractorprovided interpreters and translators the poc can assist in resolving issues concerning interpreter performance behavior security issues pay and removal procedures if necessary these personnel do not govern the actual daytoday use of the interpreters and translators however the contractor supervisor should be very involved in the daytoday use of interpreters the contractor provides management team to manage the contractorprovided interpreters i logistics units need to plan for workspace dining facilities and living areas for interpreters j opsec issues 1 interpreters are primary security risk 2 once briefed isolate the interpreter until the mission is complete 3 interpreter should remain with the service member 4 interpreter should communicate only in english 5 interpreter should not engage in conversation with other locals 6 interpreter should not have access to phone or email 7 cat i and cat ii interpreters should have separate living quarters k administration work all issues concerning contracted services with the cor contractor personnel are controlled by their terms of employment contract and their contractor chain of command unless war is formally declared contractors are not governed by the uniform code of military justice ucmj and may fall under host nation laws and procedures 8 obtaining interpreter support overview the worldwide linguist support contract wwlsc is administered by the department of the army daily management by the armys intelligence command inscom this contract is designed to support all interpretertranslator needs for combatant commanders requirements are validated by the user and funded in advance once funded an order is written and the contractor delivers for official use only 7interpreter operations handbookb service units requiring long term interpreter support should request such support well in advance of deployment one technique to speed the arrival of interpreters is to identify interpreter requirements in the joint manning document jmd at the beginning of the planning cycle requesting units should identify the following information as early as possible to facilitate the request 1 unit poc and phone number 2 location where the support will be required 3 specific number of interpreters per language including dialect if known and category required see section i for category description 4 begin date and end date use indefinite indef if end date cannot reasonably be determined 5 duty description simultaneous interpreter appropriate for high level formal staff meetings and conferences b consecutive interpreter takes at least twice as much time has more potential for missed communication appropriate in the field in informal settings and during interrogations 6 justification state the impact of interpreters on unit operations 7 requesting unit commander 8 contracting officer representative if known or established c pooled resources in many cases the contractor maintains pools of interpreters within the aor some specialized units and larger headquarters also have pools of interpreters units requiring shortterm under 30 days use of interpreters may contact the units or the contractor via their cor to obtain support d battlefield acquisition in the initial stages of conflict commanders may have to conduct immediate local hires to obtain interpreter support commanders should plan accordingly for such circumstances by identifying fieldordering officer or appropriate service equivalent with sufficient funds use the following guidelines 1 as soon as possible have linguistically proficient service member or dod civilian question the individual to discover any potential problems 2 ensure that unit members understand that such individuals have not been screened and may have other motives 3 keep locally hired and unscreened interpreters away from weapons sensitive areas and classified information you may not be sure whom this person truly is working for 4 assign armed escorts to such interpreters to protect him from reprisals and protect your service memberscenter for army lessons learned 8for official use only5 insist that interpreters ask for clarification if they are unsure of the communication in some cultures it is embarrassing to admit lack of knowledge andor understanding 6 never allow interpreters to operate on their own for official use only 9interpreter operations handbooksection ii interpreter employment note the techniques presented here deal primarily with contract andor civilian interpreters 1 role of the interpreter interpreters are not mediators or negotiators unless they have been specifically trained and selected for such tasks the role of the interpreter is to pass and receive information in contextually correct manner in designated language due to the nature of their work interpreters are often in volatile situations and in position to become mediators between us forces and members of the local populace 2 selection and hiring general very good interpreters have the ability to speak well and to express themselves clearly in the target language typically professional interpreters translate only into their specific language b evaluation technique to use when hiring new interpreter is to have proven interpreter assist in the evaluation oral evaluations with previously developed solutions should be provided to the new interpreter to assist in evaluating hisher skills in the target language such evaluations should also test the interpreters english language skills evaluation results should not be given directly to the interpreter evaluations should be used to identify the interpreters capabilities and may be provided to the cor for contract evaluation purposes c requirements the following criteria can help in determining if an interpreter is good fit for the requirements 1 native speaker interpreters should be native speakers of the socially or geographically determined dialect their speech background and mannerisms should be completely acceptable to the target audience so that attention is given to the way they talk only to what they say 2 social status in some situations and cultures interpreters may be limited in their effectiveness with target audience if their social standing is considerably lower than that of the audience this may include significant differences in position or membership in an ethnic or religious group local prejudices should be accepted as fact of life 3 english fluency consider how well the interpreter speaks english as rule if the interpreter understands the service member and the service member understands the interpreter then the interpreters command of english is satisfactory the service member can check comprehension by asking the interpreter to paraphrase in english something the service member says the service member should then restate the interpreters comments to ensure that they both agree on the content of the communication the interpreter must be able to convey the information expressed by the interviewee or target audience for official use only 11interpreter operations handbook4 mental agility the interpreter should be quick alert and responsive to changing conditions and situations he must be able to grasp complex concepts and discuss them without confusion in reasonably logical sequence 5 technical ability in certain situations the service member may need an interpreter with technical training or experience in special subject areas background knowledge in very technical or specialized subjects is necessary b the interpreter must have knowledge of the general subject of the speeches that are to be interpreted general ideas and facts and intimate familiarity with both cultures c the interpreter should possess an extensive vocabulary and the ability to express thoughts clearly and concisely in both languages d the interpreter should demonstrate excellent notetaking techniques for consecutive interpreting many professional interpreters develop symbols that work for them these symbols allow the interpreter to take down the thoughts not just the words of the speaker in languageindependent form this technique is less bound to the language and helps improve the interpreters output note depending on the mission some interpreter notes may be sensitive or even classified cat iii interpreters have ts clearances and proper procedures need to be observed 6 reliability beware of the potential interpreter who arrives late for the interview throughout the world the concept of time varies widely in many countries time is relatively unimportant the service member should make sure that the interpreter understands the militarys preoccupation with punctuality 7 loyalty if the interpreter is local national it is safe to assume that his first loyalty is to the host nation hn or subgroup and not to the us military the security implications are clear the service member must use caution when explaining concepts to interpreters additionally some interpreters for political or personal reasons may have ulterior motives or hidden agenda when they apply for the interpreting job if the service member detects or suspects such motives he should tell his commander intelligence section or security manager 8 age interpreters should be adults d characteristics the service member should be aware of and monitor the following interpreter characteristics 1 gender and race gender and race have the potential to seriously affect the mission for example in predominantly muslim countries cultural prohibitions may make female interpreter ineffective under certain circumstances additionally ethnic divisions may limit the effectiveness of an interpreter from outside the target audiences group since traditions values and biases vary from country to country it is important to be aware of specific taboos or cultural normscenter for army lessons learned 12for official use only2 compatibility the service member and the interpreter will work as team the target audience will be quick to recognize personality conflicts between the service member and the interpreter which can undermine the effectiveness of the communication effort if possible when selecting an interpreter the service member should look for compatible traits and strive for harmonious working relationship 3 confidence good interpreters act with selfconfidence in adverse or hostile situations experience if an interpreter has worked in position for long time new user should consider the following 1 does the interpreter have rapport with the other parties this can benefit or hinder the process evaluate and make adjustments as necessary 2 the interpreter may be well known and trusted by both parties if so try to limit disturbances that may move them to other areas 3 if the user feels the interpreter is too familiar with the locals it may help to bring in another interpreter for while in order to reestablish and regain control of the situation if needed 3 orientation and training orientation early in the relationship with interpreters the service members should ensure that interpreters are briefed on their duties and responsibilities the service members should ensure that the interpreters understand the nature of their duties the standards of conduct expected the interview techniques used and any other requirements necessary the orientation may include the following 1 current tactical situation 2 background information obtained on the source interviewee or target audience 3 specific objectives for the interview meeting or interrogation 4 method of interpretation to be used simultaneous or consecutive in simultaneous interpreting the interpreter listens and translates at the same time b in consecutive interpreting the interpreter listens to an entire phrase sentence or paragraph then translates during natural pauses 5 conduct of the interview lesson or interrogation 6 need for interpreters to avoid injecting their own personality ideas or questions into the interview 7 need for interpreter to inform interviewer service member of inconsistencies in language used by interviewee for example does the interviewee claim to be for official use only 13interpreter operations handbookcollege professor yet speak like an uneducated person during interrogations or interviews this information will be used as part of the assessment of the information obtained from the individual 8 physical arrangements of the site if applicable 9 possible need for the interpreter to assist in after action reports aars or assessments b training as part of the initial training with the interpreter the service member should tactfully convey that the instructor interviewer or interrogator service member must always direct the interview or lesson the service member should put the interpreters role in proper perspective and stress the interpreters importance as vital communication link between the service member and the target audience the service member should appeal to the interpreters professional pride by clearly describing how the quality and quantity of the information sent and received is directly dependent on the interpreters skills also the service member should mention how the interpreter functions solely as conduit between the service member and the subject 1 the service member must be aware that some interpreters because of cultural differences may attempt to save face by purposely concealing their lack of understanding they may attempt to translate what they think the service member said or meant without asking for clarification or vice versa because this can result in misinformation and confusion and impact on credibility the service member should let the interpreter know that when in doubt he should always ask for clarification the service member should create safe environment for clarification as early in the relationship as possible 2 consultchat with your interpreter ahead of time so that heshe can gain familiarity with your accent b rate of speech c vocabulary d sentence structure c additional issues the user should address the following additional issues when orienting and training the interpreter 1 importance of the training interview or interrogation 2 specific objectives of the training interview or interrogation if any 3 outline of lesson or interview questions if applicable 4 background information on the interviewee or target audience 5 the additional time required to brief train or interview when using an interpreter to convey the information interpreter may be helpful in scheduling sufficient timecenter for army lessons learned 14for official use only6 any technical terminology the interpreters may be asked to translate interpreter may need time to look up unfamiliar words or ask questions to clarify meaning 7 handout material if applicable 8 general background information on the subject 9 glossary of terms if applicable 4 establishing rapport establish rapport with the interpreter heshe should understand you and the terms you use while user needs to limit colloquialisms if you have rapport with the interpreter these colloquialisms can be identified early and explained or eliminated b the interpreter is vital link to the target audience without cooperative supportive interpreter the mission can be in serious jeopardy mutual respect and understanding is essential to effective teamwork the service member must establish rapport early in the relationship and maintain it throughout the joint effort c the service member begins the process of establishing rapport before he meets the interpreter for the first time most foreigners are reasonably knowledgeable about the united states the user should obtain some basic facts about the hn useful information may include population geography ethnic groups political system prominent political figures monetary system business agriculture and exports good general outline can be obtained from recent almanac or encyclopedia more detailed information is available in the country handbook for the country and current newspapers and magazines such as new york times washington post newsweek and us news and world report note country handbooks fieldready reference publications are for official use only and can be obtained through the us department of defense intelligence production program the marine corps intelligence activity is the community coordinator for the country handbook program d the service member should find out about the interpreters background the user should show genuine concern for the interpreters family aspirations career education and so on many cultures emphasize the family over career so the service member should start with understanding the interpreters home life the service member should also research cultural traditions to find out more about the interpreter and the nation in which the service member will be working though the service member should gain as much information on culture as possible before entering an hn his interpreter can be valuable source to fill gaps showing interest is also good way to build rapport gain the interpreters trust and confidence before embarking on sensitive issues such as religion likes dislikes and prejudices approach these areas carefully and tactfully deeply held personal beliefs may be very revealing and useful in the interpreters orientation training and professional relationship gently and tactfully draw these beliefs out of your interpreter f just as establishing rapport with the interpreter is vitally important establishing rapport with interview subjects or the target audience is equally important to establish critical rapport the subjects or audiences should be treated as mature important human beings that are capable and worthy of respect for official use only 15interpreter operations handbook5 meetinginterview preparation understanding to be successful interpreters must understand the subject matter of the text or speech they are translating interpreters change words into meaning and then change meaning back into words of different language interpreters must fully understand thought before they can translate or interpret that thought into another language b site selection the service member selects an appropriate site for the interview and directs the physical setup of the area when conducting interviews with vips or individuals from different cultures the physical arrangement can be significant c rehearsals as in all operations rehearsals are excellent tools to wargame how meeting may proceed and allow the interpreter and service member to better anticipate and prepare for changes and new items in the meeting d signals the service member and interpreter should develop series of signals to indicate speech breaks nodding hand gestures eye contact or the verbal ok to indicate pause for the interpreter to begin speaking other considerations 1 interpreters should mirror the tone and personality of the user 2 interpreters should not interject their own questions or personality 3 interpreters should inform the user if they notice any inconsistencies or peculiarities from sources 4 periodically check with your interpreter to ensure that he or she understands concepts b is communicating effectively with your counterpart c is not experiencing difficulties of personal nature with your counterpart 5 prior to the meeting insist that the interpreter speak in the first person b remain in close proximity when you are speaking c carry notepad and take notes as needed d ask questions when not clear of term concept or acronym project clearly and mirror both your vocal stresses and overall tonecenter for army lessons learned 16for official use onlyf refrain from becoming engaged in tangent dialogue with your audience and refrain from becoming an advocate or mediator in the dialogue ideally the interpreter should remain invisible 6 the meeting controlling the environment 1 security the service member should ensure that adequate security measures have been taken prior to the meeting 2 escapes meeting away from military compound should be in locations with multiple exits from the building so that service members are not trapped without an escape route b positioning the interpreter the interpreter should be physically positioned in subordinate location in close proximity to the service member for example have the interpreter sit alongside and just behind the service member if standing the interpreter should be alongside and one step behind the service member the service member should always be in position to maintain eye contact and address the target audience c roles in multiple interpreter situations 1 during formal discussions when both parties employ interpreters ensure that the interpreters agree ahead of time on the division of responsibilities generally your interpreter will translate your counterparts ideas into your native language your counterparts interpreter will interpret your ideas into hisher native language if your interpreter detects an error by their counterpart he or she needs to notify you so that you may clarify 2 in multinational events communication may be translated into third or even fourth language in addition some interpreters may be using their third or fourth language as result communications time increases and transmission reliability decreases pay particular attention to the delegation or audience members who are the most challenged by the interpretation effort certain delegations or groups may rely on single interpreter for several or even many listeners other delegations may not use interpreters because some or all of the delegation are fluent to some degree in the briefing language d executing the meeting 1 whether conducting an interview or presenting lesson the service member should avoid simultaneous translations that is both the service member and the interpreter talking at the same time the service member should speak for minute or less in neutral relaxed manner directly to the individual or audience the interpreter should watch the service member carefully and during the translation mimic the service members body language as well as interpret his verbal meaning the service member should observe the interpreter closely to detect any inconsistencies between the interpreters and hisher own manners the service member should provide the interpreter sufficient time to interpret completely and accurately the service member should present one thought in its entirety and allow the interpreter to interpret it for official use only 17interpreter operations handbook2 although the interpreter will be doing some editing as function of the interpreting process it is imperative that he communicate the exact meaning without additions or deletions as previously mentioned the service member should insist that the interpreter always ask for clarification prior to interpreting whenever heshe is not absolutely certain of the service members meaning however the service member should be aware that good interpreter especially if he is local can be invaluable in translating subtleties and hidden meanings 3 during an interview or lesson if questions are asked the interpreter should immediately relay them to the service member for an answer the interpreter should never attempt to answer question even though he may know the correct answer additionally neither the service member nor interpreter should correct the other in front of an interviewee or class all differences should be settled away from the subject or audience 4 an important first step for service members in communicating in foreign language is to polish their english language skills this is true even if attempt is made to learn the indigenous language the clearer the service member speaks in english the easier it is for the interpreter to translate other factors to consider include use of profanity slang and colloquialisms in many cases such expressions cannot be translated even those that can be translated do not always retain the desired meaning military jargon and terms such as gee whiz or golly are hard to translate in addition if technical term or expression must be used the service member must be sure the interpreter conveys the proper meaning in the target language the service member should speak in low context simple sentences and add words usually left off such as the air in airplane this ensures the meaning will be obvious and he is not talking about the great plains or wood plane 5 when the service member is speaking he must think about what he wants to say he should break the communication down into logical bits and give it out small piece at time using short simple words and low context sentences that can be translated quickly and easily as rule of thumb the service member should never say more in one sentence than he can easily repeat word for word immediately after saying it each sentence should contain complete thought without excess verbiage 7 number of interpreters if several qualified interpreters are available the service member should select at least two this practice is of particular importance if the interpreter will be used during long conferences or courses of instruction b the exhausting nature of this job makes approximately four hours of active interpreting in six to eight hour period the maximum for peak efficiency an interpreter is usually only effective for 3045 minutes at time c two or more interpreters can switch off about every 1520 minutes while one translates the other can provide quality control and assistance additionally this technique can be useful when conducting coordination or negotiation meetings one interpreter is used in an active role and the other pays attention to the body language and the side conversations of the others present many times the service member will gain important side information that assists in negotiations from listening to what others are saying among themselves outside of the main discussioncenter for army lessons learned 18for official use onlyd tired interpreters are less effective program ten minute breaks every hour or so for the interpreters to rest regroup look up vocabulary and consult with primaries on content toward the end of long day or long discussion the interpreters efficiency and therefore your ability to communicate decreases f interpreters generally work the hardest during meals because they are limited resource in social setting where many voices want to be heard to mitigate the pressure on the interpreter do the following 1 carefully plan seating to strategically place available interpreter assets 2 actively ensure that the interpreters get chance to eat their meal they probably will not unless you make it happen 8 behaviors understanding target population is the first step to effective communication the following factors affect our ability to communicate with the target audience 1 perception the internal representation of sensory input from seeing smelling hearing tasting or touching such that we produce an internal representation of the outside world 2 motivation those physiological cognitive or emotional factors arising from biology temperament or learning which drive behavior 3 attitude consistent learned emotional predisposition to respond in particular way to given object person or situation 4 prejudices an unfavorable opinion or feeling formed beforehand without knowledge thought or reason prejudice is behavior that is learned indirectly rather than directly from objects of prejudice b is highly emotional as opposed to rational c is rigid and unlikely to listen to differing perspectives d is typically negative tends to dehumanize mistreat or discriminate against objects of prejudice may follow from institutionalcultural opinions and actions especially where conformity to group norms are highly valued b understanding the cultural aspects of communication is the second step in understanding the target audience to thoroughly understand the culture 1 study the culture and history 2 observe all aspects of the culture if possible for official use only 19interpreter operations handbook3 accept the culture 4 respect cultural differences 5 whenever possible identify any cultural restrictions before interviewing instructing or conferring with particular foreign nationals c nonverbal communication is an important aspect of the communication process users and interpreters must pay attention to the following nonverbal factors 1 communication setting 2 physical appearance 3 dress 4 personal space level of intimacy b emotional state c type of interaction confrontational cooperative competitive friendly or territoriality 5 vocal cues 6 eye contact and eye movements 7 gestures and posture 8 touching 9 facial expressions d colloquialisms humor acronyms and jargon 1 colloquialisms tend to confuse and waste valuable time 2 be cautious of using american humor cultural and language differences can lead to misinterpretations by foreigners determine early on what the interpreter finds easiest to understand and translate meaningfully 3 avoid using acronyms if possible address any acronyms being used with your interpreter prior to any meetings 4 jargon is language used only by specific group or occupation and should be cleared with the interpreter before the communication event the service member should 1 position the interpreter by his side or even step back this method will keep the subject or audience from shifting their attention or fixating on the interpreter and not on the service membercenter for army lessons learned 20for official use only2 always look at and talk directly to the subject or audience guard against the tendency to talk to the interpreter 3 speak slowly and clearly repeat as often as necessary 4 speak to the individual or group as if they understand english the service member should be enthusiastic and employ the gestures movements voice intonations and inflections that would normally be used before an englishspeaking group considerable nonverbal meaning can be conveyed through voice and body movements the service member should encourage the interpreter to mimic his delivery 5 periodically check the interpreters accuracy consistency and clarity 6 check with the audience whenever misunderstandings are suspected and clarify immediately using the interpreter the service member should ask questions to elicit answers that will verify that the point is clear if the point is not clear he should rephrase the instruction and illustrate the point again the service member should use repetition and examples whenever necessary to facilitate learning if the class asks few questions it may mean the instruction is over the heads of the audience or the message is not clear to the audience 7 speak to your counterpart and not to the interpreter good interpreter interprets in the first person for example i think as opposed to he thinks or he says if your interpreter does not do this make the correction likewise good principal does not say tell him or ask him always address your counterpart directly as if there is interpreter 8 make the interpreter feel like valuable member of the team give the interpreter recognition commensurate with the importance of his contribution 9 keep the entire presentation as simple as possible use short sentences and simple words low context b avoid idiomatic english c avoid tendency toward flowery language d avoid slang and colloquial expressions assume that less than 100 of your message will get across likewise never assume that you completely understand the other half of the conversation directed at you matter how good the interpreter less than 100 is to be expected your ability to communicate will depend on the proficiency of the interpreter f the service member should not 1 address the subject or audience in the third person through the interpreter for example the service member should say im glad to be your instructor not tell them im glad to be their instructor for official use only 21interpreter operations handbook2 make side comments to the interpreter that are not expected to be translated 3 be distraction while the interpreter is translating and the subject or audience is listening for example the service member should not pace the floor write on the blackboard teeter on the lectern drink beverages or carry on any other distracting activity 9 post meeting actions verify information 1 confirm with your interpreter that what you heard was what was meant was the question stated correctly observing the other persons body language in response to questions often indicates whether they understand your meaning 2 identify disagreements 3 identify misunderstandings and prepare way to resolve those misunderstandings at the next meeting b provide feedback c prepare for the next meeting while the information is fresh d review your post meeting notes prior to your next meeting and discuss any problems with your interpreter again 10 other considerations gender gender can have major impact on the interpreters effectiveness based on the cultural norms of the area in some societies and cultures women are held in lower esteem than men female interpreters may become partially or completely ineffective in cases where male members of the local area refuse to speak to them directly in other societies female interpreters may be seen as less of threat than their male counterparts and may increase the dialogue between the local residents and the military unit units should research the area of operations during predeployment training identify culturalsocietal norms and plan accordingly when determining their interpreter requirements b ethnicity ethnicity also plays major role in identifying unit interpreter requirements just as with gender cultural differences between members of various ethnic groups may significantly reduce interpreter effectiveness and may cause outright hostility between the local populace and military units in the area ethnic differences may also be reflected in language dialects and alphabets used in certain areas again units should research the area well during predeployment training and identify what ethnicities and applicable culturalsocietal norms are present in their area and plan accordingly when determining their interpreter requirements c wear of uniforms units using interpreters and translators should assess the advantages and disadvantages of having their interpreters wear us military uniforms in many operations cat i ii and iii interpreters and translators wore us military uniforms while their nonus counterparts remained in civilian clothes some of the potential advantages and disadvantages are as followscenter for army lessons learned 22for official use only1 advantages builds sense of identity with the military unit they support b interpreter force protection increases c military forces able to rapidly identify interpreters as friendlies 2 disadvantages may lower local populace receptiveness to interpreter b interpreters less able to blend into local area c may incite overt hostility towards interpreters d time off just as with service members morale and retention depend heavily on operations tempo units are asked to remember that interpreters often work in the aor for years so quality of life is very important to maintain low turnover therefore it is recommended that interpreters be given at least one day off per six work days use the following guidelines 1 interpreters scheduled for on call or standby days will work in the base camps interpreter pool to support local taskings but remain available to support the interpreters primary unit of assignment if needed oncall days will not count as days off 2 if an interpreter does not report for work when scheduled the unit will immediately contact the area supervisor and report the incident to the cor as soon as possible 3 days off will be scheduled in advance and submitted to the contractor area supervisor changes to the schedule must be precoordinated with the area supervisor the contractor may preempt interpreters days off at anytime without consulting the unit in order to support other missions that may come up 4 the cor will perform periodic checks to ensure interpreters are working according to schedule leave upon completion of their initial sixmonth contract the contractor can authorize leave for their interpreters the contractor will coordinate with units to ensure minimum impact to mission when scheduling leave for the interpreters units should not expect to receive replacement while interpreter is on leave general guidelines include the following 1 upon completion of six months of service cat i interpreters can be authorized seven consecutive days off 2 upon completion of six months of service cat iiiii interpreters can be authorized 14 consecutive days off interpreters traveling from downrange to for official use only 23interpreter operations handbookcontinental united states conus are authorized an additional two days travel time f mission differences do not assume the interpreter understands the varying missions of different military units be sure to explain those differences to him prior to an operation 11 overseeing interpreters unsatisfactory interpreter practices include the following 1 not interpreting everything that is said 2 carrying on side conversation during meeting or interview 3 speaking on behalf of the person being met with or interviewed 4 answering the phone or other distracting behavior during meeting or interview 5 demonstrating demeaning behavior or attitude toward the person being met with or interviewed unless directed to do so by the unit 6 paraphrasing b some indicators of operational security opsec problems with interpreters include the following 1 interpreter compromises sensitive or operational information 2 operations known to the interpreter fail 3 attacks occur when the interpreter is absent 4 interpreter tries to dissuade source from providing certain information 5 interpreter volunteers or avoids certain duties or sources 6 sources trust particular interpreter less than others 7 normally reliable sources provide unreliable information with particular interpreter present 12 alternate sources military linguists are specifically trained and should not be used in place of nativespeaking interpreters unless there are other options available the same can be said of other military members that have familiarity or background in specific language heritage speakers when these individuals are used as interpreters they are loss to their organization causing another shortfall if as last resort and in an emergency you must use military linguist consider the followingcenter for army lessons learned 24for official use only1 they need sufficient preparation time to familiarize themselves with technical terms colloquialisms and dialect 2 they should not be expected to perform to the level of an interpreter 3 they lack proper training and thus may not know when they are overstepping their bounds as an interpreter 4 interpreting is difficult work the service member will be under significant stress to perform in an unfamiliar settingenvironment b each of the services has individuals trained in languages many of these individuals are within the intelligence units some may also be found within the special operations community such as civil affairs ca and psychological operations psyop many special operations forces sof routinely employ
