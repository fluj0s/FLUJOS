divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33477disaster debris removal after hurricane katrina status and associated issues summary hurricane katrina produced unprecedented destruction resulting in disaster debris from vegetation and manmade structures before katrina the event that left behind the greatest recorded amount of disa sterrelated debris in the united states was hurricane andrew in 1992 which ge nerated 43 million cubic yards cy of debris in floridas metro dade county when the molition of damaged property in the new orleans metropolitan area is complete hurricane katrina will have generated more than 100 million cy of disaster debris before the gulf coast region can rebuild particularly in the new orleans area much debris generated by the storm must be removed and pr operly managed ie landfilled recycled or burned the types of debris generated include vegetation eg trees limbs shrubs municipal so lid waste eg common household garbage and personal belongings c onstruction and demolition bris in some instances entire residential structures and all their c ontents vehicles eg cars trucks and boats food waste white goods eg refri gerators freezers ai r conditioners and household hazardous waste eg cleaning ag ents pesticides pool chemicals each type of waste may contain or be contaminated with certain toxic or hazardous constituents in the short term removal of debris is necessary to facilitate the recovery of the region in the long term the methods in which these wastes are to be managed require proper cons ideration to ensure that their management eg landfilling would not pose future threat to human health or the environment this report provides the background and information necessary to understand why cleanup activities are still incomplete nd additional funding of debris removal activities may be needed for some time to come as well as factors that make debris removal costly complex and lengthy operation the debris removal process may involve several activities such as wa ste separa tion hauling ndfill disposal burning and recycling to illustrate these points this report provides an overview of the types and amounts of debris generated the govern mental agency requirements and responsibilities regarding the debris removal process and the complicating factors unique to hurricane katrina such factors include the slow pace of residents to return to hardhit areas of new orlean s the difficulty in separating hazardous debris from nonhazardous debr is and issues associated with demolishing private structures and structures that may cont ain asbestos another issue of concern involves sending constructi on and demolition cd debris to landfills located in communities affected by the storm this could become an issue of concern to congress if agencies participating in the cleanup become liable under provisions of the comprehensive envir onmental response compensation and liability act cercla also known as superfund this could be possible because the definition of cd debris was expanded after the st orm to include potentially contaminated material debris removal operations associated with the hurricane are essentially complete in alabama and mississippi therefore this report focuses primarily on issues associated with continuing debris removal activities in louisianahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33477contents introduction 1 background 2 amount and types of debris 2 g v r n m n t l r l s i n d b r i s r m v l 5 funding debris removal activities 6 s t t d b r i

crs report rl33141 hurricane katrina socialde mographic characteristics of impacted areas by thomas gabe gene falk maggie mccarty and virginia w mason see the section hurricane katrina estimates of population affected in impacted areasdisaster debris removal after hurricane katrina status and associated issues introduction many factors have influenced the time it has taken and the cost associated with the recovery and reconstruction of the gulf coast region destroyed by hurricane katrina one significant factor has been the time it has taken to remove vegetative debris and manma structures damaged or destroyed by the storm management of debris is concern after any major disaster destruction in the wake of hurricane katrina and compounded soon after by the effects of hurricane rita created disasterrelated debris greater than any am ount previously recorded in the united states the volume of waste generated is unique because of the large area over which the storm caused damage and the nature and scope of the damage regions of alabama mississippi and loui siana covering 90000 square miles were declared major disa ster by the president althoug h debris was generated over the entire disaster area the most significant property damage was concentrated within 100mile radius of where the storm made ndfall on the gulf coast within this area damage due to high winds flooding from high rain fall and storm surge resulted in significant deva station in the new orlean s metropolitan area flooding largely resulting from breached levees and flood walls left much of the area under water1 this report discusses issues associated with debris remova l operations after disaster on the scale of katrina in par ticular it discusses why debris removal is an ongoing concern more than two years after the hurricane and why it is likely to be concern for some time to come as well as factors that make debris removal such costly complex operation to illustrate these points this report provides an overview of the types and amounts of debris generated the governmental agency requirements and responsib ilities regarding the debris removal process and complicating factors unique to hurricane katrina there are two primary areas of interest for congress with rega rd to debris removal th first involves the continued need if cleanup is to continue for fundi ng to support debris removal operations particularly as the demolition of private structures continues in new orleans the second involves the future potential for federa l state and local agencies to become liable under the comprehensive envir onmental response compensation andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33477crs2 2 cercla is the principal federal statute ddressing the cleanup of hazardous substances that pose threats to public health welfare and the environment under cercla in general waste generators transporters who select the disposal site and disposal facility owners and operators are liable for response co sts and for damage to natural resources 3 under wrda congress generally authorizes new corps water resources studies and projectsliability act of 1980 cercla2 popularly known as superfund as result of their current disposal practices see factors complicating debris removal below congressional concern regarding debris removal activities is evident the water resources development act of 2007 wrda pl 1101143 under 4101 debris removal of the bill the comptroller general of the united states in coordination with the secretary of the us army corps of engineers the corps and the administrator of the environmental protection agency epa and in consultation with affected communities sh all evaluate both fe deral and nonfederal demolition debris removal segregation transportati on and disposal practices relating to disaster areas designated in response to hurricanes katrina and rita including regulated and nonregulated materials nd debris among other provisions that evaluation is to include review of compliance with applicable environmental laws and administrative actions relating to debris removal and disposal in the disaster areas debris removal operations associated with the hurricane in alabama are essentially complete in mississippi bris removal operations are nearing completion therefore this report focuse s primarily on issues associated with continuing debris removal activities in louisiana background hurricane katrina made landfall on the gulf coast on august 29 2005 it left in its wake destruction unprecedented in the united states damage done to the region was from two different but related sources the hurricane itself resulting in flooding from storm surge and rainfall and damage from high winds from the hurricane itself and from tornadoes spawned by the storm and the flooding of the new orleans metropolitan area from breaches in several levees storm surge and related coastal flooding dest royed vegetation and manma structures along the coast of alabama mississippi and louisian in louisiana up to 80 of new orleans and large areas of plaquemines nd st bernard parishes were flooded to depths of almost 20 feet in the hardes thit areas some of those flooded areas remained submerged for weeks two year s after the storm significant amounts of debris remain amount and types of debris the scope of katrinas dest ruction is unique due in pa rt to the vast geographic area over which it caused damage before katrina the disaster that generated the greatest recorded amount of debris in the united states was hurricane andrew inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33477crs3 4 by comparison the disaster debris generate d after the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks on new york city was approximately 14 million tons 28 million cy1992 that storm created debris over 500square mile area and generated 43 million cubic yards cy of debris in floridas metrodade county4 by comparison hurricane katrina created disaster debris across 90000squaremile disaster area to date disaster debris totals are estimated at 34 million cy in alabama 458 million cy in mississippi and 643 million cy in louisiana this total includes debris from hurricane rita hurricane katrina is also unique because of the type of waste generated generally disaster debris includes waste materials created as the result of man made or natural disaster such as an ear thquake flood hurricane or terrorist attack debris created from flooding is often qu ite different from debris created from an earthquake or storm disa ster debris from hurricane ka trina involves two types of waste waste generated immediately during and after the storm eg from high winds and flooding related to rainfall and coastal storm surge and extensive flooding related to the levee failure in new orlean s resulting in deep flood waters that left some areas submerged for weeks the primary types of disaster debris being removed in the wake of hurricane katrina fall into the following categories municipal solid waste genera l household trash and personal belongings construction and demolition cd debris building materialswhich may include asbestoscontaini ng materials drywall lumber carpet furniture ma ttresses plumbing vegetative debris trees br anches shrubs and logs household hazardous waste oil pesticides paints cleaning agents white goods refrigerators freezers washers dryers stoves water heaters dishwashers air conditioners electronic waste computers levisions printers stereos dvd players telephones the unique nature of debr is generated as result of the new orleans flooding is illustrated in table 1 which lists specific types of waste identified by the louisiana department of environmental quality ldeq epa and the corps that have been generated in louisiana for more detail regarding the types of disaster debris being removed in the wake of hu rricane katrina and some of the issues or concerns associated with its

350000 car s and 60000 vessels eg fishing and pleasure boats were damaged or destroyed and abandoned5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33477crs5 6 this report provides information necessary to understand individual agency roles specific to the debris removal and management process for more information on provisions of the stafford act and the national re sponse plan see crs report rl33053 federal stafford act disaster assistance presidential clarations eligible activities and funding 7 the stafford act and implementing regulations use the term debris removal in broad sense to encompass the entire process of removing handling recycling and disposing of debris 44 cfr 206224 similarly in this report the term debris removal is used broadly where necessary actions such as disposal or recycling will be referred to specifically 8 in accordance with provisions of the nrp all presidentially declared disasters and emergencies under the stafford act are consid ered incidents of national significance see section ii planning assumptions and c onsideration of the nrp available at httpwwwdhsgovdhspublicintera ppeditorialeditorial_0566xml governmental roles in debris removal much of the federal agency response to debris removal after hurricane katrina has been in accordance with provisions of the robert t stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act the staffo rd act 42 usc 51215206 and the national response plan6 the stafford act authorizes the president to issue major disaster or emergency declaration in response to catastrophes that overwhelm state and local governments after hurricane katrina the president declared major disaster in certain areas of alabama mississippi and louisiana this declaration authorized all federal agencies as necessa ry to provide assistance to respond to the disaster including the demolition of uns afe structures which endanger the public 5170b and debris re moval activities 51737 the national response plan nrp wa s developed by th department of homeland security dhs to structure th way responders work together and to provide supporting mechanisms for disaster s so serious that the secretary of dhs declares them to be incidents of national significance8 the nrp applies to situations where the resources of state and local authorities are overwhelmed and have requested federal assistance various federal statutory authorities and policies provide the basis for federal actions and activities in the context of domestic incident management under the nrp the nrp does not confer new authorities upon the secretary of dhs or any other federal official rather the nrp establishes the coordinating structures pro cesses and protocols require d to integrate the specific statutory and policy authorities of various federal departments and agencies as with the stafford act the president has design ated dhs as the implementing agency for the nrp under the nrp dhs identifies nd groups the capabilities of federal departments and agencies into 15 emerge ncy support functions esfs to provide the planning support resources progra m implementation and emergency services that are most likely to be needed

potential debris remova l activities that may be required of all federa l state or local agencies under all federal state or local laws or regulations funding debris removal activities congress appropriates money for activities authorized by the stafford act to the disaster relief fund drf the stafford act authorizes debris removal by federal agencies from publicly owned properties eg roads and pub lic buildings the most commonly used method for state and local governments to acquire assistance for debris removal is through the fema pub lic assistance pa program fema can either reimburse local governments for the cost of debris removal or the local government can request direct federal ssistance from fema which then tasks the corps to complete the debris removal process the 109th and 110th congress enacted six emergency supplemental appropriations bills pl 10961 pl 10962 pl 109148 pl 109234 pl 110 28 and pl 110116 that ppropriated more than 123 billion to fund emergency assistance activities see crs report rl33226 emergency supplemental appropriations legislation for disaster assistance summary data fy1989 to fy2007 by keith bea and justin murray it is difficult to determine how much of those funds have been or will be used for debris removal operations however as of november 11 2006 fema determined that federal funding obligated for debris removal in alabama mississippi

disaster debr is that will be handled unde r the specified emergency conditions and the existing laws that apply to the handling and disposal of different types of waste ie hazardous waste nonhazardous waste asbestoscontaining materials the plans also specify requirements regarding the selection of debris storage and staging sites and waste ndling methods eg chippinggrinding burning or landfilling for certain types of waste the debris management plans provide an outline of existing applicable law they also include changes to existing law or regulatory requirements as specified in emergency declarations issued by the respective departments of environmental quality deq17 both states emergency decl arations among other provisions specify existing and emergency requirements applicable to the management of solid waste hazardous waste and asbestoscont aining materials they also expand existing law or regulatory requirements to accommodate debris management issues unique to hurricane katrina for example the louisiana deq emergency declaration expanded the definition of cd waste to allow for the disposal of certain demolition wastes that would not otherwise be allowed in cd landfill see the factors complicating debris rem oval section below18 louisiana deq issued the second extension to its 12th amended emergency declara tion on january 28 2008 provisions of that declaration expire d on or about february 28 2008 on april 14 2006 the mississippi deq mdeq issued revision to its emergency authorizations for the management of building and structural debris and vegetative debris in that revision mdeq declared that emergency need for additional storage and staging sites in re sponse to storm management of katrina wastes longer exists for most counties and cities mdeq further directed local governments to begin preparing to close their storage and staging sites and begin transporting the remaining wastes directly to authorized disposal siteshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33477crs9 19 states are required to regulate the management of solid and hazardous waste in accordance with provisions of the resource conservation and recovery act rcra solid waste is defined broadly under the law as any garbage refuse and other discarded material 42 usc 6903 haza rdous waste subset of solid waste is defined as solid waste that is either specifically listed in the regulations 40 cfr 2613126133 or meets specific criteria that make it toxic ignita ble ie burns readily corrosive or reactive eg explosive 40 cfr 2613concerns associated with debris removal activities debris removal after disaster presents challenges unique to that disaster often the debris removal pro cess takes months or even years to finish the slow pace of debris removal par ticularly in flooded regions of the new orleans area has drawn attention from area stakeholders as well as some members of congress the type and breadth of destruction associated with hurricane katrina has resulted in various factors that complicate and hen ce prolong debris rem oval operations some of the prominent issues are discussed below difficulty separating waste and the slow return of residents after most disasters landfill space is usually limited so communities try to divert as much waste from landfill disposal as possible through such means as reuse and recycling burning and composting for example vegetative debris can be chipped composted or burne d metals can be recycled cd waste can be partially recycled household hazardous wastes can be separated and dispos ed of in specially designed landfills or incinerated and refrigeratorsfreezers are emptied of spoiled foods and reused or recycled the separation of waste is also necessary to comply with existing federal and state laws regarding waste management19 for example those requirements specify criteria under which solid hazardous cd and asbestoscontaining wastes must be managed each category of disaster debris is required to be managed in way that will limit the threat that such waste may pose to humans or the environment to ensure that disaster debris is managed appropriately the corps is segregating and managing disaster debris as follows white goods collected separately drained of freon and recycled metals collected and recycled vegetative debris collected and often ground for reuse or burned when mixed or contaminat ed with other wastes burning is not an option electronic wastes collected separately and recycled to the degreepossible household hazardous waste collect ed separately and disposed of in specially designed landfills cd waste with asbestoscontaini ng material acm separated and disposed into asbestospermitted landfills tires collected and recycledhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33477crs10 20 for more information about the individual type s of waste and issues associated with their removal see table a1 in the appendix below 21 these population estimates are based on active residential postal deliveries as determined by the greater new orleans community data center the most recent data were released by the center on january 15 2008 and are av ailable online at h ttp wwwgnocdcorg 22 bruce eggler the timespicayune officials raise stink over trash slow pickup is crisis councilwoman says may 4 2006although the corps requested that resi dents separate wast much of the disaster debris from flooded regions of the new orleans area was mixed to the point that separation is either very difficult or essentially impossible20 removing debris from each private property is timeconsuming nd laborintensive crew must first segregate the waste then waste that can be removed using equipment eg front loader is loaded into trucks remaining waste must be removed by hand by right ofentry crew ie crew that has received permission from the property owner to enter the site for most disasters residents evacuate an area for the duration of the event and return soon after able to participate in the waste removal proce ss after katrina the destruction was so great that returning to many communities was impossible this was the case particularly in the flooded areas of orleans and st bernard parishes more than two years after the storm it is estimated that the population in those parishes has reached approximately 70 orleans and 41 st bernard of prekatrina levels21 in addition to facilitating more efficient pickup by placing waste curbside returning residents may expedite the remova l process by separatin g the various types of waste themselves for example they may empty refrigerators of spoiled food which may also eliminate the need to dispose of refrigerators or freezers separate household hazardous waste before it leaks or otherwise contaminates other debris remove rainsoaked debris before it becomes moldy or contaminated with other waste deal with downed trees branches or other vegetative waste or assist with the demolition of their homes however even in areas where residents have returned the separation of wastes can be problematic returning residents have been reminded not to commingle household garbage such as food waste with demolition debris such as shingles according to waste management inc the company that has contracted to remove household garbage as opposed to corpsmanage d debris in certain areas of the city this has been problem in some areas resulting in waste piles that they are not allowed to remove22 the slow return of residents is evident in the high number of trips that debris removal operators have had to make through some communities according to the corps after disaster it typically takes bris collectors two to three passes through neighborhood before the disast er debris is removed after hurricane katrina more than 20 passes were made in some neighborhoods and bris collection was still not completehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33477crs11 23 louisiana code title 33 part vii 115 24 the landfill specified in the emergency declaration are gentilly river birch highway 90 and tidewater cd waste issues as stated previously rcra governs the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes municipal solid waste landfills that co llect household garbage are predominantly regulated by state and local governments epa has however established minimum criteria that these landfills must meet states are then authorized to implement their own criteria that are at least as stringent as the federal requirements louisiana is authorized to implement its own wast management programs under rcra an element of that program is the authorization to issue permits to construct and operate municipal solid waste landfills under federal law cd wast is classified neither as hazardous waste nor as municipal solid waste therefore cd landfills are not subject to federal design and operational criteria ie c d landfills are not required under federal law to have protective liners that municipal solid waste landfill which is expected to receive certain amount of hazardous waste from households would have the disposal of cd waste as waste category is primarily stateregulated issue louisiana regulations define cd waste as nonhazardous waste generally considered not watersoluble including but not limited to metal concrete brick asphalt roofing materials shingles sheet rock plaster or lumber from construc tion or demolition project but excluding asbestoscontaminated waste white goods furniture trash or treated lumber the admixture of construction and demolition debris with more than five percent by volume of paper associated with such debris or any other type of solid waste excluding woodwaste or yard trash will cause it to be classified as other than constructiondemolition debris23 the ldeq declaration of emergency and administrative order specifies criteria applicable to cd waste disposal nd expands the definition to include furniture carpet and painted or stained lumber contained in the demolished buildings the incidental admixture of construction and demolition debris withasbestos contaminated waste ie incidental asbestoscontaminated debris that cannot be extracted from the demolition debris and yard waste and other vegetative matter under provisions of the most recent emerge ncy declaration this definition of cd waste applies only to waste that can be taken to four specific landfills in the new orleans area24 all other permitted facilities that received cd waste pursuant to previous versions of the emergency declaration were allowed to do so until april 20 2007 thereafter those fac ilities were required to operate in accordance with the definition of cd waste specified in the states solid waste regulations see

debris proposal would be us eless waste of time may 26 2006the use of local landfills to dispose of certain hurricanerelated waste has been continuing concern to various stakeholders in particular issues associated with the use of the gentilly landfill and the chef menteur landfill which was closed on or about august 15 2006 have drawn signifi cant attention there are variety of issues associated with each landfill but one issue common to both is the concern among some stakeholders that cd waste commingled with contaminated waste is being accepted at landfills that are not designed to accept such wastes both the gentilly and chef menteur landfills were authorized by ldeq to accept cd waste in accordance with provisions of the emergency declaration25 the gentilly landfill was issued permit to operate as cd landfill beforehurricane katrina but it did not begin to accept waste until after the storm on february 14 2006 new orleans mayor ray nagin used his emergency authority to suspend provisions of the citys compre hensive zoning ordinance to allow waste management inc to operate the chef menteur landfill 26 among other reasons ldeq cites the need for these landfills

also argues that the waste being sent there will be of relatively benign nature and will pose minimal risk to the environment opponents to the use of the landfills to accept katrinarelated cd debris argue that the proximity to the most heavily damaged areas of the new orleans area is in fact drawback to their location they argue that the sites are close to neighborhoods attempting to recover from the storm also they question how benign the waste truly is for exam ple they argue that under the expanded definition of cd debris the landfills can accept waste that is potentially more harmful also they fear that with thous ands of homes being torn down trash haulers will have difficult time sorting out the zardous debris from th harmless and that material more noxious than that allowe d under

hurricane res ponse for future cleanup of the landfill28 the memorandum discusses among other points the background of the site the permitting process and the onsite process of inspecting and separating wast epa concluded that th ere is way to protect against future superfund liability absolute ly particularly lia bility for landfill however epa recommended that current ope rations take steps to continue good operating practices and to document their activities such as by posting signs clearly identifying categories of acceptable waste distributing leaflets to debris haulers clearly identifying categories of acceptable waste documenting current operating safeguards and publishing written procedures for segregating waste streams prior to loading debris removal trucks so that only nonhazardous materials are loaded into trucks bound for the nonha zardous waste landfill to date similar technical analysis regarding superfund liability has been conducted for the chef menteur landfill ho wever representative of the louisiana field office of the us fish and wildlife service the service submitted comments to the corps presenting the services concerns regarding the operation of the landfill and the types of waste being accepting there29 specifically the service expressed concern that the operation of the chef menteur landfill will pose threat to the adjacent bayou sauvage national wildlife refuge the comments state that the service is primarily concerned about the potential secondary and indirect effects of siting and operating constructiondemolition debris cd landfill at the chef menteur landfill locationgiven the scope and nature of the flooding events and the age of many of the buildings to be demolished and deposited in the proposed landf ill we believe that the delivery of materials containing numerous environmental contaminants such as leadbased paint asbestos creosote arsenicbased wood treatment chemicals various petroleum products and variety of pesticides and hous ehold cleaning ch emicals would be unavoidable placement of such materi als in an unlined landfill particularly within coastal wetlands could potentially result in leaching and

between the plaintiff the louisiana environmental action network lean and ldeq that limits cd shipments to 19000 cy per day at the site30 ldeq cites the settlement agreement limiting debris intake at the gentilly landfill in part for its decision to use the chef menteur site31 the available landfill capacity at the 100 acre chef menteur site is 72 million cy of debris32 it is estimated that the landfill when filled to capacity would result in debris pile 80 feet above surrounding landscape elevations33 in the second lawsuit related to chef nteur the judge rej ected the plaintiffs leans motion for temporary restrainin g order that would have shut down the landfill34 however on july 13 2006 new orl eans mayor ray nagin announced the expiration of his emergency executive or der allowing the operation of the chef menteur landfill effective august 14 200635 waste management inc the company operating the landfill asked federal court to order the site to remain open but the judge refused its request for temporary restraining order waste management subsequently stopped accepting waste at the site on or about august 14 2006 after receiving cease and desist order from the mayors office the company now has the option of going through the permit application process as opposed to operating the site pursuant to an emergency permit issued by the mayor if waste management chooses to do so it is anticipated that the permit request may be denied by the new orleans city c ouncil which is reportedly opposed to the landfill36 it is unknown at this time whether waste

regarding the ch ef menteur landfill involves donation agreement between the city of new orleans and waste management when mayor nagin signed the agreement permitting operation of the chef menteur landfill he also signed notarized agreement with waste management stating that the company would donate 22 of the landfills revenues to the c ity of new orleans on december 15 2006 in response to congressional inquiry fema determined that the donation ag reement was not appropriate37 among other findings fema asserted that the agreements appeared to provide evidence that the landfill operators dona tion of 22 of gross revenue s was contingent on the citys approval to operate the landfill fema notes that it did not require the city to pay for debris removal necessitated by hurri canes katrina and rita however fema found that the city should not profit from those debris removal operations especially when the profit donations app ears to be at the federal governments expense together with the fact that the disposal fees charged by the landfill operator called tipping fees for the chef menteur landfill were significantly higher than other local landfills femas review indicates that the landfill operator passed the cost of the donations to the corps cont ractors fema therefore determined that the donations should be treated as credit and deducted from the citys final claim for other disaster costs effectively to reduce costs for the citys debris removal demolition of private properties dhs estimates that hundreds of t housands of homes were destroyed or sustained major damaged by the stor m and subsequent flooding38 the degree to which cleanup and possibly rebuilding may occur depends on the extent to which and when some of those damaged structures will be demolished and removed neither fema nor the corps can unilaterally decide to demolish homes or remove the debris from private property that determination must be made by the homeowner and involves multistep pr ocess involving property decommissioning and condemnation that pro cess includes inspecting the structure evaluating the presence of hazardous substances and ma terials testing fo r

implications it has been speculated by some that many residents will not choose to allow their homes to be demo lished but may instead opt to repair or rehabilitate their damaged homes another complicating factor is the potential presence of human remains in some of the destroyed homes as result canin search teams must search debris before it is removed also demolition teams must use excavators to remove the homes in layers instead of bulldozing them to prevent any human remains from being lost the number of private structures ultimately demolished will likely have the greatest impact on the time it takes to complete debris removal operations many questions must be answered before the extent of the demolition will be known for example the plan for rebuilding new or leans is still largely unknown that plan may specify areas in which rebuilding will not be allowed or where rebuilding may be required to be elevated asbestos in buildings being demolished the presence of asbestoscont aining materials in damaged residential structures and the need to segregate that material before demolition and disposal will add to the time it takes to demolish individual structures
