divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31237the current economic recession how long how deep and how different from the past summary the 10th recession of the postworld war ii period lasted from march to november of 2001 of these 10 recessions onl two have been long and deep the recession of 19731975 and the recession of 19811982 this report examines the 2001 recession and the recessions of the previous three decades in detail it gives brief overview of the other postwar recessions it outlines the fiscal and monetary policy response to each recession it also l ooks at theories of why recessions occur the report concludes by asking the stion that many commentators in the news asked was the 2001 recession different from the past it finds little evidence that this is the case commentators have claimed that the 2001 recession was different from the past because it was an investmentled rather than consumption led recession while the 2001 recession was i nvestmentled this is true of all the postwar recessions commentators also claimed that the 2001 recession was unique because its runup was not characterized by an accelerating rate of price inflation while this characteristic is different from recessions of the 1970s 1980s and 1990s it is similar to recessions of the 1950s nd 1960s another similarity between the 2001 recession and past recessions that has been somewhat overlooked by commentators is the role of rising oil prices spike in oil prices has preceded nine of the 10 postwar recessions the worldwide nature of the 2001 slowdown was unusual but not unprecedented for most countries the slow down did not develop into contraction however with the exceptions of japan nd germany economic growth in the advanced economies in 2001 av eraged 09 worl d economic growth was also weak in both the 19731975 recession and the 1981 1982 recession there has never been year in the postwar period where world economic growth contracted in response to the 2001 recession the fe deral reserve sharply reduced the federal funds rate there was some eas ing of monetary policy in all postwar recessions although in some cases the eas ing did not begin until the recession was already underway there was also an eas ing of fiscal policy in 2001 with the passage of tax cut and move from large budget surplus to budget deficit there was fiscal expansion in the rece ssions of the 1970s and 1980s but little or fiscal easing in the recessions of the 1940s 1950s 1960s and 19901991 this did not prevent the economy from recove ring quickly in those episodes contrary to the claims of some co mmentators the 2 001 rece ssion cannot be meaningfully compared to the great depression and recessions of the 19th century at that time the economy was characterized by the mainte nance of gold standard and little financial re gulation the federal reserv was not created until 1913 and did not operate discretionary moneta ry policy aimed at promoting economic

2001 the national bur eau of economic research nber the nonpartisan and nonprofit organization that dates the business cycle for the united states decided that the longest ec onomic expansion in us history had come to an end in march of 2001 and the us economy entered recession on july 17 2003 the nber declared that the r ecession had ended in november 2001 the cover of the december 3 2001 issue of the new republic magazine read why this recession is different the cover article captured sentiment expressed by other recent articles in many di fferent publications when it stated so despite the stream of bad economic news economists were confident that greenspans rate cuts would work their magic soon enough if this recession is like every other american recession since world war ii that optimism is fully merited the problem is that there s mounting evidence its not this time around it wasnt change in consumer sp ending that brought the economy to standstill it was largely change in business spending cutting interest rates in the middle of this type of economic slowdown as greenspan did this year wont help much in other words econom ists current faith in monetary policy has lot to do with the kinds of recessions weve seen in the past and little to do with the recession were in now1 if the 2001 recession was dissimilar from ot her postwar recessions to what can it be compared some commentators believed it has more in common with recessions of the 19th century and early 20th century for example the economist magazine paraphrased an argument of goldman sachs economists that greater vigilance from central banks industrial deregulation and ample productive capacity as result of strong investment have all helped to hold down inflation the traditional trigger of recession therefore has not been pulled as result the expansion has endured for longer than usual the snag is that longer periods of expansion llow other sorts of imbalance notably personal and corporate debt and over investment to build up instead eventually overinvestment reduces the re turn on capital and firms decide to cut their spending on capital consumers fe overburdened with debt and increase their saving optimism gives way to pessimism and demand falls sharply in the 19th and early 20th centuries in fact this was the typical businesscycle patternhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31237crs2 2 what peculiar cycle the economist march 10 2001this old fashioned kind of recession may in general tend to be longerlived as well as deeper than the ordinary postwar sort2 the performance of the amer ican economy is important to the government in its ability to accomplish its domestic and foreign objectives high among these objectives is full employment this report will examine the historical record more closely to judge the validity of these argu ments it first examines the 2001 recession then explores economic theories about th causes of recessions and then compares historical recessions to the 2001 episode it concludes that upon careful examination the 2001 recession was not so unusual after all the 2001 contraction from 1994 through mid2000 us economic performance was outstanding the average growth rate of gdp was bout 4 and the unemployment rate was reduced to 39 in september 2000 the lowe st rate in more than 30 years while the inflation rate averaged less than 3 per year over most of the period it began to creep up in 2000 the federal reserve expre ssed growing concern that the us was on an unsustainable growth course and that unless the economy was cooled off the inflation rate would begin to accelerate to this end the target rate for federal funds was increased from 475 in june 1999 to 65 in may 2000 in retrospect this tightening may have been excessive fo r gdp growth promptly slowed from an annual rate of 37 in the first half of 2000 to 08 in the second half with gdp growth virtually 0 in 2001 the unemploym ent rate began to rise reaching 56 in november as shown in table 1 the ec onomy shrank in the first three quarters of 2001 and has been expanding since then the desire to quell an accelerating inflation has been major reason why recent expansions have been brought to an end yet it is hard to find inflation acceleration during the 19912001 expansion it is true th at the consumer price index for the 12 months ended in december 2000 rose 34 which was high for the expansion compared with the 17 increase in 1997 and the 16 increase in 1998 however inflation in both of those years was eased by falling oil prices this is evident when the comparison is made with the cpi purge d of its energy component the rise in this index during 2000 was 26 which while higher than 19971999 was lower than 19941996 indeed the failure of the inflation rate to accelerate noticeably as the economy was operating at more than full cap acity during the last four years of the 19912001 expansion remains largely unexp lained once the recession began the inflation rate fell noticeably as one woul d expect in an economy with insufficient demand it fell from an average of 34 in 2000 to 28 in 2001 to 16 in 2002 if the cpi excluding energy prices is cons idered inflation has b een virtually constant from 2000 to 2002 for inflation data as m easured by the gdp deflator see table 1 besides tighter monetary policy the u s economy was also slowed by another oil price shock in which prices rose from 10barrel in february 1999 to above 30barrel for several months in 2000 prices fluctuated in the 2030barrel rangehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31237crs3 in 20012002 the effect of this shock was less than those of the 1970s both in dollar terms and because the us economy now us much less energy per unit of gdp while consumption expenditures he ld up during the 2001 contraction investment outlays did not similar to the pa ttern in most recessions gross private investment declined by nearly 190 b illion in 1996 dollars in 2001 approximately twothirds of this decline has been acc ounted for by inventory liquidation fixed investment outlays investment excluding inventories fell during and after the recession falling each quarter from 2001 to th third quarter of 2002 perhaps the decline in investment should not be surprising since the 19912001 economic expansion was the first since 1960 to have substantial investment component table 1

of spe nding on homeland security by brian cashellthe initial recovery from the recession wa s unusually tepid in the first seven quarters of the recovery growth exceeded 3 only twice as of july 2003 the labor market had shown sign of sustained recovery3 there were number of factors holding back the recovery after the rece ssion had ended including the corporate and accounting scandals war with iraq persistently high oil prices and the persistent weakness of the stock market longterm interest rates and the exchange rate declined more after than during the recessi on the stock market began to recover in early 2003 historical trends suggest that th is is good sign stock market recoveries have always preceded economic r ecoveries in the postwar period september 11 2001 and the stock market decline what makes economic activity so difficult to forecast is the large role played by emotional factors such as confidence uncertainty and pessimism that can neither be easily quantified nor predicted the 2001 r ecession offers two good example of the importance of such factors the attacks of september 11 and the bursting of the stock market bubble it is difficult to discern the effects of the terrorist attacks on the course taken by the economy these attacks on the us hom eland were unique experience direct physical damage to the us capital stock due to the attacks was small and mostly confined to manhattan and the airlines in any case damage to the existing capital stock is not measured in gdp however the horrific nature of the attacks was widely believed to have undermined pub lic confidence leading the public and businesses to refrain from spending at ra that would have occurred without the attacks consumer confidence indices did show sharp decline following the attacks yet the public responded to sp ecial incentives to purchase automobiles which it generally refrains from buying in downturns leading to record sales month in october 2001 for the automobile indus try november 2001 sales which also benefitted from the incentives were also very strong longer term consequence of the attacks was change in the composition of expenditures larger fraction of expenditures will be directed to making th country more secure hence lasting effect of the terrorist attacks will undoubtedly be to alter the composition of national output4 it is hard to argue that the attacks had considerable effect on the economy independent of the recession already in motion when the attacks took place gdp contracted in the first three quarters of 2001 since september 11 occurred near the end of the third quarter its impact on th at quarter was minimal one would have expected its main effects to materialize in the fourth quarter yet gdp began growing again in that quarter and has grown ever since similarly it is difficult to determine what sort of effect the stock market decline had on the investment climate fall in stock prices in sec ondary mark ets has nohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31237crs5 5 economists generally define full employment relative to an unemployment rate many estimates of this full employment rate of unemployment clustered about 5 an unemployment rate of 39 reached in september 2000 implied that the economy was characterized by excess demand full employment can also be considered in terms of sustainable rate of growth by this standard the growth rates of gdp during the third quarter of 1999 83 and the second quarter of 2001 57 were clearly unsustainable even if technological innovations had raised the sustainable rate for that reason the federal reserve undertook to tighten monetary policy between june 30 1999 and may 16 2000 the federal funds rate was raised in six steps from 5 to 6 Â½ the tightening of monetary policy may also have been motivated by fear that symptoms of bubble in the stock market would spill over to the wider economydirect effect on investment spending rather it depresses investment spending through balance sheet effects and consump tion through wealth effects thus how great an impact the decline had on the economy depends heavily on how investors reacted to it which cannot be easily differe ntiated from the investors reaction to the recession policy responses to the 2001 downturn both fiscal and monetary policy were us ed to curb the extent of the economic contraction the federal reserve d ecided on january 3 2001 that the economic slowdown was greater than required to bring the economy back to its full employment growth path5 between january 3 and december 11 2001 the federal funds rate was reduced to175 from 65 about half of the easing was subsequent to may 15th the response of economic activity to an easing of monetary policy is not immediate as will be explained below one of the channels by which monetary policy affects the pace of economic activity is through changes in the international exchange value of the dollar this channel is not going to be strong since the major trading partners of the united states also experienced economic slowdowns and lowered their own interest ra tes thus the dollar has d less scope for depreciating against other currencies in addition various parts of the industrial sector of the us appeared to have redundant capital especia lly in computer equipment and software this means that there was less incentive to add capital to this vital sector in the face of capital redundancy even as interest rates fell fiscal expansion was also used to revive aggregate spending the full employment measure of the federal budg et moved from surplus of 13 of gdp in 2000 to 06 in 2001 to deficit of 15 of gdp in 2002 government spending increased by about 1 of gdp from 2001 to 2002 the tax rebate and the reduction in personal income tax rates raised the disposable income of households and it is thought led to an increase in consumption spending however the portion of the tax cut delivered in 2001 was small less than Â½ of 1 of gdp further tax reductions were phased in beginning in 2002 but most of the tax cuts were spread well into the futurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31237crs6 what causes recessions what causes recessions the answer is both complex and simple it is complex because there is always an element of what j ohn maynard keynes referred to as animal spirits driving recessions such as confidence uncertainty and pessimism these animal spirits do not accommodate themselves to objective quantitative analysis the psychological impact of events in the 2001 recession such as the september 11 attacks and the burstin g of the nasdaq bubble are good examples of the futility of trying to precisely quan tify recessions cause for that reason our understanding of the causes and cures of recessions will always remain limited but if events of the animal spirit variety are acknowledged but then set aside explaining recessions expost becomes relatively easy the primary culprits then boil down to errors in monetary and fiscal policy th at destabilize aggregat demand variety of shocks to the productive capacity of the ec onomy that are relatively quantifiable and spillover effects from financial crises there are many other theories of the business cycle some related and some contradictory but this report will focus on those three for the sake of brevity and conceptual coherence policy errors in sense most recessions could have been avoided after the fact one can identify alternative monetary and fiscal po licy choices that if employed would have prevented or at least alleviated most recessions most recessions are caused by declines in aggregate demand individuals and firms longer desire to purchase as much as the economy can produce if pr ices adjusted quickly the price of goods and services would fall to the point wh ere aggregate demand would purchase what the economy could produce and recession coul d be averted since prices do not adjust quickly output must fall in response to the fall in demand although sticky prices make instantane ous market adjustment impossible it does enable fiscal and monetary policy to manipulate aggregate demand to boost real purchasing power when the economy is in recession see box for an explanation of how fiscal and monetary policy affect the economy because fiscal and monetary policy have wide titude to manipulate aggregat demand one can theoretically envision that there would always be policy stance consistent with fullyemployed economy theoretically any change in th behavior of private actors positive or negative that affected aggregate demand could be completely offset by fiscal and monetary policy allowing for sm ooth and continuous economic growth unfortunately information is limited and the effects of policy changes are often slow variable and uncertain thus in hinds ight erroneous policy decisions can be identified that moved the economy away from full employment or prevented the economy from quickly returning to full empl oyment policymakers at the time may have made the best decision based on the information available to them but with the knowledge one has after the fact one can identify alternative policy decisions that would have prevented or alleviated the recession such policy errors come in two common varieties first there are frequently policy errors that lead to the economy growin g at an unsustainable pace to prevent accelerating inflation and other economic imbalances from widening these errorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31237crs7 6 for more information see crs report rl31050 formulation of monetary policy by the federal reserve rules vs discretion by marc labontemust then be reversed and in the proce ss of reversal the ec onomy often overshoots and enters recession this is why the boom and bust pattern of business cycles is so typical and why hard landings tend to be the norm and soft landings the exception second there are policy errors that ccur because policymakers react to the onset of recession too slowly given the gs in policy effectiveness instead the needed stimulus is delivered after the recession has already begun these errors occur because data become available slow ly are often subject to revision and may be contradictory our knowledge of the economy simply remain s and will probably always remain too limited to see the problem coming most economists remain hopeful that stabilization policy during both expansions and recessions w ill continue to improve maki ng future recessions if not avoidable at least shorter and shallower indeed the past two recessions are the mildest of the postwar peri od for them monetary policy plays the key role in providing stabilization because fiscal pol icy is more cumbersome and harder to reverse but there remain minority of economists who believe that discretionary stabilization policy does more harm than g ood in their view policy errors are too frequent and not always accidental by increasing uncertainty these errors lower peoples wellbeing erode confidence nd policymakers reputations and worsen downturns it is fact that recessions will end on their own once prices adjust and resources are reallocated these economis ts would rather use economic rules to set policy and wait for natural adjustment to take place than risk worsening it through the active use of illconceived stabilization policy6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31237crs8 how do fiscal and monetary policy affect the economy changes in monetary and fiscal policy change aggregate spending in the economy all else equal expansiona ry monetary policy lowers interest rates boosting investment spending and interestsensitive consumer spending lower interest rates also tend to increase the capitalized value of the nations financial wea lth and this in turn tends to increase household consumption lower interest rates so lower the international exchange value of the dollar all else equal by lowering the inflow of foreign capital since capital can only be invested thr ough the purchase of dollars smaller net inflow of capital causes the dollar to depreciate the depreciation then boosts us exports and importco mpeting goods increasing economic growth all else equal thus recession is typically accompanied by an exchange rate depreciation and improvement in the trade balance this is an example of the economys builtin adju stment mechanisms that prevent recessions from persisting all of these effects take time however for more information see crs report rl30839 monetary policy current policy and conditions by gail makinen and crs report rl31204 fixed exchange rates floating exchange rates and currency boards what have we learned by marc labonte fiscal policy or the expansion of budget deficit can also boost aggregate spending if it is undertaken through higher government spending then this boosts aggregate spending di rectly if fiscal policy is undertaken through tax cuts aggregate spending is boosted to the extent that the tax cuts are spent by their recipients the effect of fiscal policy on aggregate spending can be partially offset howev er to the extent that it causes higher private interest rates which crowd out private investment spending and exports the closer the economy is to full employment when fiscal expansion is undertaken the more crowding out can be expected fiscal expansion naturally occurs as the result of the budgets automatic stabilizers declines in revenues and increases in spending that occur without policy change in addition it can occur through active policy changes legislated changes in the level of spending or taxation reasonable estimate of whether the former or latter has occurred can be determined by examining the structural deficit or deficit that would occur if the economy were at full employme nt calculated by the congressional budget office in the former case the structural deficit remains constant in the latter it widens for more information see crs report rl30839 tax cuts the business cycle and economic growth macroeconomic analysis by marc labonte and gail makinen supply shocks in the 1970s economists acquired better appreciation that economic fluctuations were not always attributable to changes in aggregate demand but could also be caused by shocks to aggreg ate supply sometimes economic conditionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31237crs9 7 an increase in oil prices can be viewed only as cause of recession if it is caused by exogenous events such as the revolution in iran and the persian gulf crisis as opposed to being the consequence of rise in oil demand caused by previously strong growth economist james hamilton claims that all nine of these oil shocks were caused by exogenous events james hamilton oil and the macroec onomy since world war ii journal of political economy v 91 n 2 1983 8 this discussion draws heavily from herber t stein us policy oil and recession the washington economist american enterprise institute novemberdecember 1990 pp 812change in ways that temporarily reta rd the productive capabilities of the economy earthquakes hurricanes and ot her natural disasters are obvi ous examples of shocks other shocks occur when crucial relativ price changes and resources and other prices cannot be reallocated and adjust ed quickly enough to prevent an economic contraction in small ope n economies events abroad eg finland suffered deep recession when the soviet union collapsed or sharp change in the exchange rate may cause such shock the us econom is probably too large and has too little reliance on international trade to succumb to these types of shocks for the us oil shocks have been and c ontinue to be the most dangerous source of supply shocks to the us economy if anything this threat has been underrated sharp spikes in the price of oil have preceded nine of the 10 postwar recessions including the current one7 the following discussion explains in greater detail why oil shocks cause recession for clarity th discussion will separa their effects on aggregate demand from those on aggregate supply8 oil shocks demand effects when energy prices change they involve an income transfer among producers and consumers in the case of price increase income is likely to be transferred from consumers to producers since producers are also consumers aggregate demand is likely to fall only temporarily as producers adjust their consumption to their now higher incomes this adjustment is likely to be longer when the income recipients are foreigners than when they are americans second effect on demand can be expected to occur because the ri in energy prices will probably push up the overall price level because other prices do not fall immediately in the face of decline in mand the increase in the price level will reduce the real value of the available amount of money in the hands of buyers and this reduction in the real money stock will also reduce spending third effect on demand can occur if the rise in energy pr ices increases uncertainty and causes buyers to defer purchases this also is likely to be of short run natu re the magnitude of all three effects will depend on how much energy prices rise and how long they remain high the strength of the effects will be temporary if the oil price rise is of short duration oil shocks supply effects the supply side effects are also multiple in nature first the increase in oil pri ces will increase the cost to produce output given the level of demand aggregate output will fall nd unemployment will rise second not all prices will rise proportionately since oil doe s not enter equally in the production of all goods and serv ices some prices will thus rise relative to others consumers will tend to divert their purchases toward other goods and services whose prices have not risen in proportion thus labor and capital w ill become unemployedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31237crs10 9 the channel through which oil shocks retard economic growth should make it clear that it is the change in oil prices rather than the level of oil prices that affects economic output once an economy has adjusted to an increase in oil prices high oil prices have effect on its ability to grow from that point forward the permanent effect for oil consuming nations such as the us is that the nations income purchases fewer goods and services henceforthand have to be shifted from the contracting to the expanding industries9 they may not however be in the right proportions or the right type the consequence is that they are likely to remain unemployed or under employed for considerable period overall the effect of an oil price hike on the supply side is to raise unemployment oil shocks policy response the argument made above that recessions caused by changes in aggregate demand could have been voided with different policy responses does not apply to oil shoc ks recessions induced by declines in aggregate demand typically cause both output gr owth and inflation to fall this gives policymakers plenty of latitude to boost demand without fearing that inflation will be reignited oil shocks make for less favorable policy tradeoff because they are characterized by falling growth and rising prices policymakers must now choose between longer recession or higher infl ation the right policy response is more ambiguous financial crises crises in the financial sector are rare r but virulent cause of recession as is demonstrated by the great depression nd japanese experience in the 1990s sound financial sector is uniquely im portant component of growing economy because it enables capital to be efficiently directed from savers to borrowers when this mechanism breaks down there are sp illover effects to the wider economy as economic production becomes difficult co stly inefficient and slow non functioning financial system is one economic problem th at cannot be solved solely through traditional monetary and fiscal expansion although the two can have palliative effects concern about financial crisis shoul d not be confused however with the expected decline in asset prices that typically accompanies recession characteristics of typical recessions role of inventories historically inventories ve played special role in recessions when the economy enters rece ssion sales fall more quickly than firms had anticipated and inventory buildup constitutes significant portion of gdp growth the buildup inventories then needs to be drawn down and while this happens economic recovery is retarded although sa are recovering new production is not needed it is only when excess inventories are worked off that economic growth can resume there has been much speculation that the development of just in time production and the growing computerizati on of inventory mana gement would make inventories less volatile in recessions if this were true recessions might become shallower and shorter measured as per centage of gdp the decline in inventories in the 19901991 was smaller than usual and s eemed to support this theory but therehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31237crs11 was an above average inventory drawdow n in the 2001 recession although below average preceding inventory buildup consumption and investment patterns it has repeatedly been claimed that the 2001 recession is different because it was concentrated in the investment sector consumption by contrast has kept growing during the recession they conclude that overinvestment during the pr eceding expansion phase is therefore the unique cause of the 2001 recession as will be shown below this claim is unfounded investment has declined more sharply than overall growth in every postwar recession by contrast growth has declined mo re sharply than consumption in every postwar recession in five of the 10 recessions including 2001 consumption actually remained positive on cumula tive basis over the entire recession theoretically this pattern is unsurprising the lifecycle consumption model suggests that output should fall more th an consumption during recessions because people prefer to smooth their consumption patterns over their lifetime investment by contrast should be highly sensitive to expected rates of re turn and shortterm rates of return would presumably fall during recessions furthermore monetary policy has been used as stabilization tool more frequently and actively than fiscal policy since monetary policy works primarily through the interest rate channel and investment is more sensitive to changes in interest rates than consumption this makes investment more volatile because investment has always fallen sharply in recessions some economists focus on investment cycles as distinct cause of recessions but for the reasons outlined in th is paragraph it is difficult to disentangle cause from effect and conclude that inve stment behavior is distinct cause of recessions many commentators claimed that infla tion remained low in the 2001 recession because it was concentrated in investment they claim that unlike the previous four recessions where excessive consumer demand pushed up prices inflation remained low in 2001 because only investment spending was excessive this is not an accurate description of the theory of aggregate demand while it is true that theory suggests prices rise when aggregate demand grows excessively it is not true that only consumption can cause aggr egate demand to grow excessively consumption is only one component of aggregate demand investment is another excessive growth in the demand for investme nt goods can be just as inflationary as excessive growth in the demand for consumption goods the historical record the united states has not had much experience with economic contractions there have been only 10 in the more than 50 years since the end of world war

in most other postwar recessions however the rise in unemployment was relatively mild the continued increase in unemployment once recovery was underway highlights an unusual feature of this recession the subsequent recove ry was sluggish at first several explanations which are not mutua lly exclusive have been given for the recession of 19901991 first the federal re serve fed tightened monetary policy between february 1988 and may 1989 with the ta rget for the federal funds rate rising from approximately 65 to 97513 although some of this increase had been reversed by the time of the recessi on the lag in monetary policy effectiveness eventually took its toll on the economy the fed undertook this policy to counter rising inflation rate which ro from 22 in 1986 to 39 in 199014 second month after the contraction began iraq invaded kuwait and the us economy was hit by major oil price shock crude oil prices rose from an average of 15 barrel in june 1990 to 33 ba rrel in oct ober 1990 prices declined considerably by february 1991 however ra ising the question of whether the price spike lasted long enough to have sign ificant effect on economic activity some analysts believed that uncertainty surrounding the crisis also played significant role in undermining business and c onsumer confidence and this in turn led to the curtailment of aggregate spending until the crisis was resolved third there were serious solvency problems among thrift institutions during this time since efficient fina ncial intermediation is key component of economic growth this disruption could have

while the banking industry did not experi ence crisis as the sl industry did the industry did undergo stress during this period which may have added to the general economic dislocation many financial analysts claimed the banking sector experienced credit crunch in which banks with deteriorating balance sheets rationed credit to creditworthy firms if this were true then those firms would be unable to invest as much as they desire d reducing aggregate spending in the short run by contrast in the conventional model banks would still offer loans to firms during economic downturns but at higher inte rest rates because of rising riskiness in this case aggregate demand also declines because firms make fewer investments at the new higher interest rates17 claims of credit crunches are frequently heard during recessions but it is difficult to determine if the rationing of credit to worthy borrowers truly occurs the data show that during downtur ns banks shift their portfolios in favor of safe assets such as government bonds this may resu lt from heightened preference for safety or lack of other creditworthy lending opportunities also the creditworthiness ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31237crs15 established borrowers may deteriorate as the economy moves from expansion to recession the borrowers may fail to see this deterioration and cl aim that banks are rationing credit in any case the pe rceived credit crunch ended when robust economic growth returned the recession ended when the economy re sponded to monetary easing and the subsequent decline in oil prices from high of approxima tely 975 in may 1989 year before the recession began the targ et for the federal f unds rate was lowered over the next 2 Â½ years to approximately 3 by the end of

two percentage points this experience highlights the typical lags in monetary policy effectiveness monetary easing that began before the recession began did not feed through to private cr edit markets quickly enough to prevent the recession from occurring in spite of the downturn the standard poors sp 500 equity index rose in nominal terms by 36 in 1990 less than the rate of inflation and 124 in 1991 nevertheless the economy ev entually responded to the lower interest rates and monetary creation despite th claimed presence of credit crunch there was scant use of fiscal policy to end the recession as ide from the use of automatic stabilizers which raised the actual budget defic it from 28 in 1989 to 39 in 1990 and 45 in 1991 as percen tage of gdp but resulted in structural deficits of 21 in 1989 and 1990 and 25 in 1991 in fact efforts were made to reduce the deficit which was already large when the recession began such as the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 which was estimated to raise tax revenues by 03 of gdp in 1991 and reduce planned outlays change s to excise taxes payroll taxes and individual income taxes accounted fo r the bulk of the tax increases additional traits of th 19901991 recession were typi cal of other recessions private investment declined significantly more than consumption large inventory drawdowns by business were also key co mponent in the decline of gdp as percentage of gdp however the change in inventories was significantly smaller than in past recessions and therefore played smaller role in the downturn the dollar depreciated by 73 in inflationadjusted terms over the next year after peaking in march 1990 the trade balance improved slig htly and this helped alleviate the decline in gdp the trade deficit was sm all even before the recession however and the improvement during the recession was not significant the trade deficit declined from 09 of gdp in the second quarter of 1990 to 03 of gdp in the first quarter of 1991 the trade deficit and do llar were able to decline in part because of the state of the world economy although the united kingdom was in the midst of recession at this time growth in western europe and japan was moderate to strong and growth was also fairly strong in the developing world the double dip recession of the 1980s the double dip recession of the ear ly 1980s was actually two separate recessions interrupted by very short two quarter expansion since the expansion was so short and the causes of both recessions were the same most analyses combine these two recessions as does this report taken together the double dip recessionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31237crs16 18 the sharp rise in overnight rates actua lly began during the short term of volckers predecessor g william miller during millers tenure overnight interest rates rose from approximately 675 in march 1978 to 105 in july 1979represents the deepest and longest recession in the postwar period economic growth fell by more than 2 in each recession and the unemployment rate rose from 63 in the first quarter of 1980 to 108 at the end of 1982 one quarter after the recession had ended this is the only time that the unemployment rate has reached double digits since the great depression it is widely acknowledged that the ma jor factor driving the economy into its deep recession in the early 1980s was the desi re by the federal reserve to reduce the inflation rate to more acceptable level inflation reached 111 on an annualized basis in the fourth quarter of 1980 the problem was not going to go away on its own since the oil shock of 1973 there had not been single quarter when inflation had been below 4 under the recently ppointed chairman paul volcker the fed chose to act decisively to reduce inflati on even if it led to reduction in economic activity in the short term beginning w ith volckers appointment in august 1979 the fed increased the federal funds rate from approximately 105 to 175 in april 198018 the federal funds rate was then lowered until it reached approximately 95 in august 1980 but when inflation remained persistent new round of rate increases brought the rate to 19 in july 1981 th increases are even more significant when adjusted for inflation because the in flation rate fell by around five percentage points during this time thus the real fe deral funds rate rose about from about 0 in august 1980 to 11 Â½ in july 1981 th nominal federal funds rate remained above 10 until october 1982 just afte r the second recession had ended longterm interest rates followed s imilar pattern although the changes were not as great from august 1979 to april 1980 nominal interest rates on aaa corporate bonds rose by appr oximately three percentage points and baa bond rates rose by almost four percentage point s from august 1980 to july 1981 both aaa and baa bond rates rose by another three percentage points and continued to rise until the first quarter of 1982 the sp index rose by 153 in 1980 and 78 in 1981 less than the rate of infl ation but fell by 65 in 1982 oil shocks again reared their ugly head contributing to this recession following

value interestingly it continued to appreciate during the second recession by 18 as part of an upward trend that c ontinued until 1985 many economists attribute this appreciation to the high interest

but remained significantly higher than their prerecession leve ls nevertheless the recessi on eventually ended and gave way to strong recovery the large ta x cuts in 1981 and ensuing budget deficits undoubtedly played role in stimulating the economy in 1982 although this was partially offset by their contribution to the high interest rates of the period which crowded out private investment likewi the high exchange rate crowded out exports and importcompeting goods as percentage of gdp the actual budget deficit rose from 26 of gdp in 1981 to 40 of gdp in 1982 and the structural deficit rose from 05 of gdp to 15 of gdp the major provisions of the economic recovery tax act of 1981 were reductions in ma rginal income tax rates individual saving incentives and more fa vorable capital depreciation rates some economists argue that the fed could have deflated the economy more slowly and less severely but it did accomplish its goal of permanently lowering the inflation rate which has not exceeded 5 since the stagflation recession of the 1970s the 19731975 recession was long and deep recession that is remembered primarily for its simultaneous rise in both the inflation rate and the unemployment rate typically these two measures are expected to move in opposite directions blame for the 19731975 recession is usually placed on the 1973 oil shock when oil prices unexpectedly rose from 260barre l in 1973 to 11barrel in 1975 in nominal terms after accounting for the rise in inflation the increase in real terms was smaller prices tripled rather than quadr upled there was tightening of monetary policy immediately preceding the recession as well however the federal funds rate increased from 5 in late 1972 to 10 in mid1973 this tightening of monetary policy is less impressive when adjusted for inflation real interest rates rose from below zero in 1972 to 23 in 1973 tig htening of policy but from base that was unsustainably low while the oil shock undoubtedly played large part in the poor economic performance of the 1970s many economists believed it has been assigned an exaggerated amount of blame for the decades poor economic performance famous predictor of recessions the inversi on of the yield curve had occurred before the oil shock suggesting that recession might have been unavoidable even if the oil shock had never occurred19 inflation was rising unsustainably long before the oil shock and the consensus among economists is that general wage and price control policies implemented in 1971 to mask inflation pre ssures exacerbated economic weakness before and after the oil shock by preventing the economy from adjusting to market forces most notably economists believe that regulatory attempts to suppress the oil price increases led to s hortages that were even more economically costly than if prices had been allowed to rise likewise while the sharp rise in oil prices undoubtedly caused the sharp spike in inflation in 19731974 it cannot behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31237crs19 20 this increase in inflation may not have been anticipated if this was the case then market participants at the time may not have viewed l ong term private rates to be falling thus it is difficult to say whether or not the stimulus was offset by the crowding out of private investment investment as percentage of gdp did fall in 1975 and 1976 suggesting that crowding out may have occurredblamed for the persistence of high inflation for the rest of the 1970s in the long run inflation can only be monetary phenome non decision by the fed to choose an interest rate below equilibrium resulting in excessive money growth the decision to keep monetary policy relatively easy probably caused the recession to end earlier than it otherwise would have but this eff ect was achieved at the cost of continuing the high inflation set off by the oil shock finally the recession coincided with secular decline in productivity growth that lasted for 20 years economists have not reached consensus as to why this decline occurred but its duration clearly rules out the possibility that it can be blamed on the oil shock whatever its cause it most likely created significant economic dislocation while workers and businesses adjusted their expectations table 5 economic indicators during the 19731975 recession quarter gdp growth consumption

rebate which was sent out in the second quarter of 1975 the act also expanded or created several individual income tax credits and deductions increased the investment tax credit and reduced corporate taxes21 expenditures were simultaneously increased beyond those provided by automatic stabilizers as result the actual budget deficit increased to 34 of gdp in 1975 and the structural deficit increased to 02 of gdp fiscal policy was eased further in 1976 when many elements of the 1975 act took effect or were expanded but was the expansionary policy respons the correct one the 1973 oil shock presented policymakers with an unfamiliar scenario contraction in output that coincided with rise in prices by choos ing to stimulate the economy high inflation was locked in for the rest of the decade until the fed deflated the economy in the early 1980s move that brought on the wo rst recession of the postwar period the alternative choice would have been to allow the recession to worsen until inflation had subsided in sum the 1970s are an unf ortunate textbook example of the limits of macroeconomic stabilization policy when the economy is hit by adverse supply shocks such as the oil shock and the dec line in productivity the instruments available to the government are too blunt to entir ely insulate the economy from the negative consequences furthermore if stabilization policy is dedicated to unrealistic and contradictory goals it worsens macroeconomic outcomes the decision to keep fiscal and monetary policy too easy after the recession had ended left the inflation rate uncomfortably high throug hout the 1970s without ever reducing the unemployment rate to the unattainably low level authorities had presumably designed those policies to achieve the 1970s recession followed the pattern of most recessions in several ways consumption growth was mostly positive throughout the r ecession while investment shrank more quickly than the economy ch anges in inventories

the developing world also boomed as petrodollars were invested in their economies the result was an overall world growth rate lower than average but higher than in the 1980s recession other postwar recessions the recessions that occurred before the 1970s were more similar to the 1990 1991 experience than the episodes of the 1970s and 1980s first they were all brief varying in length between eight and 11 mont hs second the fall in output in three was very shallow while in the 19531954 and 19571958 recessi ons output dropped sharply in short period of time third the government did not explicitly undertake expansionary fiscal policy with the exception of the 19691970 recession in two of the other episodes 1949 and 19571958 auto matic stabilizers were allowed to operate and unrelated policy ch anges were supportive of fiscal loosening in the other two episodes 19531954 and 1960 fiscal policy was actually tightened these episodes demonstrate that th ere are circumstances in wh ich the us economy is quite capable of escaping recession quickly and with little damage without turning to fiscal expansion in number of other ways they were quite different from the three recessions that have been examined so far firs t inflation was low preceding all but the 1949 and 1969 1970 r ecession the other three recessions were not characterized by need to quell growing inflationary pressu res in the 1949 recession prices adjusted extremely rapidly inflation fell from 4 in 1948 to 16 in 1949 these three recessions contradict the cl aim that the low inflation of the 2001 recession is unique experience second the us maintained fixed nominal exchange rate through the bretton woods regime during all of these recessions so there was little exchange rate adjustment to help or hinder recovery there was also less international economic interdependence in the past and so there was less recessionary spill over to other countries international capital flows we re controlled and limite d and exports and importcompeting goods were smaller fraction of output but in other ways many of these recessions were quite similar to the last three recessions as well as the 2001 recession firs t in each case investment declined by greater amount than overall output c onsumption by contrast did not fall as greatly as output in fact in three of thes five episodes consumption grew during the recession second all five r ecessions were marked by significant increase in the unemployment rate which in all but the first case continued after the recession had ended in these four cases table 6

excep tions were the two shallowest recessions considered thus the ensuing recovery did not have as low of base from which to begin fifth stock prices as measured by the sp 500 index fell in nominal terms in all of the recessions except the 19531954 recession sixth there was sharp spike in oil prices shortly before four out of five of these recessions the exception being the recession of

analysis national income and product accounts bureau of labor statistics policy responses as will be seen the use of fiscal policy in the first four of these recessions was limited as they occurred before the heyday of keynesian fiscal policy despite being given less prominence in these recessions than it is today monetary policy was eased in each case in all of these episodes monetary policy can be characterized in hindsight as following pattern of too much tightening of policy before the recession followed by an easing of policy during the recession the overtightening of monetary policy is clearest in the three cases 19531954 19571958 1960 where inflation was already w the fixed exchange rate regime in place during these five recessions did not place as much of constraint on monetary policy as theory would imply because of widespread international capital controls two lessons can be drawn fro m the limited use of stab ilization policy in these episodes first it explains why r ecessions were more frequent in the past second it underlines the fact that the economy is capable of timely adjustment in the absence of policy response based on natural market adjustment 1949 the 1949 recession was met with little explicit fiscal policy response there was an income tax cut passed in 1948 without offsetting revenue reduction but at the time of passage there was be lief that the economy would soon enter recession and the tax cut was not promoted on countercyclical grounds before the recession began president truman had called for significant expansion in government spending

war the stated aim of the government was to offset reductions in military expenditures with reductions in taxes by letting wartime tax increases expire if this could be done on 1to1 basis it would have effect on the budget balance and would constitute relatively neutral fiscal policy it would be slightly contractionary since individuals would save some of th eir tax cuts in fact military and non military spending was reduced more quickly than taxes and the budget deficit actually shrank from 17 of gdp in fy1953 to 03 of gdp in fy1954 thus fiscal policy can be char acterized as contractiona ry during the 19531954 recession since the budgets automatic stabiliz ers would have ma the deficit rise in the absence of policy changes monetary policy was eased right before the recession began after becoming contractionary in early 1953 to counter what the fed saw as the emergence of bubble on top of boom25 after that point milton friedman and anna schwartz characterize

19571958 recession had begun27 fiscal policy was eased somewhat through higher government spendi ng but tax reductions were rejected on the basis that they woul d lead to unacceptably large budget deficits the budget balance moved from budget surplus of 08 of gdp in 1957 to budget deficit of 06 of gdp in 1958 nd 26 of gdp in 1959 but this easing did not exceed the amount provided by automa tic

stance remained approximately c onstant from 1960 to 1961 nevertheless the economy recovered quickly 19691970 the 19691970 recession was preceded by period of unsustainable growth that led to accelera ting inflation which rose from 31 in 1967 to 43 in 1968 49 in 1 969 and 53 in 1970 many contemporary observers attributed this boom and bust pattern to the fiscal policy stance of the time as percentage of gdp the actual budget ficit rose from 11 in 1967 to 29 in 1968 and the structural budget deficit rose from 26 to 35 during period of full employment this increase in the deficit is likely to be highly inflationary many argued that the easing of fiscal policy was spurred by growing american military involvement in vietnam and the governments purported willingness to raise taxes to finance it in retrospect however mone tary policy and spike in oil prices might have played larger role in the cause of the recession than they were assigned by contemporaries the federa l funds rate was increased from about 5 in march 1968 to about 9 14 in august 1969 belated effort was made to reduce the budget deficit which reduced aggregate spending in 1968 and 1969 temporary 10 rcharges were app lied to individual income and corporate taxes ostensibly to curb inflation later the tax reform act of 1969 was passed it was adve rtised as measure to refo rm the tax code and close certain loopholes but also had the effect of raising revenue by 02 of gdp in 1970 its major provisions were the repeal of th investment tax credit revenue raising the restriction of the tax ex empt status of

the act extended the temporary surcharges for the first six months of 1970 at rate of 5 reduced from the previous 10 rais ing tax revenues an additional 04 of gdp30 the result of these efforts along with reduction in military outlays produced an actua l surplus of 03 of gdp in 1969 the last rplus til 1998 this still represented structural budget deficit of 11 of gdp however the drop off in

deficits in the following years was repeat of the great depression possibility in 2001 prior to 2001 the united states has not experienced an economic downturn in 10 years this means that for many americans their formative working years have been spent only during period of economic expansion there was temptation on the part of the press to exploit this situ ation with lurid headlines about how the 2001 downturn could rival the great downtur n of 19291933 stories along these lines usually tried to draw comparisons be tween the 192933 episode and conditions in 2001 and indeed any two historical pe riods are bo und to share some common experiences they may also be fundamenta lly different between 1929 and 1933 real gdp fell by nearly 27 the unemployment rate rose to 25 and the price level as meas ured by the implicit price deflator for gdp fell by nearly 26 the distinguishing characteristic of the 19291933 episode was that an economic contracti on probably set in motion by the federal reserve was compounded by financial panic as the banki ng system was allowed to collapse on march 4 1933 the day franklin roosevelt was inaugurated as president not single bank in the united states was open for business from 1929 to 1933 9755 commercial banks in the united states spended operation th is was approximately 13 of all commercial banks an importa nt reason for the collapse of the banking system was the absence of deposit insurance and failure on the part of the federal reserve to prevent it in addition the united states was linked to other countries through fixed exchange rates embodied in the gold standard which severely limited the feds ability to respond there is now growing body of research that links the severity and worldwide ch aracter of the great depre ssion to the gold standard finally generally accepted economic theory at the time was used to rationalize and accept as inevitable what happened ec onomic theory is much more advanced today on what not to let ppen and government has taken responsibility for the economic health of the nation this includes commitment to keep the money supply and the banking system intact and the united states has not had financial panic since 192933 given such changes as the institution of deposit insurance the legislative commitment of the government to maintain high employment and the use of flexible exchange rates it was hard to make case that the downturn now faced by the united states would develop into anything remotely similar to the economic contraction of 19291933 the cause of the great depression has ofte n been attributed to the stock market crash in october 1929 this explanation s not stood the test of time first it occurred two months after the great depre ssion officially began second in october 1987 stock market crash of similar percen tage magnitude occurred without causing an economic downturn in fact the economic expansion then in progress continued for nearly three more years while th 1929 crash may have worsened the beginning of the downturn there is credible eviden ce that it could have set off the next 10 years of calamity and hardshiphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31237crs26 nevertheless there were jour nalists who made great deal of the fact that the 2001 downturn in the united states was coin cident with economic contractions in two other major economies germany and japan as well as substantial slowdowns in the economies of the united kingdom and canada while the worldwide character of the 192933 contr action is accurate it is not the only time that major countries have simultaneously experienced an economic contraction the economies of the united states germany japa n and the united kingdom simultaneously contracted during some part of 197475 the data in table 2 reveal that this was one of two long contractions in the postworl d war ii era 16 months it had the largest contraction of gdp 3 and the sec ond highest rate of unemployment 9 however its close rival the contraction of 198182 was also as long had nearly the same contraction in gdp 29 had higher unemployment rate 108 and was joined in contraction by germany and th united kingdom but not by japan and the rest of western europe lternatively japan has been mired in slow growth and contraction for more than decade without much of an effect on the united states while several altern ative conclusions can be draw n from this comparison economic theory suggests that when other major economies experience downturn with the united states monetary policy may take l onger to revive and expand demand in the united states because one expansion channel that works through us interest rates falling relative to rates abroad is unlikely to be operative was the 2001 recession more similar to the recessions of the 19th century because the 2001 recession was characteriz ed by falling investment and low inflation some commentators have concluded that it wa s more similar to recessions of the 19th century than recessions of the postworld war ii era this comparison is presumably based on the fact that many recessions of the 19th century were characterized by deflation and financial panics why these commentators believe that deflation is comparable to low inflation and financial panic is comparable to decline in investment is unclear what caused deflation falling prices and financial panics in the 19th century although it has not happened to da could the same phenomena develop today deflation in the second half of 19th century was caused by the countrys adherence to true gold standard under true gold standard every note of currency in circulation must be backed by an quivalent amount of gold under such an arrangement the inflation rate is determined by the growth rate of the supply of gold the nonmonetary demand for gold the mand for currency and the turnover rate of currency in the second half of the 19th century the supply of gold did not grow as quickly as the demand for money balan ces with too few dollars chasing too many goods the price level fell and the c ountry experienced defl ation since today growth in the money supply is longer constrained by the supply of gold and can now be determined by the federal reserve the federa l reserve has discretion to target desired inflation rate and there is little reason to expect deflation thus comparison to the 19th century on these grounds is invalidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31237crs27 banking panics in the 19th century are widely believed to be the result of the dearth of banking regulation the lack of deposit insurance and the lack of lender of last resort ie central bank wit hout these tools information about financial institutions was poor and banks were vulnerable to runs investors and depositors could not distinguish between solvent and in solvent banks and so they withdrew their funds when in doubt since banks cannot li quidate assets quickly enough to pay off depositors during run even solvent ba nks would fail and panic would become widespread our banking system has not experienced run since deposit insurance was created during the great depression hence there is little validity to comparison between financ ial panics of the 19th century and recent conditions conclusion is the 2001 recession different from the past closer look at the historical record reveals that many of the purported differences between the 2001 recession and other recessions turn out to be not so different after all investment in every postwar recession inve stment has declined more than output the investment downturn in the 2001 recession was not unique the 45 decline in investment from the fourth quarter of 2000 to the third quarter of 2001 which closely corresponds to the dates of the recession has been lower than the post war recession average consumption in every postwar recession output has declined more than consumption in five of the 10 recessi ons including the 2001 recession growth in consumption has remained positive on cu mulative basis over the entire recession inflation significant acceleration in the inflation rate has been present in the runup to the previous four recessions 19691970 19731975 19801982 1990 1991 but inflation was very low and showed significant increase in three of the first four recessions of the postwar pe riod the exception being the recession of 1949 there is theoretical or empirical evidence that excessive consumption growth is the only cause of accelerating inflation oil prices in nine of the last 10 recession oil prices have spiked significantly soon before the recession began the 2001 recession is exception this is an important commonality that if anything has been overlooked and underemphasized at the onset of the 19992000 oil price spik many commentator s predicted it would not cause recession because the economy is now stronger and less reliant on oil than it used to be there is compelling evidence that if an oil price spike is exogenous it can cause the economy significant harm equity prices the stock market has declined in nominal terms in seven out of 10 of the last recessions including 2001 the exceptions are the recessions of 19531954 1980 but not 19811982 and 1990 1991 thus any negative wealth effect affecting consumption in 2001 was not unique although the magnitude of the recent decline was above averagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31237crs28 inventories despite the creation of justintime inventory management the 2001 recession experienced the typical inve ntory drawdown as firms cut production in fact the decline in inventories in 2001 wa s greater than usual as percentage of gdp typical inventory buildup di d not precede the drawdown however world economy in the past most us recessions have not been synchronized with world recessions as measured by the overall world growth rate or by the growth rates of major economic partners worldwide growth in the two largest recessions of the postwar peri od was somewhat different in 19731975 overall growth was below average and many major foreign economies who were also oil importers experienced recession ong with the united states in 19801982 overall world growth was sluggish but only few major foreign economies experienced decline in output on yearly basis the global nature of the recent ec onomic slowdown was unusual but not unique world growth was also below average at the trough of the 19731975 or 19801982 recessions economic growth in the advanced economies was below average in 2001 09 and 2002 18 but did not contract only japan and germany experienced recessions among the major foreign economies policy response monetary and fiscal policy have been significantly expansive since the beginning of 2001 th federal reserve has responded to every postwar recession by easing monetary policy historically fiscal policy has not been used as actively in most recessions automatic stabilizers have been allowed to operate but an explicit change in fiscal policy to boost demand ie tax cut or boost in government spending that widens the structural budget deficit was used only in 19691970 19731975 19801982 and the 2001 recession there is indication that the absence of fiscal ex pansion prolonged the other five recessions in fact if fiscal expansi on was essential to economic r ecovery one would expect that recessions in which fiscal expansion was us ed would be shorter and shallower yet fiscal expansion was undertaken in the tw deepest and longest recessions of the postwar period in the absence of fiscal expansion expansionary monetary policy and natural market adjus tments have proven capable of returning the economy to renewed expansion depth and duration the 19731975 and 19801982 recession stand out for their depth and duration they also stand out for their distinctive causes sharp and long lasting oil shocks characterized both recessions the 19801982 experience is also unique for its sharp tightening of monetary policy that persisted well into the downturn neither of these factors was pr esent in 2001 making the eight months of recession more similar to the smaller postwar recessions
