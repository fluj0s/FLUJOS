of cause after fire flood or explosion54 regulations further specify the factors considered by fema in evaluating gubernatorial request for major disaster declaration the factors considered to determine whether federal pa assistance is needed include an assessment of the per capita impact of the disaster within affected states55 insurance coverage in force the presence and impact of hazard mitigation measures the cumulative impact of disasters over the previous year and whether federal aid authorized by statutes other than the stafford act would better meet the needs of stricken areas56 factors considered to determine whether federal ihp assistance is needed include concentration of damages numbe r of injuries deaths or th extent to which essential services are disrupted the imp act on special populations that require higher levels of assistance the extent to which voluntary agencies are able to meet the needs of victims insurance coverage and measuremen ts of needs such as disaster housing needs approved number of homes destro yed or damaged financial assistance required and others57 emergency declarations the declaration process for emergencies is similar to that used

indi viduals or families however not all persons or entities affected by catastrophe are eligible for stafford act assistance even if the president issues declaration fema officials determine the need for assistance after major disaster or emergency declaration is issued aid is provided only to those persons or entities determined to need the assistance for example family with adequate insuran ce and alternative housing options might not be considered eligible to receive financial aid unit of local government that suffers damages to some f acilities but not to the ex tent considered necessary pursuant to fema regulations and guidelines might not receive funds to rebuild infrastructure the type of assistance made available va ries from one disaster to another and among eligible applicants within state commensurate with decisions by fema officials on the extent of damage and the ligibility of applicants for instance under major disaster declaration local jurisd ictions with large num bers of damaged or destroyed residences might be eligible for assistance under the ihp program whereas those with severely damaged infrastruct ure but relatively few damaged homes might be eligible only for assistance under th pa program similarly if local government had extensive debr is in public rightsofway due to disaster but very little damage to public facilities determina tion might be made to provide assistance only for debris removal activities under th pa program on the other hand areas severely devastated by catastrophe ar often eligible for both ihp and pa the stafford act

areas occurred nine times since 1997 87 44 cfr 20647b 88 due to the difficulty of conducting prelimin ary damage assessments immediately after disaster occurs it is not unusual for amendmen ts to be

instances where the statelocal ma tch is unduly burdensome due to factors such as the impact of the disaster or the fiscal condition of the state and its units of local government the president may waive some or all of the costsharing requirement for pa programs however the president may not waive the 25 state local requirement for assistance provi ded under the individual assistance ia program except for insular areas86 table 1 of this report indicates that the statelocal match requirement has been reduced or waived for specified peri od of time usually 72 hours for specific categories of eligible pa work for example in 2004 there were 16 disaster declarations for which the costshare requirement was adjusted for these 16 states four were granted costshare ratio of 90 federal and 10 stat elocal match for all pa program categories in addition after 12 major disasters the president waived the entire statelocal match for eligible costs incurred during period of 72 consecutive hours and only for eligible costs associat ed with debris re moval and emergency protective measures activities for the rema inder of the incident disaster period the statelocal match was either 10 in five cases or 25 in seven cases if state or local government believes that the economic impact from the disaster warrants officials may contact fe ma to request reduction in their portion of the federal costshare the regulations specify that an adjustment in the costshare requirement may be made whe never disaster is so extraordinary that actual federal obligations under the stafford act excl uding fema administration cost meet or exceed specified thresholds87 the costs incurred are based on stafford act obligations for the disaster and may differ from those of the preliminary damage assessment88 currently the threshold for qualifying for reduction of the state local match is if recovery costs based on fema obligations reach or exceed 122 per capita based on the state population before the disaster struck89 if that threshold is reached the federal cost share will be reco mmended to be 90 of eligible costs for public assistance and debris clearance rather than 7590 in addition if an affected area had suffered from another disastrous ev ent within the previous 12 months the cumulative impact of the events would also be factored into femas waiver of state local match

organizations and property owners are not eligible for grants authorized by the statute such entities generally rely on insurance or loans the devastation caused by hurricane katrina to all components of many commun ities has revived in terest in the issue of expanding eligibility for stafford act assistance to certain forprofit entities some might contend that such an expa nsion would result in considerably high federal disaster relief expenditures as private forprofit entities turn to federal grants in lieu of insurance or loans others contend that some of the facilities notably educational and health care institutions provide services comparable to those available through public or nonprofit organizations there is precedent for the provision of such assistance on at least two occasions congress appropriated funds to assist private corporations deemed to be particularly stricken after disasters when ice storms severely affected utility companies in new england and when utility companies lost infrastructure in the terrorist attacks of 2001 in new york c ity such appropriations however were made outside of stafford ac t authority third instance involving the texas medical center however is appropriate to an examination of this issue insofar as the stafford act is concerned private utilities after the 1998 ice storms in the early winter months of 1998 an ice storm resulted in the destruction of electricity distri bution infrastructure as heavily laden trees collapsed on miles of poles and wires121 private utilities owned and maintained the infrastructure to

representation on fema oversight committees election year impacts are also found another study which builds upon the 2002 paper examined presidential disasters declarations from 1981 through 2004 and found that the greater the elect oral prize and the more competitive the statewide presidential contest the more likely it is that state will receive presidential disaster declaration even after controlling for actual need129 another perspective on the issue was presented in 1989 study completed by government accountability office gao that also considered the effects of politics on disaster declarations after examining presidential declaration data from the perspective of the party affiliation of governors and members of state congressional delegations the authors concluded that there were indications that party affiliation affected white house major disaster declaration decisions130 in light of concerns about funding decisions afte r the20042005 hurricanes and the rising deficit
