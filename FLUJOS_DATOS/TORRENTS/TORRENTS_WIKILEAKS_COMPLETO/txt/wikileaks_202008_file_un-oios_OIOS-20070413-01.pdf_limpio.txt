rtc in the world institute f or development economics research unuwider in helsinki finland and the institute for new technologies unu intech renamed unumerit in maastricht the neth erlands in october and december 2006 respectively the main objective of t he audit was to evaluate the adequacy of programme and project management at rtc s unu accepted most of the recommendations establishment the projects of the maastricht economic research in stitute on innovation and technology the foundation and the faculty of ec onomic and business administration of the universitiet maastricht the um had not been integrated with those of unumerit although this was required unde r cooperation agreement in 2005 to integrate activities of unu institute for n ew technologies unuintech the legal contractual and accountability arrangeme nts are currently not in place at unumerit to integrate these projects numbering so 90 projects and having budgets ranging from less than 10000 to above 30 0000 several of them are regulated by contractual andor funding agreements between donors and either um or the foundation and are substantially more than u numerits portfolio of 10 projects the institute faces complex task to int egrate project and related financial activities and oios is of the opinion that legal expert and the director administration and finance of unu should assist in this integration for the foreseeable future there will be two separate fina ncial streams at unumerit one for the unu and one for the foundation accordingl there is intention as this time to pursue complete integration of projects this would not prevent further integration of research context between unumerit and the found ation merit as foreseen in the unumerit strategic plan unu sees need to ngage legal expert at this time the questions at hand are of practical or cademic nature and could not be dealt with by legal expert nor should they be dea lt with at the level of the director of administration the unus legal adviser has already been involved in the discussions in maastricht on this matter and he will continue to be available should there be need for such advice on the overall integration of academic activities within unu merit statutory requirements programme management in practice unu has single programme and proje ct management cycle that simplifies programme and project management signifi cantly with reduced costs effort and time to formalize this practice the statutory requirements regarding the adoption and approval of programmes should be extended to in clude projects unu believes that it is already integrated however unu agreed to fo rmalize it in the programme management manual and guidelines structure and staffing at unumerit 15 of the 30 staff positions 22 fund ed were vacant unuwider had senior programme assistant and 3 project assi stants but unumerit had none given the need to enhance programme and proje ct monitoring unumerit should consider engaging at least one programme ass istant the rector wishes to leave this matter in the hands of the director of unumer it funding both institutes benefited substantially from fundin g from their host countries income from the endowment fund and operating contributions totalled 90 per cent for unu wider and 80 per cent for unumerit from 2000 to 2005 unuwider received income totalling 21 million and unumerit 15 million specific programme contributions spc funding is intended t support academic activities over and above planned activities financed from core inc ome spc funding increased since 2000 and in the 20042005 biennium both institutes received more than double the amount of the previous biennium this category of i ncome is becoming more important to unu and to some rtcs crucial oios encourages unu to finalize its fundraising plan and to establish the fundraising programme strategies unus strategies are properly developed and documen ted and the institutes also developed their own but it is difficult to determi ne the impact of these strategic initiatives for unu as whole there is always the risk of duplicating efforts if they are not sufficiently coordinated and results are not as sessed the unu centre could strengthen its coordinating function of strategic i nitiatives which should be considered as general programme activity unu centre continues to play coordinating role as set out in the unu charter the rectors office is at the centre of such efforts the unu agrees however that if additional resources c an be mobilized for the 2008 2009 biennium specific attention will be given to strengthening the staffing component of the rectors office which has the task as part of its responsibilities programme and project cycle and fbpms the programme and project cycle is not documented but the rtcs follow similar procedures with the diagram below oios presents t he programme and project cycle if the current practices procedures statutory respon sibilities and recommendations contained in this report are considered the financial budgetary and personnel management s ystem fbpms does not include project management module when the new ccounting system is introduced it is suggested that the internal processes illustr ated above be considered and the system should provide the outputs required to comply with the statutory responsibilities ie project selection project documents and programme development programme of work updates during implementation and monitoring project summaries workplans monitoring tables and minutes of project monitoring committee meetings and reporting reports to boards unu council reviews and evaluations considering the extent of activities at rtcs it is also suggested that the system should not be complex unu is now establishing working group to study th specific needs for programme management component to be included in the new syst em guidance and standards unu has guidelines for budget preparation and proje ct proposals to guide programme and project managers unu needs more comprehensiv manual or set of management instructions that define programmeproject cycle an d project and include procedures and tools for project formulation and criteria cos ting policy and project monitoring and reporting unu agreed to develop programme management manual based on best practices programme planning the selection criteria for projects should take fin ancial criteria comparative advantages or the human resources available into consideration thus unu should set the minimum amount for research project and assess co mparative advantages that would allow rtcs to focus on issues in which they would d better than other research institutes and would help unu avoid duplication of efforts two sets of criteria are therefore suggested set of criteria that is appl icable for unu as whole and separate set for each of the rtcs criteria for unu project selection are in the unu strategic directions 2007 2010 and the proposed p rogramme management manual will also give an indication of minimum project bud gets implementation time limitations and resources available programme and project implementation unu should formalize its policies for the engagemen t of researchers to relate more closely to the work of research institutions unuw iders commissioning of research papers is costeffective as the fees are directly related to workload and output but this practice is not formalized at unu unumerit engages external researchers through consultant contracts which had been formalized within unu however their general conditions and procedures do not adequately reflect the needs of research institution oios found number of good practices at the instit utes of which the related procedures could be standardized throughout unu they include methods and procedures inviting proposals method of commissioning research papers publication of project papers refereeing policy briefs and launching of research findings programme services at rtcs should communicate these best practices and re lated procedures with the unu centre where it could be formulated in guidelines and then distributed to other rtcs moreover unus efforts to standardise procedures could also apply to administrative and financial procedures the chief administrative and programme services of rtcs could meet more regularly at least once per bienni um under the leadership of the director of administration and finance to provide forum for sharing of best practices and related procedures improving internal communic ations and streamlining procedures programme and project monitoring and reporting oios found the reports prepared by the rtcs impress ive and adequate for internal and external reporting institutes monitor implementati on internally through meetings whose composition timing monitoring tools and reporting procedures should be standardised and formalised they could be called programmeproj ect monitoring committee meetings should there be any report forthcoming fr om the programmeproject monitoring committee meetings apart from the minut of the meeting they could be kept in the formats as presented to the boards and unu council project summaries financial and technical reports postimplementation reviews and evaluations unu adopted peer review approach that focuses n the quality of research outcomes rtcs record and report to the boards and unu counci l the quantities measured as the numbers of academic outcomes which were found adeq uate however there is need to review other elements of project implementation pri or to their closure programme project monitoring committees could perform these p ostimplementation reviews april 2007

nt at research and training centres rtcs for this purpose oios visited two institut of unu namely the world institute for development economics research unuwider helsink i finland and the institute for new technologies unuintech renamed unumerit i n 2005 maastricht the netherlands the audit was conducted in accordance with the international standards for the professional practice of internal auditing 2 unu evolved over the past three decades from its in itial three programmes to global network of 12 research and training centres and pro grammes rtcps most of them had been initiated subsequent to 1985 when wider was establ ished as unus first fullfledged rtc wider provides original analyses of emerging topics and offers policy advice aimed at the sustainable economic and social development of the poorest nations the work of the institute is focused on four themes i the millennium deve lopment goals ii poverty inequality and human development iii globalization finance and growth and iv new initiatives in development economics 3 unumerit develops insights into the emergence spr ead and impacts of new technologies especially in developing countries t he work of the institute is focused on three topics i global governance of innovation ii designing the knowledge economy and iii innovation for development 4 from 2000 to 2005 unuwider received income totall ing us21 million and unu merit us15 million the board of audit conducted f inancial audits at the institutes in 2006 5 most of the findings and recommendations contained in this report have been discussed with the directors during the exit conferences held on 13 october 2006 at unuwider and on 15 december 2006 at unumerit ii audit objectives 6 the main objective of the audit was to evaluate the adequacy of programme and project management at rtcs in particular the audit examin ed establishment and structures for programme and proj ect management at rtcs alignment of programmes and projects with mandates purposes goals and strategic objectives adequacy of programme and project oversight and man agement funding policies and adequacy of programme and proj ect planning monitoring and review of programme and project perf ormance unus approach to assessing programme and project utcomes 2 iii audit scope and methodology 7 the audit included analysis of programme and projec t management practices with focus on management processes and administrative and info rmation systems the alignment of programmes and projects with mandates purposes go als and strategic objectives was reviewed in relation to the unu system as whole statutory requirements of unu and those specific to rtcs were considered when assessing establishments structures and processes as well as approaches to funding and programme and project man agement in addition the audit considered unus overall approach in assessing prog ramme and project outcomes 8 the audit activities included review and assessme nt of systems interviews with staff analysis of applicable data and review of the ava ilable documents and other relevant records related to programme and project management in par ticular the audit reviewed information on the programme and project portfolios of unuwider nd unumerit in 2006 iv audit findings and recommendations establishments 9 the rtcps are concerned with research andor advan ced training and knowledge transfer and management they focus on specific est ablished or emerging global issues and although they are usually located in one given coun try they operate internationally as opposed to associated or cooperating institutions they are integral parts of the unu system their creation and their incorporation to the unive rsity is the decision of the unu council in accordance with the terms of article iv paragraph 4 c of the unu charter to qualify as an rtc funding must be of secure nature as provided for by the endowment fund approach 10 the unu council decided to establish unuwider in h elsinki finland as rtc in 1985 unuintech was established in 1989 in maastri cht the netherlands in 2005 pursuant to cooperation agreement to integrate ac tivities of unuintech with i the maastricht economic research institute on innovatio n and technology of the faculty of economic and business administration of the univers iteit maastricht the um and ii the foundation maastricht economic research institute n innovation and technology the foundation it was decided to rename the institut unumerit the institute is under the authority of the director of unuintech who is res ponsible for integrating the activities of the entities 11 good progress had been made to integrate staffing r esources to achieve this and with the exception of the editor communications coordina tors contract all fixedterm contracts of general service staff employed by ununtech were t renewed when they expired but instead the staff were reemployed by the um acc ordingly additional provisions were included in the institutes statute to guide the co nduct of the aforementioned staff and other staff of the um who are made available to unume rit 12 the 20062007 biennium academic programme and budge t of unuintech now unumerit do not include the activities of the fo undation andor those of the um the legal contractual and accountability arrangements are not in place as yet to integrate project 3 activities project portfolios of the foundation and the um include total of 90 projects some of which are regulated by contractual agreeme nts with donors which is substantially more than unumerits portfolio of 10 projects the institute faces complex task to integrate project and related financial activities and oios is of the opinion that legal expert and the director administration and finance of unu should assist the institute in the integration 13 unu replied that for the foreseeable future there will be two separ ate financial streams at unumerit one for the unu and one for t he foundation accordingly there is intention as this time to pursue complete inte gration of projects this would not prevent further integration of research context between unu merit and the foundation merit as foreseen in the unumerit strategic plan to oios recommendation to engage legal expert unu sees need to engage legal expert t this time the questions at hand are of practical or academic nature and could not be dealt with by legal expert nor should they be dealt with at the level of the director of administ ration the unus legal adviser has already been involved in the discussions in maastricht on t his matter and he will continue to be available should there be need for such advice on the overall integration of academic activities within unumerit oios will followup on the progress of the integr ation b statutory requirementsprogramme management statutory provisions 14 the institutes are governed by similar statutes tha t include articles concerning the i legal status structure and location ii purpose and activities iii academic freedom and autonomy iv board v director of the institute vi personnel fellows and trainees of the institute vii finance and budget viii publica tions ix relationships with other organizations x review xi amendments xii d issolution and xiii transitional provisions the institutes operate within spirit of autonomy academic freedom and freedom of expression in principle they decide freely on the use of financial resources allocated for the execution of their work 15 the unu council governs the activities and operatio ns of unu and performs oversight approval reviewing and reporting functions the in stitutes boards established by the unu council facilitate the review of the programmatic and technical details of the work of their institutes in an advisory capacity the conference of directors of research and training centres and programmes condir is called by the re ctor periodically to review and evaluate programmes of research being undertaken nd advise and assist the rector to improve current programmes and in the definition an d planning of new programmes for the unu system b programme and project cycle management 16 although the statutes do not explicitly refer to pr ogramme and project management an analysis of the articles containing the responsibil ities of the directors the boards the unu condir rector and council show that the statutory requirements cover all those functions required within programme cycle ie planning pproval implementation monitoring and review as well as reporting this cycle could be re flected as per the diagram below the statutes further require regular evaluations of pro grammes of which the results are reported to the unu council 4 17 the institutes follow similar procedures and guidel ines to meet the statutory requirements details of selected projects are incl uded in the academic programmes and budgets submitted to the unu council for approval although it is programme of work it contains substantial information on the individual projects under specific programme some information such as the cost of the projects and i ndividual project deliverables are not indicated but it is available in the project summ aries that had been prepared prior to finalizing the programme of work therefore they re substantially different from the scenario where only the programmes are reviewed adopted and approved and projects are internal arrangements thereby resulting in two cycles ie programme cycle and project cycle 18 single programme and project cycle simplifies p rogramme and project management significantly with reduced costs effort and time although already practised it should be formalized by extending the statutory requirements regarding the adoption and approval of programmes to include individual research projects recommendation head2right the unu should consider extending the programme for malities stipulated in the statutes of rtcs to include proj ects thereby allowing single programme and project cycle rec 01 unu accepted the recommendation unu believes that the programme and project cycles are already well integrated this will be formalized at the time of issuing the programme management manual and guidelines as suggested and w ill be issued by the unu centre by 30 september 2008 oios will record this recommendation as implemente d upon receipt of copy of the programme management manual and guideli nes 5 c structure and staffing 19 directors are the chief academic and administrative officers of their institutes and have overall responsibility for the direction organizat ion administration and programmes in accordance with the general policies and criteria f ormulated by the boards these provisions underline the principle of autonomy of the instit utes in practice the boards act in an advisory capacity and policies and criteria are for mulated at the unu centre and applicable throughout unu 20 organizational charts present the structures of the institutes and the delegations of authorities are those required by the financial regulations and rules regarding certifying officers approving officers and bank signatories both institutes have structures that are divided between administrative and program services and research and training activities 21 the 20062007 staffing tables of the institutes pro vide for 24 and 30 posts respectively for unuwider and unumerit at the dates of the au dits only two research positions that of principle research fellow and research f ellow were vacant at unuwider but 15 of the 30 positions 22 funded were vacant at u numerit as regards programme services unuwiders staffing table provides for senior programme assistant g7 and 3 project assistants g6 and 2 g5s who support t he chief administrative and programme services officer l4 unumerits staffing table does not provide for any programme assistant posts to support the chief administrativ and programme services officer l3 given the need to enhance programme and project mon itoring unumerit should consider engaging at least one programme assistant recommendation head2right the unumerit should consider engaging at least one programme assistant to support the programme servic function rec 02 unu accepted the recommendation unu is of the view that the primary concern related to the integration of research activities of unuintec h and foundation merit into unu merit has been to achieve research synergies and to reduce administrative overheads attention will be given in the preparation of the s taffing table for unumerit for inclusion in the 20082009 academic programme and budget of unu of post for programme assistant to support the administrative and programme service s functions of unumerit or for this function to be dealt with in another manner the re ctor wishes to leave this matter in the hands of the director of unumerit decision on w hether to include such new post in the budget or to deal with it in another manner will be made by 31 august 2007 oios will record this recommendation as implemented upon receipt of copy on the decision by the unu merit on this matter d mandates purposes and goals 22 unus mandate is to devote its work to research in to the pressing global problems of human survival development and welfare that are th concern of the and its agencies 23 the purposes of the institutes are indicated in the ir respective statutes the purpose of unuwider is to help identify and meet the need for policyoriented socioeconomic research on pressing global and development problem s common domestic problems and their interrelationships b to analyze the problems of the world economy including structural issues and assist in producing new responses to exi sting and future problems and c encourage 6 research advanced training and the dissemination f knowledge and help promote the search for new modes of international economic cooperatio n and management 24 recent brochure better describes the mandatepurp ose of unuwider as to undertake research and policy analysis on structura l changes affecting the living conditions of the worlds poorest people b to provide forum f or professional interaction and for the advocacy of policies for robust equitable genderb alanced and environmentally sustainable growth and c to promote capacity building and tra ining for scholars and policy makers in economic and social development 25 the primary purpose of unumerit according to its statute is to undertake research advanced training dissemination and advisory servi ces on selected new technologies within the overall university programme particularly in re lation to developing countries unu merit has more focused description than that of u nuwider documentation and websites describe missions mandates and goals of t he institutes but remain broad and rather lengthy descriptions given the project portfolio s and size of the institutes their missions purposes and goals could be more focused on the pro grammes of work of the institutes especially those in which the institutes have com parative advantage this would make the institutes goals and objectives more specific agai nst which achievements could be measured recommendation head2right oios recommended that the unu should consider more specific goals and objectives for its rtcs that are better aligned with their sizes and programme activities focusing on their comparative advantages and against which achi evements could be measured rec03 unu accepted the recommendation unu believes that more specific goals and objecti ves of individual rtcs could be included in their strategi c plans which are to be submitted to their advisory boards there is however danger that t oo detailed specification of goals and objectives could undermine the dynamics and flexibi lity needed in research community oios will record this recommendation as implemented upon receipt of the strategic plans showing more specific goals and objectives funding 26 both the institutes receive three categories of inc ome interest income derived from the endowment fund b operating contributions fro m the host country and c specific programme contributions spc the rtcs are apporti oned endowment fund income based on their respective contributions to the fund wher eas unu programmes rtps are funded from operating contributions and spc only to quali fy as rtc funding must be of greater and more secure nature and sufficient for core acti vities including staff costs therefore unu finds the endowment fund approach to be critical fo r rtcs 27 the graphs below indicate the source of income of u nuwider and unumerit since the 20002001 biennium but estimated for the 20062007 biennium 7 28 funding remained stable for both the institutes wi th the exception of the estimated operating contributions for unumerit for the curre nt biennium from 2000 to 2005 unu wider received income totaling 21 million and unu merit 15 million the ratios in percentage in which the categories interest incom from the endowment fund operating contributions and spc of incomes were received wer 70 20 10 for unuwider and 40 40 20 for unumerit both institutes benefited fro m funding from their host countries income from the endowment fund and operating contr ibutions totaled 90 per cent for unu wider and 80 per cent for unumerit but unuwider benefited substantially more from income from the endowment fund which was 70 p er cent 40 per cent for unu merit of its total income therefore unuwider s more secure source of income and greater degree of permanence stability and auton omy 29 spc funding is intended to support academic activit ies over and above planned activities financed from core income spc funding increased si nce 2000 and in the 20042005 biennium both institutes received more than double the amoun t of the previous biennium this category of income is becoming more important and for some r tcs crucial merit did well to raise funds locally but welldefined fund raising stra tegy for unu as whole is needed 30 at the councils fiftysecond session the unu pres ented discussion paper towards unuwide fundraising strategy that sets out the main elements required to finalize fund raising plan and strategy for unu as whole unu d eveloped strategy in 2005 that includes the implementation of fundraising programme acc ording to progress report in 2006 such fundraising programme had not been established s yet and there were key steps such as needs assessment that were required before fund raising plan could be developed oios took note of the developments and encourages unu to fina lize its fundraising plan and to establish the fundraising programme f strategies 31 unu developed its first strategic plan in 2000 rev ised it in 2002 2004 and 2006 the current strategic plan entitled unu strategic direc tions 20072010 was approved by the unu council at its 53rd session in november 2006 insti tutes also developed their own plans in particular unuwiders strategic directions still in draft address some main concerns or questions directed towards the unu in prior evaluat ions namely that of linking to the system and the donor community networking developm ent researchers transferring 8 knowledge to build the capacities of developing cou ntry researchers and disseminating and publicizing research findings unumerits current strategic priorities focus on the integration efforts of the institute its research programme and international linkages and networking 32 it is difficult to determine the impact of institut strategic initiatives for the unu as whole and there is always the risk of duplicating fforts if they are not sufficiently coordinated and results are not assessed institutes have limit ed resources to engage in programme activities other than research projects such as networking c apacity building linking to the system and achieving wide goals ie the millennium velopment goals currently both unu wider and unumerit have number of initiatives li nking their programmes with the system and are actively networking researchers it may be worthwhile to consider having separate function to coordinate these activities be tween the unu centre and the institutes oios recommended that the unu consider establishing separate function to coordinate strategic direction activities of the unu centre an d those of the institutes to avoid overlaps and duplications and to make the best use of resour ces unu mentioned the continuing role of the condir and the responsibility of the unu centre to link up with the different parts of the system and to report regularly to different foca l points within the system on system wide grants and initiatives strategic direction activities however do not mee t the requirements of project and therefore it should b considered as general programme activity 33 unu centre further explained that it continues to p lay coordinating role as set out in the unu charter the rectors office is at the cent re of such efforts the condir meetings in the spring of each year also play crucial role in ensuring that there are minimal overlaps and duplication of effort in fact the unu centre has clearly identified focal points at the rtcps for administrative matters communications nd programme management unu believes strongly that it would be waste of limit ed resources to establish new unit or separate function the unu agrees however that if additional resources can be mobilized for the 20082009 biennium specific attention will be given to strengthening the staffing component of the rectors office which has this ta sk as part of its responsibilities oios accepts this clarification and urges unu to strengt hen this coordination function g programme and project cycle and fbpms 34 the programme and project cycle is not documented but the rtcs follow similar procedures with the diagram below oios presents t he programme and project cycle if the current practices procedures statutory responsibi lities and recommendations contained in this report are considered 9 35 expenditures are recorded in the financial budgeta ry and personnel management system fbpms the system does not include proje ct management module the unu undertook to introduce new accounting system by 2 009 that will include project management component to facilitate the implementati on of academic activities when developing the component it is suggested that the unu consider the internal processes as above and the system should provide the outputs req uired to comply with the statutory responsibilities ie project selection project d ocuments and programme development programme of work updates during implementation and monitoring project summaries workplans monitoring tables and minutes of project monitoring committee meetings and reporting reports to boards council reviews and evaluations considering the extent of activities at rtcs it is also suggested that the sy stem should not be complex recommendation head2right the unu should consider the following internal proc esses and outputs when developing programme management comp onent to be included in the new accounting system i pr oject selection project documents and programme development prog ramme of work ii updates during implementation and mo nitoring project summaries workplans monitoring tables an d minutes of project monitoring committee meetings and iii re porting reports to boards council reviews and evaluation s rec 04 unu accepted the recommendation the director of administration and the executive of ficer office of the rector are continuing discussions in ternally and externally on the new finance and accounting system that is to be introduced in 2 009 small working group is being established which will include programme managers nd assistants from selected rtcps as 10 members the working group will study the specific needs for programme management component to be included in the new system unu agr ees to continue these efforts and to include programme management component that addre sses the areas identified in this recommendation during 2008 so that the new system c an be deployed in 2009 oios will record this recommendation as implemented upon conf irmation that the programme management component has been integrated in the new accounting and financial system h guidance and standards 36 unu does not have comprehensive programme and pro ject manual andor management instructions to guide programme and project manager s there are guidelines for budget preparation and project proposals but there is n eed for more comprehensive set of documents andor manual andor management instructi ons that i define the programmeproject cycle and project mainly resea rch projects ii prescribe the procedures to follow and working tools to use when formulating projects iii indicating the criteria when selecting projects iv stipulate the costing poli cy v prescribe the method of project monitoring the procedures to follow and the timing thereof and vi prescribe reporting methods and formats there are practices and tools but they are not necessarily the same for the rtcs recommendation head2right the unu should introduce manual andor management instructions to guide rtcs in programme and project management that i define the programmeproject c ycle and project mainly research projects ii prescribe the procedures to follow and working tools to use when formulating projects iii sets the criteria when selecting projects i v stipulate the costing policy v prescribe the method of project monitoring the procedures to follow and the timing thereof an d vi prescribe reporting methods and formats rec 05 unu accepted the recommendation the unu centre will develop from existing instruct ions and guidelines and best practice within the unu sys tem programme management manual for issuance throughout unu the draft manual will be circulated within the unu system for comment and improvement an agenda item on the draf t manual will be included for the condir meeting to be held in spring 2008 the recto r will promulgate the manual later than 30 september 2008 oios will record this recommendation as implement ed upon receipt of the programme management manual i programme planning budgets 37 for the current biennium and as per the chart below it is estimated that specificfunded activities will comprise 20 per cent of widers and 40 per cent of merits expenditures 11 38 estimated expenditure for 2006 2007 amount to 8 million and 98 million for unu wider and unumerit respectively the percentage of personnel costs 53 and 47 and general expenses 10 and 8 in relation to the esti mated total expenditures are almost the same for unuwider and unumerit but the estimated core funded activity expenditures of unuwider 16 per cent is four times more than tha t of unumerit 4 per cent with the estimated expenditures of specificfunded activitie s of unumerit 41 per cent double that of unuwider 21 per cent the estimated expenditu res in specific funded activities of unumerit are ten times more than that of its core funded activities while unuwiders is less than double unuwider is therefore in be tter position to plan activities and formulate projects with certainty nevertheless bo th institutes properly prepare their programmes of work and submissions to boards and t he unu council and include sufficient information on projects and other programme activit ies b project selection 39 project selection is probably the most important ac tivity in the planning phase the institutes follow different approaches because they have different strategies unuwider places strong emphasis on external proposals where as unumerit endeavours to build capacity within and therefore relying more on inte rnal proposals within its five research areas 40 the process at unuwider is proactive one whereby external and internal proposals are invited focusing on issues in which the instit ute has comparative advantage in comparison to other institutes internal research m eetings follow to narrow down the list of potential topics often starting with more than 40 to produce list of 10 to 20 projects for the boards consideration ultimately the board may lect up to 10 of these attaching various levels of priority to them with the annual unu cou ncil giving final approval and funding once the programme has begun additional projects m ay be added to provide flexibility if new opportunities arise about dozen projects are fin ally undertaken during each biennium for the 20062007 biennium the research programme pres ents 13 research projects grouped into three thematic areas each of which falls within th overall unu thematic area of globalization social and human development 41 at unumerit the project proposals and selection p rocedures are carried out inhouse within each of the five broad research areas and th project selection is based on finding balance between core funding and external funds th project portfolio includes 10 projects although separate entities at this point in time t he integration of activities of um and the foundation under unumerit would increase the pro ject portfolio substantially the current project portfolio of um and the foundati on include some 90 projects ranging 12 from projects with budgets of less than 10000 to budgets above 300000 for the moment it is not possible to include them in unumerits proj ect portfolio because the contractual andor funding arrangements are between the donor nd either um or the foundation the accountability arrangements are also not in place t account for these projects at unumerit also they do not necessarily meet the seven select ion criteria of unu that focus on topics relevant to the objectives urgency and relevanc to the developing world recommendation head2right the unumerit should not include the current projec ts of the um or the foundation in its project portfolio til the necessary contractual and accountability arrangemen ts are in place rec 06 unu accepted the recommendation for the reporting to the unumerit advisory board the institute will separate project documents indic ating the distinction between unu projects and those of foundationmerlt this recommendation will be implemented prior to the unu merit advisory board meeting scheduled on the 10 1 2 june 2007 oios will record this recommendation as implemented upon receipt of cop of document on the contractual and accountability arrangements 42 the selection criteria of unu are programme and res earch priorities for unu as whole these do not take financial criteria compar ative advantages or the human resources available into consideration for example the mini mum amount for research project should be set to avoid too many small projects an assessm ent of comparative advantages would allow rtcs to focus on issues in which they would do bett er than other research institutes and to avoid duplication of efforts resources are the mos t important element but what may not be feasible for one may be feasible for another rtc i t is therefore important to have set of criteria that is applicable for the unu as whole and separate set for each of the rtcs directors would need this information to facilitate coordination avoid duplication and to support their fund raising efforts 43 oios recommended that the unu and each of its rtcs formalise its project selection criteria that should take into account i the com parative advantages ii the minimum amount budget of project iii any time limitation to the implementation period and iv financial and technical resources available unu commented that the criteria for selection of u projects are spelt out clearly in the unu strategic directions 20072010 documents unu believes that the proposed programme management man ual will also give an indication of expected minimum project budgets which would of ne cessity vary from institute to institute depending on their geographic location the time l imitations for implementation and the technical and financial resources available such d etails should however be included in individual project documents and monitored accordin gly there is need for such matters to be included in separate project selection criteria oios will follow up on the implementation of the recommendation in its review of the proposed programme management manual c programme and project costing 44 the academic programme and budget submissions are q uite detailed especially the information on the programme areas and planned proj ects staff costs are not allocated to each of the programme areas andor projects they are tr eated as core and therefore allocated to the area of work ie academic activity academic services and administrative and administration this treatment of staff costs supp orts the funding arrangements where endowment income and operating contributions are us ed to fund personnel costs operating 13 expenses and core programme activities specific contributions fund the remainder of the programme activities such as travel meetings and the cost of researchers that are not staff members the negative effect of this treatment is t hat the total cost of programme and its underlying projects are substantially understated 45 for monitoring and reporting purposes the personne l cost of all researchers staff or contracted should be allocated to the individual p rojects time recording system is in place at the um and the foundation and could be dupli cated for other rtcs recommendation head2right the unu should allocate the staff cost of researche rs to individual projects time recording system is in place at the um and the foundation and could be duplicated fo r other rtcps rec 07 unu accepted the recommendation the unu centre will include in the guidelines for preparation of the 20082009 biennium academic prog ramme and budget reference to the need to include an allocation of the projected cost of researchers to individual projects towards this end the unu centre will review the recording system in place at um and the foundation to see if it would be possible to implement its use at other rtcps the unu believes however that given the variability of im plementation of projects it would be more useful in many cases to calculateestimate the staf fing costs involved in the implementation of the project at the conclusion of the project this would also take into account that at different rtcps and at the unu centre researchersacademic officers are implementing number of different projects during any given period such an approach might also be less bureaucratic and more efficient use of researchers time and ttention the unu will implement the recommendation by 30 september 2008 oios will record this recommendation as implemented upon receipt of copy of the guideline s for the preparation of the 2008 2009 academic programme and budget guidelines j programme and project implementation research 46 the institutes make great efforts to ensure that th ey engage the best researchers wider engage lot of external researchers through com missioning of research papers method the average number of researchers had been around 1 0 but more than 100 had been involved in one single project and approximately 500 contrac ts for research papers are issued each biennium the methodology as applied by wider is based on the number of researchers engaged in project workload and output approac h the fees had been determined and documented an established researcher would be paid 5000 per paper and if more than one author the amount is distributed pro rata this thodology is good example of how the institutes find methodologies to implement known pr actices of rtcs oios found this methodology to be costeffective because the fees re directly related to workload and output but the practice and methodology is not formalised for unu 47 merit also engages substantial number of external researchers but more through consultant contracts some for periods of more than two years and rates are based on past similar engagements these rates ranged from 1000 to 10000 per month although the use of consultants through consultancy contracts had be formalized within the unu oios found the general conditions and procedures to be c lose to those applicable to the system 14 but not to adequately reflect the needs of resear ch institution policies for the engagement of researchers could be formalized better for the unu selection processes terms and conditions and rates should be standardized and determined to relate better to the work of research institutions recommendation head2right the unu should formalize its policies for the engag ement of researchers to relate more closely to the work of r esearch institutions taking into account i the methods that could be used to engage researchers for example consultanc contracts and commissioning of research papers ii the sel ection process that should be followed ii the terms and conditi ons iii the approval procedures and iv the maximum amount to be paid rec 08 unu accepted the recommendation the unu centre will gather information on the curre nt practices at the unu centre and rtcps and will iss ue guidelines on the different methods to be used in engaging researchers how the selection of researchers should be undertaken the formulation of terms and conditions for contracts approval procedures and norms in relation to the fee structures for contracts unu agrees to implement the recommendation later than 30 september 2008 oios will record this recommendation as implemente d upon receipt of the guidelines on the engagement of researchers b best practice 48 oios found number of good practices at the instit utes of which the related procedures could be standardized throughout the unu these inc lude methods and procedures in the call for papers procedure the method of commissioning research papers the publication of project papers refereeing policy briefs launching of res earch findings conferences and project meetings it may be worthwhile for programme servic at rtcs to communicate these best practices and related procedures with the unu centr where it could be formulated in guidelines and then distributed to other rtcs recommendation head2right the unu should identify best practices at rtcs that could be applied throughout the unu system such as the cal l for papers procedure method of commissioning research papers the publication of project papers refereeing poli cy briefs launching of research findings and conferences it is suggested that the unu centre identify focal point at the c for this purpose and request rtcs to share any possible best practices with the focal point the focal point could formula the best practices in guidelines and distribute them to all rtcs rec 09 49 unu accepted the recommendation the unu centre will identify best practice within the unu system relating to programme and project im plementation and will summarize this information for distribution to all parts of the u system the focal point for this initiative will be the executive officer office of the rector the recommendation will be implemented later than 31 december 2008 oios will record this recommendation as implemente d upon receipt of confirmation that the summarized best practices were distributed to all of the unu system 15 c administrative and programme services 50 in unus efforts to standardise not only procedures related to programme but also administrative and financial procedures it is furt her suggested that the chief administrative and programme services of rtcs should meet more reg ularly at least once per biennium under the leadership of the director administratio n and finance such an administrative and programme services meeting could provide the forum for sharing best practices and related procedures improving internal communications and s treamlining procedures the meeting could coincide with the annual condir meeting recommendation head2right the unu should consider an administrative and progr amme services meeting to provide forum for the chiefs administrative and programme services under the adership of the director administration and finance to inter alia share best practices improve internal communications and stre amline procedures within administrations and programme ser vices rec 10 51 unu accepted the recommendation the unu will convene meeting of administrative and programme services personnel to share best prac tices improve internal communications and streamline procedures and practices given the high cost of bringing such personnel together unu will also give active consideration t the use of videoconferencing this would be more functional approach than oneoff or onc biennium meeting and will likely enhance the sustainability of such information shar ing and communication the recommendation will be implemented by 31 december 2 008 oios will record this recommendation as implemented upon confirmation tha t the best practices have been communicated to the administrative and programme rvices in all the rtcs d project documentation 52 the project cycle commence with project ideaprop osal called the project summary that is also the project document there is good guideline for the preparation of the project summary called guidelines for the preparation of p roject proposals which is also template it contains sufficient detail for project monitorin g and reporting and provides living document during implementation some documents were not regularly updated and not all elements were completed especially those relating to accomplishments oios recommended that the rtcs ensure that researchers regularly upd ate project summaries the summaries should then be reviewed during project monitoring m eetings unu believes that this is not major problem at present but will make every effor t to have researchers update project summaries on timely basis this recommendation wi ll be implemented by 31 december 2007 oios requests confirmation that researchers have be officially informed that the project summaries be updated on regular basis k programme and project monitoring and reporting programme and project monitoring 53 programme and project implementation is not central ly monitored by unu the institutes monitor implementation internally throug h meetings and discussions at unu16 wider progress meetings are more formal and freque nt than at unumerit which does not have senior programme assistant to maintain monit oring tables and workplans for the institute as whole these internal meetings are v aluable and the composition the timing thereof monitoring tools and reporting procedures should be standardised and formalised it is suggested that i the meetings be called programm eproject monitoring committee meetings ii the composition of the committee be determined by directors but at least include the chief administrative and programme services and p rogramme assistant iii the committee should meet at least twice per year that could be prior to board unu council and condir meetings iv project monitoring tables and workpl ans unuwiders could be used as an example as well as project summaries should be rev iewed by the committee and v the outcomes should be reported in the minutes of the m eetings recommendations head2right the unu should consider internal programmeproject monitoring committees at rtcs under the leadership of the directors to monitor programmeproject implementat ion the members should include staff member from the admi nistrative and programme services rec 11 unu accepted the recommendation unuwider already has such programmeproject monitoring committee unumerit has senior progra mme leaders meeting both committees involve administrativeprogramme managem ent personnel the unu centre will study how relevant this would be for other rtcps nd will issue guideline concerning the desirability of such committees it should be noted however that this would not be necessary per at many of the other rtcps which are consid erably smaller in size of programme activities and staffing than unuwider and unumeri t the recommendation will be implemented by 31 december 2007 oios will record this recommendation as implemente d upon receipt of the unu study on programmeproject monitoring committees at rtcs recommendations head2right the unu should consider introducing project monitor ing tables and workplans widers could be used as an xample to monitor programme and project implementation th workplans should cover the programme and project ac tivities of an rtc as whole rec 12 unu accepted the recommendation the unu centre and most rtcps make use of monitoring table and workplans similar to that of u nuwider the use of such tools in programme management will be included within the pr ogramme management manual the recommendation will be implemented by 30 september 2008 oios will record this recommendation as implemented upon receipt of cop of the programme management manual b reporting 54 the statutory responsibilities of the boards the u nu condir and council are comprehensive and unu places strong emphasis and re liance on their roles and functions as regards programme approval and the reviewing thereo f oios found the reporting requirements comprehensive and the reports prepared by the institutes impressive they were found to be adequate for internal and external repo rting should there be any reporting 17 forthcoming from the programmeproject monitoring c ommittee meetings apart from the minutes of the meeting they could be kept in the f ormats as presented to the boards and the unu council project summaries financial and techn ical reports l postimplementation reviews and evaluations 55 unu adopted peer review approach that focuses n the quality of research outcomes the quantities measured as the numbers of academic outcomes are recorded by the institutes and reported to the boards and unu council these w ere found adequate to assess the quality and quantity of research outcomes but there is n eed to review other elements of project implementation prior to their closure these would include comparison of budgeted and actual costs in relation to the project outcomes t he impact of the project timing and the effectiveness of the implementing methodology used for example the selection criteria for the project and researchers it is suggested that the programmeproject monitoring committees perform these postimplementation reviews recommendation head2right the unu should consider postimplementation reviews at the closure of project in addition to the peer revi ews to assess the costeffectiveness impact and timing of the pr oject as well as the effectiveness of the implementing methodology u sed for example the selection criteria for the project and researchers the programmeproject monitoring committees could p erform these postimplementation reviews rec 13 56 unu accepted the recommendation the unu centre has prepared an end project report which would achieve the purposes set out in this recommendation as part of the overall guidelines and procedures for programme man agement the unu centre will include the requirement that such an end project report f or all projects be submitted to the advisory boardscommittees and ultimately to the rector the unu agrees that the programmeproject monitoring committees could play an important role in the preparation of such end project reviews this recommendation will be implemented by 31 december 2007 oios will record this recommendation as implemented upon receipt of copy of the guidelines and procedures for programme management v further actions required on
