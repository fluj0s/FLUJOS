industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31676middle east oil disruption potential severity and policy options summary military action in iraq disrupted the worlds crude oil supplies but sufficient world supply was available during the disr uption to keep the resulting price spikes within tolerable levels with the elimination of the regime of saddam hussein the resumption of iraqi oil exports seems near world oil prices have fallen and adequate supplies from other exporters are availabl to satisfy nearterm demand which is entering the seasonally slack spring period until they halted in midmar ch 2003 iraqs petroleum exports recently averaged about 15 million barrels per day mbd significantly less than the 37 mbd lost to world markets during the gulf crisis in 1991 consequently price and supply impacts of the recent interruption were less severe and other exporting nations were able and willing to increase crude oil suppl during the disruption the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec hol der of nearly all of the worlds spare production capacity equal to about three times iraqs exports in 2002 filled the supply gap opec administers set of production quotas for its members attempting to maintain prices in rang of 22 to 28 per barrel production by the opec10 excluding iraq increased as quotas were raised in th face of prices exceeding 30 they briefly peaked at 40 the high pri ces resulted from added factors outside the persian gulf including an oil workers strike in venezuela with venezuela producing at about half its prestrike level and iraqs exports halted other opec producers were able to keep world pr oduction constant howe ver little reserve margin remains and prices ve been slow to fall into opecs target price range this relatively benign oil disruption s cenario took place because the conflict in iraq did not impact other persian gulf producers had the conflict involved other producing nations or transpor t routes serving them much larger oil market impacts would have resulted with only iraqi produ ction affected crude oil prices spiked briefly above 30 per barrel and average us gasoline prices rose by 31 cents per gallon

policy options overview military action in iraq raised concerns about disruption of the worlds crude oil supplies the magnitude and duration of that disruption were key considerations in formulating us energy policy response but the quantity of oil supply lost during the most recent iraq conflict has been much smaller than during the 19901991 gulf crisis which also included lost supply from kuwait during that conflict oil prices rose sharply but the price spike lasted onl few months prices quickly returned to precrisis levels after the fall of saddam hussein it appears as if this pattern was replayed as prices briefly spiked at 40 per barrel early in the conflict and then quickly wound down into the 20s in recent years iraq has exported crude oil intermittently under resolution 986 often called the oilforfood program fr equent disagreements with the united nations have resulted in iraqs exports averaging less than 15 mbd during the past year about half the countrys potential therefore the march 2003 disruption of iraqs exports involved much less oil than decade ago so dir ect price and supply impacts were less severe in addition to the relatively small loss as result of the conflict which did not spread beyond iraq other exporting nati ons increased crude supply to the world market the organization of petroleum expor ting countries opec has most of the worlds spare production capacity equal to about three times iraqs average exports in 2002 during most of 2002 and all of 2003 opec nations produced in excess of their cartel quotas more than making up fo r iraqs

iraq has great potential as an oil producer its current amount of proven reserves coul d support further oilfield development given the availability of i nvestment and technology to greatly expand output and since there has been little exploration in iraq for many years it is believed that greater oil resources are potentially discovera ble were these resources to prove out iraq could potentially rival saudi arabia and russia as the worlds largest oil producer upsetting the balance of power in the petroleum geopolitical arena and potentially having profound impact on pricin g but

show prices in the lowto mid 30s some of this variation is thought to be related to supply and mand fundamentals another f actor that may have pushed prices higher the socalled war pre mium was thought to result from supply uncertainty surrounding the prewar political s ituation in iraq as described in the oil and gas journal inherent in the view that war premium which various analysts have pegged at ranges of anywhere from 24bbl to 69bbl exists is the corollary view that the likely quick end to usled military strike on iraq would spawn collapse in oil prices the precedent for this view is the 1991 desert storm campaign to oust iraqi forces from ku wait whose onset spawned historys biggest 1day drop in oil prices10httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31676crs8 estimates of war premium spanned

likelihood that his worstcase outcome would occur both analysts depicted most likely relatively benign scenario as well among its features were the cessation of iraqi oil production for 3 months followed by slow rampup to current levels other op ec producers making up the lost output and some panic buying at the start of hostilities causing shortlived price spike cordesman assigned 40 to 60 probability of this scenarios playing out regarding the most likely scenario whic h actually played out iraqi oil supply was the only oil lost to the world market and history provided guide to what could have been expected to happen to crude prices during the 199091 gulf crisis when both iraqi and kuwaiti exports were halted spotmarket prices briefly peaked at roughly 40 per barrel this reflected not only the soontobereplaced supply shortfall but the market psychology associated with the events while representing 41 increase from the december 2002 level the actual price spike as

administration announcement was calculated political gesture to affect price that the circumstances did not merit drawdown of spr oil and that adding crude to the market would do little to boost home

stabilizing influence senator murkowski then chairman of the senate energy committee issued press release on october 6 2000 underscoring the irony that oil from the us spr might relieve european

reduction in the tax to 43 beginning on october 1 2005 however as the debate continued it appeared that singling out one fuel for tax relief might introduce into the market fresh distortion affecting the relative prices of home heating oil and diesel fuel whether such measure would lead to smaller or larger price differential between the two fuels or whether some increment of the tax reduction

or about the fact that us dependence on imported oil exceeds 50 of consumption some policymakers argue that there should be ongoing effort s to boost domestic energy production high prices it can be argued will encourag additional domestic production but the course of oil prices over time is difficult to predict review of the path of oil prices since the oil embargo of 197374 suggests that unstable high prices have been episodic amidst such uncertainty it reporte dly has been difficult for the oil industry to commit to longterm investments in high ercost technologies at the same time there is little that the united states can do to appreciably reduce its dependence on imported petroleum proposals to boost domestic production ge nerally prompt comment from some policymakers that there are other initiatives conservation and alternative fuels that will achieve greater savings than the dditional production that would result from other policies the national energy plan released by the bush administration on may 16 2001 was criticized by some for appearing to be predisposed toward boosting production in preference to reducin g oil consumption chief among the proposals
