senate rules require majority of committee to be physically present in order to vote to report measure although smaller quorums are allowed for voting on amendments and for other committee business rule xxvi paragraph 7a1 and 7a3 if committee reports measure without majority quorum physically present senator may raise point of order on the floor against the measures consideration some committees allow vote to be held open for additional senators to vote but with presumption that these votes cannot change the outcome for more information on legislative process see httpwwwcrsgovproductsguides guidehomeshtml 1 absent senators may vote by proxy on reporting measure unless committee adopts rule to the contrary rule xxvi paragraphs 7a3 and 7c1 however proxy votes may not affect the outcome of vote to report measure from committee further senator voting by proxy must be informed of the matter to be decided and must request to vote by proxy some committees allow oral as well as written proxies g10g152g160g561g157g152g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g138g561g15g142g138g156g158g155g142g561 according to senate rule xxvi paragraph 10b it is the duty of the committee chair to report or cause to be reported promptly to the senate any measure approved by the committee the rule also provides means for majority of committee to force report on an approved measure to be filed but such action is rare the rule does not apply to the appropriations committee the action taken by the committee appears on the reported copy of the bill and written report generally accompanies the bill committee may report measure favorably unfavorably or without recommendation favorable report signifies that committee wishes to see further action on the measure an unfavorable report signifies the oppositethat the senate take further actionand committees usually accomplish the same aim by not reporting at all report without recommendation expresses the wish of the committee to allow the full senate to decide whether to approve measure reporting unfavorably or without recommendation is unusual but may occur when the committee is required to report by statutory rule or an instruction from the full senate g8g152g155g150g561g146g151g561g25g145g146g140g145g561g138g561g15g142g138g156g158g155g142g561g146g156g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g142g141g561 amendments adopted in markup are the committees recommendations and they are incorporated into measure only if approved by the full senate committee has several options for the form in which measure is ordered reported and the form affects how the senate will deal with amendments adopted in markup first committee may order measure reported with changes although committees seldom do so second committee may order measure reported with the amendments adopted in markup to various sections of the measure reporting with such series of cut and bite amendments is also not commonly done 1 this report was written by thomas p carr

one amendment in the nature of substitute in this case the committee would draft single amendment to strike out everything after the enacting clause of measure and to insert the text that resulted from the markup the text of this amendment in the nature of substitute may differ only slightly from the original text or be substantially or entirely different reporting committee amendment in the nature of substitute for an introduced measure would preserve the original number and sponsor of the measure fourth committee may order reported an orig inal bill that embodies text decided upon in markup senate committees are authorized to report original bills within their jurisdictions in addition to measures that have been introduced and referred to them this new bill is given its own number and it is usually reported by the committee chair on behalf of the committee reporting an original bill avoids separate floor votes on the changes adopted in markup it also protects the measure from possible point of order that the committee reported substantive amendment containing significant matter outside its jurisdiction rule xv paragraph 5 g25g155g146g157g157g142g151g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561 when committee reports measure it generally prepares an accompanying written report that describes the purposes and provisions of the measure written report however is not required under senate rules any senator is entitled to at least three days to prepare supplemental minority or additional views for inclusion in the committee report if the senator so requests when the measure is ordered reported rule xxvi paragraph 10c some committees routinely agree by unanimous consent to allow three days for senators to submit these views senate rules specify number of items to be included in any written reports some statutorily mandated and committee reports typically include other items as well see crs report 98305 senate committee reports
