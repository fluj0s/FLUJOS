target how do i find cell of terrorists that has connection to known strongselectors answer look for anomalous events eg someone whose language is out of place for the region they ar in someone who is using encryption someone searching the web for suspicious stuff jop secretcomintrel to usa aus can gbr nzl show all the encrypted word documents from iran show all pgp usage in iran once again data volume too high so forwarding these back is not possible strongselector can perform this kind of retrospective query then simply pull content of interest from site as required top secretcomintrel to usa aus can gbr nzl 1 show all the vpn startups in country x and give the data so i can decrypt and discover the users these events are easily browsable in x keys core strongselector xkeyscore extracts and stores authoring information for many major document types can perform retrospective survey to trace the document origin since metadata is typically kept for up to 30 days other system performs this on raw unselected bulk traffic data volumes prohibit forwarding top secretcomintrel to usa aus can gbr nzl traditionally triggered by strongselector event but it doesnt have to be this way reverse psc from anomalous event back to strong selector you cannot perform this kind of analysis when the data has first been strong selected tie in with marina allow psc collection after the event top secretcomintrel to usa aus can gbr nzl i my target speaks german but is in pakistan how can i find him xkeyscores hltp activity plugin extracts and stores all html language tags which can then be searched not possible in any other system but xkeyscore nor could it be volumes are too great to forward strongselector _top scretcomintrel to usa aus can gbr nzl my target uses google maps to scope target locations can i use this information to determine his email address what about the websearches do any stand out and look suspicious xkeyscore extracts and databases these events including all webbased searches which can be retrospectively queried strongselector data volume too high to forward top secret co mint rel to usa aus can gbr nzl i have jihadist document that has been passed
