discussion of select legislative proposals to increase the maximum award and the administrations budget request for fy2006 increasing the maximum pell award by 100 to 4150 would increase the estimated program costs by approximately 400 milli on for award year 20052006 if the maximum pell award were increas ed to 5800 the estimated amount of aid to students would increase by more than 58 over the estimated amount for maximum grant of 4050 to 202 billion in creasing the maximum pell award also increases the number of eligible particip ants both overall and among students in each dependency group closer examination of each dependency group reveals that an increase in the maximum award would change the repres entation of each dependency group within the population of pell grant recipients as the maximum pell award increases the percentage of dependent r ecipients and independent r ecipients without dependents increases slightly dependent recipients represent less than 40 of all recipients under current law the percentage woul d increase to an estimated 417 if the maximum award were increased to 5800 c onversely independent recipients with dependents would decrease from 418 to approximately 39 if the maximum award were increased to 5800 finally the analysis reveals that an increase in the appropriated maximum pell grant greatly increases the amount of the average pell

award introduction every year the maximum pell grant award is established during the appropriations process deba often ensues during this process about the feasibility of increasing the maximum pell award as families continue to confront rising college prices federal student aid in general and pell grants specifically become particularly important for n eedy students during the past few years there has been steady increase in college prices without comparable increase in income for low income families1 many researchers and policymakers maintain that the pell grant does not keep up with the increasing price of attending co llege or even with inflation it is estimated that the price of tuition f ees room and board has increased by approximately 500 per year since 20002001 to the present at fouryear public institutions whereas the maximum appropriated pell grant has increased by total of 300 since fy20012 in light of this many pr opose that the annual appropriation for the program should be increased at the same time there are perennial and possibly increasing constraints on the availa bility of funds to pay for large increases in pell grant appropriations policymakers continue to c ontend with the mounting pr essures of rising college prices and the adequacy of the pell grant award to offset these expenses however it is estimated that 100 increase in the maximum appropriated award increases the total costs of the program by as much as 400 million3 this report models different scenarios involving increases to the ma ximum pell award to examine the effects upon the number of recipients and the amount of student aid awarded specifically the following questions are examined how much would certain increases in the appropriated maximum pell grant costhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32923crs2 4 the most recent authorized fy2003 maxi mum pell award is 5800 and the appropriated maximum award for fy2005 is 4050does consistent pattern devel op eg an award increase of 100 raises program costs by 400 million what are the implications for the recipients eg independentstudents versus dependent stude nts family income below 10000 versus above 60000 how would the average pell grant award change under differentscenarios which group would benefit most from increasing the appropriated maximum pell grant during the reauthorization of the high er education act hea the congress is likely to debate what changes may be needed in the pell grant program it is expected that the answers that emerge from this analysis will help to inform the policymaking process this report provides brief backgr ound on the pell grant program and the related appropriations process the report also analyzes selected characteristics of pell recipients and the estimated impact upon these recipients and the costs of the program as the maximum appropriated award is increased this is followed by discussion of selected legislative proposal s to increase the maximum award and the administrations budget request for fy2006 background pell grants pell are the largest single source of federal grant aid to postsecondary students pell grants are n eedbased aid and are intended to function as the foundation of all student aid for n eedy undergraduate students pell grants are considered to be the foundation of st udent aid because othe r federal aid eg federal work study student loans is calcu lated after the amount of the pell award is determined the program provides several billion dolla rs annually to millions of undergraduate students the fy2005 appr opriation for pell is 123 billion and it is projected to provide grants to 53 million recipients each year during the appropriations proce ss significant debate occurs regarding the difference between the appropriated maximum pell award and the authorized maximum pell award4 and the ability of the grant to offset the price of attending college the authorized maximum pell award is the amount that is specified in the hea the appropriated ma ximum pell award is set in the annual appropriations legislation for the department of educa tion the appropriate d maximum pell award overrides the authorized maximum pell aw ard federal funding is appropriated annually to ensure that all eligible applicants who appl for federal aid and attend an eligible postsecondary institution receive pell grant because the program ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32923crs3 5 for additional information regarding federa l forwardfunded programs see crs report rl32303 appropriations for fy2005 labor hea lth and human services and education by paul m irwin 6 the office of management and budget midsession review economic assumptions are used in this version of the model 7 the pell award year 20052006 begins july 1 2005 and ends on june 30 2006forward funded5 if the costs of the pell grant program exceed the current fiscal years appropriation which is likely if the estimates are incorrect eg there is greater increase of eligible applicants th an expected or the appropriated amount is lower than what is needed to cover the estimated amount of student aid for particular award year the department of education ed is allowed to use appropriated monies from the next fiscal year to cover the costs of the current award year this process of ensuring that grant payments will be made irrespective of the amount of funds appropriated fo r particular fiscal year has led some to depict the program as quasi entitlement program the maximum pell grant that can be awarded is specified in the annual appropriations legislation fo r ed in addition the minimum pell grant that can be awarded currently 400 is specified in the program statute for additional information about the pell gran t program see crs report rl31668 federal pell grant program of the higher educati on act background and reauthorization data analysis the analyses presented in this report use estimated data derived by crs from the pell grant estimation model developed and maintained by the us department of educations budget service ed base s its budget requests on the results from this model the u2005b version of the mode l was used for the analyses presented6 the estimated costs and the number and characteristics of recipients included in this report are provided to suggest the relativ magnitude and nature of the impact of possible changes in the pell grant program the numbers and characteristics presented are not official program cost estimates the report utilizes pell data for award year 200520067 the family income categories used in the analyses presented were constructed based on income categories used by the national postsecondary student aid study npsas for studying federal student aid recipients by dependency status and family income and the pell estimation model npsas income categories were chosen because they separate recipients by pendency status depe ndent and independent recipients and because they closely pproximate the results produced by the pell model the format of the income groupi ngs generated by th pell estimation model is preestablished and as result c onstrains the possible income groupingshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32923crs4 8 for specific information regarding the exp ected family contribution calculation see http wwwifapedgovifapwebappcurrentefcinf ormationpagjsp in addition see crs report rl32083 federal student aid need nalysis background and selected simplification issues by adam stoll and james b stedmanfederal need analysis need analysis is complex system that is used to allocate billions of dollars of federal student aid under title iv of the hea it entails gathering financial data which is provided by the student via the free application for federal student aid fafsa using these data to calculate the expected family contribution efc and packaging of the applicants financial aid award by the higher education institutions financial aid administrator this section provides brie f description of the efc and how it is calculated it also discusses need analysis and its interaction with the pell grant this description is very generic for detailed informa tion regarding the efc calculation and the fafsa ed has posted descriptions for recent years8 expected family contribution the expected family contribution efc is the amount that the federal need analysis system determines family is expected to contribut toward postsecondary education expenses in calculating the efc consideration is given to available income and for some familie s available assets in addition living expenses retirement needs and federal and state tax liability are also considered the calculation of the efc varies pending upon the app licants dependency status there are three separate dependenc classifications for individual applicants dependent student independe nt student with dependent s and independent student without dependents this is important because parental financial information is not considered if the applicant meets the statutory definition of an independent student to be classified as statutorily independe nt title iv section 480d an applicant must meet one of the following conditions 24 years of age or older married enrolled in graduate or professional program have dependent other than spouse orphan or ward of the court or was up until age 18 or military veteran students who do not meet any of the aforem entioned conditions are considered to be dependent for the purposes of title iv student aid the amount of federal student aid aw arded is primarily dependent upon students efc and the cost of attendance coa of the postsecondary institution that the student chooses to attend this is true for all federal student aid programs except for the pell grant program to be disc ussed the coa is measure of ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32923crs5 9 it can also include an allowance for dependent care expenses for students with dependents costs associated with study ab road programs for students engaged in such programs expenses associated with disability for students with disabilities and the costs associated with employment under cooperative education program 10 the hea prohibits the pell grant from exce eding the difference between the coa and the efc this precludes the awarding of pe ll grant in excess of what student might need to cover coa after taking efc into account 11 as implemented by ed tuition sensitivity reduces the pell grant received by small number of the poorest students attending institutions with very low tuition charges for fy2005 the only students whose pell grant may possibly be reduced under tuition sensitivity are those students whose tuition charges and any allowances for dependent care or disability related expenses are less than 675 whose efcs are 700 or less and whose total coa is 3400 or higher these conditions are delineated in the 20052006 pell grant payment and disbursement tables which are available on the web at httpwwwifapedgovdpclettersattachments2005payschedrevpdf 12 for additional information about the ef c and the pell grant see crs report rl31668 federal pell grant program of the higher education act background and reauthorization by charmaine mercerstudents educationrelated expenses and is determined by each higher education institution in general the coa is the sum of tuition and fees an allowance for books supplies trans portation and miscellaneous personal expenses and room and board allowance9 after the aid administrator determines students eligibility for student aid eg federal state and institutional grants and loans the final outcome is the financial aid award which consists of the sp ecific sources and amounts of student aid each applicant will receive to help pay for hishe r educationrelated expenses efc and pell the primary pell grant award ru is that students annual grant is the least of three different amounts maximum appropriated pell grant minus efc coa minus efc10 or the tuition sensitivity amount11 for nearly all pell recipients the pell grant award is calculated by subtracting the efc from the maximum appropria ted pell grant for the year ie without regard for the coa this is because the maximum pell grant minus the recipients efc is almost always lower than the coa minus the efc the other two parts of the award rule are likely to apply only in relatively infrequent situations when coa falls below the appropriated max imum pell grant or when tuition is less than 675 and other conditions apply as discussed by law pell grant award cannot be less than 400 for those students whose pell gran t would be between 200 and 400 the law provides 400 grant otherwise known as t he bump student who qualifies for less than 200 grant will not receive pell grant12httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32923crs6 13 see for example stephen burd president bush calls for increase in pell grants chronicle of higher

5800 most recent authorized maximum pell grant 15 department of education fiscal year 2005 justifications of appropriation estimates to the congress vol 2 p n28estimated impact of increasing the appropriated maximum pell grant this section analyzes the impact of raising the appropriated maximum pell grant award by 100 500 and 1750 ther eby increasing the appropriated maximum award to 4150 4550 nd 5800 respectively these amounts were selected in light of recent proposals to increase the maximum pell award by the abovementioned amounts specifically the administration recently proposed increasing the maximum pell award by 100 every year for the next five years which would increase the maximum award to 4550 at end of the fifth year13 the 5800 maximum pell grant amount was included in the analysis because this is the most recent authorized maximum grant and some members of congress believe funds should be appropriate d to equal this amount14 these three amounts provide range of relatively small medium and large increases in the maximum pell grant in the following sections this report analyzes selected changes in the number of recipients by dependency status and family income level it further analyzes the changes in program costs for each of the three maximum award scenarios as previously stated these estimates are intended to illustrate the relative magnitude and nature of proposed changes and are not intended to serve as official cost estimates for the pell grant program how much will student aid increase ed estimates that for award year 20052006 with an appropriated maximum pell grant of 4050 the total amount of aid provided for pell grant recipients would be approximately 128 billion15 as is illustrated by table 1 if the appropriated maximum pell grant were increased by 100 to 4150 the estimated total amount of aid available would increase to 131 billion 32 increase over the amount of student aid available under current law the total estimated amount of pell aid would greatly increase if the appropriated ma ximum award were raised to 4550 or 5800 for example the estimated amount of pell grant aid to students would increase by more than 58 for total of 202 billion if the maximum appr opriated award were increased from 4050 to 5800 table 1 shows that an increase in the maximum pell grant generally means more aid for all students eligible for assistance table 1 also shows the breakdown of the estimated increase of pell grant aid to students by dependency status in eachhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32923crs7 scenario dependent recipients would receive greater percentage increase over current law than either of the two indepe ndent groups for example increasing the maximum pell grant from 4050 to 5800 would produce 65 increase in the amount of pell aid for depende nt students independent recipients with dependents and independent recipients without dependents would r eceive 51 and 61 increases respectively over the amount of pell grant aid awarded to each group under current law pattern develops table 1 also generally validates eds rule regarding an increase in the appropriated maximu m award 100 increase in the maximum award would increase the program cost s by approximately 400 million however it should be noted that the rule becomes so mewhat less accurate as the amount of the appropriated maximum pell grant increases for example if the maximum pell award were increased by 100 to 4150 the amount of aid awarded would increase by approximately 408 million similarly if the appropr iated maximum award were increased to 4550 500 increase over the current maximum award the estimated amount of aid would increase by approxima tely 21 billion or slightly more than five times 400 million however if the appropriated ma ximum grant were increased to equal the most recent authorized maximum 5800 or 1750 increase the estimated amount of aid aw arded to recipients would increase by approximately 75 b illion versus the 70 billion produced by eds rule approximately 187 times 400 millionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32923 crs8 table 1 estimated amount of pell grant aid to recipients for award year 20052006 by dependency

table 2 each increase in the appropriated maximum pell award would usher more recipients into the program each of the three increases in the maximum award also increases the number of recipients in each dependenc group with the greatest increase being realized for dependent recipients fo r example an increase from 4050 to 5800 maximum appropriated award would increase the number of dependent recipients by an estimated 186 over the number of dependent recipients under current law overall increasing the appropriate d maximum pell grant from 4050 to 5800 increases the total number of r

and family income because the pell award is generally the difference between the appropriated maximum award and the expected family contribution as the maximum award increases recipients with larger family incomes are ushered into the program16 dependent recipients as illustrated in table 4 the number of recipients in the highest family income group over 6000017 increases from 23000 when the maximum pell award is 4050 to more than 87000 recipients if the maximum award were increased to 5800 further recipients with family incomes between 40001 and 60000 begin to comprise larger percentage of all dependent recipients as the maximum award increases recipients in this group increase from approximately 13 when th maximum pell is 4050 to nearly 20 if the award were increased to 5800 conversely as the maximum award increases the number of dependent recipients in the lowest family income group 20000 or less slightly increases but their percentage of total dependent pell grant recipients actually decreases the percentage of dependent recipients w ith family income of 20000 or less wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32923crs11 decrease from approximately 39 of all pendent pell recipients with maximum award of 4050 to slightly less than 33 if the award were increased to 5800 independent recipients with dependents as shown in table 4 the estimated number of recipients in the highest income group over 30000 would increase with each increase in the maximum award the number of recipients in other income groups were unchanged under each award increase scenario independent recipien ts without dependents somewhat similar pattern is also observed among independe nt recipients without dependents as illustrated in table 4 the estimated number of pell recipients in the lowest family income group 7500 or less would not change for each increase in the maximum award however the number of recipients in the remaining groups would increase as result if the maximum appropriated pell award were increased the recipients from the lowest family income group would co mprise lower share of the total for example independent recipi ents without dependents with the lowest family income represent approximately 54 of all independent recipien ts without dependents when the maximum pell award is 4050 and the per centage would decrease to 47 if the maximum award were increased to 5800 similar to what was observed for dependent recipients the estimated number of recipients in the highest income group over 25000 while remaining relatively small nearly triples if the

family incomes have the highest average pell award among all in come groups in each maximum award scenario however with the exception of the highest income group over 60000 the average awards of recipients in the lowest income group also increase by the least the average awards of recipi ents with family incomes between 20001 and 40000 and between 40001 and 60000 would increase by the greatest percentage if the maximum award we re increased to 5800 as shown in table 5 the average award for these two groups w ould increase by 51 and 56 respectively over current law independent recipients the average awards for both groups of independent recipients are comparable although the average awards for independent recipients without dependent s are larger than those for independent recipients with dependents recipients in both groups with the lowest family incomes 10000 or less for independent recipients with dependents and 7500 or less for independent recipients wit hout dependents have higher average awards than all other income groups however recipients in this group both with dependents and without dependents also ve the smallest increase in the amount of the average award under each award increase s cenario as illustrated in table 5 if the maximum pell award were increased to 58 00 the average awards for this group would increase by approximately 43

appropriated maximum pell grant is increased the estimated number of individuals in the lowest family income group remains about the same however the estimated amount of their average award significantly increases c onversely as the maximum award increases the number of individuals in the highes t family income group increases and the average amount of their pell awards also in creases either slightly or significantly depending upon the increase in the maximu m award nevertheless average awards remain lower for the relatively highinc ome group than for the lowerincome groups dependent recipients figure 1 illustrates this relationship for dependent recipients as noted recipients in the lowestincome group less than 20000 would receive the largest increase in award dollars if the maximum award were increased from 4050 to 5800 however dependent recipients with family incomes between 40001 and 60000 would increase their average award by 56 over the amount under current law this pe rcentage increase is greater than the increase for all other income groups see table 5 the difference in the amount of th average pell award becomes more pronounced for lowerincome groups when the appropriated maximum award increases for example the average award for dependent student with family income of less than 20000 would be sligh tly more than 4500 if the maximum pell grant were 5800 and appr oximately 3200 with maximum pell of 4050 difference of approximately 1300 for dependent recipient with family income over 60000 the difference in the average award when the maximum grant is 5800 and when it is 4050 would be approx imately 370 1330 average pell award versus 960 average pell award independent recipien ts with dependents the difference in the amount of the average pell award among independe nt recipients with dependents is less extreme as shown in figure 2 the number of independent recipients with dependents does not significantly increase except for the highestincome group over 25000 it is estimated that more than 90000 recipients in this income group would become eligible for pell award if the maximum award were increased from 4050 to 5800 also the average pell awar d for independent recipients with dependents would not greatly differ for each increase in the maximum grant unless the appropriated max imum pell award were increased to 5800 if the maximum appropriated pell awar d were increased to 5800 the average award would increase by 43 for both of the two lowesti ncome groups 10000 or less and 10001 to 20000 and by 50 and 63 for the two highest income groups respectively 20001 to 30000 and over 30000 see table 5 independent recipients without dependents the results for independent recipients wit hout dependents are similar to the results for independent recipients with dependents figure 3 shows that for this group the estimated number of recipients remains constant for each increase in the pell maximum except when the maximum award is 5800 if the max imum award were increased to 5800 the number of recipients in the two highestin come groups would increase for example approximately 130000 i ndependent recipients wit hout dependents with family incomes between 10001 to 25000 would become eligible for pell grant if the maximum award were increased from 4050 to 5800 further the average pellhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32923crs16 award for this group would increase by 80 if the maximum pell grant were increased from 4050 to 5800 see table 5 as evidenced by figures 1 2 and 3 the number of pell grant recipients in the lowest family income group remains relatively constant for each dependency group and for each increase in the maximum appropriated award because pell grants are targeted towards the neediest students individuals with the lowest family incomes are likely to already receive grant recipients in this group will generally experience an increase in their pell award if the maximum award is increased but the number of recipients in this group would not significantly change conversely if the maximum pell award were increased the number of recipients in the highest family income group in each of the three dependency groups would increase in addition recipients in this group would also have an increase in their average pell award if the maximum pell grant were increased but the increases would be smaller than those for lowe rincome recipients httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32923 crs17 020000040000060000080000010000001200000 20000 or less20001 4000040001 60000ov er 60000

part of the funding fo r the program the costs of the current maximum award of 4050 the enhanced pell grants for state scholars19 and several proposed changes intended to improve the programs

500 per year since 20002001 to the present at fouryear public institutions whereas the maximum appropriated pell grant has increased by total of 300 since fy2001 several findings fro m the preceding analysis appear to be important for federal policymakers as they consider legislative efforts to increase the maximum appropriated pell grant the discussion below identifies some of these findings and their importance for policymaking in this area according to these analyses increasing the maximum pell award by 100 increases the estimated program costs by approximately 400 million for award year 20052006 further if the appr opriated maximum award were increased to equal thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32923crs22 most recent authorized maximum of 5800 the estimated program costs would increase by more than 75 billion increasing the maximum pell award would also increase the number of eligible participants by nearly 12 while changing somewhat the distribution of participants among dependency groups more specifica lly if the appropr iated maximum pell grant were increased the representation of each dependency group would change dependent recipients represent slightly less than 40 of all pell recipients under current law the percentage would increase to nearly 42 if the maximum award were increased to 5800 independent reci pients with depende nts would witness decrease in their representation among all pell recipients if the maximum award were increased under current law they make up 42 of all pell recipients however this would decrease to 39 if the max imum award were increased to 5800 closer examination of each dependency group reveals th at only recipients with the highest family incomes over 60000 for dependent recipients 20000 for independent recipients w ith dependents and over 13000 for independent recipients without dependents would increase their percentage share of all pell grant recipients if the maximum award were in creased within this highincome group the representation would increase by 21 per centage points for independent recipients with dependents 484 to 505 and by 103 percentage points for independent recipients without depende nts 154 to 257 if the maximum pell award were increased from 4050 to 5800 finally the analysis reveals that an increase in the appropriated maximum pell grant greatly increases the amount of the average pell award for the lowestincome recipients in each dependency group recipients with the lowest family incomes would have the largest average pell aw ard under each selected increase in the maximum pell grant further dependent recipients in the lowestincome group would have higher average pell awar d in each scenario than both groups of independent recipients with fa mily incomes in the lowest group the average pell award of individuals in the highest family income group would increase by greater percentage than for recipients in the westincome group even though the amounts of the awards for the fo rmer would be lower both groups of independent recipients in the highest family income group would experience the greatest percentage increase in their average pell award if the maximum award were increased from 4050 to 5800 independent recipients with dependents would increase their average award by 51 and the average award for independent recipients without dependents would increas by 80 over the amount of the average award under current law for dependent reci pients individuals with family incomes in the second to the highestincome gr oup would experience the greatest percentage increase in their average pell award if the maximum pell award were increased to 5800 this groups average award would increase by 56 over the average award under current law
