changes in the text of measure or pending amendment during its consideration senators generally have wide freedom to offer as many amendments as they want including nonrelevant changes in fact an important feature of the senate is that it lacks general germaneness rule this absence grants any senator an opportunity to raise issues and to offer extraneous riders to pending legislation however senators freedom to amend and to offer nonrelevant amendments can be restricted in certain circumstances such as when the senate invokes cloture which limits further debate on measure and imposes germaneness requirement on amendments or agrees by unanimous consent to restrict the offering of amendments the senates amending process can be complex but it is subject to certain conditions and principles whether these conditions and principles apply in all circumstances may be problematic because the senate might waive them by the unanimous consent of the membership the point to remember is that sometimes there may be gap between amendment theory and senatorial practice for discussion of details associated with the types perfecting and substitute degrees first degree and second degree and forms motions to strike to insert or to strike and insert of amendments see crs report 98614 amendments in the senate types and forms and crs report 98853 the amending process in the senate

affect any senators eligibility to offer floor amendments one factor is spatial are there any limbs or places left on the amendment tree an amendment tree is one of several charts in senate procedure precedents and practices that depict the number and effect of amendments that may be pending at the same time another factor involves time is the amending process regulated by timelimitation agreement that may specify when or in what order amendments are to be offered and which limits debate on each one still another factor is contextual for instance are there formal the imposition of cloture for instance or informal the floor managers want to preapprove changes to the pending measure circumstances that impinge on the amending process second when measure is the pending business on the floor several amending practices are typically in play right at the outset for example amendments are to be read unless the reading is dispensed with by unanimous consent b committee amendments and amendments thereto take priority over floor amendments to the bill c the measure is open to amendment at any point unless the senate by unanimous consent decides to do it another way unlike the house the senate does not proceed sectionbysection or titlebytitle when it amends legislation d amendments may be debated at length subject to the invocation of cloture or the motion to table third under senate rule xix the presid ing officer is obligated to recognize the first senator who addresses the chair senate precedents modify this stricture by granting priority recognition first to the majority leader then to the minority leader and then respectively to the majority and minority floor managers of the legislation these preferential recognition precedents grant the majority leader the option to control the floor and to fill the amendment tree g18g155g146g151g140g146g153g149g142g156g561 senate procedure outlines number of principles that guide the amending process some of them include the following t httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98707g21g142g151g138g157g142g561g3g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g561g18g155g152g140g142g156

amendment is change to the text of the bill second degree amendment proposes to change the first degree amendment senators are free to modify or withdraw their amendments until the senate takes action on them precedents stipulate for instance that action includes ordering the yeas and nays on the amendment sometimes senators immediately get action on their amendment the result they may lose their right to modify their proposal but they gain the right to amend it under cloture it requires unanimous consent for senator to modify his or her amendment any senator may demand the division of an amendment if it contains separate and distinct parts that can stand on their own however under senate rule xv any amendment to strike out and insert is not divisible under cloture an amendment may not be divided by senator as matter of right worth another mention is the senates principle of germaneness there are four instances when the senate may function with germaneness requirement for amendments they are as follows senate rule xvi requires the germaneness of amendments to general but not special appropriations bills when cloture has been invoke d if the senate enters into unanimous consent agreement that stipulates that amendments are to be either germane or relevant or both and when statutes such as the congressional budget act of 1974 require that amendments be germane in this case to concurrent budget resolutions and reconciliation bills g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 walter j oleszek senior specialist in
