through 2007 and into 2008 under unique set of rules the government in bangladesh is to hand over power to caretaker government in the months immediately preceding national elections the bangladesh national party did this in 2006 in the lead up to the scheduled january 2007 election the current political situation came about after emergency rule was declared by president iajuddin ahmed following protests and strikes by opposition parties in the lead up to the january 2007 elections this led to the installation of the present militarybacked caretaker government the awami league which was in opposition to the previous bangladesh national party bnp government protested irregularities in the voter list in the lead up to the election that was scheduled for january 2007 these irregularities were independently confirmed by the national democratic institute ndi the ndi delegation is deeply concerned that the new voters list runs to over 93 million names size that is substantially inconsistent with the 2001 census data voters list containing twothirds of the population strain s credibility on the ba sis of the 2001 census the voting age population was approximately 80 million people 1 the current militarybacked caretaker government has stated that it wishes to hold elections in 2008 after implementing electoral reforms to include new voter list and improved voter identification observers believe that the military has been reluctant to play more direct role for fear of jeopardizing its lucrative international peacekeeping work 2 some observers are already concerned that elections may be further delayed according to brad adams asia director for human rights watch the army is running the country and does not intend to relinquish power in the near future it has been reported that as many as 200000 people including leading politicians have been jailed under the emergency 3 disillusionment among bangladeshis with the two traditional ruling political parties the awami league led by sheikh hasina and the bangladesh national party led by khaleda zia meant that emergency rule has been broadly welcomed by the populace zia was prime minister from 1991 to 1996 and from 2001 to 2006 while hasina was prime minister from 1996 to 2001 there are reportedly signs that discontent may emerge should elections be indefinitely delayed bangladeshs economy is projected to grow by approximately 6 through 2008 despite the political turmoil 4 1 report of the national democratic institute ndi preel ection delegation to bangladeshs 20062007 parliamentary

under its anticorruption drive the caretaker government has moved decisively against the established political parties this has the potential to fundamentally change the political landscape of bangladesh bangladesh has for many years been one of the worlds most corrupt nations charges have now been brought against both leader hasina as well as zia of the bnp hasina was arrested on charges of extortion while zia was charged with tax evasion on july 16 2007 hussein muhamad ershad of the jatiya party has also recently retired from politics some observers question the caretaker governments motives and commitment to restore democracy in bangladesh in light of these moves 5 in recent commentary in the daily star of bangladesh it has been asserted that it now seems clearer than ever that the oligopoly of the existing political parties is what the current administration is intent on breaking up concern has also been raised that the caretaker government may have unintentionally created vacuum through its anti corruption assault on the established parties that the relatively unscathed islamist parties may be well positioned to fill 6 the election commission is moving forward with voter identity cards that reportedly will include photographs of each individual this is process that is thought will take at least year to implement in bangladesh nation with 147 million people and high illiteracy restrictions on political assembly remain in force in bangladesh many have hoped that the state of emergency could begin to be lifted allowing indoor political meetings would be one

traditionally more secular of the two main political parties the awami league reportedly signed an agreement with the khelafat majlis considered by some to be protaliban style islamist group in the leadup to the polls scheduled for january 200716 former general hussein muhamad ershad who ruled bangladesh from 1982 to 1990 had joined the to contest the election but was deemed fugitive of justice by the government after fleeing corruption charges17 some had viewed ershad as possible kingmaker or in the case of bangladesh queenmaker in the scheduled but postponed polls of january 2007 former us ambassador patricia butenis stated that bangladeshis have suffered because the political parties could not agree on the basic rules of the game the hard part is actually creating political parties that are genuinely democratic in practice and outlook parties that focus on issues and the national interest instead of personalities18 in the leadup to the scheduled january 2007 election observers generally feared that political infighting corruption rising islamist extremism and political violence would further erode the bangladesh governments ability to effectively or democratically govern bombings and other violence targeted opponents of islamization secular and leftist politicians intellectuals and journalist and religious minority groups 19 bangladeshs status as secular and moderate state as well as its democratic process has been jeopardized as result of the approach taken by the two main political parties further there is concern that should bangladesh become failed state or
