and internationally 37 adam will support eu policy development in the next stage of the development of the 38 fccc and the kyoto protocol in particular negotiations around post 2012 global climate 39 policy regime and will inform the emer gence of new adaptation strategies for europe in 40 research on adaptation policy options special attention will be paid to the role of extreme 41 events as both exposing vulnerability and as signal for change the top level impact of the 42 adam project will be improv ing the quality and relevance of scientific contributions t the 43 development and evaluation of climate change policy options within the european 44 commission this will help the commission to deliver on its current medium term climate 45 policy objectives and help inform its development of longer term climate strate gy 46 47 48 adam 2ndorder draft 15 october 2004 confidential not for circulation 2 b the case for support 49 50 51 b1 relevance to the objectives of the sub priority 52 53 climate change presents new set of challenges for the development of public policy this is 54 because the time scales involved between policy i mplementation and desired outcome ar 55 much longer than in other policy areas because many areas of policy planning need 56 simultaneously to be addressed therefore placing greater demand on the integration of 57 polic across different realms and because the truly global nature of the problem requires 58 national or regional polic ies to be designed within some framework of global strategy these 59 challenges are true for all nations yet are particularly acute for the european union eu 60 given its leading role to date in the design of humanitys r esponse to our unprecedented 61 perturbation of the global climate 62 63 appropriate european climate change polic ies therefore need simultaneously to secure long 64 term climate protection goals to be integrated across multiple sectors and to be designed to 65 reson ate with emerging international agreements and geo political discourse s they must also 66 be acceptable to europes citizens these are challenging objective s which the eu is 67 nevertheless determined to meet in order to do so however it will need to har ness available 68 scientific expertise to identify illuminate and appraise the available policy options these 69 options must address the demands stabilised climate will place on protecting citizens and 70 valued ecosystems adaptation as well as address ing the necessity to stabilise humankinds 71 perturbation to global climate at minimum desirable level whilst safeguarding and 72 transforming economic activities mitigation the appraisal of these options must recognise 73 the existence of multiple criteria such as cost benefit cost effectiveness equity legitimacy 74 and environmental integrity such an appraisal must also identify where policy options can 75 contribute to both objectives adaptation and mitigation and where policy trade offs may 76 emerge 77 78 the core objectives of th research proposed by the adam adaptation and mitigation 79 consortium are therefore 80 81 to assess the extent to which existing and evolving eu mitigation and adaptation 82 policies can achieve tolerable transition soft landing to world with global 83 climate warmer than 2degc above pre industrial levels and to identify the costs and 84 effectiveness of these policies mention 5degc somewhere 85 to define portfolio of strategic options for eu mitigation and adaptation policy 86 development in selected areas such as science and

stage of the 99 development of the fccc and the kyoto protocol in particular negotiations around 100 post2012 global climate policy regime and will inform the emer gence of new adaptation 101 strategies for europe in research on adaptation policy options special attention will be paid 102 to the role of extreme events as both exposing vulnerability and as signal for change 103 104 in terms of policy development the principal time horizon of the project will be from the 105 present to 2025 while the time horizon for policy appraisal will be out to 2100 the dominant 106 unit of analysis for the project will be the u and its current member states but will 107 specifically include global analyses where this clearly affects the interests of eu citizens and 108 states for example international emissions trading development assistance etc the 109 adam consortium will work w ith small number of 3rd country collaborating partners in 110 india china and the usa to ensure that our research is grounded in global perspective 111 112 the deliverables from this three year adam project will be 113 114 d1 improvements in economic modelling tools for use in analysing the effects and 115 costs of mitigation and adaptation options including areas of technology dynamics 116 innovation spillovers economic externa lities and emissions trading within europe 117 d2 blah blah ottmar et

an appraisal of range of new ie beyond business asusual mitigation and 130 adaptation policy options as applied to four worked examples spanning range of 131 scales and sectors including post 2012 global climate regimes 132 133 meeting and delivering the research objectives stated above requires major european 134 research effort such as can only be funded under an eu fp6 integrated project all individual 135 member states in the eu recognise the dimensions of the challenges outlined above and some 136 member states have research institutions which can tackle individual components of the 137 problem or can provide research underpinning of national climate policy planning 138 member state however even less any single institution is capable of providing the integrated 139 research support that is needed at the level of european climate policy planning given the 140 breadth of disciplinary skills that are needed eg economics policy climate science 141 envir onmental science together with the range of research tools that need to be deployed 142 eg modelling policy analysis integrated assessment large scale integrated project is the 143 most appropriate and effective research instrument in europe that can deliver the stated 144 objectives t he adam consortium brings together many of europes leading national 145 research capacities wh ich have not only been working at the climate science policy interface 146 for many years but all of whom share the same intellectual outl ook of disciplinary integration 147 adam 2ndorder draft 15 october 2004 confidential not for circulation 4 and policy relevance which such project needs the adam project will be able to exploit 148 many years of national and european research investment in climate change and build on these 149 institutional capacities to deliver tr uly innovative and unique series of processes and 150 products in support of eu climate policy 151 152 153 b2 potential impact 154 155 strategic impact 156 the top level impact of the adam project will be improv ing the quality and relevance of 157 scientific contributions t the development and evaluation of climate change policy options 158 within the european commission this will help the commission to deliver on its current 159 medium term climate policy objectives and help inform its development of longer term 160 climate strate gy in the context of the fccc and the post 2012 negotiations and b 161 existing and emerging sectoral policy objectives within the eu 162 163 the u has stated climate policy objective of stabilising global climate at more than 2 c 164 above pre industria l levels this is equivalent to further warming of more than about 165 13c above todays temperature achieving this objective will probably require co 2 166 concentration to rise higher than 450ppmv reaching this goal will require contributions 167 from all th worlds industrialised and industrialising nations and will not be easily achieved 168 even under such stabilised climate europe and the wider world will experience changes in 169 the frequency distribution and severity of climate risks some of which will cause 170 considerable loss of life economic disruption and ecosystem damage under this scenario 171 mitigation will present the major challenge but serious attention to adaptation options will 172 also be needed 173 174 different scenario may see global temperature reach 5 c above pre industrial levels by 175 2100 with sea level rise commitment of 1m or more in the next century the risks 176 associated with extreme weather events in this scenario would be significantly greater than in 177 2c warmer world and the danger of exceeding irreversible critical thresholds eg melting 178 the greenland ice sheet will also be commensurately larger under this scenario whilst 179 successful mitigation efforts may be restricted to small number of nations and perhaps only 180 be pursued half heartedly elsewhere the challenge for our societies to adapt to such large 181 changes in climate will be immense 182 183 the world may well develop in way that fall s between these two futures yet it is clear that 184 we will only safely navigate this coming cen tury of climate change by paying serious attention 185 to combinations of policy options that both mitigate climate change and adapt society so as to 186 be better protected against the residual climate risks it seems likely that many of these policy 187 challenges will take us well beyond those options currently in place or under negotiation for 188 example eu 15 greenhouse gas emissions in 2002 were only 2 9 below 1990 levels 189 compared to the kyoto target of 8 by 2008 2012 indeed to adequately address both the 190 mitigation and adaptation challenge is likely to require innovative technologies new forms of 191 solidarity and loss sharing entirely novel f orms of policy intervention and perhaps quite 192 radical transformations of our societies the necessary transition from our current 193 development trajectories to those required for climate protection are not immediately obvious 194 nor is it clear what combinat ions of changes in technology behaviour institutions and policy 195 would deliver them within europe this transition should be achieved without compromising 196 adam 2ndorder draft 15 october 2004 confidential not for circulation 5 the objectives of the gothenburg declaration on sustainable development and the lisbon 197 strategy fo r european as an innovation driven knowledge based economy 198 199 the adam project using the above diagnosis as framing of the problem will evaluate 200 europes current predicament and develop p ortfolio s of strategic climate policy options in 201 selected domains which will contribute to the achievement of longterm climate goals for 202 europe and for the world these portfolios will be subjected to novel options appraisal 203 framework paying especial attention to european competitiveness cost effectiveness and 204 social justice such an appraisal framework will help inform the development of sustainable 205 climate protection strategy for europe in the context of an evolving international climate 206 policy regime 207 208 innovation exploitation dissemination 209 the adam proje ct will develop an innovative policy options appraisal framework paf and 210 apply it to number of strategic climate policy domains we will also advance the current 211 generation of economic modelling tools that are used to evaluate climate policy options nd 212 complete quantitative vulnerability assessment for europe these tools within the context 213 of the paf will allow for comparative analysis of mitigation and adaptation options and an 214 examination of their interaction through our worked examples we will develop and appraise 215 set of novel policy portfolios as applied to the challenges of climate change in europe 216 217 our work will be informed by cycle of six monthly climate s cience policy eu workshop s 218 and we will hold major f inal adam conference i n brussels in the winter of 200809 the 219 sixmonthly workshops will facilitate the dialogue between europe s climate policy 220 community and the adam consortium which will shape and guide our work and allow our 221 work to inform and suppor t the eu negotiat ing process on climate change our work will be 222 reported to the international framework convention process through successive cop mop 223 events and to the wider scientific and policy communities through conventional science and 224 policy journals throug h our 3rd country collaborators the relevance and applicability of the 225 adam policy options appraisal framework in other world regions will be tested 226 227 contribution to policy and regulation 228 anything more to add here the adam project will view dg environment as its key client 229 but w ill maintain close interaction with its sponsor dg research and with other appropriate 230 dgs eg energy transport agric ulture and with the european environment agency the 231 four worked examples will be agreed and then developed in conjunction with significant 232 european policy advisors for ex ample the climate change unit in dg environment 233 responsible for negotiating post 2012 global climate regimes 234 235 added value of european approach 236 the development f adaptation and miti gation strategies for managing climate change is an 237 area where the value of co operative european research is self evident the eu plays 238 crucial function within the international climate negotiations and eu negotiating positions 239 need to be informed by t he best possible analysis from european researchers at the same 240 time many of the challenges of adaptation eg new insurance regulations and mitigation 241 eg emissions trading policy have to be set at an eu scale here again research capacity 242 such as that offered by the adam consortium will be crucial in drawing national expertise 243 and experiences of tackling these issues into series of more coherent and co ordinated 244 strategies which can be implemented across europe 245 246 adam 2ndorder draft 15 october 2004 confidential not for circulation 6 relation to other research initiatives 247 anything else to say here the adam partners have led or been significantly involved in 248 many ongoing or recently completed eufunded research projects relevant to adam s 249 objectives for example efiea 2 ateam ccash dinas coast mice prudence 250 matisse sustainability test and newater add others please we are therefore 251 wellplaced to exploit and harn ess this knowledge base for the purposes of adam where we 252 do not have direct formal involvement in relevant european scale projects our national and 253 european networks allow us to gain access to such work for example the newly started 254 ensembles integrated project will be one such important companion activity as will 255 carbo europe other please also several of the senior staff name them klein adger 256 berkhout barker etc in the adam partners contributing to the project are convening or 257 lead authors for the ipcc 4th assessment report ensuring that our work is f ully cognisant of 258 new insights arising from the ipcc 259 260 261 b3 scientific and technical excellence 262 263 research strategy 264 265 the adam work programme is structured around four primary work domains as sh own in 266 the accompanying diagram scenarios mitigation adaptation and policy appraisal 267 268 the policy appraisal domain will provide the central component of adam namely the 269 development of an innovative policy option s appra isal framework paf the paf will be 270 both major deliverable of the project and also the key mechanism for providing policy 271 relevant outputs from the project the paf will be used within adam in two major 272 exercises i to appraise broad range of exi sting and evolving eu policy measures with 273 respect to stated mitigation and adaptation targets and ii to appraise portfolios of novel 274 policy options as might be applied to four selected domains with global regional or sectoral 275 reach deliberative appr aisal will use both quantitative economic and environmental 276 model ling and qualitative analysis produced by the other work clusters within the adam 277 project 278 279 the scenarios domain will lay out the four framing scenarios that wi ll guide and contextualise 280 the adam analysis these scenarios will be global in scope but with more detail for europe 281 and will encompass development pathways policy regimes and associated climate futures and 282 environmental impacts in simple terms the four scenarios will span range of climate 283 futures from 2c global warming in which the primary challenge will be to mitigate to 5c 284 warming in which the primary challenge will be to adapt 285 286 the adaptation domain will develop quantitative knowled ge base on europe s vulnerability 287 to climate change provid ing the eu and other stakeholders with the rationale for concerted 288 focus on adaptation and mitigation it will also study the interactions between climate change 289 especially changing extreme wea ther events non climatic developments and sectoral 290 policies and thus provide insights into the complex societal processes that define vulnerability 291 to climate change by modelling the process of adaptation within selected sectors in europe 292 social technical and environmental factors that influence adaptive capacity will be identified 293 this domain w ill also define policy options to reduce europes vulnerability to climate 294 change by analysing the way in which current developments and policies influence potential 295 climate change impacts and the capa city to adapt to these impacts 296 adam 2ndorder draft 15 october 2004 confidential not for circulation 7 297 298 299 we do not say much about the uncertainty analysis and methods for ia does this matter 300 301 the mitigation domain will evaluate the costs and effectiveness of different mitigation 302 options at the eu level and estimate their corresponding contribution at the global level in the 303 illustrative adam scen arios this domain will also conduct t the eu level an evaluation 304 of mitigation efforts in specific sectors these global and sectoral evaluations will take into 305 account the main channels of interaction between the eu and other world regions namely 306 technology transfer foreign direct investment trade of used products and investment goods 307 development aid and international trade ie physical and financial capital flows these are 308 all areas where the eu can play an important role special ttention will also be paid to the 309 role of technology spillovers and technological change and innovation including an 310 assessment of the impact of emissions trading and other policy instruments 311 312 the adam project will interact closely with eu institutions in particular dg environment 313 and will includ major consultation exercise with european policy makers comprising 314 formal review of the policy mapping and appraisal at the end of phase one of the project the 315 interaction with policy makers will be mai ntained throughout the project duration using 316 cycle of six monthl adam science policy workshops building on the recent success of the 317 two efiea 2 climate science policy workshops organised by rivm and the tyndall centre in 318 august and november 2004 319 320 321 work domain s scenario analysis 322 do we need deliverable here is the scenarios work sufficiently picked up elsewhere 323 the scenarios domain will lay out the four framing scenarios that will guide

for circulation 8 climate futures and environmental impacts the scenarios help to ensure integration and 327 synthesis within adam by providing common context of self consistent scenarios that 328 provide qualitative and quantitative information on range of plausible development 329 pathways mitigative and adaptive capacity climate change and impacts of climate consistent 330 with multi gas scenarios and stabilisation levels at range of atmosphe ric greenhouse gas 331 concentrations 332 333 the set of four main scenarios will span range of climate futures from 2 c global warming 334 by 2100 consistent with the eus stated climate policy objective in which the primary 335 challenge will be to mitigate to war ming scenario in rather unconstrained carbon world in 336 which the primary challenge will be to adapt intermediate scenarios will represent future 337 global policy regimes in which there is early or late consensus over the scale of mitigation 338 that is nee ded and that explore the consequences of various combinations of adaptation and 339 mitigation action the exact stabilisation levels of these two scenarios will be determined 340 within the project but probably will aim for stabilisation at 25 and 3 c 341 342 clearly ver the past few years important scenario work has been performed including ipcc 343 sres uneps global environment outlook and the work of ipcc post sres stabilisation 344 scenarios most of this work did not consider the full suite of radiatively active gases and d id 345 not consider impacts and adaptation the adam work will aim to close th gaps including 346 checking the internal consistency of the economic scenarios allowing for purchasing power 347 parity exchange rates but above all by providing synthesis of existing work including new 348 results from other u projects such as prudence and ensembles in integrated 349 scenarios as described above uncertainties accumulate across the chain from drivers to final 350 impacts as result of which wide ran ge of impacts are possible at the local scale that are 351 consistent with certain specification of greenhouse gas emissions identifying and 352 communication these uncertainties will therefore be an imp ortant aspect of the work 353 354 we re emphasise that t he purpose of this scenarios work in adam is to develop the consistent 355 information that is needed for the integrated study of adaptation work domain and 356 mitigation work domain m as means to developing and appraising portfolios of climate 357 policy options for long term climate change

develo pment aid and 421 international trade ie capital flows all areas where the eu can play an important role 422 423 in the last decade growing consensus has emerged that international trade in pe rmits can 424 reduce the climate protection costs because greenhouse gas emissions are abated at locati ons 425 with least costs moreover there is also consensus that tra dable permits are efficient in 426 adam 2ndorder draft 15 october 2004 confidential not for circulation 10 globalised and fully integrated world market at first glance this i mplies that if large 427 emitters do not accept an emission cap smaller emitters can ose some comparative 428 advantage in international trade however most economic models used for climate policy 429 advice only allow for the trade of goods and emission permits but omit the crucial aspect 430 determining the comparative advantage of countries trade in capital goods within the 431 adam project work cluster m2 is designed to inform relevant stak eholders within the eu 432 about the consequences of climate policy targets on ec onomic growth and comparative 433 advantages u nder different scenarios 434 435 one major concern of european climate policy is the comparative advantage of eur opean 436 firms on globalising world markets it is assumed that if only europe was commi tted to 437 emission reductions during decade r two without usa and russia emission intensive 438 european firms could loose some of their com parative advantage it will be clarified whether 439 and for what firms it is realistic assumption for european policy to improve the comparative 440 advantage of its d omestic firm s by relaxing emission caps or if oth er more effective policy 441 instruments are available this analysis will focus on the role of technological spill overs 442 short term and long term and ident ify pote ntial linkages between climate policy and trade 443 policy 444 445 in accordance with carbon leakage effec ts pollution h avens ambitious emission caps in 446 europe could induce flow of emission intensive goods like cars trucks etc and industrial 447 activit ies to china and india moreover used power plants and energy intensive basic 448 industries could end up being exported even faster from europe to conomies with high 449 growth rates over the next three decades reinvestments in the ele ctricity sector will increase 450 substantially within the oecd but even more new inves tments in transforma tion and in 451 developing countries this requires an in depth an alysis of how different emis sions reduction 452 scenarios and international trade regimes i nfluence the electricity and basic industrial sector in 453 europe and in countries like china and india it has to be analysed whether there is potential 454 for europe to exp ort new highly efficient or carbon capturing and sequestration technologies 455 to these countries leap frogging this is new research area analys ing the impact of 456 international trade in cap ital goods and capital mobility on climate change issues 457 458 most models that have already analysed the impact of emissions trading and other kyoto 459 instruments like cdm on mitigation costs have often completely omitted the impact of emis 460 sions trading on international capital flows and vice versa crucial question is whether 461 emissions trading and trading capital goods are complements and substitutes and how these 462 two trading regimes determine the mitigation costs for europe and other world regions in the 463 short term and how they influe nce adaptation cost in the long term these insights are crucial 464 for europe in defining position in the cond com mitment period of kyoto and develop ing 465 position for wto negotiation on this issue 466 467 international trade on the one side may reduce the vulnerability of some regions and ma 468 increase the vulnerability of other regions it will depend on the trade pattern in the busi ness 469 asusual scenario and on the trade pattern influenced by climate policy in this research focus 470 the impact of international trade on european adaptation costs and vulnerability in the longer 471 term will also be analysed as well as the impact of european climate trade and development 472 policy on selected world regions such as asia or latin am erica 473 474 deliverable d2 blah blah ottmar

potential impacts of climate change and of 485 opportunities to adapt to these impacts 486 487 second the meta analysis will provide information that will be the basis for the development 488 of unified framework that allows for formal interpretations and assessment of vulnerability 489 this framework will be rooted in systems theory and should capture the most important 490 unifying features of existing f ormalisations we will show how the framework relates to the 491 vulnerability studies considered in the meta analysis and analyse the practical benefits derived 492 from basing vulnerability assessment on formal framework 493 494 third the meta analysis will produ ce list of actors individuals sectors institutions etc 495 who are either affected by climate change in position to reduce vulnerability or both they 496 operate on scales ranging from local to european using actor oriented modelling the 497 behaviour of these actors will be analysed within small number of worked examples linked 498 to work cluster p3 this will provide insights into the process of adaptation including non 499 climatic factors that promote and constrain adaptation 500 501 in parallel with the i ndepth actor oriented modelling macro scale assessment will be 502 carried out of the inter relationships between vulnerability to climate change and vulnerability 503 to social pressures in the eu including unemployment income distribution poverty and 504 transfer requirements this assessment will distinguish between different social groups and 505 result in improved knowledge of adaptive capacity to climate change and how it is determined 506 by social and economic conditions 507 508 collectively these activities as we ll as those carried out in work cluster a2 will contribute 509 to the development of digital atlas of europes vulnerability to climate change it will build 510 on the results of the eu fp5 project ateam activities in the adaptation work domain will 511 result in two major improvements more detailed and realistic assessment of adaptive 512 capacity and monetisation of potential impacts using consistent economic valuation 513 framework the digital atlas will enable users to identify hotspots of vulnerability t climate 514 change and obtain insights into the climatic and non climatic processes that create this 515 vulnerability thus it will be an important tool to stakeholders faced with the challenge of 516 reducing vulnerability to climate change 517 518 deliverable d3 qua ntitative assessment including digital atlas of vulnerability to 519 average temperature climate change in europe and proposed options for reducing 520 this vulnerability 521 522 work cluster a2 c oping with extremes 523 given escalating losses from weather related disasters and the ipccs predictions of 524 increased intensity and frequency this cluster will give special attention to assessing risks and 525 vulnerability to slow and sudden onset extreme eve nts such as floods landslides droughts 526 adam 2ndorder draft 15 october 2004 confidential not for circulation 12 heat waves and wind storms based on the medium and long term scenarios from work 527 domain s and drawing on existing studies historical records and expert judgments this 528 cluster will quantify weather related ex treme risks likelihood and losses to humans and 529 economies at the relevant sub national national regional and sectoral scale throughout the eu 530 member states this will also be done selectively and in association with our 3rd country 531 collaborators for highly exposed developing countries focusing primarily on macro 532 economic impacts and vulnerability the projected risks will take account of changes in land 533 use capital movements population and climate the risks will be combined with financial 534 copin g capacity to quantify the economic vulnerability of the relevant geographical location or 535 sector depending on possibilities to reduce the losses through structural and non structural 536 technological paths and absorb them through solidarity and insuranc instruments this 537 will yield european map of economic vulnerability in the eu and to some extent globally 538 which will complement the vulnerability map of work c luster a1 building on cluster a1 539 more nuanced and detailed assessments of risk and vul nerability to extreme weather including 540 social institutional economic and environmental factors will be carried out as part of the 541 policy assessment framework worked examples cluster p 3 542 543 special emphasis will be placed on identifying innovative tec hnologies cf eberhards 544 concerns about technology modeling eg portable levees innovative policies eg new 545 forms of humanitarian disaster assistance based on newly emerging financial instruments and 546 institutions eg public private incentive compatible insurance systems for reducing and 547 transferring the risks within europe and in light of europes global responsibilities in 548 developing countries specifically we will propose adaptation options that are robust to 549 uncertainties in the asses sments including policy instruments for reducing the losses in 550 sustainable manner and transferring the risks through new forms of european solidarity eg 551 novel uses of the european catastrophe fund this will mean identifying opportunities for 552 main streaming disaster risk management within the eus existing directives and policies as 553 well as those of its member states this will also mean examining proactive loss reduction 554 and financing measures for restructuring europes current post disaster role in providing 555 development and humanitarian assistance as well as the eus possible role in restructuring 556 climate adaptation funds for example as part of the global environment facility the policy 557 options will serve as input to the policy assessmen t framework cluster p1 558 559

development of an innovative 568 policy option s appraisal framework paf the paf will be both major deliverable of the 569 project and the key integrating mech anism for providing policy relevant outputs from the 570 project the paf will have two main innovative components 571 572 an integrated appraisal framework bringing together quantitative and qualitative 573 components enabling multi criteria appraisal of policy op tions working independently 574 and in combination with other policies the direct and indirect impacts of policies will be 575 analyzed the framework will also be used both to assess the contribution of sectoral 576 adam 2ndorder draft 15 october 2004 confidential not for circulation 13 policies to existing macro level climate policy t argets and in prospective normative way 577 to appraise alternative policies in the longer term 578 structured i nteraction between analysts and stakeholders including citizens in 579 process of deliberative appraisal building on procedures already develope d in 580 environmental policy analysis and integrated assessment the appraisal framework will 581 build in an interactive approach from the outset linking knowledgeable and interested 582 parties in the analytical work of the project 583 584 work cluster p1 will thus iteratively develop the paf through structured interaction with 585 identified end users of the policy option appraisals b apply the paf through work clusters 586 p2 and p3 and using analysis provided by the mitigation and adaptation work domains 587 and c in s upport of the policy options appraisals in p2 and p3 perform meta analysis of the 588 academic literature and results from work carried out in adam deliberative appraisal will 589 use both quantitative economic and environmental mode lling together with qualitative 590 analy sis produced by the other work clusters within the adam project 591 592 once set of policy options has been defined the framework will involve applying multi 593 criteria appraisal mca to broad range of analys produced by other work clusters and 594 covering 595 596 environmental integrity use of mainly quantitative models to assess emissions 597

surrounding the policy option 608 609 for each criteri on the appraisal may be conducted by either defining quantitative targets or 610 where appropriate by defini ng looser principles comparative appraisal of different policy 611 options can also be conducted without necessarily requiring targets or principles to be 612 defined targets can be developed based upon stated eu policy goals or they can be defined 613 through deliberative exercises with bo th experts and lay people bo th approaches will be 614 employed in adam the criteria used may also be expandedreducedchanged in different 615 deliberative exercises an mca will then be conducted by gathering the relevant analysis and 616 information for each of the criteri on together with the corresponding set of targetsprinciples 617 and in some cases set of weightings for combining criteria the aim however will be to 618 produce appraisals in the sense of gaining insights into and comparison and exp loration of 619 the implications of various policy options rather than formal assessment in the technocratic 620 sense 621 622 deliverable d5 novel policy options appraisal framework which uses both formal 623 modelling and

european union in the global context the cluster will inventorise european policies relevant 630 to climate change adaptation and mitigation we would aim to include measures currently 631 recognised as climate policies but include also policies in other sec tors including agriculture 632 trade and environmental protection policy mapping will identify and analyse potential 633 interactions negative and positive between eu policies and instruments and between eu 634 policies and international policies including with in international climate agreements and the 635 world trade regime the aim of the appraisal will be to determine whether current eu policy 636 objectives can be achieved to establish where major shortfalls are likely and to assess in 637 link with work cluster s a1 and a2 how eu vulnerability and resilience will be influenced as 638 result drawing on these results work cluster p3 will investigate for selected examples 639 how identified weaknesses and vulnerabilities and unexploited opportunities may be handled 640 over the longer term through an analysis of alternative strategies 641 642 to fulfil these objectives the research team will 1 create
