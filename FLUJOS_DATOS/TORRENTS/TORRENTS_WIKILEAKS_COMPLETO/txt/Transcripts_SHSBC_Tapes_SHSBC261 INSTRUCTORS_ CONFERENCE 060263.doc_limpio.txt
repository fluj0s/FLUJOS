instructors conference lecture given on 6 february 1963 okay now this is what this is the 6th of female voice 5th 6th 6th of february its the 6th of february 1963 and this is an instructors conference saint hill special briefing course okay now youre into the middle of some of the most rewarding and some of the most dangerous processes which have ever been originated and the reason ive called this conference is i just wanted to tell you that this is not the time for any private theories or anything else these things go according to set of very furiously fixed rules and unless those rules get followed pcs wind up in the soup now i dont want to minimize this with you because for the first time we are really exclamation point dealing with complete reversal of the first statement made in book three of dianetics the modern science of mental health which is that any auditing is better than auditing lousy r212a auditing is much worse than auditing you see were dealing with something here which is violently dangerous used wrong thats an astonishing thing to tell you it isnt something that we particularly want bruited about from the housetops to the public and all that sort of thing but it is our responsibility to make auditors who dont goof because look there isnt anything else cracks these cases all right lets just look it straight in the face all right so you have to go off high dive high tower hundred feet in the air to dive into an eight foot tank that is covered with flaming gasoline and that is the only way to do it then you have to learn how to do this dont you see oddly enough in scientology there isnt any other way out were the only way out you can size this up anyway you want to so somebody comes along and he doesnt get results from processing so he goes to subud well look that isnt going to take him anyplace see i mean were the only door there see theres lot of phony doors the fda passes them everyday pills and all this kind of thing and the psychiatrists with their electric shock machines and all this sort of thing man those are traps all right so ive done everything i could possibly thats the status of routine 2 as of today and i have done everything i could possibly do now and will continue to look for indicators and that sort of thing but these indicators are very very precise theyre terribly precise they actually do not admit of any argument list right way to well its going to loosen the needle thats all its going to give you some ta action list wrong way to and in the first few items youre going to see that ta tighten up and the needle tighten up first youll see the needle and then the ta theres practically ta action on wrong way to see and we dont take 15 or 20 pages to find out its wrong way to you see thats just goof and its that kind of goof that puts the pc in mortal danger its that kind of goof see we specialize in wide rses big wide rses thirdofadial stuff dont go mucking around with any sixthofaninch wide rs you see anything smaller than third of dial youre too deep in the bank and i dont care how good it looks as having been complete list if it isnt giving if you havent got that in your ri or didnt have it in your ri why youre listing too deep and your pcs going to pull in lot of mass the pcs going to get in trouble and so forth all right your next point here is that the whole house of cards can fall in if you grabbed first list ri and listed the thing and then abandoned it you got nice wide rs you see lets say it was parts of existence and you had thirdofadial rs and now you go on and youre going to complete that list to find out if you get another one and you get sixthofadial rs you damn well better take the thirdofadial rs you had in the first place and youd better list it right and youd better keep it going you understand because youre not going to get any more rses on the case the case is going to fold up theres where the rses disappear to so the rule here is good big wide rs but that doesnt mean something that is taken from representing rock slamming or rocket reading item you can get big rses if you represent or rock slamming item now on source list youre liable to get the appearance of the ri anywhere on the list your guess is as good as mine i just had one turn up as item number one the first item put on the list rsed and it was the item although it was continued see there it was so source list this is your first source list see that appears anyplace under the sun moon and stars but within reason all other lists each list taken from an ri follow very precise thing its always the last rs of course you can goof this you can goof this you can overlist and overlist and overlist and go 775 items you see beyond the last one and sooner or later itll go and theres another bug shows up that was inherent in something we were doing here when we told the pc that something rsed we were goofing because the pc now represented whatever rsed hoping to get his item on the list you must tell the pc quite something else pc says but that rsed you say good then your item probably wont have anything to do with it you sow him with that propaganda otherwise he will goof your list the way he goofs your list is he lets say you tried and didnt find the rs you didnt find the ri see you listed it down and then you didnt find the ri you understand for some reason or other it didnt appear but he now knows two rsing items one of them fixes in his mind and he tries to do represent of that item in order to complete his list and get an rs on the list see that is goof so we disabuse him of the idea that this is of any use to him whatsoever actually just educationally that we tell him so as an auditor hes got john jones now well we just warn him your item probably wont have anything to do with john jones lets lets get busy now we obviously are nowhere near it now lets get some new ideas here make him list some more otherwise he represents rock slamming item and youll get an increased incidence of rs and you will get all sorts of goofy looking things but that thats piece of auditing thats an error that has been entered by the auditing dont you see well the rule in 212a is that you come to your last rs still ta and you go 50 items beyond your last rs with still ta see fifty items beyond if you exceed that rule youre liable to start tightening the bank and itll start looking like wrong list it wont increase the number of rses but itll start tightening up on the pc that needle starts going tight after 50 thats an interesting datum isnt it in other words that 50 is pretty absolute fact once in blue moon because banks are banks youll have to go more than 50 and suddenly find yourself there you didnt have an ri on the list so you go back to it and you list bit more and you find yourself staring into the teeth of an rs that appeared from place sometimes if youre unlucky and got out of bed that morning didnt put your shoes on right and that sort of thing itll be item 51 i have seen it happen its the very next item the pc put on the list right after the auditor stopped listing very next one everybody tearing his hair out by the roots and the pc says compounded felony you know is the next item he gives it rses like mad the auditor tries to list further goes on the bank starts beefing up everything starts going to hell in balloon you see he now tries to put another 50 on top of it he cant make it so he finally goes back and tests compounded felony and it is the ri and there arent two rsing items on the list and all is well dont you see goofy things like this can be expected to occur but in the final analysis if list is taken from proper item you know proper source list and you got the right ri it goes on around just like clockwork pang pang pang you start having trouble and these rules start going astray when youve got an improper source list or you didnt get the right ri off the first list or you got the wrong ri on the next list so you start having trouble and these rules start going by the boards go back one see this is the third ri youre trying for and it occurs as item number 3 on the new list and your lists uniformly here have been about 15 page lists for this particular gruesome package one of these long listing packages and all of sudden on item number 3 on checkover of trying to find it and so forth matter of fact you find ifs on the first page its item number what the hell well dont consider that its fortuitous man you scrub what you just found see because youre off the wrong ri scrub it right then you see go back and continue that list little bit further and youll all of sudden will find you didnt have the ri see ifs the wrong source list or the wrong ri that causes this 212a thing to go awry and every time it goes awry it piles up mass on the pc and gums up the pc and thats all you have to be wary of is dont go gumming up the pc dont keep running things that pile in mass who was it yesterday apparently pulled piece of screaming genius which is why hes still here after all these god endless months because he pulls them he has an rr this is 3mx now but its the same rules he has an rr that appears on page 12 and its his last rr and he lists to page 17 well where did he think he was going were his brakes busted see couldnt be stopped because oddly enough this rule of 50 in 3mx becomes 25 in other words 212as 50 items you use 50 you see as soon as you get onto 3mx its 25 now all of your errors and difficulties associated in the vicinity of r212a come under these headings complete asinine stupidity just unbelievable stupidity guy is doing it he doesnt know what hes doing and so forth it but when you look it over and try to find it you look for something clever and youre going to find something that is just incalculably stupid thats always nice and gross i had one i should have saved from perth this is an absolute classic this is the most marvelous thing you ever saw and i think i sent it back yes i did well i ought to have kept it its an actual quote found running in session in perth well now im going to read your item to you whatever it was catfish uh all right then the pc said oh well yes catfish thats very interesting did you get anything out of that the pc brightly finally says well did you get nice rs on it oh it didnt rs female voice that happened here you see how the hell do you think yourself around mistakes like this the auditor hasnt got the fantastic essential that you have to have an rs he never got that you see thats the stupidity that you run into your next one your next one is an actual or inadvertent failure to grab this one point that it is the routine 2 it is not the auditing that helps the pc and youll get this kind of cycle going when an auditor first starts in on this christ he has mid ruds and since the last time i audited you mid ruds and every page he turns over he gets in the big mid ruds and every time he gets an item he tiger drills it and he tiger drills endlessly big tiger the item that he reads before and then he endlessly big tigers the other and he never tells the pc anything but just keeps on auditing auditing auditing auditing and you find out 90 percent of your session is consumed in all of this motion now is this auditor this is to be expected see i this we see weve seen this continually so it will go on this way all right then gradually as he gets grip on the fact that its routine 2 well you get diminishment of the auditing and an increase see but he goes down to about 50 percent he gets in his rudiments every at the bottom of every page dont you see or something like this and he has tendency to cut them short here and there you see and he doesnt interrupt the pc from listing just so he can get his rudiments in you know hes learned these facts then by god he gets smooth enough in his presence as an auditor and holding the pc insession and so forth so you hear drill of an item before it is listed you know and you listen in vain and you wont hear any beginning ruds you wont hear any end ruds youll hear some havingness you know and the thing has suddenly gone to 98 percent of the session has become routine 2 you can expect that evolution so dont try particularly to prevent it but just put out the rather snide propaganda that when they finally know their business why they wont be doing this you see thats the best way to handle it oh go ahead put all the rudiments in you think you should youll eventually find out that most of your trouble is coming from your auditing it isnt coming from that so its smoothness of presence its also the smoothness that they can put the rudiment in the rapidity with which they can put these things in and that sort of thing get the idea its the goodness of their trs this all keeps the session running and eventually you arent occupied in patching up the lousy auditing the guy is doing hes auditing very selfconsciously so he knows hes goofing so he expresses it in getting in mid ruds all the time you see he knows hes made mistake so his first thing is well i get id better get in the mid ruds here to get that mistake off see hes called the item three times each time differently see hes mispronounced it some different way each of the three well he says the best thing to do is get in all of my mid ruds you know just its you just get this endless confusion thats because the guy hasnt got the technology as stable datum now you could expect such an evolution now further you can expect the diminishment of error unless the student is permitted to disperse off lists this is golden opportunity an absolute golden opportunity to audit wrong student can audit so wrong that he never learns how to audit right you see what i mean its such narrow catwalk that he never does learn how to audit right because he can do so much dispersal on it see oh he sees the first rs on the list and he calls it again immediately to the pc and he says well thats your reliable item and he tries to represent it but then that gets noplace and it beefs up the bank and so forth so he decides hed better invent something new to go along with this and actually he just goes on dispersal and hell get worse and worse and worse as an auditor and not only the pcs will get destroyed but hell be destroyed as an auditor dont you see so it is of great interest to us in our instruction here to get all these rules packaged up so they dont drift around in the air someplace and then never theorize with student just lay these things into him with an ax actually they exist now see weve got these things i can go back over all of these things and pull them all together into packages and that sort of thing we still in the addition to what ive been giving you here we know these things these things let put it this way are known so we can therefore embark on this kind of an action but when you learn how deviate until so toe the mark and of course the guy after he learns how and toes the mark he sees theres reason at all to deviate you see in his anxiety to get result he will do something else or wonderful and strange dont you see actually it runs off very smoothly if its done right now your next thing the next point here id like to make with you is the things that bring in mass or beef up the bank and that sort of thing normally can be counted on as wrong something is going wrong here but its not necessarily the source you dont just keep picking on source and abandoning lists to correct this mechanism well ive just given you one way this can happen and one of the ways this can happen is the pc is representing an rsing item youll get increased incidence of rs and everything else towards the end of the list youll get beefup of bank hell start looking absolutely haggard and the list is from perfectly good source see well it can be from perfectly good source and listed wrong way to now one of the ways you detect bad source is you cant tell which way to list it theres marked difference you test it what would it oppose and you list dozen items and then you test what would oppose it and you list dozen items and you just cant tell any difference between them thats your best test by the way for wrong source you cant tell the difference between these things well dont go beyond that say to hell with it lets look it over lets look the case over earlier than this point in other words lets look at this source and see if we didnt have wrong source thats when you get wrong source thats when the thing wont list dont go 45 pages to find out its wrong way to and dont go 45 pages both ways to to find out it cant be listed see the time to find that out is very early but watch this mass characteristic watch this mass characteristic you can always expect little mass to show up because hes listing but boy when he starts getting dark its these areas these pouches under the eyes that tell you the whole story and when he starts getting dark under there something is going wrong well dont make up your mind whats going wrong before you see whats going wrong because as ive just given you there can be wild auditing goofs in progress there can be fantastic quantities of auditing and nothing but total suppress and protest on the part of the of the pc dont you see there can be an auditor who never does anything but qanda for instance everything the pc says the auditor does something see and it can be something mechanically wrong it probably is something mechanically wrong however thats the one i would pick on id look over and see what the devil is happening here look look lets see what is happening here and one of the first things very important thing to check is in any way at all this pc representing rock slamming item thats about the first thing to check because he isnt answering the auditing command the way you check that is just how is he answering the auditing command and then you prod him little bit on the subject of are you representing any rock slamming item here or something see has the auditor given you an item and youre now trying to get that on the list see whats going on here and youll find out thats out of gear more often than not but when they cant list and when it wont run right believe it doesnt run right it doesnt go on this cycle pc pretty good pc worse worse worse you know were used to this in oldtime auditing and then it gets better and better and better and the pc comes out of it thats going through something well r212a doesnt go that way it doesnt go that way it can stay on nonimprovement see it can remain on plateau but once it starts over the edge of that plateau and the pc starts getting worse there is something wrong any darkening of the eye pouch dont you see catch it early dont list five pages with him getting lower and lower in the chair and mass crushing in further and further in without investigating this thing now its an interesting thing about the abandonment of lists you abandon too many lists youre really going to get the pc upset but let tell you something about list sources list sources is not anywhere near as critical as you think it is the sources for list are not critical you start in on raw meat pc you can make all kinds of errors and get packages thats not critical point that is point and it has bearing on it but its not that critical now if you find out suddenly that this list source that youre taking comes from rock slamming item an oldsome old 3gaget off of that man because the pc is going to list into discolored skin tone and all of this kind of thing is going to happen but im talking now about lets say you went into the scientology list and he found scientology rock slamming like mad how the hell are you going to correct scientology list how can you increase and finish the auditing the how can you complete scientology list with scientology rock slamming male voice never tried it well you can you can think of all kinds of dodges by which you hope youre doing it but in actual fact youre not doing anything but representing rock slamming item you understand so what the hell buck into it headon so it doesnt list well so the pc has hell of time so the lists are all 22 pages long do it gave you nice big rs third of dial what the hell man and youll find out that youll more often come out right without being so damned gingery about that first list sometimes case folds up just because on the first list there were five rses and the auditor finally grabbed one and then that got abandoned you have to go back and finish that list parts of existence anything like that he had he had sex rock slamming third of dial you tried to complete the list and you came up with rock slam which was quarter of an inch wide youd be so much better off to take sex see and carry it on if it had ever been carried on than to try to correct or rectify dont you see if theres any way you can get rock slamming item that is an ri from that first list or first approach that the person had in case repair do it and expect it to be fluky it will it will not quite follow the rules here and there and that sort of thing so thens when you have to be smart theres where you get your variations dont you see something was done wrong in the first place and when you go back to correct it you find out that youve got to complete what you did so this puts completing cycle of action actually senior to avoiding something because its wrong see completing cycle of action is bit senior to correcting the situation youve got something that will list god help us it lists horribly but it will list well complete it and carry it all around four ways but if youre not going to and this is brandnew case and you see that this thing is just going place dont try to pick an item off of it look youve got to make up your mind you see if youre going to pick up an item off of it youd better carry it on but if youre not going to pick up an item off of it if he if you its just going place you see all the rock slams were only about threeeighths of an inch that sort of thing just tap the pc cheerily on the back and say thats fine now were going to take another list you see but supposing this thing all the way had been delivering great big rock slams well youd better try to get something because it may be that you will never counter another rock slam of that magnitude cherish those big rock slamming lists and do them even if theyre little bit wrong you see the idea is simply this routine 3 has got to be as precise as though its laid out with carpenters square and it is but what are you handling youre handling the goal man and that handles all the mechanics of the gpm and everything will run off just like clockwork not routine 2 routine 2 youre on the outskirts of all this and youre trying to cut yourself channel through see and its fluky and itll go right on being fluky and routine 212a follows rules that are quite precise but the rules only go astray when something is done wrong see the rules go astray when the rules arent followed you got the idea but sometimes because youre on the outside of the gpm anyhow and tickling its edges youve got to take something just because it is rock slamming like crazy and bear through with it because you cant get anything else and youll find out thats superior to leaving it alone you see theres point of judgment involved in the thing but 212a because of the very nature of the thing that its only handling lock items on top of rr items see but an rsing item is only lock on an rr item because youre only handling these locks well with all the lousy auditing you see with all the goofs with auditors reading the supersignificance and by the way never let an auditor monkey with significance of anything particularly in r3 because in r3 lets say the pcs goal was to be dog and the auditor will inevitably take the first rr that he gets which is barking and say obviously its the pcs terminal it never is never its always the oppterm because this goal has passed into the hands of the enemy that goal is only resident in oppterms now isnt that an interesting point and the next item up the auditor of significance you see to eat bones oh goody goody goody goody see goody goody thats fine thats terminal dont even have to test it bull see so just the rule is significance never pay any attention to the significance of an item just never do just neglect it utterly just do it by mechanical test but expect 212a to be random and grab what you can get or grab what has been listed wide take allowances for the pc listing rock slamming items and that sort of thing you can get something on that list to rs widely when read again and there arent two things on the list that are grab it man i dont care if it came from item one see if you get something there or if something was taken off that list that rsed well and then was listed somehow make that list come out to something because that pc will never be right until you have go all the way around in other words you understand male voice yes you can find the rs neglect it list it bury it goof it and then get nice complete list with little tiny rs that wont list that tears the pc to ribbons you got get the idea so just specialize on that big rs just make sure that it didnt come from representing rock slamming item or rock reading item just go on you cant miss in other words old 210 and 212 when they were originally put out are correct you can just take the mostest read that you found on list one and represent it all the way around and the person will be much happier auditor you see that i mean its simple but with great precision what is the perfect way to do it is to complete the list one you see that 210 and 212 were actually not totally invalidated by 2 12a just some new indicators and data came along you can still take 212 and get someplace with it now we got to get results without knocking people in the head thats thats what we got to do now we got to teach them to get results without knocking people in the head at these original stages and the liability of the routine 2 is that it will knock people in the head but usually knocks people in the head when done goofily you get to figuring too hard you think too hard you try to figure yourself to death on the thing you try to get yourself into some kind of weird state of what the waw and if it woo and then it wrr just settle it all down did anything rs here oh yeah and did we ever have an rs was it ever listed you know this kind of thing well did well god almighty get something off that new list we dont care if its cycled get something off of it find out if its terminal or oppterm chase this guy around the block into fourpackage of it and hell be happy as clam this is actually how you settle it down see its actually crude settle down its not very precise settle down because its not very precise process see because youre you couldnt be but if that it has rules at all and that 212a could be evolved is fantastic because youre handling locks on the goal always has liability always is slippy but find great big rs and run with it thats fine if you can do it do it and youll come out right and the pc will be better every time find great big rs and do something else and try to be perfect with something else and find something else and try to find something else youre going to wind up with 38th of an inch rs which when you try to do it pulls the whole bank in on the pc so were trying to get the maximum gain with the least bank pulled in on the pc and that is the rule you are trying to follow see and that rule is accomplished by finding the widest rs and making package out of it we dont care how we got the rs as long as it isnt from representable rock slamming item and youll find out youll have wonderful success with this if you follow it now in 2mx in the routine 3mx we got an absolute doll which is as which is as different from 212 routine 2 approaches as you ever heard of and its an absolute doll that thing is just carpenters square its just exactly on the lists are shorter they run more rapidly it is very swift its always the last rocket reading item on the list you know if you overlist it tightens the bank thats by the rule of 25 and the only variety which youll find is if you havent prepchecked the goal and the goal is slugged up like crazy and it wont rocket read well but its persistent in its rocket reading you know its tested tuesday and it got one rocket read out of it and its tested friday and it got one rocket read oh to hell with it list it see that kind of thing
