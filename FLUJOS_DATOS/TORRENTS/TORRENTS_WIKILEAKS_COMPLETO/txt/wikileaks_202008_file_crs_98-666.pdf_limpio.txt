well as steelhead trout are anadromous ie they live as juveniles in fresh water migrate to the ocean to develop and when sexually mature return to freshwater to spawn while steelhead trout and atlantic salmon can return to the sea after spawning and may spawn again in subsequent years pacific salmon die after spawning once juvenile salmon typically reside in fresh water from few days pink salmon to three years some sockeye salmon before migrating to the ocean where they typically spend 16 years before migrating to their natal stream as much as 900 miles or more inla nd natural phenomena predators droughts floods and fluctuatin g oceanic conditions stress salmonids and contribute to the variable bundance of their populations niño pacific decadal oscillation1 and global

currently 28 distinct population segments of five salmonid species have been listed as either endangered or threatened unde r the endangered species act see table 1 with three additional populations identified as species of concern5 while species of anadromous trout or salmon is in danger of nearterm extinc tion individual population segments designated as evolutionarily significant units or esus6 within these species have declined substantially or have even been extirpated the american fisheries society considers at least 214 pacific co ast anadromous fish populations to be at risk while at least 106 other historically abundant popul ations have already become extinct7 human activities stressing fish anadromous salmonids inhabit clean silt free streams of low water temperature below 68 f and quality estu arine nursery habitat human activities logging grazing mining agriculture urban development and consumptive water use can degrade aquatic habitat silt can cover streambed gravel smothering eggs poorly constructed roads often increase siltation in streams where adult salmon spawn and young salmon rear removal of streamsi trees and shade frequently leads to higher water temperatures grazing cattle remove streamside vegetation and exacerbate streambank erosion urbanization ty pically brings stream channelization and filled wetlands alte ring food supplies and nursery habita t habitat alterations can lead to increased salmonid predation by marine mammals birds and other fish water diversions for agriculture exacerbate these pr oblems according to state water

anadromous fish the 31 dams ie hydro projects in the federal columbia river power syst em fcrps produce about 40 of the power in the pacific northwest and the reservoirs behind these dams create major navigable waterway as far inland as lewiston idaho wh ile the design of some dams is described as fishfriendly eg wells dam on th columbia river in washington poorly designed dams can physically bar or impede anadromous fish migrations to and from the sea kill juveniles as they pass through dams turbines and expose fish to potentially harmful gas supersaturation8 if delayed by dams durin g migration both young and old salmon can be exposed to increased predation to an increased risk of bacterial infections and to higher temperatures which cause stress and sometimes death9 decreased river flow can also harm juveniles by delaying their downstream migration changing fcrps operations to benefit salmon is controversial in part because costs of dam and power generation changes are passed along to pow er customers through increased rates the goal of fish hatcheries operated along the pacific coast since 1877 has been the augmentation of natural salmonid populations and the pr oduction of fish to replace those lost where dams completely bloc ked passage and dest royed native salmonid populations today at least 80 of the salmon caught commercially in the pacific northwest and northern california each year come from hatcheries in the 1970s however scientists disc overed that some hatc hery practices reduced genetic diversity in fish populations10 the mixing of populations by tcheries and tran splantation has generally resulted in decreased genetic fitness of wild popul ations and the loss of some streamspecific adaptations so hatchery fish generally ve lower survival rates than wild fish and are less able to adjust to ch anging ocean conditions or to escape predators the harvest of intermingled fish popula tions from different watersheds presents several problems including how to protect esalisted populations while promoting the harvest of abundant native and hatchery fish since hatche ries are often more productive than natural fish populations ma naging fisheries to avoid surp lus returns to hatcheries can result in overharvested natu ral populations controversy arises when managers must consider how much the harvest of abundant popul ations must be curt ailed to protect less abundant esalisted populations such policies can frustrate both commercial fishermen and sport anglers esalisted or seriously depressed populations thus can become the limiting factor on fisheries resulting in tens of millions of dollars in foregone fishing opportunities to avoid further depr essing the weakest populations protection and rest oration

statement which can authorize limited take ie harm of the species and specify r easonable and prudent measures that might minimize harm if nmfs issues jeopard opinion it includes reasonable and prudent alternative rpa actions whic h could be taken to avoid je opardizing the species nmfs issues numerous biops related to salmon each year for example 1995 biop for the us army corps of engineers and the bonneville power administration sought to develop biologically sound strategy to deal with salmon passage in the columbia and snake rivers the major impact of this bi op and its 1998 supplement has been the move away from transporting the majority of juven ile salmonids downstream by truck or barge instead the adopted spread the risk policy supplements barge transport and reduces fish mortality by increasing the spill of water and fish over dams to circumvent turbines in 2000 the corps completed system operati ons review of the columbia and snake river hydropower system with breaching the four lower snake river dams considered as one among many options as result in december 2000 nmfs issued revised biop that reviewed the strategies outlin ed in the 1995 and 1998 biops and recommended changes this biop did not recommend breaching snake river dams but did include steps to consider breach should the rpa fail revised 2004 jeopardy biop did not include breaching and was remanded to noaa by the federal district court of oregon although not due to dam breaching issues13 noaa released revised biops on may 5 200814 the final revised biops are being review ed by the court

and tribal councils in devel oping comprehensive salmon ma nagement efforts states generally seek to forestall listings or if listings do occur to reduce federal involvement affecting state managed lands with limited st aff and funding to implement wide range of programs nmfs has encour aged integrated management efforts ie habitat conservation plans among federal state and tribal agencies as tool to save listed species and avoid future listing of additi onal esus through comprehensive recovery efforts nmfs viewed the oregon coastal salmon restoration initiative ocsri to promote comprehensive and proactive stateba sed recovery efforts and avoid listing coho salmon in oregon as precedent for federalstate local partnerships however federal court decision clarified that to avoid an ev entual listing plans ca nnot be based primarily on speculative or proposed future measures but must instead be based on recovery measures that are enforceable or reasonab ly likely to occur for instance measures embodied in laws regulations or long range and stable funding mechanisms15 with the listing of many salmonid esus in the columb ia river basin new options for governance are being explored by federal state and tr ibal parties restoration efforts for some california salmon including wa ter reforms were embodied in the central valley project improvement act title xxxiv of pl 102575 and the san joaquin river restoration program16 under this authority the us fish and wildlife service fws has coordinated plans for fish screens fish dders and water polluti on reduction to recover native fish populations in th central valley project area in 1993 nmfs issued an interim policy on artificial propagation of pacific salmon under the to guide how hatcheries shoul d be used to help recover salmonids17 in response to litigation over the ro of hatcheries in salmon recovery policy statement defined how hatchery fish are to be treated when deciding whether esus should be listed under the esa18 in general the policy is to rec over wild populations in their natural habitat wherever possible without resor ting to artificial pr opagation washington oregon and british columbia ma ssmark hatchery coho salmon by fin clipping so that marked fish can be readily identified by fishermen as hatchery fish and selectively harvested while unmarked native fish can be released to spawn similar programs are underway for other species such as chinook salmon and steelhead trout in early 2006 an independent scientific panel began collaborative review to identify 1 hatchery programs that are not contributing to salmon recovery and 2 ways to reduce the harvest of esalisted fish19 the final report of this pane l is due in december 2008 an fws review of columbia river tcheries for their
