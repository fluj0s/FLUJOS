in the wic program state health agencies exercise substantial control in the school meal prog rams local educational agencies leas and local school food authorities most of ten have the major role in very few instances the federal government fns takes the place of state agencies for example where state has chosen not to operate specific program or where there is state prohibition on aiding private schools at the st ate level education health social services and agriculture departments all have roles at minimum they are responsible for approving and overseeing local providers such as schools summer program sponsors and child care centers as well as making sure they receive the federal support they are due at the local level program benefits are provided to more than 39 million children and infants and some 2 million lowerincome pregnant and postpartum women through just over 100000 public and private schools and residential child care institutions about 200000 child care centers and

served are subsidized those rved free or at reduced price to lower income children are supported at higher rate s all federal mea lsnack subsidy rates are indexed annually for inflation2 as are the

products produced th ere if they are produced in sufficient quantities to meet schools needs 5 participating schools may offer all meals free and not make annual freereducedprice eligibility determinations for individual student s or separately count free reducedprice and fullprice meals if they pay any extra cost ie claim from the federal government only the estimated amount they would have received if they had operated regular free reducedprice and fullprice meal program this choice generally is used by schools with very high proportions of needy children it reduces the burden of making individual eligibility determinations and simplifies daily meal counts and procedures for claiming continuedadministrative standards under state overs ight and follow buy american rules4 however there is only minimal federal regulation of foods offered separately from subsidized school meals competitive foods such as carte items and food sold from vending machines cash subsidies are set by federal school l unch law and indexed annually each july for inflation and the amount of fede ral aid is not dependent on providers costs these cash subsidies also called reimburse ment rates

eligibility determinations in the first year of fouryear cycle in the following three years they count the total number of meals served and the perc entages of free reducedprice and fullprice meals served in the first year are applied to the total meal count to calculate their federal subsidies under provision 3 schools can for four years receive federal subsidies equal to those received in the last year in which they made freereducedprice eligibility determinations adjusted for enrollment changes and inflation for both provisions schools may be approved for fouryear extensions if the composition of their school population remains stable 6 this free fresh fruit and vegetable program is funded separately from the school lunch program it began as pilot project established by the 2002

noted above for the school lunch and breakfast programs for july 2006june 2007 the subsidies for snacks are 65 cents for free snacks 32 cents for reducedprice snacks and 6 cents for all other snacks however unlike the school meal programs while federal cash subsidies differ according to the family income of individual children in center there is requirement that free or reducedprice meals be served centers may adjust their fees to account for the federal subsidies or charge or not charge separately for meals to acc ount for the subsidies but the cacfp itself does not regulate the fees they charge the cacfp generally operates through child care centers that are public or private nonprofit entities however forprofit child care centers can participate in the cacfp if they meet certain conditions they are qualified if they receive at least some payments derived from title xx of the social security act the federal social services block grant for at least 25 of enrolled children13 in addition under pilot project that began operating in iowa and kentucky more liberal test can be applied to forprofit centers they may participate if at least 25 of enrolled children meet the family income requirements for fr eereducedprice school meals this pilot was expanded to delaware in fy2002 fi nally under provisions of law enacted in december 2000 pl 106554 the more liberal

separately the cacfp provides cash subsidies to family and group day care homes typically serving four to six ch ildren this component operates very differently than the component for centers although like centers subsidies for day care homes are limited to two meals and one snack or one meal and two snacks per day per child day care homes receive cash subsidies that generally do not differ by individual childrens family income unlike the subsid structure in programs for schools and child care centers which differs according to the family income of the child to whom the mealsnack is served16 instead there are two distinct sets of subsidy rates that generally depend on the location of the hom or the providers income tier i homes those located in lowerincome ar eas or operated by

and similar to the progra m in centers day care home sponsors may opt to have subsidies calculated according to the family income demographics of the children in the homes they sponsor if family income documentation is obtained17 day care homes participate under the aeg is of public or private nonprofit sponsoring organizations that handle administrative tasks eg overseeing compliance with

support the agricultural economy most prominently following the enactment of section 32 of the agricultural act of august 24 1935 in 1974 basic entitlement to commodity assistance was placed in child nutrition law in addition to cash subsidies schools which receive the bulk of federally donated commodities and othe r providers are entitled to specific dollar value of commodities based on the number of meals they serve21 the inflationindexed each july commodity entitlement is set at 1675 cents meal for the 20062007 school year the department purchases these commodities and pays for most processing costs to fulfill this guarantee with the go als of meeting the preferences of recipient agencies supporting agricultural prices and removing agricultural surpluses schools and other providers also receive bonus commodities donated from federal stocks acquired at the departments discre tion for agricultural support reasons eg surplus commodities and excess commodity credit corporation holdings these bonus commodities were valued at 120 million in fy2005 finally the value of commodity dona tions both entitlement and bonus must equal at least 12 of the total cash and commodity assistance provided under the school lunch program if this 12 requirement is not met the agriculture department is required to purchase and distribute add itional commodities to schools
