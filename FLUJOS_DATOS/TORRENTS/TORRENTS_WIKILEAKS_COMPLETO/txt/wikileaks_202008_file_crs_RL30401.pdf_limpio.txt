fy1996fy1998 introduction eighty benefit programs provide cash and noncash aid that is directed primarily to persons with limited income these benefit programs cost 3917 billion in fy1998 up 31 from fy1997 and equal to 46 of the gross domestic product gdp higher medical spending accounted for 103 billion of the years net increase of 118 billion and for the first time medical benefits accounted for half of all incometested spending welfare represented the same share of the federal budget 168 as in fy 1997 but slightly smaller share of gross domestic product 46 compared to 47 in 1997 federal funds provided 708 of the total see table 1 for fy1996fy1998 summary after adjustment for price inflation 1998 welfare spending was up 15 58 billion from that of 1997 an increase of 74 billion in real spending 1998 dollars for medical benefits more than offset declines totaling 27 billion for food aid jobs and training and energy assistance real spending increases medical benefits 39 services 54 education benefits 18 and housing aid 06 in real terms cash benefit outlays held steady of fy1998 welfare dollars more than half 501 were spent on medical aid spending for medical aid exceeded combined outlays for benefits in all other forms cash food housing education jobs and training services and energy aid spending for human capital programs ones providing education jobs and training accounted for less than 6 of all welfare dollars actual spending for jobs and training is somewhat understated because some other benefit programs including public housing food stamps and temporary assistance for needy families have work and training components this report consists of catalog of 80 needbased programs1 including some that made final outlays in fy19972 and two new programs state

rounding program data on which this table is based are found in table 12httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30401crs3 3 editions of this report before 1991 counted the entire eitc both the refund and the reduced tax liability historical tables in this report use only direct eitc outlays 4 this report excludes the child tax credit enacted in 1997 pl 10534 portion of this credit may be refundable for taxpayers with three or more qualifying children depending on the social security taxes they pay and the eitc they receive however in 1998 child tax credits were refunded nature of programs most of these programs base eligibility on individual household or family income but some use group or area income tests and few offer help on the basis of presumed need most provide income transfers that is they transfer income in the form of cash goods or services to persons who make payment and render service in return however in the case of the job and training programs and some educational benefits recipients must work or study for wages training allowanc stipends grants or loans further the tanf block grant program requires adults to commence work after period of enrollment the food stamp program imposes work and training requirements and public housing programs require recipients to engage in selfsufficiency activities or to perform community service finally the earned income tax credit eitc is available only to workers this report excludes income maintenance programs that are not income tested including social insurance and many veterans benefits and all but one tax transfer program thus it excludes social security cash benefits unemployment compensation and medicare the oldage survivors and disability insurance programs social security cash benefit programs in fy1998 paid out almost as much as all incometested programs total of 372 billion financed primarily from payroll tax collections the report also excludes payments even though financed with general revenues that may be regarded as deferred compensation such as veterans housing benefits and medical care for veterans with serviceconnected disability the report includes one taxtransfer program the refundable earned income tax credit eitc for lowincome workers with children this credit reduces the taxes of working families with gross income below specified limit in 1999 26928 for families with one child 30580 for those with more children and makes direct payments refunds to those whose income is below the income tax threshold or whose tax liability is smaller than their credit this report treats the direct payment component of the eitc but not the reduction in tax liability as welfare expenditure3 other tax benefits are excluded from the report because they are not refundable make direct payments4 further in most cases they impose income test for eligibility examples of these other tax benefits are the deductibility of mortgage interest and property taxes on owneroccupied homes causing estimated revenue losses of 517 billion and 178 billion respectively in 1998 these tax transfers increase families disposable income by reducing their tax liability and are known as tax expenditures the standard deduction and personal exemption in the income tax code also decrease families taxable incomehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30401crs4 billiondollar programs in fy1998 in fy1998

standards apply to different population groups within state with some exceptions medicaid is available only to persons with very low income however medicaid does not cover everyone who is poor only 45 of persons in poverty received medicaid benefits at any time during 1995 there are two basic reasons for this first state income limits tied to former afdc cash assistance criteria and which continue to be applicable for medicaid eligibility determination for some families with children are well below the poverty level second medicaid eligibility is subject to categori cal restrictions that is it is available only to low income persons who are aged blind disabled members of families with dependent children and certain other pregnant women and children the medicaid statute defines more than 50 distinct population groups as potentially eligible including those for which coverage is mandatory and those that states may elect to cover the various eligibility groups have traditionally been divided into two basic classes the categorically needy and the medically needy the two terms once distinguished between welfarerelated beneficiaries and those qualifying only under special medicaid rules however nonwelfare groups have been added to the categorically needy list over the years the scope of covered services that states must provide to the categorically needy is much broader than the minimum scope of services for the medically needy see the section on benefits most of the eligible categories fall into seven basic groups lowincome families with children meeting the financial and categorical criteria under the former afdc program and low income aged blind or disabled persons meeting the eligibility rules for receipt of supplemental security income or ssi families meeting the eligibility requirements of state afdc programs on july 16 1996 are eligible for medicaid even if they do not qualify for tanf states may modify their rules governing income and resource standards

income is too high or because they fail to meet the programs categorical restrictions coverage of some children in this category the ribicoff4 children was made optional when medicaid was enacted in 1965 but in the 1980s congress began requiring coverage of nonafdc children of certain ages with family income below specified income levels the medically needy persons who do not meet the financial standards for cash assistance programs but meet the categorical standards and have income and resources within specified medically needy limits established by the states persons whose incomes or resources are above those standards may also qualify by spending down incurring medical bills that reduce their income andor resources to the specified levels coverage of the medically needy is optional as of august 1996 35 states and other jurisdictions covered at least some groups of the medically needy5 persons requiring institutional care special eligibility rules apply to persons receiving care in nursing facilities nfs or intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded icfsmr or who are participating in alternative community care programs for the aged and disabled many of these persons may have incomes well above the poverty level but qualify for medicaid because of the very high cost of their care lowincome medicare beneficiaries medicaid pays required medicare premiums deductibles and coinsurance on behalf of low income aged and disabled medicare beneficiaries coverage is restricted to medicare costsharing unless the beneficiary also qualifies for medicaid

apply to refugees asyleeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30401crs37 6 this group will become largely obsolete as states are required to phase in coverage of children under age 19 with incomes below poverty however some states might then still choose to cover ribicoff children aged 19 and 20lawful permanent aliens and individuals and their families who have served in the military qualified aliens and nonqualified aliens who otherwise meet medicaid categorical and financial eligibility rules may receive emergency services only families pregnant women and children medicaideligible families pregnant women and children fall into two basic groups those meeting afdc standards as of july 16 1996 and those qualifying under series of targeted medicaid expansions that began in the 1980s afdcrelated groups medicaid eligibility for afdcrelated groups was affected significantly by both the personal responsibility and work opportunities reconciliation act of 1996 prwora pl 104193 which replaced the afdc cash assistance program with the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant program and the balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 pl 10533 for afdcrelated families the net effect of these two laws is 1 for new eligibles states must use afdc income and resource standards in effect on july 16 1996 and 2 families meeting afdc eligibility criteria prior to prwora remain eligible for medicaid states may modify their rules governing income and resource standards for afdcrelated groups such modifications can be made by raising incomeresource standards up to the percentage increase in the consumer price index cpi after july 16 1996 or by lowering income standards to applicable levels lower than those in effect on may 1 1988 or by using incomeresource methodologies that are less restrictive than those in effect on july 16 1996 mandatory states must continue medicaid assistance for recipients of adoption assistance and foster care under title ive of the social security act transitional or extended benefits are available to families who lose medicaid eligibility due to increased earnings or child or spousal support payments if the family loses medicaid eligibility because of increased earnings or hours of employment medicaid coverage is extended for 12 months during the second 6 months premium can be imposed the scope of benefits might be limited or alternate delivery systems might be used if the family loses medicaid because of increased child or spousal support coverage is extended for 4 months pregnant women and children are exempt from tanf work requirements and retain their medicaid eligibility optional states are permitted to cover additional afdcrelated groups states may cover children in families whose income and resources are within afdc standards as of july 16 1996 but who do not meet the definition of dependent child also known as ribicoff children states may cover such children up to maximum age of 18 19 or 20 and may limit

children who are defined in terms of family income and resources7 rather than in terms of their ties to cash welfare programs mandatory states must cover pregnant women and children under age 6 with family incomes below 133 of the federal poverty income guidelines the state may impose resource standard that is more restrictive than that for ssi in the case of pregnant women or afdc as of july 16

pregnant women and infants under age 1 with family incomes up to 185 federal poverty level fpl in addition through other provisions of medicaid law including waivers of eligibility rules as well as through medicaid expansions under the state childrens health insurance program described below states are permitted to cover additional pregnant women and children with incomes above applicable federal mandatory minimum levels for example as of may 1998 38 states exceeded the minimum 133 fpl income criteria for pregnant women as did 39 states for infants under age 1 year and 16 states for children ages 1 to 5 years similarly 19 states exceeded the 100 fpl income criteria for children ages 6 to 14 years prior to full phasein of mandatory coverage minimum income levels for medicaid eligibility for children ages 14 to 19 years in 1998 were tied to afdc related standards in effect as of july 16 1996 these income levels were often well below poverty guidelines in 1998 34 states went beyond minimum afdcrelated income criteria and extended medicaid eligibility to children ages 14 to 19 years with family incomes at or above 100 fpl finally states have the option of continuing medicaid eligibility for current child beneficiaries for up to 12 months without redetermination of eligibility states are also allowed to extend medicaid coverage to children under 19 years of age on

additional ssp amount in 1998 was 36 per month for an individual living independently8 mandatory states are generally required to cover ssi recipients however states may use more restrictive eligibility standards for medicaid than those for ssi if they were using those standards on january 1 1972 before the implementation of ssi in 1998 11 states used more restrictive standards known as

states may use different definitions of disability more restrictive income and resource limits or methodologies for determining income and resources different from those used under ssi states using more restrictive income standards must allow applicants to spend down deduct incurred medical expenses from income before determining eligibility for example if an applicant has monthly income of 600 not including any ssi or state supplement payment and the states maximum allowable income is 500 the applicant would become eligible for medicaid after incurring 100 in medical expenses in that month states must continue medicaid coverage for several defined groups of individuals who lose ssi or ssp eligibility the qualified severely impaired are disabled persons who return to work and lose ssi eligibility because of earnings but still have the condition that originally rendered them disabled and who meet all nondisability criteria for ssi except income medicaid must be continued for these persons if they need continued medical assistance to continue working and their earnings are not sufficient to provide the equivalent of ssi medicaid and attendant care benefits for which they would qualify in the absence of earnings states must also continue medicaid coverage for persons who were once eligible for both ssi and social security payments and who lose ssi because of costofliving

medicare or medicaid eligibility for medical benefits from va conveys varying degrees of rights in principle all veterans are eligible to receive services from va medical facilities however the potential total amount of services available to all veterans is contingent on appropriations veterans with highpriority rights are generally assured full array of services and those with lowerpriority are provided services if space and resources are available there is evidence that any veterans were denied services at any va facility in fy1998 and denials are expected during fy1999 except for nursing home care which is provided only on spaceavailable basis regardless of priority status highest priority for the full range of medical services is granted to veterans with severe

million veterans qualify for free care because they meet the lowincome standards veteran applying for care under the lowincome eligibility test is advised that reported income is subject to verification by matching the amount shown on the application with income reported to the internal revenue service irs once eligible under the income rules veteran remains eligible until determined upon annual reevaluation to longer meet the income standard for years before fy1999 it is estimated that roughly 58 of the total cost of va medical services could be attributed to persons who met an
