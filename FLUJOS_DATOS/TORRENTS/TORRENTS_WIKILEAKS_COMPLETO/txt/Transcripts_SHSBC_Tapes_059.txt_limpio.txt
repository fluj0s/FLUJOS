shsbc 59 question and answer period prehav sec checks arc break process lecture given on 19 september 1961 thank you how you doing today huh audience good okay now the state of affairs today is that you have now decided that there was something you needed to know about scientology and questions are in order the date is what the 19th or audience member the 19th of september 19 september ad 11 all right and i am in the way of questions questions one two yes audience member how much of an assessment by elimination do you do on the prehav scale how much of an assessment by elimination do you do on prehav scale this became burning question back in july so burning that there is at least one person who has scars you do repeater technique on the prehav scale and you have pc in more trouble than could ordinarily be gotten into by the income tax bureau now thats lot of trouble now hes all messed up you know all of the data we have actually answers these questions from away back if you knew the progress of data and your subjective reality and your validity of the datas good you can work these things out normally but theres an old rule from about 1950 that you can ask an auditing question two or three times you can ask it two or three times and then skip it you can do it three well thats borderline two sometimes you wish you hadnt one certainly one always now when youre asking these questions on an assessment on the prehav scale youre running straight up against this old rule how often can you repeat level without running process now that is the question which leaps up there how often can you read level to the pc without then being guilty of auditing him do you understand now if you do repeater technique or you do too many readings of levels you of course have audited the whole prehav scale on the preclear and of course hes in mess so the governing factor is simple one is how do you get an accurate assessment on the prehav scale without actually auditing the prehav scale on the preclear now that is the question and the way you do it is very precise way and this is the way i do it and i have always gotten away with it and auditing you know is what you get away with and ive never had any difficulty with this but other approaches have brought about difficulty uniformly and routinely have brought about difficulty and therefore this is the one i recommend which is probably the first one and the earliest one of these things i have great confidence in this method of assessment you take the whole prehav scale the primary scale and you start at the bottom of the scale the original one i by the way i will give you the very very original one just to start off with this is not the one but this is the way i used to do it and i never got in trouble with this one either ill give you the earliest shall i i just remembered there was another one you started at the bottom of the scale and you read up scale to the pc until you got rising needle and then you quit and went back down the scale again and you just took the one which reacted the most going up and reacted the most coming back and if it was the same level why you had it made and if that wasnt it then you separated out with just brief read of the one read of the other one found out which was the most and thats the one you took that is the original by the way i remember that that was johannesburg all right now auditors had trouble with that one and when the prehav scale became very expanded we ran into the first method of assessment for the new expanded prehav scale primary levels and thats this is the proper one and this is the one im going to give you now and this is the way you do it now you wont get into any trouble if you master this particular method of doing it you start at the bottom and you just read the levels up the scale all the way to the top and wherever you get needle reaction an instant reaction of the emeter needle you make dot at that level now in view of the fact that youre going to use the mimeographed sheet several times sometimes you make crosses sometimes you make circles sometimes you make dots you know but use one symbol for one assessment so youll be able to differentiate it and every time you get reaction just on one read you put down your symbol and when youve gotten all the way to the top you will find that you have gotten several levels reacting several levels reacted now this has an added advantage and at this time you could count and find out how many levels were active on this preclear the last time you assessed him for level and if you now have more you know that youre in trouble and you had better assess the goal and assess the terminal and check these things out and particularly the terminal because you may not have proper terminal assessment you may not have proper goals assessment so that is very close watch you have to keep the first three or four assessments on the prehav scale because that tells you whether or not your goals or terminals assessment was right thats the way you check it out thats aside from exactly how you do it routinely assuming you had the proper one you have now reached the top now you go back down and you dont hit every level of the prehav scale you dont read it all the way back down from the top you simply read those levels that you made mark on and you read those on down to the bottom and now you go back up and now you only read those that have two marks after them and at that time unless your rudiments are out and everything is nutty and going wrong youve got your level theres only one reacting there will only be one that accumulates three thered be something quite wrong if you got three or four accumulating three but it sometimes happens that on the last read up you will get two levels that have three marks after them now what you do is read do the same system you read the one you read the other one and youll notice one dropped out and itll drop out right now and when i say read it i mean just repeat it once to the pc now there is complete assessment on prehav scale the length of time which this takes is very very short there is practically time involved in it at all this actually is totality of about six or seven minutes at the absolute outside and somebody that tells they are taking fifteen minutes to assess on the prehav scale i know they are doing something wrong and if somebody that takes session to assess on the prehav scale boy i know theyre wrong i have doubt about that but let now tell you the numerous errors which auditors make in doing this number one they expect the preclear to answer so they wait after every read see and they say this would king have faith now they wait for the preclear to answer and the preclear has nothing to do with the assessment we care not for the preclears opinions of assessments we care not for the preclears opinions of the rightness and wrongness of anything assessments whether theyre goals terminals or level are totally between the auditor and the emeter they are not anything to do the preclear had nothing to do with this he might as well be on long distance lead and in the next county thats just if you just figure it just to that degree you do not have to be in good communication with him nothing has to be there you just read them and you get an instant reaction he does not have to say anything you dont tell him to say anything you dont ask him for his opinion nothing these are all methods of wasting time how fast can you read these things you can read these things almost as fast as you can talk how fast can you read the scale from the bottom to the top without any pauses the funny part of it is that you would get the same reading because its only going to require tenth of second for that level to react if its going to react its going to react and that is it and if you were very very sharp and you were very close you could actually catch the reaction while catching your breath to say the next word see thats how close together that thing could be but thats an extremity and that looks like its too much strain and it isnt good auditor presence to do that so you rather easily read them you see thats the first and foremost they expect the pc to say something and the pc shouldnt say anything to hell with it i mean thats nonsense now the next error which they make is to get oneway flow started you see would king blank would king blank would king blank would king blank would king blank now what are they doing they got oneway flow and halfway up the scale theyre going to get stuck very tricky way of doing this and by the way this is just trickiness and this is not pat method of doing it this is not fixed method this little thing im about to give you here which is just way to do it is you read would king blank would you ______ king would king blank would you ______ king you got the idea would you have faith in king you see for one level so its back and forth back and forth so you got twoway flow established as you go up the thing you got the idea so you dont get him on stuck flow anyplace in other words pc to the terminal terminal to the pc pc to the terminal terminal to the pc you see you just you get how that is somebody got prehav scale ill show you what i mean there will be slightest doubt i felt little doubt little dark cloud of doubt went up over your heads at that moment all right would king have faith in you you see thats one flow king to you what would you cause king bum auditing command would king prevent you from knowing how would you have effect on king see how could king affect you would you run an obsessive canthave on king would king make something of you how would you create king get the flipflop back and forth all right that prevents stuck flow from happening as you assess this thing using how you will find uniformly as you do this is much more easily done now ill give you how i would actually ask the pc these things i would ask pc these things i would have him on the meter let give you the next error the next error is to be looking at the pc or the list when youre saying the word because an instant reaction occurs before you can shift your eyes from the list or the pc back to the meter so you have little drill which you should develop in yourselves that runs like this you look at the list to get the level you look at the meter and you say the list you speak while looking at the meter got that now actually thats just little bit tricky youll find some of you will find thats just little bit tricky to do at the first few trials and youll find it sort of seems odd to you see youre not reading the paper youre apparently reading the meter and youve actually had to put the list over here on the meter you know its like this all right ill give you an example of it weve got to form this up in our minds you see would you have faith in king see but actually you dont do it that way you look at the list you say would you have faith in king thank you what would king cause thank you how would you prevent king knowing thank you got the idea paper meter pc paper meter pc paper meter pc got the idea now reading it at about that speed permits the pc to keep up with you so he analytically can keep up with you his reactive mind is keeping up with you the whole way you see that thats just about that speed you just go paper meter pc paper meter pc paper meter pc read it off the paper mentally say it while looking at the meter and then look at and acknowledge the pc and then come back with your pencil and make the dot so youve made little circle each time you do this little circle and you keep doing that and all of sudden it gets very natural theres nothing much to it now i punch these things all right would you have faith in king thank you what would king cause thank you got the idea cause well we dont care about kings when youre assessing something hit it with your voice now thats little circular trick on how to do an assessment when you get that thing down grooved totally you find out your assessments become much more positive and reliable why well youre doing it on positive reliable basis of course we dont expect anybody in this course to look at the meter fixedly for quite some time be sure you look at the meter for some time first it makes the meter calmer and if you look at the meter you look at the meter and then you look at the list and youd say well have you got faith well wasnt any reaction on that was there just avoid the emeter never confront the emeter and youll have messy auditing the whole way now its very easy for human being to confront human being theyre fixated on bodies anyhow so they all too often will be fixated on body and they all too often get their tr 0 about half flat and it leads them into fix you see and there they are auditing tr 0 you see while theyre doing an assessment and actually any scientologist can be knocked totally out of session by suddenly noticing that at time has the auditor ever looked at the meter while he was asking the question and he immediately his own training gets in his road he doesnt like to duplicate bad auditing activity so hes liable to call the auditors attention to the fact you didnt look at the meter how do you know whether that is right or wrong now of course this has never happened in this unit but you see how that would go all right now thats about all there is to know about one of these assessments anything else about one of these assessments is pure additity and some people do have an addectivity an addictivity to additity additity thats right so dont do it dont put lot of other things on this assessment because that is the way you do one and your assessment will always be right by the way on general assessments of goals and terminals do you realize that mary sue catches you out something on the order of 50 percent of the time wrong goal wrong terminal did you realize that was happening thats something to be worried about because theres only one way you can louse up pc and thats to have the wrong goal and the wrong terminal everything is negative gain not only is all auditing from that point wasted but it actually worsens the pc to audit the wrong terminal okay so you got to be sharp on this youve got to be very good on this and youve got to be very good youve got to know how to get the right goal youve got to know how to get the right terminal youve got to know whether or not theyre right and youve got to know what to do when you find out theyre wrong now those things are paramount in importance theyre paramount i just couldnt emphasize them enough this you must learn how to do here if you learn nothing else for heavens sake learn how to assess and as i say mary sue is finding you out about 50 percent of the time thats too many man thats too much and has never found perfect set of rudiments i dont think to date and never found all rudiments in on the pc to date when checking and doing crosscheck on terminal thats commentary its not good one so get all of your rudiments in keep them in and after you have found the persons goal run your end rudiments check the persons goal before you get somebody else to check it same way with terminals do identically the same thing with terminals and you wont be making so many misses its quite ordinary for somebodys quote goal to be found unquote or terminal to be found unquote and then come down to get it checked and for two or one rudiment to be out the goal or the terminal whatevers being found not just slightly incorrect but totally incorrect and for the goal or terminal to be found which had already been null quote unquote nulled that was just liver than pistol but there is something else that is happening which is of considerable interest and that is you are not inquisitive enough you are not inquisitive enough you must be more inquisitive you are afraid of arc breaking the pc by asking the pc enough questions that tendency is everywhere manifest you must ask the pc more questions now ill give you an example students goal and terminal had caused week or so of auditing fruitless auditing search search search search search and mary sue checked it out only to find that previous auditor had arc broke the goal so that it was not now registering and the second that the arc break was taken off that goal went liver than pistol and it took her only in matter of maybe an hour or an hour and quarter to do the whole job now that meant that the auditor who just found that goal and terminal that meant that that person was not at all inquisitive had spent whole week grinding on goals list without ever asking the pc how did your last goals assessment go did anything peculiar happen in your last goals assessment how do you feel on your last auditors attempt to find your goal question of that sort was asked but whole week an auditor could sit there and try to find goal and terminal knowing from the auditor reports which were all in the folder that the pc had been assessed previously for goal and terminal unsuccessfully ah but the auditor before that had found the goal and the pc had blown session instantly saying i dont want that goal i want nothing to do with it at all or some paraphrase thereof and apparently this auditor must have said well she doesnt want anything to do with that so it must not be her goal and went on with the remaining list and then another auditor came along and assessed for week without ever discovering this other incident all you have to do is ask questions and your emeters react now theres another thing about assessment that you must know all of this is slightly prelude to it and that is that when pc has been badly audited on levels but the right terminal you have to take off the auditing in order to get any assessment at all its part of getting the rudiments in so before you do an assessment you must get the rudiments in and particularly you must ask if the pc has had previous auditor auditing on the prehav scale or has had any auditing on the prehav scale whatsoever find out if theres ever been anything wwrong or anything arc broke or anything upset about any former assessment and clean that up slick as bunny and youll always have bang bang bang assessment you can always do easy auditing if you set the pc up to be audited and you can always do hard impossible auditing by not setting the pc up to be audited so the first rule in answer to your question is get all of your rudiments in by which we also mean get inquisitive about any earlier or former assessment or what the pc has felt about assessments of the type we are about to do and get the arc breaks off of that and whether youre doing goals terminal or prehav assessment you will always get reliable assessment 100 percent of the time you see all right that answer it male voice that answers it all right okay is there another question yes male voice yeah does this threeway cycle of paper meter pc prevent the establishment of the oneway flow that you mentioned does this cycle here of paper meter pc prevent oneway flow from occurring youve got oneways and twoway flows mixed up there im sorry but youve got wrong idea of twoway flow i would recommend that you read scientology 880 you go ahead and get that book i think thats the one that covers it isnt it female voice yes it is scientology 880 and it tells you all about flows there are flows and they are bank flows and this flow has nothing whatsoever to do with anything but the terminal that you are assessing and the pc and the interrelationship between the terminal and the pc and that is the stuck flow we are talking about has nothing to do with the auditors relationship to the pc has only to do with the terminals relationship to the pc and that is the flow that can get stuck you cannot run on terminal would king cause anything thank you would king cause anything thank you would king cause anything thank you would king cause anything thank you now all of sudden this odd phenomenon will suddenly disclose itself the needle will stick and itll just get stickier and stickier and stickier and stickier and all of sudden go stuck and your tone arm will get stickier and stickier and stickier and stick and youll say thats it thats it the level is flat it isnt flat that is stuck flow and somebody else comes along and say well what could you cause king what could you cause king what could you cause king what could you cause king all of sudden the thing gets loose the needle gets loose the tone arm gets loose everything is loose everything is flying around beautifully and youd say all right what could you cause king thank you what could you cause king thank you what could you cause king and itd start to get stick and what could you cause thing king thank you and all of sudden it gets stuck stuck stucker stucker frozeny and the tone arm will freeze now thats oneway flow dont you see youve got to think of commands in terms of flows from the person to the terminal from the terminal to others you see and youve got to get what pattern of flows is because if you stick any leg of that flow you dont flatten the command but you simply freeze the meter and this is not the same as flattening level you see thats different one so you can run an unbalanced command and make level look like its flat but it isnt you understand what i mean male voice all right i do yeah male voice come back to establishment of oneway flow while assessing i got the impression just now that you didnt tell us to flipflop on this saying would king cause would you cause king would you run an obsessive canthave on king i got the impression that you didnt tell us to do it that way you only told us that as something fancy in auditing male voice oh you didnt all right well do you want us to do it that way i think you ought to listen to that tape played back i said that is not vital necessity male voice ah to do this kind of thing but you will cause stuck flow if you dont do something like that male voice okay see there are other ways you could prevent stuck flow you could read whole fiveway bracket but now we are getting above the auditors ability to keep track you see you could read whole fiveway bracket you could say would you have faith in king would king cause anything to happen to you would king prevent another from knowing would another prevent would another have effect on king and would king have an effect on himself you see now theres fiveway bracket isnt there all right you try to audit pc and keep track of fiveway bracket and five different commands now do i make that clear do i understand what you are asking now thats the main point male voice yeah ive got it now all right male voice that we do have to do something on the line of changing it back and forth thats right you can also assess this way thats why i say this isnt vital i just say you have to do something about it this is point you have to take up you can also do this now what do you think of faith in regard to king you see how does cause relate to king thats not particularly good one not particularly good one but it does get around this because it can flipflop you see cause king but youre not saying king causing anything its just cause in relationship to king and he will turn the command around one way or the other or some type of permissive command like that might get over the whole problem thats why i say that that exact method which i gave you is not the only method by which this is done but the fact of stuck flow is always present during prehav assessment it can always happen on an assessment and all of sudden you havent got an assessment have you you see here would be the way you would cause stuck flow would you have faith in king would you cause something to happen to king would you prevent king from knowing would you have effect on king would you have an effect on king see you king you king you king you king and youve done this sixtyfive auditing commands although there its an assessment they still operate as auditing commands and youve done it sixtyfive times youre going to get stuck flow see thats for sure see thats an awful lot of times to say you king you king you king you king outflow from you to the king i think you really ought to look over flows i think you ought to look over flows i think all of you should pay some attention to this because otherwise why you put fiveway bracket together would be complete mystery to you you can do this you know just draw little arrows you see youre trying to break the valence which you have already found in the pc off of the pc youre trying to individu to knock off the individuations and other phenomena with relationship to the pc and this valence well that is done by flows because the pc is already stuck on the valence by some type of stuck flow sergeant orders troops sergeant orders troops sergeant orders troops sergeant orders troops sergeant orders troops nobody ever orders the sergeant get the idea eventually he either gets stuck into being private you see or he snaps terminals in some way with troops or he cant leave camp and nobody can figure out why is that sergeant never leave camp you got the idea hes just on flow from sergeant to troops sergeant to troops sergeant to troops sergeant to troops sergeant to troops see and hell eventually snap on that flow you cannot continue something flowing that long in one way if you do you get into all kinds of weird troubles now you eventually would find this sergeant had an officer and the officer would come along and he would say well lets take it the way officers would normally handle sergeant theyd say well sergeant what do you think sergeant dont you think its good idea dont you think we shouldnt uh and we get different kind of officer one day and he said sergeant stand there hand that write up the orders drill the men right away the sergeant cant take single order see hed said blublublulalala i just actually cant even hear this officer see positive orders stuck flow so anything that flows the other way runs into jammed stuck flow coming in and he cant actually accept an order from an officer and he goes around nattering about it he goes around being very upset about it and so forth we would say well theres something very wrong here yeah the only thing very wrong is we have weve connected with the phenomena of stuck flows in life now oddly enough with this officer around long enough doing that he would remedy the flow three years after three years of service you would have this sergeant saying something like this well i certainly hated captain jinks when he first reported to this post but theres one thing you can say about him he knows what hes doing something like year and half ago captain jinks finally ran out the stuck flow you see all right five years later we find the sergeant wearing his hat see we now dont have any troops the government has interfered and decided that in view of the fact that were getting rid of all the territories and turn the country over to the ban the bombers or something like this in view of that we dont have any troops anymore you see we just have skeletal force and the sergeant doesnt have any troops but hes still got captain jinks and this has been going on for about two years and captain jinks says sergeant stand there and the sergeant goes off and wears his hat exactly in the same position and carries his stick in exactly the same position as captain jinks hes got stuck flow in exactly the opposite direction hes snapped terminals in now to captain jinks you got the idea just like you had these troops who themselves never gave any orders eventually all looking like the sergeant so now youd get the sergeant looking like captain jinks now were talking about the valence closure mechanisms when were talking about flows these are the mechanisms by which person becomes somebody else there isnt anything odd about it its this stuck flow mechanism you run body you run body you run body you run body you run body you run body body never runs you so youre in body and then one day you get reaction from body so you succumb because the stuck flow has now snapped it is looking for some excuse for the body to run you in some particular way because youve run the body too long dont you see now you have most of the drivers out here on the road being driven by their cars if you ran questionnaire they would answer it quite broadly where should car take you they would all answer that they wouldnt even think twice about it and yet the essence of all excellent driving is taking the car somewhere i taught somebody to drive jaguar by taking the jaguar down the road and it almost killed the person i made the person take the jaguar down the road turn the jaguar around all corners you see do everything think everything and do everything to the jaguar that they were supposed to do very interesting almost killed the person for while but i made him do it consciously and so made him discharge this stuck flow by running it consciously in other words 8c on jaguar if you in driving start doing this watch out because youre liable to have almost anything happen you all of sudden lose your ability to drive right in the middle of long straightaway or something you know you say whats going on what youve run into is stuck flow what youve done is take over analytically the stuck flow mechanism if you start consciously driving car that youve been so carefully driving unconsciously because in driving car unconsciously you have already succumbed to stuck flow we have at this particular time the idea that all skills must become unconscious well isnt that fascinating idea skill is unconscious see footballer for instance all of his actions with football must be into some kind of reactive groove so that he never even has to think he just always makes the perfect goal you see he never has to think he thats the modus operandi of the day if you wanted to improve his football you would go out there and bring it all up to the surface now all of sudden he never would miss but before it was all unconscious but he missed occasionally but that was just the fortunes of the day you see the automaticity doesnt always work leaves us all on the subject of stuck flows and this is very very important mechanism because it is the mechanism which youre trying to cure with routine 3 youre finding out what thing it is that the person has total stuck flows on in all directions and has been submerged into and has become and then you are separating this thing out and you are separating it out usually running with fiveway bracket which runs all flows and all conditions with regard to this terminal and when you have flattened all flows and all these conditions of the primary scale and whatever else you had to do and incidents you will find out that you have discharged the compulsion to be interiorized into it or to run it or to command it or to be unconscious about it when youve discharged these things you of course have gotten rid of most of the persons case you follow that did you know all that male voice female voice ron how does this affect you always instructing students whats the question huh female voice the stuck flow youre an instructor always instructing the student how does this affect female voice yes stuck flow oh i got long way i got long way to go before this gets to be stuck flow i remember one space academy i think the curriculum was two thousand years i was student there female voice all right remember something about scientology scientology is the only thing which undoes its own spells scientology is actually the only science on earth today which undoes all of its own rules its very peculiar thing that is the only reason we have any business doing anything with it anything we do in scientology can be run out do you know the only overt that you can pull with scientology lies in the field of instruction to fail to pass along the materials accurately becomes an overt bad auditing isnt much of an overt not on the long run on the long run but bad dissemination is an overt because this makes it impossible for mr jinks that was badly audited to get it run out couple of lifetimes later see theres always some hope for mr jinks as long as there was good dissemination but thats its joke with regard to actually ive had great deal of trouble with schools schools are always teaching oh things like my own subjects and so forth and ive had to learn my own speeches and theyre the difficulty is theyre wrong and theres one whole series of speeches that are commonly taught in schools and theyre all wrong theyve got now the wrong place names and the wrong people and they dont make sense but theyre good oratory and this is crazy you know but you get goofiness on the subject after while and about the only thing that you find difficult about instruction is being taught principles that are contrary to truth and when somebodys pushing principles which are contrary to truth or contrary to fact or which are just made up out of thin air or something like this then you have will encounter great deal of difficulty both the instructor and the student will eventually get in trouble because of this and as suzie will attest ive been laughing and you of course have heard in lectures laughing about certain subject matter that is taught on earth today as incorrect we didnt realize that every physics textbook in england at the elementary level has rule after rule and law after law incorrectly stated or that is totally incorrect there was scientist who has made hobby of this has been checking up all of the english textbooks and was on tonight last night and he had wondered how much we had held back british science by teaching newtons laws backwards and things like this and they were all in the textbooks and the textbooks keep on getting reprinted and issued and so forth well now thats an overt and an instructor would suffer from that but now you for instance start teaching student correctly somewhere because well there isnt one of you who wont teach somebody sometime or another something about scientology you see whether in broad mass or single individuals you couldnt escape it but lets say you were pushing bunch of misconcepts that would then add up to an overt wouldnt it all right now the overt act motivator phenomena has to be part and parcel to this stuck flow phenomena see you have to get an individuation there has to be an unease thered have to be an unconscious reaction there has to be something unknown there has to be something hidden all of these things have to occur in order to make the stuck flow phenomena come about for instance the sergeant is telling the troops that theyre actually going to go on picnic and they get out there and they find out that the picnic baskets happen to be baskets for dirt and theyre actually supposed to build fortification in the burning sun you see theres always this kind of thing going on in the army so youve always got people snapping into people and valence closures and so forth but they must all be accompanied by lies or prevarications and right on that subject theres only one thing that becomes an overt with regard to the instruction done here is when i tell you clearly with exclamation points and underline it and underscore it that you must read an emeter and then you proceed to read the pcs shoes well i get some overt thoughts and in the field and region of those overt thoughts i suppose i could get into stuck flow situation but every now and then i run out my overts and unkind thoughts about you so youre safe okay right any other questions yes male voice on this withhold on the new rudiments commands you have to whom wasnt that known and to whom shouldnt that be known how does that apply if you ask the pc are you withholding anything give that give that bulletin right there instead of answering that question why dont i give you brief rundown on the new rudiments on what you can get away with and what you cant get away with with regard to it huh male voice good and thatll answer it in the process ask your question once more though however male voice when you ask pc are you withholding anything and you get tick how do you apply that question there to whom wasnt that known how does this doesnt even make sense to all right all right lets take up the whole thing number one room that is very very easy these are the new rudiments room tr 10 or pcs havingness process if you have found the pcs havingness process in the list of thirtysix presessions you naturally use that to orient him with regard to the room and he will be able to find out and differentiate why he doesnt like to be audited in that room he will pick it up now youve the safest thing is to have the pcs havvingness process that is the safest thing thats the best thing but to break down at that point when youre clearing rudiments to find the pcs havingness process would be very clumsy way to go about it so just sooner or later when auditing pc you should find the pcs havingness and confront processes it doesnt take very long to do and all the materials and how it is done have all been made available this long time its rather simple action now i have something to say about this this is why i wanted to go over all of the rudiments i have something to say about this auditor process you realize of course that beingness is in the middle of confusion and that beingness is pinned into confusion so this is one of these limited processes what are you willing to be what are you unwilling to be of course is picking the stable datum out of the confusion which is reverse auditing and its very good run on very limited basis but if you wanted to run case with this you would have to run much more broadly and you would have to run your 1a processes as part of the auditing command youd have to introduce 1a youd have to bring it right in on the heels of this thing this one for long run now not just for two dozen commands to settle the pc into session you see you can get rid of you can get away with it you know for just rudiments process for little while you can get away with it usually but remember to run it broadly you would have to introduce the whole idea of 1a and get the problems out of the road because he obviously has problems and the beingnesses are the middle of confusions about problems so youd say have to say what would you be willing to be what would you rather not be what would another be willing to be what would another rather not be what confusion could you confront what confusion could another confront now the best way to sort that out would be to sort out problem motion and confusion and use the word that reacted the most on the pc for those two confronts now that is quite legitimate and is one of these dynamite processes now if you wanted to run whole case with this you would have to add two more commands what confusion youve sorted it out whether its confusion problem or motion would you rather not confront what confusion problem motion would another rather not confront youd have to have the plus and the minus confusion now i suppose whole case would run with that i suppose whole case would run clear with that without an assessment well after all youve picked up the beingness which is the stable datum and youre handling the ability to confront confusion and youre handling these various elements that create reactive bank anyhow and maybe if you ran case with that for thousand hours the case would go clear you got the idea but its one of these long arduous propositions without much differentiation but running it just what would you be willing to be what would you rather not be all right now lets just sit down and run that for two hours well all right well all right and then next session lets sit down and run it for start to run it for two hours i dont think youll make it the pcs going to be right splang in the middle of an engram because that runs pcs into engrams if run very long otherwise its very limited process and you must know that about it but its nice one to settle the pc into auditing session oh youd run it couple of dozen times you know you say well what would you be willing to be i wouldnt wouldnt and all of sudden hed hahahahaha im not willing to be pc oh all right so youre not willing to be pc all right now what would you be willing to be so and so what would you rather not be so and so what would you be willing to be oh im willing to be pc all right im going to audit this ask you this question two more times and end this process if thats all right with you thank you and youre out in other words it will do that job but going much further than that youre going to get into trouble with the process so you might as well know that i wouldnt give you process that you could get into trouble with without that now if you do get into trouble with it add another and beingness another and not beingness just in the commands i just gave you and if youre going to sit down and clean this thing up till to izzard youre going to have to run confusion confront confusion rather not confront for self and for the other too making this whole number of package of commands its going to be one two three four five six seven eight commands its an eight command process to run the thing all the way out but the way to get yourself out of trouble on it you would only have to add the two confusion commands see what confusion can you confront what confusion could another confront that would get you out of trouble without getting elaborate you get how this would be done pc says oh im going into an engram and so forth well you havent got his terminal you havent youre not running him on the prehav scale you just made booboo so on just add the command confusion confront and he will come right on out of it just as nice as you please okay so youve got the command youve got the remedy all right lets take up the next level which is the one youre asking about what is unknown about that problem with joe this is perfectly all right its perfectly all right now what did you find wrong with that male voice its the withhold the next one i must be confused bit oh you got that was whats marked with question mark oh i guess what youre talking about all right what is unknown about that problem with blank now that is good enough to clean present time problem because youve located the fact that he had problem with blank his boss well you ask him do you have present time problem and the meter goes clang and the blue smoke starts coming out of the corner we going to put little smoke hole there and oh he says i dont want anything to do with the problem because i want to get on with the session and so forth well thats not good enough question i mean youd better audit it and the best way to get rid of it and the fastest way to get rid of it is just ask him the plainest version of it all which is what is unknown about that problem with your boss what is unknown about the problem with your boss what is unknown about that problem with your boss just repetitive command nothing fancy nothing further about it that makes it that makes it all of sudden the guy go kabloom and you only run that you see long enough so that you get reaction on the meter and you say how do you feel with the problem of your boss well i think i ought to do something about it that isnt long enough the test of pt problem if its flat the pc doesnt have to do anything about it thats the primary test of pt problem thats an old saw in auditing pc feels he still has to do something about it its not flat ive had an auditor tell well ive got the pt problem flat because she said right after the session she would go out and phone up her husband and make peace with him and you say yes but you didnt get any gain in this intensive oh well it couldnt have had anything to do with that yes it had everything to do with that he didnt apply the basic test of present time problem she still wanted to do something about this problem with her husband therefore the present time problem was not flat and didnt answer the required rudiments the pc has to take care of something in present time the pc has to move in present time toward certain target well if the pc has to move in present time toward certain target that has nothing to do with session targets the pc is out of session simple as that so if the pc has to do something about this you still have not flattened it and you just run this until the meter goes flat on that present time problem and then you ask him if he has present time problem about anything else being very specific about anything else meaning were through with that one and if hes got one on that then you clean that one up and then you ask him do you have now have present time problem you get reaction on the meter carry on and go to your next rudiment and we run to withholds to whom wasnt that known to whom shouldnt that be known well that is about the nastiest withhold process anybody ever dreamed up now the question i dont know quite how the question comes up now how repeat the question again male voice well the question is when you ask the pc are you withholding anything yeah male voice and you get tick and you ask him what was that he says i dont know then how do you apply that uh i get you male voice end i get you i see and the pc doesnt know male voice thats right ah this is special case this is special case well let see i have to kind of pick it up here somehow or another because i cant imagine pc saying that to without my following straight on through you know these the germans developed dachshunds you know to go down small holes well i dont know lets see youre asking to clear this up with command i would clear this up differently if i ran into that and i said well what isnt are you withholding anything and the pc got tick and you say all right what was that and he says well i dont know i havent got clue i wouldnt run process i would say well before session or just any kind of thing you know the who when what type of questioning well before session was there something that came up that you thought you ought to tell dont accuse him of withholding you see hed say oh yes oh yes yes i did want to tell you that actually last night i had quite headache after that session and you say well all right thank you now are you withholding anything and you very often will find the tick disappears thats as easy as it is to clean them see so thats twoway comm clean any question about what when where that classifies as twoway comm youre supposed to try to clear withhold with twoway comm what was it when was it was there any time when you thought of withholding anything from what sort of thing would it be that you would find it very difficult to tell thats very nice one run it into classes what would i be most likely to get angry about you see never confronted that one before you see you get angry about lets see hohohohohohohohoho yes hohohoho of course hes got you the auditor mixed up with somebody whos censuring him so hell get whole type of class of withhold from you as an auditor got the trickiness with which this can be done cleverness is speed when getting withhold off of the pc cleverness is speed now that doesnt mean there arent other ways of doing it and that doesnt mean you cant do it with repetitive process the earliest repetitive process for withhold was think of something youve done think of something youve withheld think of something youve done think of something youve withheld think of something youve done think of something youve withheld is there anything youd care to tell about that oh well all right thank you well think of something youve done think of something youve withheld think of something youve done think of something youve withheld think of something youve done think of something youve withheld now is there anything you would care to tell i was down in the melbourne acc and i was giving whole bunch of lectures on 0w and advising the auditor to run this sort of thing so he went covert on the whole deal you see and he started running the pc saying think of something youve known think of something youve withheld now is there anything you would care to tell see well the pcs already loosened it up and its rattling around in his skull and its about to come out through his eyeballs if he doesnt get rid of the thing now thats the earliest repetitive process which was directly levelled at getting withholds off of pc or beyond just the idea of getting withholds off of pc now thats usable thats rudiments process see its quite usable you say well are you withholding anything tick well what is that i dont know and you say well is there anything that you thought you should tell is there anything that you havent told in earlier sessions is there anything you think i would object to being told any type of questioning and its still going tick see he hasnt given you the gen of course you can go off into repetitive processes and the earliest one of them is think of something youve done think of something youve withheld think of something youve done think of something youve withheld now much more modern version or much more modern process would be to search it out along some line and say what is unknown about my reactions thank you what is unknown about my reactions thank you what is unknown about my reactions thank you uhuhuhall of sudden he of course uhhhhhh he suddenly realizes youre going to get ragingly angry if he suddenly tells you something see that but thats sort of clearing the auditor so the auditor can be talked to by the pc you get the indirect method so there is direct application of unknown to that exact situation which is special situation this is highly general situation now this withhold in the rudiments its up to you to get the rudiment off of him now what you use to do that we re not particular about you can get the old do withhold process you can stir it up one way or the other and so on youre not trying to run security check on this pc however and if the pc is adamantly holding up the whole progress of the thing yes thats special case and you can go in and run any process which you think will eventually get him to get loose and turn loose of that withhold he obviously has got withhold from you because hes afraid of your reactions to the things you might say and as long as hes afraid of your reactions to the things he might say he is not in twoway communication with you and so is not insession so this is an insession type of withhold not security check type of withhold that we are more interested in so that makes it little bit different doesnt it audience voice hmm huh all right now this is directed at this remember these are list of processes to be run on something found which cant be cleared by twoway communication thats what these rudiments processes are so we say are you withholding anything and the pc says and we get tick and we say what was that and the pc said ooooh well oooooh yes oooooh well and you well what was it and the pc oooooh well what what whats this all about well last night down in the restaurant three other students and i were discussing your auditing and i dont want to have to tell you this but we decided and so forth and so on and i said and that was an unkind thought youre not interested in what they thought youre only interested in what he thought and then you say well come on now what did you say and what did you think thats always the keynote of withholds you can waste eighteen thousand years of auditing on running off other peoples statements and so forth with regard to the withhold yes i had an aunt once who drowned puppy oh christ all right so you had an aunt that drowned puppy that has nothing to do with our auditing session did you help her drown the puppy i just heard about it all right what did you do and where did you drown puppy oh do you suppose i couldve well it says here something about it got the idea did you ever drown puppy well clang where did you drown the puppy clang oh i had forgotten all about it you see thats security check type of situation now you saw into this security check situation you clean this up and get this drowning of puppies so that it doesnt react and this thing works the same way if you were to run that on security check withhold you see you would clean up the whole withhold you wouldnt leave the guy stuck in some kind of withhold now lets supposing that this was just an auditing session situation see and you said well whats this withhold and he eventually said and i was down at the cafe and we were talking to three other auditors and i said and i thought and so forth and you say all right are you withholding anything you still get clang you say was it is it about that that you are withholding and you still get another clang well theres sense of sitting there for the next two and half hours trying to beat to pieces something which is apparently an almost traumatic incident see the thing for you to do is not to run responsibility on it or something like that the thing for you to do is to run this one to whom wasnt that known well you of course you see to whom shouldnt that be known you of course all right to whom wasnt that known well it wasnt known to the other students well to whom shouldnt that be known well it shouldnt be known to your preclears you get how this would be answered and so it eventually cleans up that traumatic situation and all too often this is being run into by auditors you say are you withholding anything and the pc says clank then you say what was that and well i guess that was the oh yes and you say are you withholding anything you see and you still get reaction you try to chase it out as an arc break or something of this sort actually its the same withhold but it didnt release now this is how you release withhold and that is why it is process does that make sense now male voice yes very much so otherwise the weapons by which you get the pc to give you the withhold this is another story all right does that answer it male voice yes perfect all right now this becomes next one is arc break and this is one of the most important developments that we have had for long time and this is honey this process what didnt an auditor do when what werent you able to tell an auditor when and that is bitch kitty because that cleans up basicbasic on the arc break chain and that will smooth pc into session faster than scat there are variations of this command there is variation of what werent you able to tell an auditor that is nonvariable if youre cleaning it up for the session only you of course say what werent you able to tell in this session that is not as good as what werent you able to tell an auditor but would still keep him within the finite ranges of the session rather than run it all up and down the line and would clean him up for you just now lets say you run into the endofsession arc break well youre not going to sit there till midnight for heavens sakes running this other process because this is going to be longer process you can clean it up for the immediate session in which you are involved and the immediate session in which you are involved is simply not an auditor what didnt i do when what werent you able to tell when thats specialized use of it and the specialized use of it is limited to trying to get on with the session trying to get the pc out of session and something ended this gives you very short run but if you had to do something like this to keep the thing squared around of course the pc is hot on the subject of an auditor but this is quite remarkable development and let go into the background and the network of the development itself youre seeing here the final great great great great great great great grandson of the discovery that communication is the most important corner of the arc triangle see communication is the most important corner and what do you know as long as you run recall it is perfectly safe to say werent able to say thats perfectly safe as long as its recall what wouldnt you be able to say will wind the pc up in more soup why because its saying what werent you able to what arent you able to go out of arc with see same thing so it is quite delicate thing and you should know this about this process that that is very very solidly and completely and only recall process it only works as recall process and then does lots of good and if used as conditional process you know what arent you able to tell im not so sure see youve got to run that as recall now psychotics have gone sane on this single auditing command in spite of the fact that it was stuck flow command and everything else think of communicating with somebody thank you think of communicating with somebody thank you think of communicating with somebody thank you think of communicating with somebody thank you think of communicating with somebody thank you run for twentyfive hours and its made some people go sane see i mean its that powerful process it could be refined you could have said think of somebody communicating with you think of you communicating with somebody see something like that and you would have had considerable resurge on the part of case but it wasnt communication that aberrated anybody it was the not communication that aberrated them so recall on the not communications operates as very powerful process and it is extremely powerful just as process itself we dont need it at the present moment we dont have any real use for it at the present moment it would have made considerable splash four or five
