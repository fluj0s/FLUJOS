services c changes in the programs approach to limit fraud and d changes in some components of state medicaid financing the finance committee also recommended number of changes that woul d result in medicaid spending increases these proposals include temporary financial relief for medicaid costs of individuals who resided prior to hurricane ka trina in selected parishes in louisiana and counties

and the schip program would amount to 43 billion in savings over the period1 the change in medicares payment for physician services would result in 108 billion increase over th fiveyear period but

fmap payment rates for individuals in selected louisiana parishes and counties in alab ama and mississippi affected by hurricane katrina would increase medicaid spending by 18 billion the largest medicaid savings proposal is the result of chan ges in the reimbursement for outpatient prescription drugs the finance committee proposals result in 63 billion reduction over the fiveyear period the health provisions in the senate finance committee proposal were modified by several floor amendments the amendments included changes that 1 would require that fy2006 fmaps would be r ecalculated and it w ould limit any reductionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33131crs3 in states fy2006 fmap rate the estim ated increased cost of this provision would be offset by extending outpatient pr escription drug rebates to most managed care organizations other amendments w ould 1 authorize the continued provision of certain adult day health care services or medical adult day care services under state medicaid plan 2 ex clude discounts provided to mail order and nursing facility pharmacies from the determination of average manufacturer price and to extend the discounts offered under feeforservice medi caid

these amendments are incorporated in the senate bill provision descriptions medicaid medicaid outpatient prescription drugs the major medicaid outpatient prescrip tion drug provisions alter the upper limits that apply to federal reimbursement of state spending on prescription drugs alter the formulas for calculating the rebates that prescription drug manufacturers are required to pay to states and establish special reporting require ments for the prices of certain authorized generic drugs nd certain outpatient drugs administered in physicians offices federal upper limits under current law stat medicaid programs set the prices paid to pharmacies fo r medicaid outpatient drugs federal reimbursements for those drugs however are limited to federal upper limit ful the ful that applies to drugs available from multiple sources generic drugs for the most part is calculated by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms to be equal to 150 of the lowest published average whol esale price awp fo r the least costly therapeutic equivalent the upper limit that applies to brandna and other drugs is equal to the acquisition cost as estimated by the states the senate bill would replace the curre nt ful requirement so that state payments for single source drugs provided in pharmacies that are not critical access pharmacies would qualify for federal reimbursement up to 105 of the average manufacturer price amp as reported to cms by the manufacturers fuls for multiple source drugs provided in pharmaci that are not cr itical access pharmacies would be equal to 115 of the weighted am p for those drugs state payments for single source drugs provided in critical access retail pharmacies would qualify for federal reimbursement up to the lesser of 108 of the amp or the wholesale acquisition cost for the drug fuls for multiple source drugs provided in criticalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33131crs4 access pharmacies would qualify for federal reimbursement up to the lesser of 140 of the amp or the wholesale acquisition cost for the drug critical access retail pharmacies are defined as those retail pharmacies that are not within 20 miles of any other retail pharmacy in addition the b ill includes interim upper payment limits that would apply during calendar year 2006 befo re the new fuls become effective in addition this section of the bill woul d modify the definitions of the prices that manufacturers are currently required to provide to cms the definition of amp an important price point for calculating medicaid drug rebates and for the proposed fuls would become more specified than under current law for example one of the new specifications would direct ma nufacturers to include cash and volume discounts in the computation of amp the bill would also define weighted amp for the purpose of calculating fuls for multiple source drugs and would establish that dispensing fees for multiple source drugs may be higher than those for single source drugs rebates under current law prescription drug manufacturers that participate in the medicaid program are required to pa rebates to states for drugs provided to medicaid beneficiaries for which fee for service payments are required the rebates are calculated based on formula in stat ute for single source and innovator multiple source drugs those drugs that had fo rmerly been sold under patent but are now off patent basic rebate s are equal to the greater of 151 of the amp or the difference between the reported amp and the best price for each drug the rebate for all other multiple source drugs is equal to 11 of the amp the senate bill makes two major changes to medicaid rebate policy the bill would require manufacturers to begin paying rebates for drugs provided to medicaid beneficiaries who are enrolled in most managed care or ganizations and would raise the rebate percentages for all drugs the basic reba for single source and innovator multiple source drugs would be raised to the greater of 181 of the amp or the difference between the reported amp and the best price for each drug the rebate for all other multiple source drugs would be raised to 17 of the amp states would have the option of collecting rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers for those drugs provided to enrollees of mcos or alternatively allowing the mcos to collect the rebates in exchange for reduced mco payment rates authorized generics and phys icianadministered drugs authorized generic drugs are generics that are produced by the same manufacturer that produces the brandname version of the drug or by different manufacturer with the authorization of the manufacturer that hol ds the patent on the brandname version the senate bill would establish requirement that manufacturer reporting the amp and best price for brand name product must also incl ude the prices at which authorized generic versions are sold this provision is estimated to increase rebates that result in savings to the medicaid prog ram since authorized generic drugs are generally less expensive than brandname versions of the same drug in addition the bill would require states to provide utilization and coding information to cms for physicianadministered outpatient drugs this would improve the ability of cms to ensure manufacturers pay rebates for those drugshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33131crs5 longterm care under medicaid

at the option of the state in the community in which the individual is institutionalized at the tim of application states use different methods for counting transfer s and determining the length of penalty period when more than one transfer is made during limited time period th senate bill would impose certain requirements on how these calcu lations would be made in an attempt to ensure that such calculations result in longer rather than shorter penalty periods specifically the provisions would 1 require states to count cumulative transfers transfers made during different months as one transfer and 2 prohibit states from rounding down to shorte n the penalty period changing noncountable ssets to count able assets not all assets that an applicant may have are counted for the purposes of determining an applicants eligibility for medicaid longterm care services or for determining if transfer for less than fairmarket value has been made states generally follow rules established by the supplemental security income ssi program for countin g income and assets of applicants provisions in the senate bill would change the status of certain types of assets from noncountable or exempt

ramp for all drug products in the same multiple source drug billing and payment code the provision would provide the secr etary with the authority to enter into contracts and engage the services of ve

section 340b allows certain health care providers including many community health centers and disproportionate share hospitals access to prescription drug prices that are similar to the prices paid by medicaid agencies after being reduced by manufacturer rebates prior authorization for mental health drugs the bill would limit the ability of states to place atypical antipsyc hotic or antidepressant single source drugs on prior authorization lists imposing other re strictions unless drug use review board has determined that doing so is not likel to harm patients or increase overall medical costs it also would require states to pay for 30 day supply of such drugs in cases where request for authorization is not responded to within 24 hours after the prescription is transmitted reform of asset transfer rules lengthening lookback period for all disposals to five years current law requires states to impose penalties on individuals who transfer assets all income and resources of the individual nd of the individuals spouse for less than fair market value an estimate of the value of an asset if sold at the prevailing price at the time it was actually transferred specifically the rules require states to delay medicaid eligibility for certain medicaid longterm care services for individualshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33131crs21 applying for care in nursing home and at state option for cer tain people receiving care in communitybased settings who have transferred assets for less than fair market value on or after lookback date the lookback date is 36 months prior to application for medicaid for income and mo st assets disposed of by the individual and 60 months in the case of certain trusts the penalty or period of ineligibility begins with the first month during which th assets were transferred the house bill would lengthen the lookback date to five years or 60 months for all income and assets disposed of by the individual it would also change the start date of the ineligibility period for all transfers to the first day of month during or before which assets have been transferred for less than fair market value or the date on which the individual is eligible for medical assi stance under the state plan and would be receiving certain longterm care services if it where not for the penalty whichever is later availability and provisions concerning hardship waivers to protect beneficiaries from unintended consequences of the asset transfer penalties current law requires states to establish procedures for not imposing penalties on persons who according to criteria established by the s ecretary of dhhs can show that penalty would impose an undue hardship the house bill would add to existing law criteria for approving or disapproving applications for undue hardsh ip waivers it would also require states to provide applicants with notice about the availability of undue hardship waivers to review applications under timely pr ocess and to establish an appeal process for beneficiaries who recei ve an adverse determination the bill would also permit facilities to apply for waivers on behalf of and with the consent of institutionalized individuals in additi on if the application for undue hardship of nursing facility residents meets criteria specified by the secretary the state would have the option of providing payments for nursing facility services to hold the bed for these individuals at facility while an application is pending such payments could not be made for longer than 30 days disclosure and treatment of annui ties and of large transactions current law provides that the term trust for purposes of asset transfers and the lookback period includes annuities only to the extent that the secretary of dhhs defines them as such cms guidance transmittal letter 64 asks states to determine the ultimate purpose of an annuity in orde r to distinguish those that are validly purchased as part of retirement plan from those that abusively shelter assets to be deemed valid in this respect the life of the annuity must coincide with the average number of years of life expectancy for the individual according to tables in the transmittal if the individual is not reasonably expected to live longer than the guarantee period of the annuity the individua l will not receive fair market value for the annuity based on the projected return in this case the annuity is not actuarially sound and transfer of assets for less than fair market value has taken place the house bill would require applicants and their community spouses to report their ownership interest in annu ities or s imilar financia l instruments it would also require disclosure of all transfers greater than 100000 further it would also require that all transactions 5000 or more within single year would be treated as single transaction subject to certain requirements the bill would also require the state to be made the remainder beneficiary unde r such annuities or similar fi nancial instruments thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33131crs22 bill would also give the secretary authority to provide guidance to states on categories of arms length transactions s uch as the purchase of commercial annuity that could be generally treated as an asset transfer for fair market value application of incomefirst rule in applying community spouses income before assets in providing support of community spouse current law includes provisions inte nded to prevent impoverishment of spouse whose husband or wife seeks medicai d coverage for longterm care services allowing the community spouse to retain hi gher amounts of income and assets on top of noncountable assets such as hous car etc than allowed under general medicaid rules the law allows commun ity spouses with more limited income to retain at least state sp ecified amount set within federal guidelines if the community spouses monthly income amount is less than this amount the institutionalized spouse may choose to transfer an amount of his or her income or assets to make up for the shortfall ie the difference between the community spouses monthly income and the state specified minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance the house bill would require that any transfer or allocation made from an institutionalized spouse to meet the need of community spouse for community spouses monthly income allowa nce be first made from income of the institutionalized spouse only when suffi cient income is not available could resources of the institutionalized s pouse be transferred or allocated disqualification for long term care assistance for individuals with substantial ho equity under current law states set asset sta ndards within federal parameters that applicants must meet to qualify for coverage these standards specify limit on the amount of countable assets person may have to qualify as well as define wh ich assets are not counted in general countable assets cannot exceed 2000 for an individual st ates generally follow ssi rules for computing both countable and noncountable assets current medi caid and ssi asset counting practices exclude the entire value of an applicants home the house bill would exclude from medicaid eligibility for nursing facility or other longterm care services those individuals with an equity interest in their home of greater than 750000 the secretary of dhhs would blish process to waive application of this provision for demonstrated cases of hardship this amount would be increased beginning in 2011 from year to year based on the percentage increase in the consumer price index for all urba n consumers rounded to the nearest 1000 individuals whose spouse child under age 21 or child w ho is blind or disabled resides in the individuals home would not be excluded from eligibility enforceability of continuing care retirement communities and life care community admission contracts the house bill would allow state licensed registered certified or equivalent continuing care retirement communities ccrc or life care community to require in their admissions contracts that residents spend their resour ces subject to medicaids rules concerning the resources and income allowances for community spouses declared for the purposes of admission on their care before they apply for medicaid it would also allow certain entrance fees for ccrcs or life care communities to be considered by states to be countable resources for purposes of the medicaid eligib ility determinationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33131crs23 flexibility in cost sharing and benefits many of the provisions in this chapter allow for changes to existing costsharing and benefit requirement s through medicaid state plan amendments rather than the special waiver process that is required under current law state option for alternative medicaid premiums and costsharing under current law premiums are genera lly prohibited under medicaid except under specific circumstances for example for pregnant women and infants with family income that exceeds 150 of the federal pove rty level fpl states are allowed to implement nominal premiums or enrollment fees between 1 and 19 per month depending on family income as defined in regulations other restrictions apply to servicerelated costsharing for example all servi cerelated costsharing is prohibited for children under 18 servicerelated costshari ng is also prohibited for pregnant women for any pregnancyrelated rvices or for services to treat other medical conditions that comp licate pregnancy other gr oups and services are also exempt from servicerelated costsharing eg emergency care family planning services services delivered to persons receiving medicaid hospice care for most other beneficiaries and services nominal servicerelated costsharing between 050 and 3 depending on the cost of the service provided may be imposed the house bill would allow states to impose premiums and costsharing for any group of individuals for any type of servi ce subject to several specific restrictions certain groups would be exempted from paying premiums eg children under 18 in mandatory coverage groups inpatients in certain medical institutions who must spend nearly all their income on medical care before medicaid pays for services also costsharing would be prohibited fo r specified services eg preventive care for all children under 18 services provided to hospice patients emergency care the total amount of annual costsharing for ll individuals in fa mily would be capped at 5 of family income for all families regardless of income states would be allowed to impose higher costsharing am ounts than is allowed under current law for individuals with family income over 100 of the fpl states may exempt additional classes of individuals or services from pr emiums and servicerelated costsharing beginning in 2006 for individuals in fa milies with incomes below 100 fpl the secretary of hhs would be required to increase nominal costsharing amounts over time based on the annual percen tage increase in the medi cal care component of the consumer price index fo r all urban consumers the house bill would also allow states to condition the provision of medical assistance on the payment of premiums and to terminate eligibility for medicaid when the failure to pay premium continue s for at least 60 days states may apply this provision to some or all groups nd may waive premium payments when they would be an undue hardship in addition states could permit medicaid providers to require medicaid beneficiary to pay au thorized costsharing as condition of receiving services providers would also be allowed to reduce or waive costsharing amounts gao would be required to conduct study of the impact of premiums and cost sharing under medicaid on access to and utiliz ation of services with report of findings due to congress later than january 1 2008 all provisions would behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33131crs24 effective for costsharing imposed on items and services furnished on or after january 1 2006 special rules for costsharing for prescribed drugs under current law costsharing for outpatient prescrip tion drugs follows the rules described above for all costsharing amounts many stat require costsharing amounts that are slightly lower for generic drugs or fo r drugs listed on preferred drug list the house bill would allow states to impose costsharing amounts that exceed the proposed state option limits described above for certain stateidentified non preferred drugs if specific conditions are t under this option states may impose higher costsharing for nonpreferred drug s within class waive or reduce cost sharing otherwise applicable for preferre d drugs within such class and must not apply such costsharing for preferred drug s to persons exempt from servicerelated costsharing costsharing for nonpref erred drugs would be based on multiples of the nominal amounts based on family income for persons generally exempt from costsharing the costshari ng for nonpreferred drugs ma be applied such cost sharing may not exceed nominal amounts nd aggregate caps on costsharing would still apply when prescribing physician determines that the preferred drug would not be effective or would have adverse health ffects or both the state may impose the cost sharing amount for preferred drugs on the prescribed nonpreferred product states may exclude specified drugs or classes of drugs from these special cost sharing rules finally states would be prohibited from implementing these special costsharing rules for outpatient prescription drugs unless the state has instituted system for prior authorizati on and related appeals proce sses all provisions would be effective for costsharing imposed on items and services furnished on or after october 1 2006 emergency room copayments for nonemergency care under current law waivers may be used to allow states to impose up to twice the otherwise applicable nominal costsharing amounts for nonemergency services provided in hospital emergency room er states ma only impose these higher amounts if they have established that medicaid beneficiaries have available and accessible alternative sources of nonemergency outpatient services the house bill would allow states through state plan amendments rather than waivers to impose increased costsha ring on statespecified groups for non emergency services provided in an er wh certain conditions are met first alternative nonemergency provi ders must be available and accessible to the person seeking care second after initial scr eening but before the nonemergency care is provided at the er the benefi ciary must be told 1 the hospital can require higher copayments 2 the name and location of an alternative nonemergency provider and that this provider uses lower copayme nts and 3 the hospital can provide referral when these conditions are met states could apply or waive costsharing for services delivered by the alternate providerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33131crs25 for persons with income below 100 fpl costsharing for nonemergency services in an er could not exceed twi ce the nominal amounts individuals exempt from premiums or servicerelated costshari ng may be subject to nominal copayments for nonemergency services in an er only when costsharing is imposed for care in hospital outpatient departments or by ot her alternative providers in the area served by the hospital er aggregate caps on costsharing would still apply finally the house bill would require the secretary to provide for payments to states for the establishment of alternat nonemergency providers or networks of such providers it also authorizes and appropriate s 100 million for paying such providers for the fouryear period begi nning with 2006 the secretary would be required to give preference to states th at establish or provide for alternate non emergency services providers or networks that serve rural or underserved areas where beneficiaries may have limited access to primary care providers or in partnership with local community hospitals use of benchmark benefit packages medicaid benefits may differ for what are called categorically needy cn versus medically needy mn groups in general cn groups include families with children the elde rly certain persons with disabilities and certain other pregnant women and children who meet applicable financial standards these financial criteria are tied to rules under two federal cash

health services for those entitled to nursing facility care within state services available to all cn groups must be equal in amount duration and scope likewise services available to all mn groups must be equal in amount duration and scope the house bill would give states the option to provide medicaid to state specified groups of beneficiaries throug h enrollment in benc hmark and benchmark

be equivalent to or be tter than the dental plan that covers the greatest number of individuals in the state who are not eligible for medicaid finally states could only enroll eligib beneficiaries in
