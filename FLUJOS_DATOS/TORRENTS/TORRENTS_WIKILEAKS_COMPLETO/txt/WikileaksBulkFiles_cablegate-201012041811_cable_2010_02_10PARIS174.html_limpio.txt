minister kouchner february 8 2010 classified by alexander vershbow asdisa reasons 14 bd 1 snf summary at the request of the french ministry of foreign affairs secretary of defense robert gates secdef met with french fm bernard kouchner in paris on february 8 2010 discussions included how to persuade the chinese and others to support sanctions against iran and the importance of targeting the iranian government rather than the people on afghanistan kouchner confirmed that france would maintain its position that it could not add additional combat troops for the time being but was open to the possibility of sending additional trainers both kouchner and secdef lauded recent progress in pakistan discussing nato kouchner argued for stronger european pillar which secdef supported with the caution that pursuit of an independent european security role risked reducing the already limited capabilities available to the alliance secdef also raised the need for reform and for examination of future nato missions which he would define narrowly rather than broadly end summary iran 2 snf kouchner said that the us and france were working well together in new york on an iran sanctions resolution all the problems now are with the chinese kouchner had met chinese fm yang twice the previous week but said that right now it was difficult to predict whether the chinese would veto or abstain he noted that the chinese were furious over the ustaiwan arms deal which would make it difficult to get resolution passed in february 3 snf secdef observed that russia usually followed chinas lead on north korea whereas china usually followed russia on iran therefore we should try to get the russians to persuade the chinese to support the iran sanctions resolution mfa political director jacques audibert remarked that the russians had been helpful during the last p5plusone teleconference but he worried that the russians would water down the content of the resolution kouchner said that president medvedev seemed strongly on board and there was daylight between his position and that of foreign minister lavrov secdef said he suspected that china ultimately would not want to be isolated and would abstain 4 snf secdef urged kouchner not to exaggerate the chinese concern over taiwan they would need little more time and in the end an abstention might be good enough result for us he added that we should urge the saudis to weigh in with beijing since china has more at stake in its relations with saudi arabia than iran he commented that the saudis always want to fight the iranians to the last american but that now it is time for them to get into the game 5 snf raising his concerns about bringing nonpermanent unsc members on board secdef reported that in ankara he had impressed upon pm erdogan the dangers of proliferation to other middle east countries or an israeli strike if the iranian nuclear program couldnt be stopped kouchner expressed his doubts about turkeys desire for constructive role in region describing erdogans comments to ahmadinejad defending the iranian nuclear program as dangerous 6 snf kouchner then asked secdef for his perspectives on the popular protests in iran in the french view the internal developments were very important the most significant change in decades he urged careful thought about how to avoid discouraging the protesters with sanctions bearing in mind that the protesters did not support tehrans ambitions for nuclear weapons he further emphasized his belief that human rights issues should receive attention as well 7 snf secdef said that kouchners argument underscored the need to focus sanctions on the irgc and companies it owns in order to minimize the hardship for the iranian people he remarked that iranians across the political spectrum support peaceful nuclear program but it was not clear whether they favored acquisition of nuclear weapons therefore our political strategy should reaffirm irans right to have civilian nuclear program as long as it is safeguarded and in compliance with the nonproliferation treaty 8 snf further explaining the us position secdef said that while our understanding of the iranian leadership was opaque we do know that they do not like to be isolated the usg would soon be designating several irgc companies under the iran sanctions act his own view was that it was important to get the unscr passed quickly even if it were not as harsh as we might wish once resolution is passed he explained it will offer legal platform on which the eu and individual states can impose harsher sanctions paris 00000174 002 of 003 9 snf kouchner agreed but added that another problem was to get the nine votes needed in the unsc he said that lebanon was one of frances prime targets in this respect but he doubted that france would be able to bring the resolution to vote during its presidency as february is very short month gabon which takes the chair in march is good asset for france he commented audibert interjected that the russians had supported deleting some sections of the draft unscr but had approved including sanctions on the irgc kouchner said that france had to proceed carefully since french woman had been taken hostage in tehran he disparaged fm mottakis duplicitous performance in munich afghanistan 10 snf on afghanistan kouchner confirmed that france would maintain its position that it could not add additional combat troops for the time being pledging that france would stay until the very end he said that the french would send 80 french trainers to kabul on their own but were also looking into joint training opportunities with germany possibly an omlt 11 snf kouchner solicited secdefs reaction to karzais idea of local noncombat zones gates said that he was not familiar with this proposal but was skeptical about declaring zones where the government could not use force since we could not enforce similar restraint on the taliban 12 snf the us secdef said supports reintegration and has money in its military budget to support shortterm efforts at integration similar to the sons of iraq initiative in anbar province kouchner commented that key was to provide higher salaries to the ana and anp secdef agreed noting that salary increases in late 2009 had led to an increase in recruits kouchner said that this made sense as we were fighting misery as well as terrorism pakistan 13 snf turning to pakistan secdef described the dramatic changes that had taken place over the past year it was astonishing that president zadari had remained in power and that the pakistanis had conducted such effective coin operations he noted that coordination between isaf and pakistans armed forces was improving and this was creating more difficult situation for the taliban along the border the pakistan operation in south waziristan had flushed out taliban and qaeda elements they were more vulnerable on the move moreover pakistans aggressive campaign against the insurgency had won broad political support among all political parties operations in the west and northwest had begun to accrue respect for pakistan army that musharraf had squandered it is important for all of us to talk to the pakistanis and provide economic assistance secdef commented that one can never be an optimist about pakistan but that the changes had been striking kouchner agreed with secdefs analysis that the changes in both the political and military spheres were nothing short of miracle nato 14 c kouchner then raised nato declaring that france was ready to play its role in defining the alliances future strategy he said that general abrial supreme allied commander transformation has offered input but emphasized that it was critical to come up with real strategy that we could explain in debates in parliament kouchner stressed that we needed to clarify natos roles and missions as well as its role in combating the threats of terrorism poverty and oppression secdef agreed that the strategic concept should deal with 21st century security threats q with an emphasis on the word security he said the strategic concept should also incorporate lessons learned from afghanistan particularly the need for comprehensive civilmilitary strategies and better partnership between nato and the eu and 15 c secdef said that nato reform should proceed handinhand with an examination of alliance threats and missions either as parallel process or as part of the strategic concept itself in this regard the alliance cannot afford so many headquarters and needs to take steps paris 00000174 003 of 003 to reduce overhead 16 c secdef also stated that the alliance should be clear as to what natos limits are for example it does not have role in the pacific we should adhere to the basic principle that nato is about the security of its member states we all face terrorist risks and there are many other new threats but secdef would be inclined to define future missions narrowly rather than broadly 17 snf kouchner highlighted piracy as an emerging issue on which the eu and nato were working together although the real problem was inside somalia as an aside he mentioned that france was willing to support the training of additional troops for the tfg 18 c kouchner argued that strengthening the european pillar in nato was necessary the eu cannot exist without defense the us needs strong european allies and strong european pillar was not in contradiction with nato secdef replied that during his time as secdef he has felt the need for better way for eu and nato to work together while nato is primarily security alliance it cant do its job without civilian component the eu is primarily politicaleconomic organization but he was willing to acknowledge that it had some security role such as counterpiracy or peacekeeping in chad secdef said that while each organization might have its primary role and mission they could both perform both functions 19 c interpreting secdefs latter comment as prohibiting an eu security role kouchner dissented and said that since 500 million people live in the european union the eu needed to be able to adequately protect them gates observed that france was just one of 5 or 6 nations that spent more than 2 percent of gdp on defense and that if the eu decided it needed an independent security role it could reduce number of forces available to nato and cripple the alliance even now nato had insufficient resources kouchner said that we needed to share burdens among all nations and that it was hard to make people spend more on defense in the midst of an economic crisis 20 u this cable has been cleared by secdef drafted by osd staff rivkin
