on the congress and legislative process government and finance division special rule is house resolution intende d to regulate floor consideration of specific legislative measure named in the re solution when adopted by the house the requirements prescribed by special rule can supersede the standing rules of the house as well as rulemaking provisions in statutes such as the congressional budget act but only in application to the measure named sp ecial rules serve two key functions 1 to enable the house to consider specified meas ure and 2 to establish specific terms for considering it including any modifications of the amending process this report identifies the most common kinds of modifications recommended by the rules committee in terms used by the committee for more information on legislative process see httpwwwcrsgovproductsguidesguidehomeshtml open rules when special rule states that measure is to be c onsidered for amendment under the fiveminute rule but includes further provision to modify the amending process it is defined by the house rules committee as an open rule under this circumstance members may offer any amendments that comply with the standing rules of the house modified open rules often special rules allow any member to offer germane amendm ents under the five minute rule subject only to an overall time limit on the amendment process or requirement that amendments be preprinted in the congressional record these rules place limitations on the substance of amendm ents and are designated by the rules committee as modified open rule closed rules when special rule allows amendments to be offered during consideration of measure other than those recommended by the committee reporting the bill it is defined by the rules committee as closed rule the rules committee defines special rule as closed even when motion to recommit with amendatory instructions is allowed because house rule xiii clause 6c2 prohibits the co mmittee from reporting special rule that would prevent the motion to recommit bill or resolution from being made as providedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98612crs2 in clause 2b of rule xix including mo tion to recommit with instructions to report back an amendment otherwise in order if ffered by the minority leader or designee modified closedstructured rules in modern practice special rules frequently place restrictions on the amending process that are less stringent than those of closed rule such rules may limit the amendments that are in order to those that are specified in the special rule or the report accompanying the rule typically the ru committee will notify members by dear colleague letter and an announcement on the floor of the intention to report such rule and will allow members to file their proposed amendments with the committee other modified closedstructured rules ma preclude the offering of amendments to one or more sections of measure other modifications of the amending process there are also other ways in which special rule may modify the amending process either separately or in comb ination with one of the categ ories described above for example the amending process normally doe s not allow for amendments that would reamend text that has already been amended however special rules occasionally provide that an amendment be in order notwithsta nding the adoption of previous amendment this variant is descri bed in crs report rs20313 queenofthehill rules in the house of representatives measures are normally read for amendment by section or by paragraph in the case of appropriations bills special rules may modify this practice by making it in order to read bill for amendment by title or to be open for amendment at any point special rules may modify the length of time that an amendment may be debated the application of the fiveminut rule may not be suitable in some instances particularly when the house debates major alternatives in such case special rule may provide for specified extended period of debate for an amendment usually equally divided and controlled by proponents and opponents of the amendment special rules may also protect all or sp ecified amendments from points of order by providing waivers of one or more house rule s such as the germaneness requirement in rule xvi clause 7 this varian t is described in crs report 98433 special rules and waivers of house rules the house may also adopt rule that simu ltaneously agrees to dispose of separate matter such as an amendment which is specified in the rule itself this variant is described in crs report 98710 selfexecuting rules reported by the house committee on rules
