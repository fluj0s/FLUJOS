bridge enewsletter lrhs congress lectures date demanding that somebody confront something theres where we sometimes seem to feel that cross mean or vicious methods have workability and we make mistake we believe that the viciousness the meanness and the threat of punishment is what is getting result that isnt whats getting result demanding that somebody confront something gets result punishment to restrain somebody from doing something never did otherwise than worsen that person to restrain person by threat of punishment from action will inevitably worsen that person oddly enough its true slow him down because it takes his awareness away it reduces his ability to confront life how about the other way around how about punishment threats and duress to make him confront something unfortunately works and those of us who have had great deal to do with the world of men and the world of duress know that it works and we very often fall into the fallacy of believing then that punishment works this excerpt was taken from the washington congress on antiradiation confront lectures confrontingness an article by l ron hubbard excerpted from the washington congress on antiradiation confront lectures the ability to confront is the ability to have space you have to have space in order to have universe and space is freedom and therefore if one is to be free one must be able to confront the man who is running away from the enemy is never afterwards free whether we call it guilt whether we call it cowardicewhatever we call it he is never afterwards free he would be freer if he were stonedead as body now look if this means so much if this very thing called freedom depends upon confrontingness wed certainly better know quite bit about it if the ability to handle to control to have to use to expend beingness livingness depends upon such things as i have read to you from this listhavingness confrontingness and so forththen wed better know lot about it and we do know lot about it i dare say we will know lot more about it one of these days but i can tell you right now it isnt necessarily true that this must be followed to get person into frame of mind that he cannot confront but how does person ordinarily get into the frame of mind that he feels he cant confront things not by the way by making up his mind that he cant he has assumed pattern already on the earlier track the motto of which is enough to confront he must have enough to confront if he doesnt have enough to confront he doesnt have and the whole thing comes down to what it says there in scientology 88008 on the subject of abundance in all things the easiest way to remedy confrontingness is to have the individual mock up things to confront in other words he gets less and less things to confront and after while he figures out that he cant confront them naturally thats true he cant confront podium that isnt sitting there but he says after while in order to confront podium it must be sitting there and that is not correct that is reaction that is the motto of the reactive mind and thats where reactiveness comes from it must be sitting there for to confront it if it isnt sitting there i cant confront it therefore it must follow that i am afraid to confront it therefore i must forget all about it and it is quantitative at that level of the scale and all you have to do is remedy the number of things he could have or confront and youve got it enough to confront thats all l ron hubbard excerpted from the lecture confrontingness this lecture is available in the washington congress on
