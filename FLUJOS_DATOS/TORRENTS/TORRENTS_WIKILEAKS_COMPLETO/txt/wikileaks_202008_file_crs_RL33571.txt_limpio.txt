respective versions of the national defense authorization act ndaa these contain numerous provisions that affect military personnel retirees and their family members provisions in one version are often not included in another treated differently or in certain cases they are identical following passage of each by the respective legislative body conference committee is typically convened to resolve the various differences between the house and senate versions if conference committee reports its final version of the authorization act the bill is returned to the house and senate for their consideration upon final passage the act is sent to the president for his approval in the course of typical authorization cycle congressional staffs receive many constituent requests for information on provisions contained within the annual ndaa this report highlights those personnelrelated issues that seem to generate the most intense constituent interest and tracks their status in the fy2007 house and senate versions of the ndaa the house bill was hr 5122 and was approved by the house on may 11 2006 on june 22 2006 the senate struck all after the enacting clause of hr 5122 and substituted the language of its defense authorization bill s 2766 the resulting conference report hrept 109702 was approved by the house on september 29 2006 and by the senate on september 30 2006 it was signed

varied from one to two years in grade for promotion to first lieutenant or navy lieutenant junior grade and another one to two years for promotion to captain or navy lieutenant time from commissioning to promotion to captain or navy lieutenant has therefore ranged from two to four years generally time ingrade requirements are reduced during periods of hostilities and increased in the absence of

heart medal for prisoners of war background the purple heart medal is awarded to any member of the armed forces for wounds or death as result of an act of an opposing armed force international terrorist attack or as the result of military operations while serving as part of peacekeeping force in 1962 executive order 11016 expanded authority for the awarding of the medal to wounds and death resulting from conflicts other than war later that same year army policy was modified to allow prisoners of war pow to receive the medal if wounded or injured by their captors the policy change was not retroactive in 1996 public law 104106 expanded eligibility for the purple heart to those prisoners of war who were wounded before april 25 1962 while held as prisoner of war or while being taken

treatment which the joint chiefs of staff currently do not qualify the decedent for award of the purple heart and for military members who survive captivity as prisoners of war but die thereafter as result of disease or disability incurred during captivity discussion house language would have expanded the eligibility to receive the purple heart to pows who die while in captivity or die after release of injuries or illnesses incurred while pow the former group would receive the purple heart not necessarily as result of wounds or injuries suffered but because they died as prisoners the second group includes those who suffer disease or disability not necessarily related to their treatment by their captors as pow senate and conference language seeks presidential report on the issue

public pronouncements complaints have been made that chaplains are not being inclusive in their statements and have offended individuals of other religions within the past year both the navy and air force have issued rules allowing chaplains to pray as they wish during voluntary worship services but to be nonsectarian or utilize moment of silence during public meetings or ceremonies religious groups particularly evangelical christians have complained that such rules are violation of freedom of religion represent gag order on leaders of faith and appear to be motivated by political correctness any administrative or legislative activity in this area could raise constitutional questions particularly with regard to the first amendment house hr 5122 senate s 2766 conference sec 590 would add language to each of language was reported language was reported however the the service sections including the conference committee directed the academies stating that chaplains shall secretaries of the navy and the air have the prerogative to pray according force to rescind recent directives and to the dictates of the chaplains instructions thereby undoing recent conscience except as must be limited service changes by military necessity with any such limitation being imposed in the least restrictive manner feasible discussion if enacted this language would have allowed chaplains to invoke sectarian comments eg to mention jesus christ allah or buddha during public meetings or ceremonies in other words military necessity considered sectarian comments would not be

bonus for transfer between the services from 2500 to 10000 discussion experience from the armed forces drawdowns of the early and mid1990s has demonstrated that voluntary separation programs are preferable to involuntary programs vsi allows the services to target overstrength ranks years of service skill rating military specialty or competitive category to best shape the force for the future using the senate provision as an example an air force captain with 10 years of service would be eligible for maximum vsi payment of approximately 235000 according to army officials the incentive bonus

service performed and divides by 360 to produce the number of years of service given the less than fulltime nature of normal reserve service this means that an individual who has been serving in the

organizations becoming less integrated with the army and air force additionally he argued that the legislation has not been adequately studied and could have negative unforseen consequences the house version of the ndaa would have directed the commission on the national guard and reserve to study hr 5200 and an alternative proposal which would have simply elevated the cngb to the rank of fourstar general the senate version of the ndaa contained scaledback version of s 2658 which omitted some of the most controversial provisions of that bill for example the provision making the cngb member of
