of deoxyribonucleic acid dna evidence has been an important tool in law enforcement dna analysis has significantly changed the way crime scenes are investigated and how prosecuti ons are conducted the federal bureau of investigation fbi started its dna database in 1988 ce then the fbi has led law enforcement agencies throughout the unite d states to standardize dna analyses to be submitted into the fbis combined dna index system codis the collection of dna for use in criminal investigations has grown much faster than the resources to analyze it as re sult many publicly f unded laboratories across the country have been experiencing diffi culty in meeting the demand and reducing the backlog of requests meanwhile state and federal statutory regulations have been enacted to require dna samples to be take n from those convicted of certain criminal offenses during the 1990s and more r ecently congressional concern over the need for federal assistance to crime labs led to the enactment of several measures on march 11 2003 the bush administration announced major dna initiative the advancing justice thr ough dna technology act of 2003 pl 108 405 addressed many of the proposals ra ised in the administrations initiative including authorizing funding to elimin ate state and federal dna backlogs and expanding grant program to state and local governments to perform dna analysis of samples collected from convicted indi viduals and violent crime scenes among other things the act also set forth c onditions under which fede ral prisoners could obtain postconviction dna testing and aut horizes funding for representational support for both the prosecution and defense in capital cases the 109th congress passed the violence ag ainst women and department of justice reauthorization

the act broadens the federal governments authority to collect dna sample from individuals for inclusion in the fbis combined dna indexing system codis introduction1 deoxyribonucleic acid or dna is the f undamental building block for an individuals entire genetic makeup dna is powerful tool for law enforcement investigations because each persons dna is different from every other individuals except for identical twins by analyzin g selected dna sequences called markers forensic laboratory can deve lop profile to be used in identifying person from dna sample2 dna can be extracted from number of bi ological tissues such as hair bone teeth saliva and blood because the human body contains so many copies of dna even minuscule amount of body fluid or tissue can yield useful information statutory provisions authorize criminal jus tice officials to co llect dna samples from federal offenders3 district of columbia offenders4 and military offenders5 federal law also features grant program under which dnaidentifying information collected by state law enforcement officials is fed into codis and available to law enforcement officials online6 obtaining dna sample from suspect or convicted offender does not have to be an invasive procedure it can be as simple as swab of the inside of the mouth with qtip to obt ain some saliva if applicable law permits this method of collectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32247crs2 7 see attorney general report to congress national forensic dna study report final report dec 12 2003 p 3 httpwwwojpusdojgov nijpdfdna_studyreport_finalpdf

and federal forensic laboratories as result these profiles are not added into dna databases in timely manner backlogs include casework samples which consist of dna samples obtained from crime scenes vi ctims and suspects in criminal cases and backlogs of states convicted offende r samples which c onsist of dna samples obtained from convicted offenders who are incarcerated or under court supervision additionally the fbis federal convict ed offender program fcop which is responsible for processing and analyzin g offender or arrestee samples from the federal bureau of prisons the federal pr obation offices and the court services and offender supervision agency for the district of columbia also faces backlogs of offender dna samples although progress has been made the national institute of justice nij estimates that up to 90 of the dna samples in this country identified for testing had not yet made it to laboratory with new samples sitting at police stations waiting for criminalists to complete other cases7 nij also estimated that there was backlog of over half million total crime samples nationwide that had not been tested with over 221000 of those being homicide and rape cases8 some city and state fore nsic laboratories have been the subject of media attention due to inefficiencies and test results that have been called into question with the backlog in samples around the country and the potential postconviction uses of dna testing including the po ssibility of freeing prisoners who were erroneously convicted congress has turn ed its attention to dna and its implications when used during criminal investigati on and prosecution this report discusses possible issues that may be of concern to congress background few would argue that dna has become the most significant weapon in crime detection since the introduction of fingerprin ting in the early 1900s state and federal dna databases have proved instrumental in solving crimes reducing the risk of convicting the wrong person and establis hing the innocence of those wrongly convicted the fbi has chosen 13 markers to serve as the basis for entry into the federal database the national dna index system ndis with the intention that all forensic laboratories would be equipped to handle these 13 markers collectively the 13 markers provide great discriminatory power the chance that two unrelated people would have the same pr ofile is judged to be extremely small less than one in hundreds of trillions9 dna evidence is used to solve crimes in two wayshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32247crs3 10 john

cases where suspect is not known biological evidence from the crime scene can be analyzed and compared to offender profiles contained in existing dna databases to assist in identifying the perpetrator through the use of dna databases biological evidence found at one crime scene can also be connected to other crime scenes linking them to the same perpetrator or perpetrators according to the fbi more than 8000 dna samples from the scenes of unsolved crimes have been matched with samples taken from inmates after their imprisonment an additional 3000 crime scene samples have been matched to unidentified suspects who remain at large10 current federal statutory law as early as the 1980s states began acting laws that required dna samples from those offenders convicted of sexual offenses and other violent crimes the samples were then analyzed and their profiles entered into state databases meanwhile the fbi laboratory convened wo rking group of federal state and local forensic scientists to blish guidelines for the use of forensic dna analysis in laboratories the group proposed guidelines that are the basis of present national quality assurance standards and it urged the creation of national dna database11 the criminal justice comm unity began to utilize dna analyses more often in criminal investigations and trials and congress enacted legislation to better define how dna could be used during the 1990s and more recently congressional concern over the need for federal assistance for crime labs led to the enactment of several measures the following section mmarizes current federal law as it pertains to dna used in criminal justice capacity the dna identification act of 1994 pl 103322 the dna identification act of 1994 is subtitle of the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 it was enacted to improve the capabilities and capacity of state and local forensic dna laborator ies to support the investigation and prosecution of violent crime the act di d

grant program for states to to he lp defray the costs of postconviction dna testing24 the act also established incentive grants to states to encourage dna testing of offenders sentenced to death by an accredited laboratory as condition for receiving the grant states must develop plans to ensure that there is prompt dna testing of people who may have been wrongly convict ed while at the same time ensuring that procedures are in place to discourage frivolous testing in addition to the grant program the act established postconviction dna tes ting standards and procedures for federal offende rs who could not have obtai ned such forensic testing at the time of their trials the act required the attorney general to submit dna test results to the national dna index system under the following circumstances if the current test results are inconclusive if the results show that the offender was the source of the dnaevidence or if the results show that the offenders dna matches the dnacollected from another offense the act required that if the results from the dna sample of the offender do not match the dna evidence sample or that of anothe r offense the dna sample of the

however only two bills have receive congre ssional action as discu ssed below other pieces of legislation that have been intr oduced in the current congress are discussed later in the report violence against women and department of justice reauthorization act of 2005 pl 109162 title x of pl 109162 the dna fingerprinting act of 2005 made several changes to current law among other provisions the act authorizes federal authorities to take dna samp from larger categories of individuals including those who are arrested and detained and include the dna analysis in the federal bureau of investigations fbis comb ined dna index system codis the act however requires the director of the fb i to expunge the dna analysis from codis of arrestees for whom the attorney genera l receives certified copy of final court order that establishes the charge has been dismissed resulted in an acquittal or that charge was filed within the applicable time period the act also requires the director of the federal bureau of inve stigation to expunge the dna analysis from codis of individuals whose convictions have been overturned similar measure was previously passed in the house on september 14 2005 see title ii of the childrens safety ac t of 2005 hr 3132 selective legislative issues for congress while there is opposition from some civ il libertarians on the broad use of dna by law enforcement proponents contend th at by having na tional dna database or system that coordinates multiple databases such as codis may in some cases actually protect those wrongfully accused or even convicted nonetheless there are number of issues that arise when disc ussing broadening the dna database in addition to dna database related issues other issues concerning the use of dna for law enforcement purposes are also present as discussed below broadening the database while all states collect samples from so categories of convicted offenders they vary in the types of crimes for wh ich they collect dna samples with the trend toward broader sample collection number of st ates collect samples from juveniles adjudicated delinquent on the ba sis of various crimes few collect samples from anyone arrested not just c onvicted offenders substantial number of states have enacted legi slation authorizing the collection of dna samples from all offenders convicted of felony pl 108405 expands the categories of convicted federal offenders from whom the collecti on of dna samples is authorized and pl 109169 further expands the categories of indi viduals who are eligib to have their dna collected to include arre stees see discussion abovehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32247crs9 25 42 usc 14132a1expanding the national data base to include persons convicted of lesser crimes or even arrestees could potentially increase the number of crimes solved through its use however the increased use and inclusiveness of dna databases across the country raises several concer ns while other crimes may be solved by expanding the categories of offenders included in dna da tabases at what point does the cost associated with the additional dna samples to be an alyzed outweigh the benefit moreover expanding the number of samples that need to be processed could add to the already taxed forensic sc ience budgets of many states comprehensiveness of the national dna index should all dna profiles collected by states be added into th national database the statute governing the national dna inde x allows the inclusion of dna profiles of persons convicted of crimes25 however it does not permit the inclusion of all dna profiles from samples collect ed under applicable state authorities such as those from adjudicated juveniles or individuals arrested but not convicted of crimes because what can be included in the na tional dna database is narrower than the scope of dna sample collection under some state statutes it has been argued that the effectiveness of the nati onal dna index is hindered for example most stat collect dna samples from some categories of adjudicated juvenile delinquents so states have authorized dna sample collection from certain arrestees on categori cal basis these states can collect dna samples and include the resulting dna prof iles in their own da tabases however they cannot submit this information to be entered into the national dna index pl 108405 allows for the submitting jurisdictions to include any dna profile from persons from whom they lawfully collected samples critics however have voiced strong concerns that such testing would violate constitutional rights to privacy and protections against illegal searches and seizures postconviction dna testing most states have made provisions fo r postconviction dna testing in 2003 the administration proposed to establish postconviction dna tes ting standards and procedures for federal prisone rs who could not have obtai ned such forensic testing at the time of their trials under the pr oposal procedures woul d be implemented in order to ensure that the use of dna ev idence could demonstrate innocence of the crime for which the person was convicted because he or she was mistakenly identified pl 108405 created the kirk bloodsworth postconviction dna testing grant program which awards grants to states to help defray the cost of post conviction dna testing pa rticipation in the progra m however is
