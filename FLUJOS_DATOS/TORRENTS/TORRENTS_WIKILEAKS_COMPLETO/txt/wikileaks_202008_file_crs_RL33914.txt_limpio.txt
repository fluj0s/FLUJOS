2008 susan thaul specialist in drug safety and effectiveness domestic social policy division the prescription drug user fee act pdufa history reauthorization in 2007 and effect on fda summary in 1992 congress passed the prescription drug user fee act pdufa i to give the food and drug administration fda revenue source fees paid by the pharmaceutical manufacturers to supplement not replace direct appropriations the impetus behind the 1992 law stemmed from the length of time between manufacturers submission of an fda new drug application nda or biologics license application bla and the agencys decision on approval or licensure fda had attributed the delay which affected patients and manufacturers to constraints on its ability to hire and support review staff congress reauthorized the user fee program in 1997 pdufa ii in 2002 pdufa iii and most recently in 2007 pdufa iv as title i of the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 fdaaa pl 11085 congress intended pdufa to diminish the backlog of applications at fda and increasingly shorten the time from submission to decision pdufa ii expanded the programs scope to include activities related to the investigational phases of new drugs development and to increase fda communications with industry and consumer groups pdufa iii again expanded the scope of authorized activities to include both preclinical development and threeyear postapproval period in keeping with the law fda has worked with the drug manufacturers to set pdufa performance goals which the secretary of health and human services hhs has submitted in letters to the chairs of the relevant congressional authorizing committees the secretary also submits annual performance and financial reports in crafting pdufa iv the most recent reauthorization the 110th congress addressed workload and compensation adjustments expanded the authorized range of safety activities to include development of data collection systems and analytic tools and enforcement of postapproval study labeling and risk evaluation and mitigation strategy requirements increased public communication requirements and authorized user fee for the advisory review of prescription drug television ads the general view is that pdufa has succeeded fda has added review staff and reduced its review times at each reauthorization however discussion returns to certain issues in the context of pdufa that also reflect broader fda concerns these include budget choices under limited resources including the relationship between direct appropriations and user fees the identification and amelioration of conflicts of interest when the regulated industry is major source of industry funding and the tension between making new drugs available to the public and ensuring

reauthorization in 2007 and effect on fda in september 2007 congress reauthorized the prescription drug user fee act pdufa1 this was the third fiveyear extension of the original 1992 law since 1993 the program has enabled the food and drug administration fda to collect and use fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers to review marketing applications concerning prescription drug and biological products the law intends those fees to supplement direct appropriations not replace them this most recent version of the user fee program often referred to as pdufa iv retains the basic structure and elements of the original pdufa like pdufa ii and pdufa iii pdufa iv addresses issues that had been either unnecessary or unrecognized in earlier versions of the law the current authority expires october 1 2012 this report reviews the history the four pdufa authorizations as well as the issues concerning them it first describes the situation that led to the introduction of prescription drug user fees it then describes the initial pdufa law and the incremental changes made in each of its reauthorizations the report closes with discussion of the intended and unintended effects of the prescription drug user fee program on fda both within the human drug program and agencywide this report presumes some knowledge of the approval process for drugs and biologics readers unfamiliar with those activities might benefit by first reading crs report rl32797 drug safety and effectiveness issues and action options after fda approval by susan thaul before prescription drug user fees the 1992 passage of pdufa had its origin in the dissatisfaction from industry consumers and fda itself all three felt it took far too long from the moment manufacturer submitted drug or biologics marketing application to the time fdas reached its decision in the late 1980s that process took median time of 29 months2 patients had to wait for access to the products for some patients drug 1 the

for sale could be the difference between life and death manufacturers in turn had to wait to begin to recoup the costs of research and development at that time fda estimated that each onemonth delay in reviews completion cost manufacturer 10 million3 fda argued that it needed more scientists to review the drug applications that were coming in and the ones already backlogged in its files it had not received sufficient appropriations to hire them for decades fda had asked congress for permission to implement user fees the pharmaceutical industry generally opposed them believing the funds might go into the treasury to reduce federal debt rather than help fund drug review the 1992 law became possible when fda and industry agreed on two steps performance goals setting target completion times for various review processes and the promise that these fees would supplement rather than replace funding that congress appropriated to fda those steps helped persuade industry groups the fees would reduce review times and gave fda the revenue source it had sought for over 20 years the prescription drug user fee act and its reauthorizations pdufa i congress first authorized fda to collect fees from pharmaceutical companies in 1992 with the prescription drug user fee act pdufa pl 102571 which amended the federal food drug and cosmetic act ffdca4 its goals were to speed up fdas review of new drug applications for approval and to diminish its backlog of applications pdufa specified the activities on which fda could spend the fees most of the collections were to be used to hire additional reviewers5 to keep funding predictable and stable congress required three kinds of prescription drug user fees and specified that they each make up onethird of the total fees collected 2

would pay an annual fee for each of its manufacturing establishments and product fees manufacturer would pay an annual fee for each of its products that fit within pdufas definition for fy1993 the standard application fee was approximately 100000 the law provided exceptions either exemptions or waivers for applications from small businesses or for drugs developed for unmet public health needs or orphan diseases6 pdufa i authorized fee revenue limits for each of fy1993 through fy1997 allowing also for adjustments based on inflation the fees collected in each fiscal year were to be in an amount equal to the amount specified in appropriations acts for such fiscal year in accordance with the agreement that brought about its passage pdufa i explicitly stated that the funds were to supplement not supplant congressional appropriations the law included complex formulas known as triggers to enforce that goal fda may collect and use fees only if the direct appropriations for the activities involved in the review of human drug applications and for fda activities overall remain funded at level at least equal to the prepdufa budget adjusted for inflation as specified in the statute pdufas basic goal was each year to reduce the time from the sponsors submission of an application to fdas decision regarding approval rather than listing specific performance goals in statutory language congress stated in the bills findings section 101 that 3 the fees authorized by this title will be dedicated toward expediting the review of human drug applications as set forth in the goals identified in the letters of september 14 1992 and september 21 1992 from the commissioner of food and drugs to the chairman of the energy and commerce committee of the house of representatives and the chairman of the labor and human resources committee of the senate as set forth at 138 cong rec h9099h9100 daily ed september 22 1992 this direction was not codified in the ffdca instead congress with that finding incorporated the performance goals listed in fda commissioner david kesslers september 1992 letters to the committee chairs7 the predominant goal was that by 6 the orphan drug act pl 97414 established incentives to encourage manufacturers to develop drugs for certain conditions as designated by fda for which there otherwise are insufficient financial

as laid out in performance goals identified in letters sent by the secretary of the department of health and human services hhs to the two authorizing committees mandated tighter performance goals more transparency in the drug review process and better communication with drug makers and patient advocacy groups and allowed fda to use pdufa revenue to consult with manufacturers before they submitted an application previously fda could use the fees only to review manufacturers application now fda could meet with manufacturer from the moment it began testing new drug in humans see figure

private stakeholders when considering the reauthorization of this program before its expiration10 allowed the collection development and review of postmarket safety information for up to three years on drugs approved after october 1 2002 which allowed the agency to double the number of staff monitoring side effects of drugs already on the market allowed biotechnology companies to request that fda select an independent consultant for which the manufacturer would pay to participate in fdas review of research activities authorized two pilot programs for the continuous rolling review of new drug applications for products designated for the fast track program because they would address serious or lifethreatening conditions for which other treatments were not available11 encouraged companies to include risk management plans in their prendabla meetings allowed the use of fees to develop databases documenting drugs use allowed the use of fees for risk management oversight in the peri approval period ie two to three years postapproval provided for first cycle preliminary reviews required the hhs secretary to note on fdas website if sponsor did not meet an agreedupon deadline to complete postmarket study and to note if the secretary considers the reasons given for study incompleteness to be unsatisfactory required any sponsor who failed to complete timely studies to notify health practitioners both of this failure and of unanswered questions related to the clinical benefit and safety of the product and added specificity to the availability and crediting of fees provision stating that fees authorized be collected and available for obligation only to the extent and in the amount provided in advance in appropriations acts and that such fees are authorized to remain available until expended pdufa allowed fda to use fee revenue for activities that were part of the process for the review of human drug applications both pdufa ii and pdufa iii expanded the scope of that definition beyond the review of submitted ndabla to include both earlier phases preclinical development clinical development and later phases postapproval safety surveillance and risk

approach to prescription drug user fees that congress first enacted in 199213 the pdufa provisions in fdaaa made some technical changes to the laws earlier versions and introduced some new elements14 for example pdufa iv added reverse trigger to the law turning around the concept of triggers that the earlier pdufa laws included to safeguard the prepdufa level of appropriations if appropriations for both fda as whole and for the agencys review of human drug applications exceed the amounts appropriated for those activities for fy2008 then authorized user fee revenue will be decreased by an amount up to 65 million of the increase in appropriations added fee revenues for drug safety totaling 225 million over the fiveyear reauthorization removed the calendar and time limitations on postapproval activities fda may therefore use pdufa funding for authorized activities throughout the life of product rather than the threeyear postapproval period that pdufa iii had allowed expanded the list of postmarket safety activities for which the fees could be used to include developing and using adverseevent datacollection systems including information technology systems developing and using improved analytical tools to assess potential safety problems including access to external data bases implementing and enforcing new ffdca requirements relating to postapproval studies clinical trials labeling changes and risk evaluation and mitigation strategies and managing adverse event reports authorized the assessment and collection of fees relating to advisory review of

effective january 31 2013 issues considered at each pdufa reauthorization pdufa has attracted both criticism and praise from industry fda staff consumers and members of congress the issues they raised played out in the legislative debate leading up to pdufa iv as they had at each earlier reauthorization although specific to pdufa these issues persist because they reflect broader questions about budget choices under limited resources the identification and amelioration of conflicts of interest and the tension between making new drugs available to the public and ensuring that those drugs be safe and effective the next section of this report uses data covering the period leading up to pdufa iv to illustrate those key issues likely to resurface particularly as congress plans for pdufa v scheduled for 2012 effect on review time based on its stated goals pdufa has been generally viewed as success fda has added review staff and now completes it reviews of ndabla applications more quickly and runs less of backlog median time from an nda or bla submission to fdas approval decision was 29 months in 1987 for the first two years of pdufa i it fell to 17 months in later years fda presented separate calculations for standard applications and priority applications15 table 1 shows median approval times for 1993 through 2006 in calendar year 2006 the median review times were 130 months for standard applications and 60 months for priority applications fda attributes shorter approval times to pdufafunded staff increases pdufa also funds fda activities with sponsors before their official nda or bla submissions resulting in increasingly more complete applications that require fewer extensive resubmissions 15 beginning in 1997 the goals distinguish between standard and priority

performance report to congress fda commented on the spike in approval times as seen in the 2002 data citing an imbalance between resources and workload that resulted in significant stress to the program as result of pdufa industry faces shorter and more predictable review times it has treated the perapplication fee about 100000 fy1993 and over 1 million fy200816 as an acceptable cost relative to the estimated 10 million monthly cost of delay in the years immediately before pdufa was enacted meanwhile pdufa has enabled consumers to have quicker access to new drugs such quicker access however has raised concerns first critics ask whether pdufas emphasis on speed results in inadequate review second they ask whether the increase in industry funding might lead to undue industry influence they are concerned that pdufa in the name of speed might lead fda to sacrifice safety and effectiveness 16 the fy2008 fee for an application requiring clinical data is 1178000 fda prescription drug user fee rates for fiscal year 2008 federal register vol 72 197 october 12 2007 pp 5810358106 crs9 many overlapping factors influence drug safety most unrelated to the source of funding some safety problems cannot be identified before public marketing17 in its consideration of pdufa and in other plans for fda the congress has discussed whether fda has the authority and resources to identify and then act on problems during both the premarket and postmarket periods it addressed these issues in fdaaa both in the pdufa title and broader drug safety title effect on fda resources the key to the shortening of review times is the influx of funds that pdufa allows this section first describes the extent of the collected fees and then discusses that revenue in the context of the budget for both the human drug program and fda overall what began as program to fund new drug review has budget management and policy implications beyond that figure 1 and figure 2 illustrate the resource funding and personnel history of the fda human drugs program from fy1989 through fy200718 table 2a and table 2b in the appendix provide detailed actual and inflationadjusted budget figures along with fulltime equivalent positions by funding source for selected fiscal years beginning in fy1994 user fees have made up an increasing proportion of fdas budget for human drug activities while total funding has increased over the period this has been entirely due to the increase in user fees congressional appropriations have remained essentially flat in real ie inflationadjusted terms indicating fulltime equivalent fte positions by funding source shows that the overall increase in personnel comes solely from the user fees first collected in fy1993 and that the overall increase in ftes obscures 19 decrease in ftes funded by congressional appropriations from fy1992 to fy2007 the pdufa triggers described above in particular and the relative contributions of appropriations and user fees to fdas budget for human drugs have implications for budget planning both within the human drugs activity area and in agencylevel decisions across all activities 17 see

activities the review of manufacturer applications to market drugs and biologics and still directs majority of fees to those tasks it is widely asserted that pdufa is responsible for what some observers view as an inappropriate budget imbalance between fdas premarket drug review and its postmarket safety activities they point out how pdufa requirements the trigger requirements that congressional appropriations for fdas review activities be maintained at least at 1992 levels and congressional budget trends increasing fda responsibilities at relatively flat funding levels result in squeezing out of nonpdufa related programs faced with losing fee revenue if pdufaauthorized activities decrease fda must prioritize its use of appropriated dollars to those activities critics say that nonpdufa activities such as the review of generic drug applications therefore suffer in part to address this concern the congress has with each pdufa reauthorization extended the scope of covered activities the top and middle sections of figure 3 illustrate the five stages of drug development beginning with basic research and continuing through preclinical development which could be research in the laboratory or with animals clinical research the phase 1 phase 2 and phase 3 trials that involve people and fda review and the related industryfda interactions19 the bottom third displays the span of industry rd activities over which the laws allowed pdufa fees to cover fda activities the law authorized fda to use pdufa i fees to fund only those activities from nda submission through the review decision pdufa ii allowed fda to use the funds for meetings with manufacturers during the clinical development stages going therefore from the investigational new drug ind submission through review and pdufa iii extended the time range at both ends to include the preclinical development period and up to three years after marketing begins pdufa iv removes the threeyear limit on postapproval activities fda may therefore use pdufa funding for authorized activities throughout the life of product 19 fda pdufa white paper 2005 figure 31 crs12 figure 3 drug research and

through its provision of fees the industry has too much influence over fda actions they believe that by structuring industry participation into the setting of performance goals the law creates conflicts of interest this is compounded because they say the process of setting performance goals is not transparent until an amendment in pdufa iv that requires consumer participation as well the law directed fda and manufacturers to meet in preparation for each pdufa reauthorization to discuss workload and revenue needed fda then submitted letter to the authorizing committees that presents performance goals for the following five years the performance goals regarding review activities were structured to include length of time in months and the percent of applications that would be completed in that time20 the industry participation in goal negotiation and the focus on review time created what some see as actual or the appearance of industry 20 in fy1994 for example fdas performance goal had been to review and act on 55 of new applications within 12 months over the years the goals reflected an increasing percentage of applications and decreasing number of months in which to make decision on those applications fda app pdufa performance goals fy1993fy1997 third annual performance report pdufa of 1992 fy1995 report to congress december 1995 pdufa reauthorization

the fee system contributes to quick and suboptimal reviews fda staff reports of pressure to meet performance goal deadlines suggest to some that safety and effectiveness data are being inadequately evaluated21 interaction with congressional appropriations decisions as previously noted user fees are an increasing part of fdas budget in fy2008 user fees contribute 242 of fda budget looking only at the agencys human drug program basically that is the center for drug evaluation and research and related activities of the office of regulatory affairs as in figure 1 and tables 2a and 2b in the appendix for fy2008 user fees contribute 484 of the drug programs budget not shown on the figure the fy2008 enacted budget for the human drug program shows user fees contributing 58 of the premarket activities total and 253 of the postmarket activities total22 fda relies on fee revenue for maintaining its expert science base via staff retention critics say that fda is becoming too dependent on industry fees to carry out its normal review activities related concern is that the large percentage of fdas budget being covered by user fees may undercut congressional support for increases in direct appropriations to the agency leaving aside some critics distrust of the pharmaceutical industrys motives other political and health analysts believe that drug application review is regulatory responsibility that the federal government should shoulder completely they believe that rather than rely on user fees congress should appropriate the full amount necessary to support fda is its mission to protect the publics health23 21 see for example union of concerned scientists fda scientists pressured to exclude alter findings scientists fear retaliation for voicing safety concerns
