6111c01 shspec74 formation of commands details on formulating commands for goals processing you can have difficulty with some standard command like think of _______ in about 50 of cases the pc wont make sense out of think and it wont read you could clear the word very carefully get all his considerations process the condition etc or better yet find substitute the pc can understand often get the idea will work but if the second part of the command has it in another form then what well square it around so it makes sense cure for inability to think look around and find something thats not thinking be sure its clear to the pc dont find that you are having trouble with it after you have run it for three hours but dont go to the extreme of clearing the same command every session either just clear it when you first use it even if it looks fine to you see if it makes sense and is answerable to the pc mental concepts can exist in the absence of words when you are forming commands its concepts you want to communicate words express the form and character of the think thetan in order to communicate goes through mest and to hear takes the communication out of mest thats how he keeps off other thetans the whole business of forming commands uses that mechanism the command should of course always be duplicated thats havingness factor as well as not attracting the pcs attention and it makes him think repetitive thought which will eventually asis his circuits dont get pedantic about it process in the language he speaks including dialects and colloquialisms if you are trying to compose commands without knowledge of the basics of scientology youd do better to go hang yourself one of the basics is to make sense remember that if word was something the pc was quite rational about it wouldnt read in the first place and its not up to you to run language school for pc often he will cognite on what it means as you run it but if you have to change wordings to make the command grammatical or sensible be sure to get one that reads and has the same sense to the pc your commands are always being formed and cleared up against the raw stuff of which aberration is concocted as result it becomes tricky and vast subject the fundamentals of the mind are simple and not very many the difficulties of clearing and forming commands can cause the auditor to give up and just take commands lrh has given even if you do this try at least to understand the thought behind the command which is meant to be transmitted to the pc if it doesnt transmit because of some weirdness fix it up so it fits and transmits lrh expects that you would make sure its answerable dont change any commands that you are already running matter how much better you now see you could make it realize that commands are communication not semantics
