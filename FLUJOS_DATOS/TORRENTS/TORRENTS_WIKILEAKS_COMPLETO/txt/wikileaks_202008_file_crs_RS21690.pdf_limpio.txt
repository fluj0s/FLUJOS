provisions of current law regarding the prohibition of attorneys fees in certain situations the exception to this prohibition and the reduction of attorneys fees in certain circumstances were not amended the house report discussed the proposed at torneys fee provision noting that the committee remains concerned bout excessive litigation under the act and the burden that local educational agencies face in paying fees to attorneys10 the report noted that the governor may take the geographic differences in state into account and encouraged the governor to make the establis hed rates public prior to the beginning of the school year this provision was described in the report as helping to restore balance to the proceedings under this act and continue to provide early opportunities for schools and parents to foster more cooperative partnerships and resolve problems11 however the attorneys fees provision in hr 1350 has been criticized the minority views in the committee report argued for removal of the language stating there is question that this will limit access to knowledgeable and experienced legal representation by the people who need it th mostlow income inexperienced

court may in its discretion award reasonable atto rneys fees as part of the costs to the parents of child with disability who is the prevailing party however the senate bill would make some changes the senate bill would add requirement for preliminary meeting prior to due process hearing to provide an opportunity to resolve the complaint and the bill specifically provides that attorneys fees are not available for this preliminary meeting in addition the b ill would add language to the provision on the reduction of attorneys fees clarifying that if the parents attorn ey does not provide the required information to the local educational agency the court shall reduce the attorneys fees the senate bill would add new subsection specifically allowing parents to represent their children in court generally an individual has right to proceed as his or her own counsel in federal court13 rule 17 of the federal rules of civil procedure precludes minors from proceeding pro although representative or guardian may sue on the minors behalf however several circ uits have held that the right to proceed pro in federal court does not give parents who are not attorneys the right to represent their children14 the idea cases that have specifica lly addressed this issue have generally found that parents cannot proceed pro on behalf of their child15 the leading case is collinsgru v palmyra board of education where the third circuit held that parents seeking to enforce their childs substantive right to an appropria education under the idea may not represent their child in federal court16 however in detailed examination of the issue the first circuit declined to follow collinsgru in maroni v pemibaker regional school district the court held that pare nts do have procedural and substantive rights under idea since they are parties aggrieved because they are able to request due process hearings and thus ar logically within the groups of parties aggrieved given the right to

sea or lea against the attorney of parent or parent in certain circumstances the attorney of parent may be require d to pay the seas or leas fees if he or she files complaint that is frivolous unreasonable or without foundation continues to litigate when the litigation clearly became frivolous unreasonable or without foundation or if the complaint or subsequent cau of action was presented for any improper purpose such as to hara ss or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation like the provision relating to attorneys the parent of child with disability who files complaint may be required to pay th seas or leas attorneys fees if the complaint or subsequent cau of action was presented for any improper purpose such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation the senate bill also included provision th at nothing in the subparagraph shall be construed to affect the attorneys fees provisi ons applicable to the district of columbia in the senate debate on the attorneys fees amendment senator grassley stated that the amendment would in way limit or discourage pare nts from pursuing legitimate complaints against school district if they feel their childs school has not provided free appropriate public education it would simply give school districts little relief from abuses of the due process rights found in id ea and ensure that our taxpayer dollars go toward educating children not lining the pockets of unscrupulous trial lawyers19 senator gregg also emphasized the need for the attorneys fee amendment he noted thatthe concept that defendant should be able to obtain attorneys f ees when plaintiffs actions were frivolous unreasona ble or without foundation s been applied to title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 the supreme court in christiansburg garment co v equal employment opportunity commission 20 held that prevailing defendants should recover attorneys fees when plaintiffs actions were frivolous unreasonable or without foundation in order to protect defendants from burdensome litigation having legal or factual basis21 senator gregg observed that the st andard is very highand prevailing defendants are rarely able to meet it and obtain reimbursement of their attorneys feeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21690crs6 22 150 cong rec s5349 daily edmay 12 2004 23 id rule 11

cong rec s5349 daily ed may 12 2004 and that case law directs courts to consider the financial resources of the plaintiff in awarding attorneys fees to prevailing defendant22 the attorneys fee amendment also would allow defendants to recover fees if lawsuits were brought for an improper purpose senator gregg noted that this concept was drawn from rule 11 of the fe deral rules of civil procedure23 and that in interpreting this language from rule 11 c ourts must apply an objective standard of reasonableness to the facts of the case24
