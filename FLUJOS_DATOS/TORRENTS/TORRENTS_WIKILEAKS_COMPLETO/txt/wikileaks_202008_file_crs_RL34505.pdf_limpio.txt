scholars including participants from across the political spectrum concerning the need to reform the us governments national security system reform proponents argue that the current architecture was designed to meet the global security challenges of the postworld war ii context and may not be appropriate for addressing 21stcentury challenges that architecture includes the organizations structures and processes that govern decisionmaking budgeting planning and execution and congressional oversight of national security activities strategic guidance documents including formal strategies and other forms of guidance are key element of that system the current debates are timely because they may shape how the new administration approaches strategy documents and how the 111th congress exercises oversight national security strategy can theoretically serve several distinct purposes by offering prioritized objectives and indicating which elements of national power ways and means are to be used to meet them it can provide guidance to departments and agencies to use in their internal processes for budgeting planning and executing and organizing training and equipping personnel by clearly linking goals and the approaches designed to meet them national security strategy can provide the executive branch key tool for justifying requested resources to congress by laying out detailed strategic vision it can help inform public audiences both at home and abroad about us government intent some critics charge that executive branch processes for developing strategy are flawed because for example they fail to establish priorities consider fiscal constraints or assign responsibilities to specific agencies some note that the issuance of strategic guidance does not always fully comply with legislative mandates while others note that the mandates themselves could be improvedfor example by better synchronizing requirements for related documents congress can continue to shape the role

still highly inchoate debate among practitioners and scholars including participants from across the political spectrum concerning the need to reform the us governments national security system1 reform proponents argue that much of the current architecture was designed to meet the global security challenges of the postworld war ii context and may not be appropriate for addressing 21stcentury challenges2 that architecture includes the organizations structures and processes that govern decision making budgeting planning and execution and congressional oversight of national security activities3 national security strategic guidance documents including formal strategies and other forms of guidance are key element of that system in general strategy articulates prioritized ends and then links means resources and ways approaches in plan of action to achieve those ends in given context4 strategy may be narrowly targeted designed to achieve one specific goal such as strategy for marketing campaign for single new product or it may address broad field including multiple prioritized objectives and initiatives such as companys overall strategy to succeed in the marketplace5 at its best strategy is iterativethat is there are feedback loops in place to help update the strategy based on the changing outside environment and on lessons learned as the strategy is implemented national security strategy for the us government can theoretically serve several distinct purposes by offering prioritized objectives and indicating which elements of national power ways and means are to be used to meet them it can provide guidance to departments and agencies to use in their internal processes for budgeting planning and executing and organizing training and equipping personnel by clearly linking goals and the approaches designed to meet them national security strategy can provide the executive branch key tool for justifying requested resources to congress 1 for an overview of the current national security reform debates see crs report rl34455 organizing the us government for national security overview of the interagency reform debates by catherine dale nina m serafino and pat towell 2 the cornerstone of the current system is still the national security act of 1947 and its subsequent amendments that legislation laid the foundations of new national security regime including the creation of the national security council the central intelligence agency the department of defense separate department of the air force and permanent joint chiefs of staff see national security act of 1947 pl 80235 3 there is single shared understanding of the concept of national securitysome observers include homeland security while others focus exclusively on challenges abroad some observers include economic energy andor environmental security while others prefer narrower definition 4 for an overview of the elements of strategy see john m collins military strategy principles practices and historical perspectives potomac books inc dulles va 2001 5 the october 2007 national strategy for homeland security defines strategy only in the more limited sense focused on single goal as an integrated approach to achieve policy that takes into account underlying assumptions context tradeoffs and necessary resources see homeland security council national strategy for

security strategy the national defense strategy together with the quadrennial defense review report and the national military strategy the military strategy written by the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff describes how the military will operationalize the defense strategy written by the secretary of defense which in turn covers those aspects of the security strategy for which the department of defense is responsible all of the strategies are mandated by law and their contents are prescribed in some detail to date execution has not always precisely matched the letter of the law this section

onetime legislative requirement see above and in 2001 and 2006 on the basis of the permanent mandate15 all three qdr reports were submitted to congress on time16 the first two qdr reports included defense strategy as mandated by legislation section iii of the 1997 qdr report was entitled defense strategy and it began with summary of national security strategy including national interests that summary was based on the recent february 1996 white house document national security strategy of engagement and enlargement section ii of the 2001 qdr report was entitled defense strategy at the time the review was conducted and the report written the most recent national security strategy dated from december 2000 national security strategy for global age written by the clinton administration the 2001 qdr report described broad national objectivespeace freedom and prosperitybut did not refer specifically to national strategy 17 in departure from past practice dod issued the march 2005 national defense strategy nds separately from and prior to its partner qdr report which was issued in february 2006 the nds repeatedly cited the most recent national security strategy at the time from september 2002 the 2005 nds was notable for introducing new quadripartite categorization of global security challenges traditional irregular catastrophic or disruptive the 2006 qdr report emphasized its direct link with the 2005 nds it stated the foundation of this qdr is the national defense strategy published in march 200518 and it echoed the four global security challenges introduced by the nds the 2006 report also established four focus areas defeating terrorist networks defending the homeland in depth shaping the choices of countries at strategic crossroads and preventing hostile states and nonstate actors fr om acquiring or using wmd these four areas were not assigned relative priority but they were labeled priority areas in comparison with other possible issues the report described each area and the capabilities it required provided refined version of the force planning construct the guidance used for sizing and shaping the force discussed 10 portfolios of capabilities including implied tasks and addressed three sets of institutional and organizational concernsthe defense enterprise dod personnel and coordination with other agencies and with international partners the law requires that the next qdr be conducted in 2009 and that qdr report be submitted to the congress by early february 2010 following the separate document model established by 15 substantively

subsequent national military strategy reports were due to the armed services committees in february 2006 and february 2008 the absence until as late as 2003 of codified permanent national military strategy requirement may seem surprising but the general need for military strategy was recognized in both law and practice much earlier24 prior to the 1986 goldwaternichols act title 10 us code described the duties of the joint chiefs of staff as including preparing strategic plans and providing the strategic direction of the armed forces25 the goldwaternichols act amended title 10 to include new section 153 which assigns responsibility to the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff for assisting the president and secretary of defense in providing for the strategic direction of the armed forces as well as preparing strategic plans including plans which conform with resource levels projected by the secretary of defense to be available for the period of time for which the plans are to be effective 26 national military strategies have also been required in the past on limited basis the ndaa for fy1991 required the submission of military strategy report to congress during fiscal years 1992 1993 and 199427 in contrast to the current mandate the responsible party was the secretary of defense while the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff was to participate fully in the development of the report the report was to be submitted in both classified and unclassified formats to cover period of at least 10 years to be fiscally constrained and to address series of specified

documents are congressionally mandated 29 as rule most formal strategies are unclassified and they require or imply participation from more than one department or agency their scope ranges from multifaceted concerns such as national security and intelligence to specific topics such as national security personnel development typically written strategies state their relationships to other strategic guidance documents in the constellation of strategies the national strategy for combating terrorism nsct is one of those whose relationships with other strategies are most clearly defined

one of the security strategys eight major areas counterterrorism the division of labor between the nsct and the national strategy for homeland security the nsct added was that the homeland strategy

the homeland security architecture in general was created in response to the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 31 shortly after 911 president bush created the office of homeland security at the white house and tasked it as its first responsibility to produce national strategy for homeland security that strategy issued in july 2002 addressed broad strategic objectives and threats and proposed specific initiatives to meet those threats in six critical mission areas32 the 2002 national strategy for homeland security suggests but does not conclusively state conceptual dividing line between homeland and national security responsibilities for example the strategys first stated objective is to prevent terrorist attacks within the united states some observers might argue that this indicates that the boundaries of homeland security responsibility are the nations borders other observers might contend that preventing terrorist attacks at home requires actions abroad the homeland security act of 2002 which codified the organization and responsibilities of the homeland security council hsc nd created the department of homeland security dhs did not establish formal requirement for homeland security strategy33 it required the hsc to provide policy oversight and engage in assessment but not to craft strategy per se34 in october 2007 the homeland security council issued an updated national strategy for homeland security which addressed the same broad areas as its 2002 predecessornational objectives threats and initiatives35 the strategy noted that it complements other major strategic documents including the march 2006 national security strategy and the september 2006 national strategy to combat terrorism without spelling out the relationships among the three strategies as clearly as the 2003 nsct did36 in 2007 congress established new requirement for the secretary of homeland security to conduct quadrennial homeland security review qhsr on the model of the

requires that the qhsr be conducted every four years beginning in fy2009 and that report based on the review be submitted to congress by december 31 of the year in which the review is conducted38

homeland curity and other relevant governmental and nongovernmental entities including state local and tribal government officials members of congress private sector representatives academics and other policy experts 39 the report based on the qhsr is to be unclassified the department of homeland security is further instructed to make the report publicly available on its website40 concerning the relationship between the qhsr and the national strategy for homeland security which might be considered analogous to the relationship between the qdr and the national security strategy the legislation may be somewhat confusing to some the legislation requires that the qhsr be consistent with the national strategy for homeland security 41 at the same time the qhsr should update as appropriate the national homeland security strategy42 updating strategy while remaining consistent with it may sound like an unusual mandate but the problem may only be semantic the intent of the legislation seems to be that the qhsr should examine and update the full array of strategic approaches in manner broadly consistent with the presidents most recently published strategy 43 conceivably the subsequent iteration of the published strategy might reflect conclusions of the most recent qhsr the legislation does not specifically require the qhsr to be consistent with the current national security strategy but the requirement for consistency with appropriate national and department strategies might be understood to include the nss the qhsr legislation like that governing the quadrennial defense review is quite specific concerning the focus of the review and the contents of the report to be submitted to congress the qhsr report is to include description of threats to national homeland security interests the national homeland security strategy including prioritized list of the critical homeland security missions description of required interagency cooperation

and better identify the alignment of resources authorities and personnel needed to support those required capabilities this review would be used in turn to help dni develop and periodically adjust

law recent example is the submission by the current bush administration of only two national security strategies rather than meeting the annual submission requirement in the 1947 national security act as amended by goldwaternichols some observers have suggested that in todays globalized age any written document is by definition too staticthat agencies need more frequently updated guidance and that both congress and the public can gain more accurate understanding of current administration intent from public statements and congressional testimony other observers have suggested that while official written strategy has useful role to play an annual requirement for national security strategy may be too frequent some suggest that the broad contours of the global security environment do not change

specificissue strategies would derive guidance from and chronologically follow recent national security strategyfor example national security strategy would be followed by national defense strategy which in turn would be followed by national military strategy in recent practice the timeline has not quite worked that way the 2001 qdr report with its embedded national defense strategy was issued in september 2001 before the current bush administration issued its first national security strategy september 2002 the first national military strategy did not follow until 2004 and it almost immediately preceded the next national defense strategy issued in march 2005 year ahead of its accompanying qdr report february 2006 and just ahead of new national security strategy march 2006 in the defense arena current requirements for submission timelines are fairly wellsuited for logical sequential development of these nested strategies the qdr report and its accompanying defense strategy are due to congress by the date the president submits the budget for the next fiscal year at the beginning of an administrations second calendar year in office 54 the national security strategy for that year is due to congress on the same day in theory the qdr report and defense strategy could draw on the previous years national security strategy required 150 days after an administration takes office and perhaps on the concurrent development process for the secondyear national security strategy the national military strategy in turn is required to be submitted to congress by february 15 of evennumbered yearsthat is just several days after the submission of the national security strategyand either several days or two years and several days after the submission of the qdr report and defense strategy by these timelines development of the military strategy could draw on the defense strategy from two or four years earlier and perhaps on the concurrent defense strategy development

challenges or opportunities and to describe the capabilities required to meet those objectives the security strategy includes all elements of national powerand all relevant agencies civilian and militaryand is thus an umbrella for the dodcentric defense and military strategies the intended relationship between the defense and military strategies is less clear the 2004 national military strategy nms stated that it implements the national defense strategy nds the nms added that it derives objectives missions and capability requirements from an analysis of the national security strategy the nds and the security environment55 its own contribution in turn is providing set of interrelated military objectives and joint operating concepts that help service chiefs and combatant commanders identify required capabilities it is not completely clear conceptually what further refinement or additions defense objectives might require to become military objectives that senior leaders can use to identify requirements g18g155g146g152g155g146g157g146g163g138g157g146g152g151g561 prioritization of objectives and activities by leadership at one level can help leaders at the next subordinate level more appropriately shape their own strategies and target their efforts and resources the national security strategy could provide such guidance to dod and its qdr and defense strategy and those dod efforts could provide corresponding guidance to the joint staff for its military strategy as rule current strategic documents do not prioritize the objectives or missions they prescribe nor are they required to do so by law56 the most recent national security strategies include eight or nine focus areas but all of the areas are implicitly equal in weight the most recent quadrennial defense review report names four focus areas all implicitly of equal importance such guidance could theoretically be used by subordinate agencies or offices to justify budgeting to achieve very wide spectrum of capabilities g20g152g149g142g156g561g138g151g141g561g20g142g156g153g152g151g156g146g139g146g149g146g157g146g142g156g561 strategy at the national level generally addresses areas of effort that may require participation by multiple departments and agencies in many cases there might be multiple agencies that could conceivably accomplish the mission such as strengthening international partnerships for such mission possible instruments could include military exercises led by the department of defense development assistance programs led by the agency for international development and participation in multilateral organizations led by the department of state among others yet recent national strategies have rarely assigned responsibility for specific tasks to specific agencies by assigning responsibility for various missions national strategy might serve as tool for leadership to indicate the most appropriate arm of national power to bring to bear in each case because the messenger may be as important as the message using strategic documents to 55 see chairman of the joint chiefs of staff the nationa l military strategy of the united states of america

defense strategy and qdr and the national military strategy are not required by legislation to be fiscally constrained57 at the department of defense processes have long been in place under the broad heading planning programming budgeting and execution cycle ppbe to use strategy to inform budget decisions the ppbe cycle includes the development of classified internal strategic guidance documents that assign responsibilities and set priorities which are used in turn to inform programming and budgeting 58 there is close analog for translating strategy into budget at the national level

historical example may be president eisenhowers top secret project solarium established shortly after stalins death in 1953 to reassess us containment policy toward the soviet union the methodology include d the formation of three teams of seasoned experts and practitioners both military and civilian each team was assigned strategy to elaborate and defend after working for six weeks at the national war college the teams presented the strongest cases they could muster at session with the president eisenhower attended by the rest of the national security council senior military leaders and others 59 more recently congress when mandating the first quadrennial defense review also required the secretary of defense to establish nonpartisan independent panelthe national defense panelto assess the review process itself60 observers note that the legislative mandate and public voice including congressional testimony gave the panel an opportunity to shape the review process and its outcomes the 2006 qdr process was also assisted by the work of an independent panel of defense experts and retired flag officers although they did not have legislative mandate and their assessments were not made publicly available 57 one historical exception was the early 1990s temporary na tional military strategy requirement see national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1991 november 5 1990 pl 101510 1032 that legislation required that the secretary of defenses national military strategy report to congress include the secretarys recommendations for national military strategy that is both coherent and fiscally constrained 1032a2b the secretary was to base his recommendation on strategic military plan by the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff cjcs in that plan the cjcs was to

nominally intended to inform multiple audiences simultaneously the executive branch congress the american people and foreign audiences in practice some observers note national strategies have typically emphasized the public diplomacy function over the mandate to provide guidance within the executive branch as one observer noted strategies such as the national security strategy and national defense strategy are heavy on themes and messages and light on detail61 referring to the requirement for national security strategy the beyond goldwaternichols project based at the center for strategic and international studies csis argued that each administration from president reagan on has chosen to treat this statute primarily as requirement to publicly explain and sell its polices rather than an opportunity to undertake rigorous internal strategic planning process the result has consistently been glossy document that serves public affairs function but does little to guide us national security policymaking and resource allocation 62 it is possible that there are irreconcilable tensions in terms of classification level between the need to provided detailed guidance to subordin ates who will implement it and the need to explainand sella strategic vision to broader potentially skeptical public audiences at the department of defense for example the usual practice is to complement the public unclassified qdr report and military strategy with internal classified guidance documents that assign specific tasks to offices of primary responsibility 63 g22g146g150g142g143g155g138g150g142g561 as rule current security strategies are presenttense documentsthey describe security challenges and opportunities in the present tense rather than specifically addressing how those security conditions might be expected to evolve over time key exception is the qdr which is congressionally mandated to anticipate conditions and requirements 20 years into the future 64 61 see ltc nathan freier the strategy deficit strategic studies institute march 20 2008 available at httpwwwstrategicstudiesinstitutearmymilpdffilespub863pdf ltc freier adds none of the strategies can purport to involve the detailed articulation of achievable minimum essential ends the balanced adjudication of ways and means and thorough analysis of the risks associated with action andor inaction 62 clark murdock and michele flournoy lead investigators beyond goldwaternichols us government and defense reform for new strategic era phase 2 report center for strategic and

informed strategic planning guidance and joint planning guidance subsequently as part of comprehensive effort to rationalize and synchronize internal strategic documents dod established guidance for the employment of the force and guidance for the development of the force 64 two earlier products by the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff joint vision 2010 issued in 1996 and joint vision 2020

amending current legislative requirements to address some of the concerns noted above this section describes several of the most concrete proposals to date

national security review qnsr as an interagencylevel analogue to dods quadrennial defense review this proposal in its current form was put forward by the csis beyond goldwaternichols project and was later echoed by other commentators 65 the beyond goldwaternichols project recommended that congress amend legislation to replace the current requirement for national security strategy with requirement for the more rigorous qnsr66 the qnsr like the qdr would be review process as articulated by the beyond goldwaternichols project it would be led by senior official designated by the president and it would involve participation from all departments and agencies concerned with at least some national security issues it would include an assessment of the future security environment and the development of national security objectives it would produce strategy for achieving those objectives including identifying the capabilities required to implement the strategy and delineating agency roles and responsibilities similarly in december 2008 the project on national security reform pnsr which included broad coalition of national security experts called for national security review that would prioritize objectives establish risk management criteria specify roles and responsibilities for priority missions assess required capabilities and identify capability gaps 67 the proposal to create quadrennial national security review is quite different from the similar sounding proposal put forward by the commission on smart power also based at the center for 65 see clark murdock and michele flournoy lead investigators beyond goldwaternichols us government and defense reform for new strategic era phase 2 report center for strategic and international studies july 2005 p 28 similar proposal for quadrennial security review qsr was put forward earlier by the commission on roles and missions corm whose work was mandated by the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1994 november 30 1994 pl 103160 in title xiv national commission on roles and missions of the armed forces 14011411 the qsr which would be comprehensive strategy and force review at the start of each administration and an interagency activity directed by the national security councilresembles the later qnsr in proposed form but the substantive focus of the qsr sounds more defensecentric than that of the qnsr the corm noted for example that the qsr would address international political and economic trends changes in threats and military technology evolving opportunities for using military force to shape the security environment resources available for defense possible adjustments to existing national security policy or strategy and diverse set of military force and program options see john p

quadrennial smart power review68 the smart power review also modeled on the qdr would address the uses of all the civilian tools of national power the pro posed national security review by discussing both military and civilian tools would be broader in scope69 g16g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g21g142g140g158g155g146g157g162g561g18g149g138g151g151g146g151g144g561g9g158g146g141g138g151g140g142g561 second major proposal is that congress enact legislation to require the president to issue classified national security planning guidance the proposal was first put forward by the beyond goldwaternichols project and was echoed in the 2006 qdr report and the final report by pnsr 70 the guidance would be classified intended to convey intent and direction to subordinate organizations the guidance would set priorities and state national security objectives and the approaches and capabilities required to achieve them it would assign responsibility for specific tasks to specific agencies it could conceivably also provide specific fiscal guidance 71 the planning guidance would follow from the national security strategyor the quadrennial national security review bey ond goldwaternichols recommended that the guidance be issued in the first year of each new administration and updated biannually after that

strategic guidance requirements have observed that adequate personnel currently may not be available to manage and integrate complex multiagency reviews or planning processes one logical locus for such staffing support is the national security council nsc staff whose positions gi ve them access to highlevel debates and systemiclevel view above and outside the various equities of individual departments they are relatively wellplaced to help challenge assumptions and to identify gaps however as rule the daily work of nsc staff has shortterm focus on crises and other realtime requirements therefore some observers have suggested that should additional strategic guidance requirements be established expanding the nsc staff or redesignating the portfolios of some of its personnel might have to be considered one group of observerpractitioners recommended the creation and staffing of permanent new interagency planning and policy directorate within the nsc staff led by deputy national security advisor for interagency planning and policy who would be dualhatted as deputy director for national secur ity at the office of management and budget in 68 see richard l armitage and joseph s nye jr cochairs smarter more secure america center for strategic and international studies november 2007 p 67 the concept of smart power refers to an integration of traditional hard power the use of
