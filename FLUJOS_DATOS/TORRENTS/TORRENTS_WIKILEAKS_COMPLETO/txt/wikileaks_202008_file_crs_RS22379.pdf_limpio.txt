organic pollutants pops are chemicals that can harm human health and wildlife do not break down easily in the environment and tend to accumulate as they move up the food chain many pops are transported in the air and water across international boundaries most pops are synt hetic industrial chemi cals or pesticides but few are unintentional byproducts of processes such as combustion between 1998 and 2001 the united states part icipated in the negotiation of three united nationssponsored intern ational agreements to address global problems associated with pops two are treaties the 2001 st ockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants pops convention and the 1998 ro tterdam convention on the prior informed consent procedure for certain hazardous chemi cals and pesticides

polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs polychlorinated dibenzopdioxins the polychlorinated dibenzopfurans and 9 pesticides all of which are strictly regulated in the united states specific exemptions to the prohibitions are allowed eg the use of ddt to control mosquitos that may carry malaria the agreement has been ratified by 155 nations it entered into force on may 17 20041 the rotterdam pic convention was opened for signature in 1998 has been ratified by 120 nations and entered into force february 24 20042 it aims to ensure that importing nations know about and agree to imports of chemicals that are banned or severely restricted in the exporting country or that are severely hazardous pesticide formulations many pops fall into these categories the aarhus pops protocol was concluded in 1998 has been ratified by 29 of the 55 states in the united nations economic co mmission for europe unece and entered into force in october 20033 the protocol aims to elimin ate or restrict production and use ensure environmentally sound disposal nd restrict emissions for many of the same pops that are covered by th stockholm pops convention most are heavily restricted in the united states the president has signed and submitted the two treaties to the senate for advice and consent if the senate consents by twoth irds majority and if the united states enacts legislation needed to implement the treatie s and the executive agreement in the united states then the treaties can be ratified and the agreements would become binding us law the pops protocol doe s not require senate approval however legislation is needed to resolve inconsistencies betw een provisions of all three agreements and two us laws the toxic substances control act tsca wh ich governs industrial uses of chemicals and the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act fifra which regulates pesticide sale and use4 bills in the 107th 108th and 109th congresses would have authorized the us environmental protection agency to imple ment the agreements but proposal was enacted implementing legisla tion has been proposed in the 110th congress stakeholders appear united in their support fo r legislation authorizing regulation of the pesticides and other chemicals listed in annexes to the agreements however views diverge when changes to tsca and fifra are perceived to either simplify or complicate existing regulatory procedures or standard s under those laws either for the listed popshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22379crs3 or for other chemicals that might be added in the future through amendments to the agreements some believe that having agreed to international actions the united states should expedite them others are more cerned with protecting the power of congress to decide how and when to re gulate particular chemicals
