scope and methodology 6 unhcr received us 71 million from united nations development group iraq trust fund undgitf for the operations in souther n iraq and had expended about us 52 million in 2004 of which us 42 million 80 per c ent was through twelve implementing partners mostly international ngos 7 oios noted that the total expenditure recor ded against the project 04sbirqrp332 for the operations in southern iraq in 2004 was us 67 million our review concentrated on 2 the activities implemented by intersos expenditur us 15 million the salvation army expenditure us 15 million agency for technical c ooperation and development acted expenditure us 05 million and war child expen diture us 084 million we were unable to carry out an audit of danish refugee coun cil expenditure us 025 million as all accounting documentation had already been sent to t heir copenhagen headquarters from kuwait 8 after the august 2003 bombings that killed scores of personnel and decision to pullout the international staff from iraq unhcr tablished two offices in exile in amman and kuwait by october 2003 to remotely manage the i raq programme unhcr had to considerably rely on the ngo implementing partners for the programme implementation furthermore with prohibition on the travel of international staff to iraq in place unhcr resorted to other methodologies to monitor th programme implementation as the use of its traditional monitoring mechanism was not pos sible 9 also the ngos operating in iraq had serious constraints due to the deteriorating security situation which eventually led them to swi tch over to the remote management mode in southern iraq the international staff members f the ngos working with unhcr pulled out in the beginning of 2004 and most of them are b ased in kuwait furthermore most of the ngos have offices in kuwait the iraqi national st aff members of these ngos run the operations in southern iraq 10 oios review of the implementing partners was confined to the examination of accounting and other records made available in kuwa it the audit activities included limited review and assessment of internal control systems interviews with staff available in kuwait and analysis of applicable data iv audit findings risk exposure 11 due to the security situation inside iraq and the absence of reliable banking system unhcrs implementing partners used money traders to transfer the funds needed for the operations oios estimated that over 70 per cent f the funds for the operational projects were spent inside iraq in cash furthermore the nationa l staff members of the implementing partners were responsible for the receipt safekeeping and d isbursement of most of these funds 12 oios noted that ngo staff kept considerabl hard cash at their residences for example oios found that us 40000 in cash was hel d at an ngos staff members house considering the security situation the economic ch allenges confronting iraq the disproportionate level of salaries to national staf f compared to their responsibilities as well as the remote management of the operations by the impl ementing partners oios concluded that unhcr is exposed to high level of operational and financial risks not to mention the physical risk to national staff members the office of the chief of mission explained that t his was an isolated case due to the lack of banking s ystem inside iraq implementing partners have option but to rely on national staff for ndling cash the continued use of money traders for the operations is still the most reliab mode of fund transfers 13 in general the procurement procedures fol lowed by unhcrs implementing partners were not fully transparent intersos was responsib for the reception of returnees from iran 3 and saudi arabia at transit centre and their onwa rd transportation to their final destinations in iraq intersos expended over us 75000 in transpo rtation but documentation such as manifests and contracts were not available the au dit found that it was not possible to relate payment vouchers to the incoming convoys and subseq uent departure to the final destination from the transit centre oios recommended that int ersos maintain comprehensive details like final destinations paid for the number of returnee s in each bus the distances covered and the cost per km the office of the chief of mission explained that u nhcr national staff were closely involved in the reception of returnees and most of the documentation relating to the operations was available in basra the decision to engage vehicles off the market instead of service contract was based upon needs and in their opinion was the most cost effective 14 similarly acted which expended us 1850 00 on shelter construction activities did not have all the documentation in kuwait like bills of quantities bidding documentation receiving and other warehouse reports for the mater ials procured and consumed their files in kuwait contained only the payment vouchers 15 some of the implementing partners explaine d that most of the missing documents were available in their offices in iraq oios appreciat the logistical difficulties in moving documents from iraq to kuwait and the resulting ris ks involved and in these special circumstances will accept the partners explanation for the lack of adequate documentation to support the expenditures charged 16 most of the implementing partners explaine d that it was not always possible to institute open and fair procurement procedures for example selection of suppliers contractors was restricted to the entities operating in the village or district again for the fear of physical safety invitations to bid were not widely circulat ed the office of the chief of mission added that it was unsafe for outside bidders due to resis tance from the local community 17 with remote management strategy it was d ifficult to ensure appropriate controls were in place to mitigate the various risks identified i n the iraqi operation in some cases to ensure adequate controls in place was neither cost effecti ve nor feasible ioua explained that access to populations of concern was limited particularly in central iraq it was estimated that over 12 million persons were displaced at the end of 20 04 remote management does have and will continue to have serious impact on the unhcr s ability to discharge its core protection function b separate ledger 18 according to the memorandum of understandi ng between unhcr and undp unhcr was to establish separate ledger account fo r the receipt and administration of the funds from undgitf as reported by the board of uditors unhcr did not establish separate ledger to account for the funds received f rom undgitf but blended these funds with other donor sources and posted them to the pro ject account 04sbirqrp332 as result unhcr had to manually compile the expenditu re details from the financial reports received from the implementing partners to present the financial report to undgitf unhcr explained that with the ongoing implementatio n of the based new erp system msrp compliance with the requirement of separa ledger was difficult however unhcr is confident overcoming this limitation upon full implementation of msrp 4 c programme monitoring 19 considering the significant limitations of the iraq operation oios appreciated and commends the initiatives put into effect by the unh cr offices of particular significance were the ongoing efforts to engage professio nal firm to carry out technical evaluation of all the construction components of the 2004 program implementation and b implementation of webbased photo library wwwcb bkorg displaying the activities implemented in southern iraq in addition to the pho tographs and video clippings available in amman and kuwait 20 oios noted that monthly progress reports w ere received from the implementing partners and analyzed on the activities implemented though unhcr programme staff carried out financial verification of the spmrs fi nancial monitoring reports regularly better results would be attainable if the financial data w ere matched to the actual implementation level 21 oios was pleased to note that workshops an d trainings on essential skills were organized for both national and international staff members of implementing partners to ensure they are aware of and well trained in unhcr standar ds and guidelines eg procurement d audit certification 22 for 2004 subprojects executed by the impl ementing partners competitive bidding exercise was conducted to select an audit firm and the selection of audit firms was at an advanced stage at the time of audit v acknowledgement 23 i wish to express my appreciation for the assistance and cooperation extended to the auditors by the staff of unhcr in kuwait and its im plementing partners egbert c kaltenbach chief unhcr audit service office of internal oversight services
