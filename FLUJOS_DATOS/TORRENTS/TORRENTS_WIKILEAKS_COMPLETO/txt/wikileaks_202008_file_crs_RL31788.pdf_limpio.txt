making assistance available for 2001 and 2002 losses lthough ac tion was taken in the 107th congress the issue was expected to be considered again early in the 108th congress for an update on action in the new congress go to the link in footnote 1 at issue was whether proposed adhoc disaster assistance should be provided without equivalent reducti ons in spending on other programs proponents of additional assistance claimed that available programs were not adequately addressing farmers needs the president stated that the new farm spending authorized by the omnibus 2002 farm bill pl 107171

programs which fund advertising re search and other marketenhancing activities vi ew them as selfhelp g overnment involvement and cost are minimal producers and often im porters are required to fund the programs through assessments usually deducted from revenue at time of sale thus the name checkoff usdas role largely is limited to administrative and oversight duties the mandatory aspects of checkoffs have generated strong opposition among some farmers who contend they must pay taxes for activities they would not underwrite voluntarily groups representing these producers have challenged the programs in usda and the courts two cases reached the us supreme court which was asked to decide on whether the programs violate the free speech provisions of the first amendment beef in 2001 the supreme court found in united states v united foods inc 533 us 405412 2001 that the mushr oom checkoff infringed upon free speech the courts decision potentially impacts other legal challenges of some of the 15 operational federa llyauthorized checkoff programs on june 21 2002 us district court in south dakota agreed that the national beef checkoff also violates the first amendment the court ordered ll beef assessments to halt by july 15 2002 but the order was stayed while the us government appealed the ruling pork in augustseptember 2000 us da conducted nonbi nding referendum on whether to continue the pork checkoff at the behest of several producer groups led by the campaign for family farms th groups prevailed to end the program but the national pork producers council n ppc subsequently won temporary restraining order to prevent usda from publishing final termination rule february 2001 settlement agreement was reached whereby the checkoff would continue with modifications including ssurances that the checkoff board would operate independently of nppc and be mo re responsive to produ cers cerns about its activities in addition usda will conduc t survey in june 2003 and if 15 of producers and importers favor binding refe rendum it will be held within one year3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31788crs6 3 continued httpwwwamsusdagovlsgmpbporkhtmlegal challenges to the pork check off continued in october 2002 us district judge in michigan ruled that the checkoff violates free speech and ordered halt in collection of funds effective n ovember 25 the department of justice requested the sixth circuit court of appeals to stay the ruling and stay was granted allowing collections to continue awaiting the appeals process on september 16 2002 usda published fi nal rule effective september 30 2002 in the federal register to reduce the assessment ra from 045 45 cents per 100 of hog market price to 040 as r ecommended by the national pork producers delegate body usda also decreased assessments on impor ted pork and products to reflect the combined effect of the increase in the 2001 average price for domestic barrows and gilts and the proposed 005 decrease in the assessment rate the assessment change will decrease annual f unding of the checkoff program by an estimated 56 million annually with an estimated 290000 decrease in importer assessments farm bill 10607 of the farm law exempts from any commodity checkoffs persons who produce and mark et 100 organic products competition and industry structure concentration in an imal agriculture continuing trend toward consolidation within agriculture generated legislative interest in the effect of concentration nd consolidation on us agriculture strong interest by producer groups nd policy makers grew out of the ongoing changes in the structure and business methods of the lives tock industry including consolidation of production and processing into fewer and larger operations more vertical integration ie ownership or increased control of more than one phase of production and marketing by single firm and the gradual shift from mainly open cash markets to private contracts or other marketing agreements between buyers and sellers at issue were the impacts positive and negativ on traditional producers rural economies consumer choices and prices nd the environment and the role if any that government should play many animal producers believe increasing concentration and other changes have resulted in less open market environment and contributed to the lower prices they have been receiving that is as meat packers ie those who slaughter and process animals acquire more of their slaughter n eeds via ownership contracts or marketing agreements they purchase fewer animals on the spot public market thus reducing spot prices paid usda nd other analysts generally believe that other factors notably imbalances in supply and demand are much more significant factors additionally analysts have sa id that contracts provide more stable prices than the spot market giving producers further incentives to enter into contractshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31788crs7 economists explain that production and pro cessing firms become larger in order to capture lower perunit costs when operating at or near full capacity they argue that vertical coordination and use of advance marketing arrangements are reflection of todays agricultural markets which are shifting from the production of few homogenous commodities without particular market in nd to creation of wider variety of specific consistently highqua lity consumer products for specific markets negative impacts of consolidation include potential environmental impacts and several related issues th trend toward fewer but rger operations coupled with greater emphasis on more intensive pr oduction methods and specialization has concentrated more animal waste within some geographic areas according to the environmental protection agency epa other critics have raised socalled quality oflife issues related to the loss of small family style operations on the one hand and the growth of large factory style operations on the other the hog industry especially has been cons olidating rapidly in recent years at the packer level the four largest firms share of hog slaughter reached 56 in 2000 compared with 40 in 1990 in 1997 64 of all hogs were marketed through some form of forward sales arrangement between producers and packers although less than 10 of all hogs involved entire or partial packer ownership according to usdas economic research service ers larger producers 5000 head in recent years have accounted for nearly threefourths of the pig crop compared with just over onefourth in 1994 expanding production is much more complicated and expensive process than in the recent past more so for smaller producers industry analysts say expans ion processes now include securing large scale financing obtaining building and waste management permits from state and local authorities and hiring and training staff in contrast 15 to 20 years ago many smaller producers maintained multiuse buildings for rapid repopulation of hog herd when returns turned favorable necessary construction was accomplished without complicated procedures needed to manage waste family labor typically provided adequate supplies of skilled herdsmen the factors that affect expansion patterns today are likely those that are muting the peaks and valleys of the hog cycle thereby leading to less variable hog prices analysts conclude the poultry industry has been almost entir ely vertically integrated for decades and has had significant vertical integr ation almost from the beginning as commercial industry the pork industry is increasing its vertical integration and becoming more similar to the poultry industry in structure in the cattle sector the four largest beef packers accounted fo r 69 of all cattle slaughtered in 2000 compared with 59 in 1990 however st ructural change generally in the beef industry has not been as dramatic in recen t years as it has been for the hog industry government response

provision to extend gipsa authority to include sw ine production contracts sec 10502 previously gipsa protected broiler farmers who grow under contract and livestock producers who sell directly to packers but did not have authority over livestock producers who grow under contract another pr ovision allows contract produ cers to discuss the contract with family advisors and enforcement agencies even if the contract contains confidentiality clause sec 10503 banning packer owners hip of livestock producers who face fewer marketing opt ions and less competition for their livestock have expressed c oncern about captive supplies5 they believe packers are using captive supplies to manipulate market prices that are more favorable to packers and less favorable to producers that is as packers buy fewer animals on the spot open cash market reported prices l onger accurately reflect the preponderance of prices paid for most livestock they be lieve such producers believe this reduction in price transparency works to their increasing disadvantage relative to packers httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31788crs9 6 for additional information see crs report rs20079 livestock mandatory price reporting and ams mpr site at httpwwwamsusdagovlsgmncsls_mprhtmsome producers have suggested that one remedy to captive supplies and the perceived market manipulation is to ban packer ownership and control of livestock supporters of ban believe it would limit packers per ceived ability to manipulate the market thereby improving farmers prices and access to livestock markets these producers and their supporters are concer ned about the rapid pace of vertical integration in the livestock industry and believe that ban could slow or stop it opponents of ban argue it would reverse many of the production efficiency gains made by the livestock industry in recen t years through closer packerproducer alliances at the least they contend it would create turmoil in the industry because packers and producers would have to undo many relationships built over time in congress in the 107th congress in response to calls from some producers the senatepassed farm b ill s 1731 hr 2646 as ame

cool requirements for fresh meat and other raw agricultural products have attracted much attention in recent years one reason is that they are viewed by some as way to help us producers dealing with low farm pri ces proponents argue that consumers would pay more for domestic products than for imp orts also some perceive that food products from certain countries might pose greater health risks proponents contend that additional labeling requi rements would enable consumers to know the source of retail food offerings and c onsider that information when selecting purchases opponents counter that countryoforigi n labeling bears relation to food safety and would not succeed in raising comm odity prices paid to us producers as proponents hope they argue it would im pose excessive and costly

department cool opponents c ountered that the estimate illustrated the extent of the burden on the agricultural sector suggesting that the estimate might even be too low environmental issues12 in recent decades the continued trend toward fewer but larger operations coupled with greater emphasis on more in tensive production met hods have resulted in more manure and other animal waste constituents within some production areas where these larger livestock facilities are concentrated one issue has been whether all the waste is or can be handled in ways that minimize environmental problems second issue has been what to do when the available land in some areas where herds and flocks are concentrated is insufficient to assimilate all the manure and other waste where the volume of wastes exceeds the lands capacity spreading it on fields or storing it can lead to excessive chemical and nitrogen runoff into surface or subsurface waters and result in fish kills and other problems animal feeding operations afos are facilities where animals are kept and raised in confined situations feed is brought to the animals when large enough these facilities are designated as concentrated animal feeding operations cafos and they become subject to regulatory re quirements promulgated by epa to prevent water pollution cafo generally is fined as having 1000 animal units au threshold that 11200 operations ex ceed according to the most recent census of agriculture published data collected in 199713 however only about 4500 of these operations were covered by permits according to epa epas cafo definition also includes smaller facilities in certain physical settings smaller cafos have either 300 to 999 au or fewer than 300 au epa timated that the number of cafos subject to regulation will continue to grow rapidly and that about 15500 operations will need permits by 2006httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31788crs13 14 for more information on the final rule see wwwepagovnpdescaforule 15 see crs report rl30437 water quality initiatives and agriculture under the federal clean water act ca fos are regulated as point sources in similar manner to industrial sources of pollution and must obtain permits in order to discharge pollutants into us wate rs under rules issued in the mid1970s environmental groups brought suit in re sponse to lack of implementation that culminated in judicial consent decree in 1992 requiring final regulations to be issued by december 15 2002 on december 15 2000 epa under the clinton administration had proposed set of rules epa held eight public meetings across the country to gather public comment on th at proposal the bush administration met the court deadline by signing the fina l rule on december 16 2002 and publishing it in the february 12 2003 federal register 14 under the final rule all cafos must apply for permit by december 2006 from the state agency administering an authorized national pollutant discharge elimination system permit program in 45 states or directly from epa in the other five states epa will be giving states considerable implementation flexibility however it points out that the permitting re quirements will be stricter than under the old rule and that the proposed rule w ill include several ne w controls on waste discharges and land pplications of waste15 all cafos will be required to develop and implement nutrient manage ment plans to carry out best management practices under those plans and to submit annual re ports large cafos will have to keep records for any manure transferred to another party the rule will eliminate three exemptions that excused cafos from permits under the prior rule if they discharged only during large storms if they raised chickens using dry manure handling systems or if they were excluded because they did not need to count immature swine and immature dairy cows for purposes of this program epa estimated that cafos produce bout 220 billion gallons of manure annually epa had predicted during the rulemaking process that the proposal would reduce the volume of nitrogen released into the environment by more than 100 million pounds and phosphorous by more than 56 million pounds in addition over 2 billion pounds of sediment and nearly 1 million p ounds of metals will not be released according to the epa analysis compliance costs to cafo operators were estimated at 335 million annually estimated annual benefits from the rule ranged from 204 million to 355 million farm groups generally were pleased that the final cafo rule was more flexible than earlier proposals but continued to ex press concerns about implementation costs epas press release pointed out that the rule does not include copermitting requirements national grou nd water requirements certif ication by recipients of transferred manure or ma ndatory requirements on when manure may be applied to frozen snowcovered or saturated ground environmental groups argued that gr eater regulation is warranted and complained that the final rules will accomplish far less than the earlier proposals more specifically they expressed concern about the lack of any minimum standards the
