from ben santer santer1llnlgov to phil jones pjonesueaacuk subject re multimodel sst detection results date wed 02 may 2007 081038 0700 replyto santer1llnlgov cc nathan gillett ngillettueaacuk peter gleckler gleckler1llnlgov iharrisueaacuk xflowed dear phil thanks very much for the quick reply it would be nice to get hold of cru ts 30 even at the 05 x 05 degree resolution for the sst detection and attribution analysis that i described yesterday i reduced the spatial dimensionality to get better estimates of covariance matrices eofs etc by regridding all model and observational sst data to common 10 x 10 latlong grid i think it would make sense to do the detection and attribution analysis involving the land 2m temperature changes at the same 10 x 10 resolution so it isnt essential for to get the cru ts 30 data at 5 x 5 resolution we might as well have just one regridding step from 05 x 05 to 10 x 10 rather than two as in the sst case the primary focus would be on land 2m temperature changes over 1950 to 2006 im hopeful that the changing coveragevariance issues wont be that severe over this period let back up little and outline why i want to look at cru ts 30 ive always thought that it would be fun to contrast the sn behavior of sst and land 2m temperature based purely on the amplitude of unforced variability one might expect sn ratios to be more more favorable for sst changes than for land 2m temperature changes but its not that simple due to landocean differences in specific and total heat capacity we expect the ghginduced surface temperature signal to be larger over land than over oceans and then theres the issue of the spatial heterogeneity of the forcings arguably anthropogenic forcings over land are more spatially heterogeneous than over oceans eg changes in land surface properties over oceans such landocean forcing differences must also influence the sn behavior of temperature changes over land and oceans so i suspect based on sn arguments that its better to search for an anthropogenic surface temperature signal over the oceans rather than the land actually showing this might be useful cheers ben phil jones wrote ben cru doesnt have an infilled land database at the 5 by 5 degree resolution we do at the 05 by 05 degree resolution though it would take bit of work to average these together to the coarser resolution but it ought to be possible we have new version of this cru ts 30 that ian harris harry is finishing off it runs from 1900 to 2006 it doesnt take care of variance issues so will have problems when in regions with poor data earlier in the 20th century should be ok though from 1950 if you want to start then harry is iharrisueaacuk i think the temperature is finished but nathan could check im away now till the hc meeting in sweden and spain another option is to use the infilled 5 by 5 dataset that tom smith has put together at ncdc all infilling has the problem that when there is little data it tends to revert to the 196190 average of zero all infilling techniques do this alluded to countless times by kevin trenberth and this is in ch 3 of ar4 this infilling is in the current monitoring version of ncdcs product the infilling is partly the reason they got 2005 so warm by extrapolating across the arctic from the coastal stations i think ncdc and the hc regard the permanent sea ice as land as it effectively is as side issue the disappearance of sea ice in the arctic is going to cause loads of problems monitoring temps there as when sst data have come in from the areas that have been mostly sea ice it is always warm as the 6190 means are close to 18c been talking to nick rayner about this it isnt serious yet but its getting to be problem in the ar4 chapter we had to exclude the sst from the arctic plot as the arctic north of 65n from 1950 was above the 6190 average for most of the years that had enough data to estimate value see you in exeter in weeks time cheers phil at 0140 02052007 ben santer wrote dear nathan im now in the process of transferring sst data from the ar4 preindustrial control runs im hoping that the data transfer will be finished by tomorrow as described in the supporting text of our pnas water vapor paper ive changed the time model of all control runs the time model is the same as in the 20c3m runs ie months since 1800 this slightly complicates life if you want to subtract models instantaneous control run drift from its 20c3m run you then have to figure out the time in the new months since 1800 time model at which the 20c3m run was spawned from the preindustrial control i find however that the advantages of using uniform time model far outweigh the disadvantages with some help from peter i managed to obtain some preliminary results for the detection of an anthropogenic fingerprint in observed sst data to my knowledge most formal patternbased da work that has dealt with temperature changes close to earths surface has used combined ssts and land 2m temperatures im not aware of any patternbased work other than your work with sst changes in the atlantic and pacific tropical cyclogenesis regions that has focused on sst changes alone im assuming that the dearth of sst only fingerprint work arises in part from pesky masking and regridding problems the same problems we had to address in the pnas water vapor paper as i mentioned several days ago i essentially replicated all of the data preprocessing we had done for the water vapor paper ie the same procedures were used for masking and regridding sst data to uniform 10 x 10 latlong grid calculation of the v and nov sst fingerprints and concatenation of sst data from the v and nov control runs i also employed the same spatial domain that we used for the pw analysis all oceans 50n50s one of the choices i have to make in estimating detection time is the selection of start date for calculation of trends in the signal time series zt and zt the projections of the observed data onto the raw and optimized fingerprints respectively for the water vapor paper the start date was dictated by the start date of the ssmi pw data 1988 here however we are using noaa ersst data which are available from 1880 onwards i chose start date in 1950 i think this is defensible choice partly because the spatial coverage of sst data is more stable over time in the second half of the 20th century than in the first furthermore 1950 start date is somewhat conservative choice in view of the flattening of the observed globalscale sst increase in the 1960s and 1970s start date in the mid1970s would probably yield shorter detection times the detection time results are encouraging in the spatial mean included case we invariably obtain robust detection of the v and nov model fingerprints in the noaa ersst data as you pointed out previously nathan the fingerprint estimated from the nov 20c3m runs is basically an anthroonly fingerprint for 1950 start date the detection times are all with 5 years of 1980 irrespective of whether the v or nov models are used to estimate fingerprints optimize fingerprints or assess statistical significance this means that if we had begun monitoring observed sst changes in 1950 we would have been able to identify an anthropogenic fingerprint roughly 30 years later i should point out that as in the vapor paper weve tried to be conservative in our significance testing procedure and have intentionally retained residual control run drift results are more ambiguous in the spatial mean removed case in that setting whether we can or cannot detect an anthropogenic fingerprint is much more sensitive to vnov dataset choices why might that be preliminary hypothesis is that in the mean removed case greater attention is focused on differential sst changes in the western and eastern pacific the recent grl paper by soden and vecchia provides some modelbased evidence that such differential sst changes may be forced and are accompanied by changes in the walker circulation i suspect that these differential westeast sst changes may evolve in complex way over time and that in the mean removed case we might have more luck detecting an anthro fingerprint if go to full spacetime optimal detection but thats only guess on my part and my intuition has often been wrong in the next few days ill fool around with several different start dates and will also start looking at the spatial patterns of the raw and optimized fingerprints the dominant noise modes etc as i mentioned previously it would be nice to contrast the sstonly da results with landonly da results does cru have landonly temperature data in which missing land 2m temperatures have been statistically infilled in other words is there land 2m temperature counterpart to the hadisst product ive copied this email to phil who im sure will be able to answer my last question anyway looks like this work is worth pursuing it will be very interesting to compare your spacetime results with the results weve obtained thus far with best regards ben benjamin d santer program for climate model diagnosis and intercomparison lawrence livermore national
