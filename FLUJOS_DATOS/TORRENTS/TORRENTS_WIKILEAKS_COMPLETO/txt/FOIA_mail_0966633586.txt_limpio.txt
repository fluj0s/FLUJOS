from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to benjamin santer e782144popgunllnlgov subject jgr paper date fri aug 18 171946 2000 ben here few main points about the paper ive ignored minor englishwording things i spotted p4 it seems better to put the other anthro forcings before the natural get discussed top of page ie other heteorogeneous sentence should be before stratospheric aerosols p4 bottom could reference delworth et to illustrate the perfect model argument they reproduced reality 1 out of 5 attempts p5 dont like phenomenology of enso change to enso sequences p6 middle emphasise that withe models you can look at lot longer series p6 bottom whether the model was really perfect michaels would find some problem p7 23rd way down say something about santer et 2000a p9 dont think you need to say you got the soi from cru p10 echam4 has solar but how much does it change by or is it constant p11 end of 2 presumably in combining the sat and sst you used anomalies worthwhile saying p1215 section 3 gets to read like recipe it is important but it might be better as an appendix also i guess the amount of detail depends on success of other submissions i think the section needs reworking bit as the style changes somewhat have you considered whether alpha and tau and tramp can differ by month between the surface and 2lt the lag you use is 7 months the science paper of toms uses 6 months in the later tables i wasnt clear how raw and nofilt relate to each other i guess all the tables need longer captions with more explanation i couldnt figure out what the numbers referred to in the tables p17 i wonder if its possible to show in diagram that the iterative scheme works and youre getting to global rather local minimum p19 the higher ratios get nearer to my 2 but only at the high end p20 the last 4 numbers in table 3 have been multiplied by 01 p23 an interesting aside would be to show in one of the tables how much change in the observations is due to volcanoes ie show how much cooling due to this there has been people will quote this value it shows that natural factors solarvolcanoes have led to cooling as solar effects will be very small over this time p24 emphasise later that models and obs all show 2lt level changes more than surface p24 say something about how good echam4 is for enso or refer to paper p2533 all good stuff but it does take time to read not very helpful comment i know but im being referee p33 does fig 7 use the same data as in fig 5 one shwing things through time the other as distribution p35 pcm crept into the hamburg section so it should be said here when the giss section starts p38 quantify the volcanic cooling i mentioned this earlier p39 not clear what independent components are wrt smith et 2000 p42 surface data has errors too p43 the last sentence of the acknowledgements is like red rag to bull for michaels even the perceptive adjective will not placate him have to go home now i think ive covered most things i noticed have good weekend cheers phil
