from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to neville nicholls nnichollsbomgovau subject re misc date wed jul 6 150745 2005 neville mikes response could do with little work but as you say hes got the tone almost dead on i hope i dont get call from congress im hoping that noone there realizes i have us doe grant and have had this with tom w for the last 25 years ill send on one other email received for interest cheers phil at 1421 06072005 you wrote thanks phil i had seen the estimates of 012c for uah 52 but wasnt sure if the version producing these trends had all the months corrected and that john was happy with the corrections i had heard that his initial estimate was that the change made major difference to the trends but that later calulations didnt support this i think i have pretty good idea now of the trends in the various data sets i have seen the mearswentz paper but will watch out for johns paper i know i could have asked john about all of this but i suspect he feels bit overburdened and harrassed at the moment and i didnt want to add to the pressure on him so thanks for passing this stuff on to i thought mike manns draft response was pretty good i had expected something more vigorous but i think he has got the tone pretty right do you expect to get call from congress neville nicholls bureau of meteorology research centre 9th floor 700 collins street

nicholls subject fwd misc neville heres an email from john with the trend from his latest version in also has trends for ratpac and hadat2 if you can stress in your talks that it is more likely the sondes are wrong at least as group some may be ok individually the tropical ones are the key but it is these that least is know about except for few regions the sondes clearly show too much cooling in the stratosphere when compared to msu4 and i reckon this must also affect their upper troposphere trends as well so john may be putting too much faith in them wrt agreement with uah happy for you to use the figure if you dont pass on to anyone else watch out for science though and the mearswentz paper if it ever comes out also do point out that looking at surface trends from 1998 isnt very clever

lt dataset i believe i had indicated earlier to you that the correction was within our published margin of error in any case here are the numbers that describe various aspects of v52 19792004 global trend 0115 uah 0125 ratpac and 0137 hadat note when subsampled for the same latitudes in which sonde observations are available uah and hadat are almost exactly the same update of site by site comparison of uah lt 52 and sh radiosondes from christy and norris 2004 all 87 sh stations adjustments raobs 0028 uah 0040 74 best sites with adjustments raobs 0030 uah 0054 these sh changes from the original publication were very minor because most stations were outside the tropics where the diurnal error had essentially impact paper by sherwood claims that day minus night is legitimate way to go about looking at sonde problems the real problem though is that day minus night is only an indicator of sonde change it does not determine the change itself most notorious is the philipps mark iii to vaisala rs80 where the night warmed by about 03 c and the day by little bit less which means the day minus night reveals negative shift when in fact both ob times have significant positive shift these sondes form signifciant part of the lks dataset similar results occur for us viz miniart 2 to microart software in 1990 i have many other sone comparisons and all are more consistent with the uah trends more than rss and certainly vg indeed i was curious to see that your name was on vgs latest paper i wish i had time to fill you in on why the addition of the nonlinear terms is red herring both uah and rss have performed the calculations with and without the nonlinear terms with impact on the trends and why the latitudinal difference for calculating the coefficients leads one astray im little nervous now that you may have dog in this fight as we say in alabama while writing up the ipcc i expect my sonde comparisons to be included in the ipcc and i will have further results demonstrating the problems with the day minus night technique within few months ive lots to do now thanks for listening john c john r christy director earth system science center voice 2569617763
