by the manhattan project during world war ii these mate rials were later defined by the atomic energy act of 1954 as special nuclear materials along with other materials that the former atomic energy commission aec determined were capable of releasing energy through nuclear fission reprocessing of irradiated nucl ear fuel to extract special nuclear material generated highly radioactive liquid and

repository the repository is to be constructed and opera ted by the department of energy doe under the nuclear regulatory commissions nrc licensing authority yucca mountain in nevada is the candidate site for the nations first repository the nrc and the environmental protec tion agency epa share regulatory authority for radioactive wast disposal however these regulatory agencies have yet to adopt uniform radiation protection standards for disposal sites the nrcs jurisdiction however does not extend to does management of defenserelated waste at doe facilities other than yucca mountain radioactive waste classification continues to raise issues for policymakers most recently doe policy on managing the residue in highlevel waste storage tanks proved controversial enough that congre ss amended the definition of highlevel waste the disposition of waste with char acteristics left undefined by statute can be decided by an nrc administrative ruling the case for lowactivity waste

m waste byproducts also result from radioisotopes used for scientif ic medical and industr ial purposes waste classification policies have tended to link the processes that generate the waste to uniquely tailored disposal solutions conse quently the origin of the waste rather than its radiologic characteristics often determines its fate congress recently renewed its interest in radioactive waste classification when department of energy doe order rega rding the disposition of highlevel waste storage tank residue was legally challeng ed as result congress amended the statutory definition of highlevel waste to exclude such residue1 the classification of other radioactive wastes continues to remain an aspect of disposal policy the atomic energy act of 1946 pl 79585 defined fissionable materials to include plutonium uranium235 and othe r materials that the atomic energy commission aec determined to be capable of releasing substantial quantities of energy through nuclear fission source material included any uranium thorium or beryllium containing ore essential to producing fi ssionable material and byproduct material remaining after the fissionable mate rials production in the amended atomic energy act of 1954 pl 83703 the term special nuclear material superseded fissionable mate rial and included uranium enriched in isotope 233 material the aec determined to be special nuclear material or any artificially enriched material2 as the exclusive producer the aec originally retained title to all fissionable material for national security reasons in the 1954 amended act congress authorized the aec to license commercial reactors and ease restrictions on private companies using special nuclear material section 183 terms of licenses of the act however kept government title to all special nucl ear material utilized or produced by the licensed facilities in the united states in 1964 the aec was authorized to issue commercial licenses to possess special nuclear material subject to specific licensing conditions pl 88489httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32163crs2 3 rem is the product of the dose measured in units of rad 100 ergsgram multiplied by quality factor q for each type of radiation that is rem rad x q for gamma rays q 1 thus the absorbed dose in rads equals rems for neutrons q 5 and alpha particles q 20 thus an absorbed dose of 1 rad is quivalent to 5 rem and 20 rem respectivelyalthough the atomic energy act referred to transuranic waste material contaminated with elements in atomic number greater than uranium radioactive waste was not defined by

nrc classifies as lowlevel radioactive waste consistent with existing law measurement of radioactivity and hazards of radiation the measurement of radioactivity nd the hazards of radiation are in themselves complex subjects disc ussion of radioactive waste would be incomplete without reference to some basic terms and concepts radioactive elements decay over time the process of radioactive decay transforms an atom to more stable element through the release of radiation alpha particles two protons nd two neutrons charged beta particles positive or negative electrons or gamma rays electromagn etic radiation radioactivity is expressed in units of curies the equivalent of 37 billion 37 x 109 atoms disintegrating per second the ra of radioactive decay is expressed as halflife the time it takes for half the atom s in given amount of radioactive material to disintegrate radioactive elements with shorter halflives therefore decay more quickly the term for the absorption of radiation by living organisms is dose the united states uses the roentgen equivalent man rem as the unit of equivalent dose in humans rem relates the absorbed dose in human tissue to the effective biological damage of the radiation3 not all radiation has the same biological effect even for the same amount of absorbed dose as some forms of radiation ar more efficient than others in transferring their energy to living cells in 1977 the international commissi on on radiation protection icrp concluded that an individua ls mortality risk factor from radiationinduced cancers was about 1 x104 from

background radiati on exclusive of radon icrp qualified the recommendation with data showing that even at continued exposure of 500 millirem the change in agespecific mortality rate is very small less than 45 for females less than 25 for males older than 50 years and even less for males under age 50 the radiation protection standards for nrc activities licensed under 10 cfr part 206 are based on radiation dose limit of 100 millirem excluding contributions from background radiation and medical pro cedures unlike the nrcs dosebased approach to acceptable hazard level the environmental protection agency epa uses riskbased approach that relies on the linear nothres hold model of low level radiation effects in the epa model risk is extrapolated as straight line from the highdose

httpwwwnrcgovreadingrmdoccollectionscfrpart040part040appahtmlthe definition of lowlevel waste in the compact may vary but the compact provides for adjustments and flexibility under its own procedures adequate to allow the compact to handle waste for which the states are responsible66 on the basis of the compacts article vii and the language of hrept 99317 quoted above that accompanied hr 1267 it might be argued that the compacts jurisdiction extends to tenorm when fo r disposal purposes tenorm meets the criteria of class b or c lowlevel radioactive waste thus the compacts authority to dispose of lowlevel radioac tive waste would appear restricted by the energy policy act of 2005 tenorm that pos threat similar to the threat posed by discrete source of radium226 would ar guably be outside the jurisdiction of the compact diffuse source of radium 226 ie tenorm that does not pose similar threat however would appear to remain within the jurisdiction of the compacts article viid provision

the aec first acknowledged the problem of waste disposal in 1955 concerned over the hazard of radioactive waste the aec awarded contract to the national academy of sciences to conduct research on methods to dispose of radioactive waste in geologic media and recommend disposal options within the continental limits of the united states68 the academys suggestion at that time was that disposal in cavities mined out in salt beds or salt domes offered the most practical and immediate solution in the mid1960s the aec conducted engineering tests on disposing spent fuel in salt mine near lyons kansas after developing conceptual repository designs for the mine aec abandoned the lyons proj ect in 1972 due to technical difficulties the aec went on to identify another site in salt deposit and announced plans for retrievable surface storage program as an interim measure until repository could be developed but the pl an was later abandoned69 in the 1970s the energy research and development administration erda and later the department of energy doe began program of screening various geologic media for repository including salt deposits and the federal sites of the hanford reservation and ne vada test site the na tional problem created by accumulating spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste prompted congress to pass the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 nwpa the potential risks to public health and safety required environmentally acceptable waste disposal solutions and the act provided for developing repositories to dis pose of highlevel radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel under the act the department of energy will assume title to any highlevel radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel accepted for disposal in repository constructed under the act 42 usc 10131 in 2002 the president recommended approval of the yucca mountain repository site in nevada in recent district court ruling however epas 10000year safety standard on radiation containment at the s ite was found to

nevada south carolina nd washington hosted disposal sites for commercially generated lowlevel waste the act encouraged the formation of multistate compacts in which one state would host disposal facility for the member states the new facilities were to begin operation in by the end of 1985 when it became clear that the deadline would not be met congress extended the deadline to the end of 1992 in the amended act of 1986 pl 99240 since then new commercial site has been licensed in ut ah and the nevada site has closed much of the lowlevel waste disposed of as class consists of debris rubble and contaminated soil from decommissioning doe and commercial nuclear facilities that contain relatively little radioactivity these decommissioning wastes make up much larger volumes than lowlevel waste generated by operating nuclear facilities the term lowactivity has been used in describing the waste although it lacks regulatory or statutory meaning the nati onal research council in its interim report improving the regulation and management of lowlevel radioactive wastes found that the current system of regulating lowactivity waste lacked overall consistency72 as consequence
