the attacks eidls will httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21061 provide eligible firms with the working capital needed to pay ordinary and necessary operating expenses that they would have been able to pay had the disaster not occurred legislation while the sba has several disaster loan programs available to businesses and individuals that have suffered physical and economic damage as result of the september 11 terrorist attacks congress may decide to modify or expand authority for those programs to respond to the losses resulting from the attacks in the senate s 1499 introduced by senator kerry on october 9 2001 and cited as the american small business emergency relief and recovery act of 2001 would make several significant changes designed to strengthen and expand existing sba loan programs including the agencys principal nondisaster lending and venture capital programs s 1499 addresses three categories of small businesses small businesses directly affected because they are physically located in or near the building or areas attacked or closed for security measures or are located in national airports such firms would be eligible for sba economic injury disaster loansunder more favorable terms than are currently availablesuch as deferring the payments and forgiving the interest on these loans for two years as well as increasing the loan caps and extending the deadline for applying for disaster loans to one year small businesses not physically damaged or destroyed or in the immediate vicinity of the world trade center or the pentagon but directly or indirectly affected because they are suppliers service providers or complementary industries especially the financial hospitality travel and tour industries 7 alan escobar us small business administration email to the author oct 29 2001 crs5 small businesses in need of capital and investment financing procurement assistance or management counseling in the economic aftermath of september 11 such businesses would be eligible for number of sba programs with enhanced incentive features eg waiving the borrowers fee for regular 7a loan for working capital or 504 loan to buy equipment to increase productivity or lower operating costs in the house hr 3230 introduced by representative manzullo and others on november 6 2001 and cited as the american small business emergency relief and recovery act was identical to s 1499 discussed above on november 14 the bill was approved by the house small business committee by voice vote as modified by amendments offered by representative velazquez the legislation would allow the sba to offer grants to small businesses that are in such dire financial straits that they cannot afford to secure loans lower interest rates on sba disaster loans and permit the sba to forgive disaster loans for borrowers suffering the greatest financial hardships also in the house hr 2961 introduced by representative lafalce and others on september 25 2001 and cited as the terrorist disaster relief for small business act httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21061 would allow the administrator of the small business administration to authorize providing loans under the eidl program to firms located in all areas of the united states not just those that have already been declared disaster areas hr 3011 introduced by representative velazquez on october 3 2001 and cited as the small business emergency relief act of 2001 would authorize sbas administrator to make certain changes in the agencys disaster loan programs including the making of loans without regard to the ability of small business concerns to obtain credit elsewhere as well as waiving loan amount limitations and size standards some of the bills provisions were as noted above incorporated into hr 3230 concluding observations the loan authorities proposed in response to the attacks are without precedent and will be costly according to economic analysts sbas disaster loans unlike its 7a guaranteed loans come directly from the treasury further with regard to proposed legislative changes making the 7a business loans available at more favorable terms to borrowers lower interest rates and longer repayment times such program changes could necessitate substantial increases in appropriations for the agency some analysts have stated that the more favorable terms proposed for the 7a program would lead to increased subsidy rates and larger default rates for the program many small firms suffering economic injury resulting from the terrorist attacks are expected to seek sba assistance many small businesses typically purchase businessowner insurance policies that include broad coverage provisions similar to homeowners policy that automatically cover basic losses when business is interrupted however as donald griffin director of business and personal lines with the national association of independent insurers notes business interruption insurance is very complicated and not everyone buys it8 8 donald griffin national association of independent insurers chicago il telephone continued crs6 as noted above some of the legislative proposals are designed to mitigate bankruptcies business closures and layoffs directly related to the attacks they also address the shrinking availability of credit and venture capital to small businesses through traditional lenders and investors condition that has been exacerbated by the attacks many small businesses would welcome the legislative changes these bills contain including the opportunity to borrow money under the sbas 7a program at lower interest rates with the option of deferring the principal payments for one or two years on the other hand on october 10 2001 national federation of independent businesses nfib chief economist william dunkelberg testified that regarding capital markets credit has been widely available and getting cheaper9 he went on to point out that in recent nfib survey only 3 of respondents reported credit availability as their most important business problem it may be argued of course that the legislation is intended target specific group of firms ie those suffering economic distress as direct result of the terrorist attacks not the entire universe of us small business httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21061 8 continued conversation with the author oct 31 2001 9 testimony of william dunkelberg on behalf of
