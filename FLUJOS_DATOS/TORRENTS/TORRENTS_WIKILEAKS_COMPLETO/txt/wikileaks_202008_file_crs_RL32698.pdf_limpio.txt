bills for the four ftas were passed by wide margins running contrary to predictions of some observers that congress was turning protectionist or antitrade all agreements received strong backing from the business community but encountered resistance from organized labor they eventually will eliminate tariffs on almost all traded g oods cover trade in services and provide enhanced protection for

openings and opportunities protection for the us steel industr was prominent concern of the 108th congress in 2003 many members supported the steel industrys efforts to persuade president bush to extend the import rest raint regime he had imposed in 2002 while others supported steelconsuming industries efforts to roll back the import restraints the more globalized us economy contribut ed to rising concerns in congress about whether us companies were increasingly offshoring or relocating service sector jobs to lowwage developing countries as well as to generalized anxiety about job losses associated with chinas growing tr ade prowess and its policy of pegging its currency to the dollar congress also engaged in an intensive debate generated by growing consumer interest in purchasing more affordable prescription drugs from abroad the issue was addressed in elements of three bills introduced in the sena and one bill which passed the house in 2003 number of export policy issues were also the subject of legislative activity in the 108th congress while policies that pr omote exports through financing and efforts to open foreign markets attracted limited amount of legislative

openness of the us market to goods and services produced abroad export policies both increase and restrict the sales and opportunities of specific companies and industries trade policies affect jobs profits and investment deci sions in the united states and abroad in the process some workers and companies gain or lose more than others thereby increasing the political stakes embedded in the

list of congressional traderelate d hearings is provided in appendix b this section illustrates another dimension of congressional interest in trade issues and the numerous committees that play role in oversight it can be noted that congress influe nces trade policy in number of ways beyond the bills that are discussed in this report the most common are through floor statements and letters sent to the administration that urge certain course of action as well as through warnings that specific legislation will be introduced to resolve problems that are not being adequately addressed in negotia tions regulations or executive actions in addition to warnin g the administration congress often sends messages directly to us trading partners some prominent examples of this form of trade policymaking from the 108th congress follow1 group of house republicans led by house speaker hastert urged president bush in january 29 2003 letter to initiate wto dispute settlement case against the eu ropean unions biotechnology moratorium on march 5 2003 senate finance committee chairman charles grassley expressed his dissatisfaction with the administrations decision to delay initiating the wto

overall effects of any of the agreements on the us economy are expected to be minimal each agreement provides us exporters and investors with additional market ope nings and opportunities13 these ftas are also significant because they are the first agreements considered by congress under the fasttrack procedur authorized in the trade act of 2002 other precedents include the fact that the chile fta was the first such agreement with south american country singapor was the first such agreement with an asian country the australian agreement wa s the first fta between the united states and developed country since the usc anada free trade agreement in 1988 and the morocco fta forms part of the adminis trations longterm effort to establish middle east free trade area extant opposition and controversy to the ftas was concentrated mostly on labor and immigration issues in the case of chile and singapore and on agricultural and pharmaceutical trade issues in the case of australia the labor provisions contained in the chile and singapore agreements were criticized by some members mostly house democrats on the grounds that basic worker rights obligations such as freedom of association the right to form unions and bargain collectively and limitations on child labor were not subject to as rigorous dispute settlement process as was provided in the usjordan fta14 while the salience of the treatment of bor rights in the chile and singapore ftas may have been tempered by these c ountries relatively strong labor rights laws and records the issue is likely to be much more divisive in congressional consideration of the uscentral american fta cafta which the administration concluded in december 2003 cafta reportedly is opposed by many more members some of whom sa it does not go far enough in promoting stronger labor laws and enforcement in the region faced also with opposition from sugar and textile interests the bush administration decided not to send implementing legislation to congress this year but battle over the implementation legislation can be expected in the 109th congress15 immigration provisions were also controversial in the chile and singapore ftas

by lenore sekentry of business personnel and professional workers ra ised concerns among many in congress who have jurisdiction over immigration that the ustr negotiated these provisions without any authority or direction from congress the bush administration countered that the temporary entry of professionals falls within tpa objectives regarding the opening of foreig n country markets for us services and investment in particular reduction or elimination of barriers that restrict the operations of service suppliers or the tablishment or operati ons of investments16 agricultural issues were among the most difficult issues in the consideration of the australian fta in the end each si acceded to very sensitive demands of the other in order to bring the negotiations to close this meant that australia acceded to the us objective not to liberalize trad in sugar and to only gradual opening of dairy and beef while the us acceded to australias position on maintaining monopolies for the export of wheat barley and rice17 number of members of congress however were highly critical of the sugar exclusion arguing that the exclusion of any product or industry shoul d not be repeated in future ftas18 trade and the health care policies of foreign trading partners became an issue for the first time in the negotiation of the australian fta during these negotiations the united states complained that the way the australian government subsidizes the costs for pharmaceuticals may disadvantag number of newer innovative drugs produced in the united states the issu exposed fundamental differences between the us and australian healthcare systems and how each treats costs of pharmaceutical products borne by their citizens19 in congressional consideration of the agreement this issue was widely

eu again complained to the wto that the eti benefit was also an export subsidy and the wto again backed the eu charge while the eu indicated it would not impose retaliatory tariffs as long as the congress was making progress on achieving wto compliance it began imposing punitive tariffs on 4 billion of us exports beginning at 5 on march 1 2004 and increasing by 1 percentage point each month

and japanese steel producers in the 1990s subs equently the eu and japan challenged the law in the dsu in 2002 the dsu dete rmined that the law violated us wto obligations because it provided remedies for dumping in excess of the antidumping duties and other price measures that are permitted under the wtos antidumping agreement25 in response to this ruling the confer ence report of the miscellaneous tariff bill included provision that repeals the 1916 antidumping act prospectively the legislation however does not ppear to affect pending cases filed under the law it is thus uncertain whether this form of repeal will end all wto litigation on the statute particularly due to japans continui ng insistence that the repeal end all current court proceedings26 byrd amendment the third high profile compliance case involved the byrd amendment which requires annual disbur sement of antidumpi ng and countervailing duties to petitioners and interested parties instead of to the us treasury in the underlying trade remedy proceedings wto panel in 2002 ruled that the cdsoa violates wto obligations in part because it provides an extra protection to industries already benefitting

repeal of the cdsoa in its fy2004 and fy 2005 budgets and repeal legislation was introduced in 108th congress predominant congressional sentiment appears to be against repeal for example 70 senators

debate on outstanding bilateral trade disputes that are being settled under the aegis of the wto importrelated legislation us policies affecting imports tend to be shaped largely by mixture of economic principles and practical political considerations unanticipated events and broader foreign policy considerations also serve to influence the development of specific policies from year to year28 the case for maintaining relatively open market for the purchase of foreign goods and services rests on the view that imports provide multip economic benefits for consumers imports provide goods that are often available at lower prices or simply not produced in the united states foreign goods also can benefit ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32698crs10 29 crs report rl32059 trade trade

consequences and cures by craig elwellcompanies by providing needed inputs at lower prices and by encouraging cost cutting and innovation29 decisions to deviate from the economic rationale for maintaining relatively open policies towards imports usually rest on practical political considerations although consumers and many producers benefit from having access to imported goods and services some workers can lose their jobs and some companies can go out of business due to rapid increases in imports that compete headtohead with domestic production to address displacem ent international as well as domestic rules have been established to provide temporary relief to those hurt or injured by import competition these rules also stipulate various measures or barriers governments may employ depending in large part on whether the import competition being curbed is considered fair or unfair30 us government policies that affect the relative receptivity or openness of the us market to imports are also affected from year to year by unanticipated events the large and growing us merchandise trade deficit for example may increase demands for protection from import competition as the number of companies and workers hurt by imports increases relative to those helped by exports when the increase in the trade deficit is being account ed for disproportionately by one country much more scrutiny is likely to be give n to that countrys trading practices31 foreign policy objectives can also affect import policies efforts for example to forge closer economic and political ties w ith specific regions or countries can lead to more open or less restrictive policies via the extension of preferential access to the us market congressional actions in 2003 and 2004 refl ected the interaction of these cross cutting pressures in five legislative categories 1 protection of american workers and industry from import competition 2 offs horing or outsourcing of service jobs 3 trade

ex ports and imports of goods and services as percent of gdp has risen from around 9 in the early 1960s to around 24 today more firms communities and workers benefit as well as are hurt by trade because the benefits of trade are diffu sed across the economy and the costs are concentrated and localized groups hurt by trade are often much more concerned and active about the development of us trade policies as result numerous members of congress are often under in tense pressure to respond to demands for protectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32698crs11 32 crs report rl31748 the american steel

offshoring of service jobs new wrinkle brought about by globalization was growing alarm about whether us multinationals were increasingly offshoring or relocating service sector jobs to lowwage countries such as india and china the economic report of the president released by the council of economic advisors in february 2004 set off heated debate by calling offshoring g ood thing for the

to reduction in us output and corres ponding loss of jobs amidst an economic recovery with unusually low job creation we re openly critical of the report some responded by offering amendments that

exports export promotion efforts are touted on the basis of their contribution to job creati on and healthy economy export promotion advocates commonly emphasize the number of jobs associated with the
