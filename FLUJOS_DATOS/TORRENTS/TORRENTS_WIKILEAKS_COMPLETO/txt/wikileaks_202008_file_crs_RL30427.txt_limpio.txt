foreign countries updated july 26 2005 andrew feickert specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division congressional research service the library of congress missile survey ballistic and cruise missiles of selected foreign countries summary this report provides current summary of ballistic and cruise missile activity in selected countries and discusses implications for us national security policy the defense threat reduction agencys weapons of mass destruction terms of reference handbook defines ballistic missile as missile that is guided during powered flight and unguided during free flight when the trajectory that it follows is subject only to the external influences of gravity and atmospheric drag and cruise missile as longrange lowflying guided missile that can be launched from air sea and land ballistic and cruise missile development and proliferation continue to pose threat to us national security interests both at home and abroad approximately 35 countries currently possess operational ballistic missiles of various ranges and approximately 25 countries have operational cruise missiles with range greater than 150 km 90 miles some analysts consider cruise missile proliferation to be of more concern than that of ballistic missile proliferation primarily due to their low threshold of use availability affordability and accuracy this report will be updated annually with the fall of iraq and the voluntary termination of libyas ballistic missile program many view north korean and iranian missile and wmd programs as the primary rogue nation longrange ballistic missile threat to us national security russia and china continue to be the only two countries that could conceivably attack the united states with intercontinental ballistic missiles armed with nuclear weapons but improved relationships with both countries have done great deal to diminish this threat over past decades indias and pakistans ongoing missile development programs are viewed by many as highly aggressive and even provocative but are generally viewed in regional context as opposed to direct threat to the united states the renewal of dialogue between these two countries in an attempt to settle their disputes by diplomatic means may also help in slowing proliferation as well as preventing their potential use in this region the implications of ballistic and cruise missile proliferation to the united states has necessitated both nonproliferation and counterproliferation approaches in trying to stem the development deployment and export of missiles past administrations have been characterized as nonproliferationoriented by some analysts while the current bush administration is viewed by some as having abandoned traditional nonproliferation for more actionoriented approach towards missile proliferation other experts have suggested that the united states must somehow find the right balance between missile nonproliferation and counterproliferation policies if meaningful longterm progress is to be made while some believe that missile proliferation can be rolled back by some combination of these approaches others note that both ballistic and cruise missiles have become such an integral part of many countries national security frameworks that it is highly unlikely that countries will abandon their programs in

missiles by categories of range 7 missile survey ballistic and cruise missiles of selected foreign countries introduction foreign ballistic and cruise missiles pose potential threat to the national security interests of the united states while weapons of mass destruction wmd can be delivered by variety of means including aircraft artillery and asymmetric means it is missiledelivered wmds that garner the most domestic and international attention countries with wmd missile capability have the potential to influence the actions of other countries in their regions or even countries on another continent and in some cases destroy population centers and national infrastructure at the present time the united states is within range of the ballistic missiles of russia china and perhaps north korea as well as france and the united kingdom several other countries have missiles within range of us overseas facilities and interests number of countries are attempting to either procure or develop longerrange ballistic missiles to accurately deliver wmds over great distances and many fear that one day such an attack may be launched against the united states by regional power or rogue state where stringent political and military controls over these weapons are not exercised estimates of the missile threat to the united states continue to be controversial for number of reasons one is that many missile programs have moved underground and can also be hidden in countrys civilian space or aerospace industry making it much harder for intelligence organizations to track development there is also some controversy still surrounding the 1995 national intelligence estimate and 1998s report of the commission to assess the ballistic missile threat to the united states pl 104201 also known as the rumsfeld commission report despite numerous recent developments in missile programs worldwide the rumsfeld commission report continues in 2005 to be the open source benchmark for missile proliferation while there is still disagreement about the extent of the missile threat the bush administrations unwavering commitment to ballistic missile defense has resulted in the deployment of ballistic missile interceptors at ft greely alaska and vandenberg air force base in california1 1 for detailed information on us missile defense see crs report rl31111 missile defense the current debate mar 23 2005 crs2 estimates released by the us intelligence community vary little from those issued in the late 1990s by the rumsfeld committee iran is still assessed as being capable of developing an intercontinental ballistic missile icbm2 capable of reaching the united states by 20153 although in the 1995 national intelligence estimate nie most intelligence agencies believed that this could happen before 2015 the nie also cites north korea as posing an icbm threat to the united states before 2015 likewise north koreas ballistic missile development time lines may need to be reevaluated as new missile programs are apparently underway while not posing direct threat to the united states the proliferation of shorter range ballistic missiles and cruise missiles has resulted in heightened regional tensions in the middle east between india and pakistan and between china and taiwan declining ballistic missile threat some maintain that the longrange ballistic missile threat has decreased significantly since the cold war primarily due to nonproliferation treaties and arrangements4 the most significant reduction they argue are in icbms slbms irbms and mrbms and that even srbms are beginning to decrease as aging inventories are retired5 given these decreases the threat is characterized by some as follows there is widespread capability to launch shortrange missiles there is slowly growing but limited capability to launch medium range missiles decreasing number of longrange missiles from cold war levels that will continue to drop significantly over the next fifteen years possibility that one or two new nations could acquire limited capability to launch longrange missiles over the next two decades 2 ballistic missiles are classified by their range as

center sept 2000 p 15 4 joseph cirincione the declining ballistic missile threat 2005 carnegie endowment for international peace feb 2005 5 ibid p 5 crs3 likelihood of nation attacking the united states or europe with ballistic missile is exceptionally low6 others also note the increase in srbms particularly in the 100 to 200 km range as well an increase in programs that modify existing surfacetosurface unguided rockets with guidance and control sections which adds further lowcost srbm capability7 ballistic missiles are also considered less expensive to maintain than an air force and since technologies can be transferred across to satellite launch vehicles earning hard currency some analysts suggest that these factors will insure the continued proliferation of ballistic missiles8 given this possibility of increased proliferation some conjecture that the ballistic missile and nuclear warhead threat situation is going to become more complex and international in nature with whole regions likely to be involved rather than just individual countries9 missile production and development facilities one significant trend is the increasing number of missile production and development facilities fifteen countries are known to produce ballistic missiles the united states france russia china north korea south korea taiwan india pakistan iran israel egypt syria ukraine and argentina several other countries including germany japan great britain south africa and brazil could produce ballistic missiles but have chosen not to when country has missile production facility its ability to produce large quantities of missiles is limited only by its ability to obtain certain critical materials and components when country acquires large number of missiles and launchers it may be able to launch sustained attacks and to overwhelm missile defense systems production and research facilities also enable these regional powers to enhance the range accuracy destructiveness and missile defense penetration aids of their missiles another important factor is that countries with an indigenous missile production capability also avoid export control restrictions when trying to import missiles and missile technology from outside sources finally once country produces missiles it can consider exporting them as well as the production technology to still more countries for financial political or ideological rewards north korea has been exporting missiles and missile production facilities for number of years and there is concern that more countries will enter the missile market as suppliers russian and chinese organizations have been primary sources of missile technology and in the past western firms also have transferred missile technology 6 ibid p 10 7 janes strategic weapons systems issue 42 jan 2005 p 15 8 ibid 9 ibid pp 1516 crs4 nuclear biological and chemical warheads10 the primary cause for concern with missile proliferation is that missile systems can provide countries an effective vehicle for delivering nuclear chemical or biological weapons over long distances the most worrisome trend is the growing number of countries with both longrange missile and wmd programs india and pakistan have tested mrbms and nuclear explosive devices north korea iran and israel are suspected to have nuclear chemical and biological weapons programs as well as variety of short and medium range missiles over the last several years nuclear weapons programs have declined in number south africa reportedly dismantled the nuclear weapons and missiles that it had developed argentina brazil south korea and taiwan also abandoned earlier nuclear weapon programs belarus kazakhstan and ukraine transferred to russia the nuclear weapons they inherited from the soviet union recent revelations about the possibility of north koreas development of nuclear weapons and irans revitalized nuclear program could reverse this favorable trend11 several other countries that have missiles also have chemical weapons and some have chemical warheads for their missiles bulk filled chemical warheads for shorterrange ballistic missiles are considered relatively easy to develop while chemical submunitions are considered somewhat more challenging biological warheads are considered fairly difficult to develop because of the difficulties associated with working with biological agents in terms of their sensitivity to environmental conditions during missile flight and upon dispersalit has been reported that during the 1991 gulf war iraq had missile warheads filled with variety of nerve agents and others with botulinum toxin and anthrax china egypt india iran israel north korea pakistan russia saudi arabia serbia south korea syria taiwan and vietnam all have missiles and reportedly have chemical weapons several countries reportedly have biological weapons programs including china egypt iran israel north korea pakistan and russia12 ballistic missiles armed with conventional highexplosive warheads proved to be important weapons of terror when used against cities in the iraniraq war and the 1991 gulf war the development of advanced conventional warheads such as cluster bombs and fuelair explosives and enhanced missile reliability and accuracy will increase the military effectiveness of missiles armed with conventional warheads the united states has demonstrated the military effectiveness of cruise 10 see also crs report rl30699 nuclear biological and chemical weapons and missiles status and trends 11 see also crs report rs21391 north koreas

state of proliferation out of print available from author at 77673 crs5 missiles in several conflicts and new generation of stealthy more capable cruise missiles is presently in development in number of countries13 the demand for missiles and wmd as missiles and missile production technology have become widely available the demand for longerrange missiles and nuclear biological and chemical warheads has increased because of their relatively low cost ability to penetrate defenses strike deep into an enemys homeland and to deliver nuclear or biological weapons that could threaten the survival of an enemy country missiles have become delivery system of choice and symbol of national might for some countries the technological and military prowess of the united states was demonstrated for the world during the 1991 gulf war and again in afghanistan and operation iraqi freedom oif as result adversarial countries and nonstate groups may be more likely to avoid direct conventional military confrontation with the united states some potential adversaries such as iran and north korea continue to develop missiles and wmd as means to counter us military strength in their region and to intimidate or deter their neighbors at the same time several allies and neutral countries are also building missiles and developing wmd to promote their perceived national security interests any stigma associated with the possession or use of missiles was significantly reduced by the iraniraq war the afghan war the gulf war chinese intimidation of taiwan russian use in its chechen conflicts and by us use of cruise missiles in iraq bosnia afghanistan and sudan in regional wars missile attacks and artillery fire on civilian population centers have become standard form of combat as the use of standoff weapons usually cruise missiles or airtosurface guided weapons against hostile military units intelligence centers terrorist camps and wmd facilities has become commonlyaccepted us military practice status of missile proliferation about three dozen countries have been publicly identified as having ballistic missiles and half of those countries are in asia and the middle east see table 1 about 30 of these countries have or are developing ballistic missiles that can deliver 500kilogram warhead 300 kilometers or further14 of the noneuropean countries fourteen have produced

missiles that can deliver 500 kg warhead 300 kilometers and related technology components and material relatively crude early generation nuclear warhead is estimated to weigh about 500 kg countries other than the united states that are currently reported to have missiles that meet the mtcr thresholds are afghanistan algeria armenia belarus bulgaria china egypt france iran israel north korea

indigenous missiles with range of 300 km or more crs6 israel north korea pakistan south korea syria taiwan ukraine and south africa which longer produces missiles in addition to these regional powers which are often discussed as missile proliferators several western and eastern european countries and republics of the former soviet union have missiles international pressures and domestic policy decisions have eliminated certain missile programs in brazil egypt south africa poland hungary and former soviet republics while the longstanding missile technology control regime mtcr is credited with slowing missile proliferation it is not known what effect if any the international code of conduct against ballistic missile proliferation icoc will have on proliferators15 mtcr the united states canada france germany italy japan and the united kingdom established the missile technology control regime mtcr on april 16 1987 the mtcr was designed to slow the proliferation of ballistic and cruise missiles rockets and unmanned air vehicles uav capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction it is an informal arrangement not treaty consisting of guidelines for transfers of missiles and related technology and an annex listing items to be controlled the regime is based on the premise that foreign acquisition or development of delivery systems can be delayed and made more difficult and expensive if major producers restrict exports the mtcr has independent means to monitor or enforce its guidelines nations adopt the guidelines as national policy and are responsible for restraining their own missilerelated transfers icoc on november 25 2002 icoc was inaugurated at the hague the netherlands the icoc like the mtcr is not treaty but instead set of fundamental behavioral norms and framework for cooperation to address missile proliferation the icoc focuses on addressing the demand side of proliferation and is viewed as complementing the supply side oriented mtcr it seeks to achieve transparency by using confidence building measures such as information transfer on ballistic missile programs it also calls for prelaunch notification of ballistic missile flight tests unlike the mtcr the icoc intends to establish formal standing organization to collect information and oversee the development of its confidence building measures and information control mechanisms 15 see

and the number of icbm nuclear warheads will be cut from 1770 to 92317 at the end of 2004 russia reportedly made number of claims about impending deployments in 2005 of new generations of russian

maneuverable reentry vehicle possibly including countermeasures which russia claims negates us missile defenses19 the silobased version of the topolm is currently operational with four regiments each regiment has 10 launchers and fifth regiment of silobased missiles is due to be commissioned in 200520 the production of the mobile version is scheduled to begin in 2005 with between three to nine systems scheduled to enter service in 2006 and similar number of systems being developed annually in the following years21 press reports that russia will develop new heavy icbm successor to the topolm are viewed by many as unlikely to be true given russias limited defense budget budget that supposedly was responsible for slowing topolm production to only four missiles in 200522 bulava ssn30 the bulava is submarinelaunched ballistic missile slbm that has been in design since 198623 this 10 warhead missile is intended to be used with the new boreyclass nuclear powered ballistic missile submarine the first of which is scheduled for launch in 200624 the bulava is also believed to have maneuverable warhead and relatively short burn time which is intended to make it less susceptible to

3000 and 3500 km an accuracy of between 5 to 10 meters and 400 kg conventional warhead capacity31 these missiles designed to be carried on russian longrange strategic bomber aircraft are described by russian press as weapon for use in local conflicts and counterterrorist operations32 number of unarmed kh55 cruise missiles left in the ukraine after the withdrawal of russian forces were reportedly illicitly transferred to iran and china33 according to ukranian government officials 12 missiles were supplied to iran and six missiles to china in 2001 some western analysts believe that more missiles could have been supplied than the 18 acknowledged by the ukranian government and that north korea might have also received missiles some are concerned that these kh55s could be modified into precision guided kh555s and that they could be modified to be fired from smaller aircraft such as su24s which would increase the utility of the missile among nations that do not have large long range bomber aircraft china chinese military modernization has been called threat to the united states which could conceivably alter the regional balance of power in the pacific34 as part of this overall

pressure and trade sanctions north korea is continuing to increase diversify and improve its missile fleet in conjunction north korea publically declared itself nuclear power in 2003 and many analysts believe that its nuclear program is focused on developing nuclear warheads for both short medium and longerrange ballistic missiles north korea is also widely believed to have either acquired or developed chemical and possibly biological warheads for its ballistic missiles north korea has allegedly exported ballistic missiles and associated technologies to number of countries and some analysts suggest that these transfers have advanced the recipients missile programs by many years finally north korea has conducted number of missile test firings during and between negotiations which many analysts feel were intended to influence the united states and countries in the region north koreas march 2005 announcement that it was longer observing selfimposed moratorium on longrange

government officials referred to the allegedly longerrange version of the taepo dong as taepo dong x67 according to us intelligence officials the taepo dong x is believed to be based on the former soviet navy ssn6 submarine launched ballistic missile that north korea may have possibly obtained from russia between 1992 and 199868 an unnamed congressional source reportedly noted that the russian pacific fleet which deployed the ssn6 was desperately disorganized and underfunded during the period between 1992 and 1998 suggesting that north korea might have obtained ss n6 technology from the russian navy or the missiles designer the makeyev design bureau without the knowledge or approval of the russian government the south korean press reported on september 8 2003 that south korean intelligence officials had identified what they believed were 10 new intermediate range ballistic missiles and five launch pads at north koreas mirim aerodrome69 south korean officials also suggested that this new missile had been under development since the early 1990s and could have maximum range of 3600 kms70 according to the report japanese south korean and us intelligence officials inferred from the shape of the missile that the new north korean missiles were based on the sovietdesigned ssn671 according to one us press report unnamed us officials confirmed the accuracy of south korean press reports and further elaborated by stating that the unnamed intermediate range ballistic missile was road mobile72 making these missiles more difficult to locate and destroy with the capability to accommodate reentry vehicle weighing approximately 1500 lbs 680 kgs73 north korean missile derived from the ssn6 could conceivably accommodate heavier and less sophisticated nuclear weapon the type which many experts believe north korea is capable of producing while there appears to be some disagreement in the ranges for the ssn6 and the possible north korean ssn6 variant 3000 to 3600 kilometers depending on the source missile with 2500 kilometer range would enable north korea to strike us military forces in japan and okinawa and with 3500 kilometer range to strike guam us territory with

assessments while specifics on north koreas missile development programs continue to be vague statements by us military officials in early 2005 suggest that north koreas missile programs continue to evolve us army general leon laporte commander of us forces in korea reportedly stated in march 2005 that the regimes continued development of threestage variant of the taepo dong missile which could be operational within the next decade could also provide north korea with the capability to directly target the united states75 general laporte also expressed his concerns over north koreas medium and intermediate range missiles and their potential to strike okinawa guam and possibly alaska76 in open testimony before the senate armed services committee on april 28 2005 vice admiral lowell jacoby director dia stated in response to questions on north korean missile capabilities that north korea had the capability to arm missile with nuclear device and that twostage nuclear missile which could reach portions of the united states was also within north korean capabilities77 admiral jacoby qualified these controversial statements during the hearing saying that without flight testing these attributed capabilities were theoretical in nature78 these statements suggesting that north korea had achieved nuclear missile capability resulted in great deal of controversy reportedly stunning senators at the hearing and eliciting response from the pentagon later that day suggesting that admiral jacoby had overstated north koreas nuclear missile capabilities79 while most experts agree that north koreas ballistic missile program is progressing others suggest that the north korean missile program suffers from number of significant problems peter hayes the director of the nautilus institute for security and sustainability in berkeley california who specializes in north korean nuclear and energy issues notes that north korean missiles are unreliable80 in terms of reliability he suggests that the combined probability that north korean missile would both take off and then stage as intended was around 49 percent and that any hostile north korean launch guaranteed an almost 100

that each new missile type becomes new type of unknown operating characteristic suggesting that north korean missile attack might look like an uncontrolled fireworks display82 although there are variety of assessments as to the state and viability of north koreas longrange missile program some suggest that these missiles serve another purpose the londonbased international institute for strategic studies iiss offers the possibility that north koreas longer range missiles are designed more for bargaining leverage and trading for political and economic benefits than for military use in sense both are probably true by developing greater missile capabilities north korea can drive up the price for agreeing to restrain or abandon parts of its missile programme and at the same time be in stronger position to test and deploy such systems if negotiations fail83 missile proliferation north korea has been called the worlds most prolific exporter of ballistic missiles and related equipment materials and technology84 over the past 20 years north korea is credited with having sold several hundred scuds and nodong missiles components related technologies and production facilities primarily to middle eastern countries such as egypt iran syria libya pakistan yemen and the united arab emirates these missile sales possibly amounting to several hundred million dollars constituted significant portion of north koreas hard currency earnings over the years and likely were also exchanged with iran for oil and with pakistan for nuclear technology there is speculation however that revenues from missile sales have been declining in recent years as some of north koreas traditional customers iran for example have developed an indigenous missile production capability and others such as yemen egypt pakistan and the united arab emirates have been pressured by washington to end their missilerelated dealings with north korea resumption of ballistic missile test flights on march 3 2005 north

concerned that iran may develop nucleararmed ballistic missiles that can not only strike targets throughout the middle east israel in particular but also parts of europe and beyond89 irans space program on january 5 2004 irans defense minister reportedly announced that iran would launch satellite within the next 18 months90 although this deadline has passed without launch some us intelligence analysts remain concerned that such launch likely involving modified shahab3 missile would not only elevate irans stature but also serve as trojan horse to help iran develop both range and warhead improvements to the already upgraded shahab3 under the cover of civilian space program91 this upgraded shabab3 which was flight tested three to four times between july and october 2004 reportedly has number of modifications that suggest that this missile is being modified to accommodate nuclear warhead92 the upgraded shahab3 with more bulbous nose and up to 15 more propellant capacity suggests reentry vehicle similar to the russian ss9 icbm93 experts also maintain that this new configuration could facilitate additional modification for the addition of small solid propellant upper stage and satellite payload94 this shahab version could therefore become dual use missile thereby making it more difficult for intelligence analysts to separate ballistic missile development activities from space launch ones nuclear warhead development iran is reportedly also developing missile reentry vehicle containing small nuclear warhead for use in its shahab missiles95 us officials commenting after former secretary of state colin powells november 17 2004 disclosure that iran was developing nuclear warheads for its missiles stated that the warhead is based on an indigenous iranian design and includes the physics package the nuclear weapons components designed to fit inside of the reentry vehicle96 the anonymous us officials stated the information on iranian warhead development came from

into the upgraded shahab3 which is currently based on liquidfuel technology100 if these claims are true this could represent significant breakthrough for irans ballistic missile program solid propellantbased missiles unlike liquid propellant ones can be kept in storage for years require less maintenance and are generally more reliable and accurate in addition solid propellant capability is generally considered pre requisite for developing longer range missiles the maximum range for single stage missile is approximately 2000 kms and in order to achieve greater ranges two or three stage missile is required the inflight separation and ignition of these additional stages are considered very complex scientific and engineering processes and in order to maintain the accuracy of the missile it needs to be using solid fuel101 shahab 45 there has been great deal of speculation surrounding upgraded versions of the shahab 3 the socalled shahab45 on october 3 2002 iranian brigadier general ahmad vahid the chairman of the iranian aerospace industries organization told journalists that iran had plans to develop longrange missiles in order to strike the united states since the us is not one of irans strategic defense targets and instead had oriented its ballistic missile development against its principal regional adversary israel102 some believe that this statement suggests that iran will not pursue specific shahab45 programs as the upgrdaed shahab3 is capable of striking israel and regional targets one expert postulates that irans previously discussed improved shahab3 might in fact be irans way of developing more capable longer range shahab missiles without hanging politically contentious shahab4 or 5 labels on such programs103 97 ibid 98 tyler marshall and sonni

these strategic weapons to deter china many analysts believe that they are destabilizing factor in south asia india also obtained the lease of russian submarine capable of carrying nuclearcapable cruise missiles with 300 km range in december 2002107 this capability will likely not only further destabilize the region but will also greatly enhance the survivability of indias nuclear weapons by

indigenously and that publically severing ties with north korea might lessen us pressure regarding pakistaninorth korean cooperation having publically proclaimed the end to this relationship pakistan would assume considerable risk if they reinitiated missilerelated dealings with north korea cruise missiles123 according to the latest published unclassified assessment from the dods national air and space intelligence center proliferation of land attack cruise missiles will expand in the next decade at least nine countries will be involved in producing these weapons the majority of new lacms will be very accurate conventionally armed and available for export the high accuracy of many lacms will allow them to inflict serious damage on important targets even when the missiles are armed only with conventional warheads us defense systems could be severely stressed by lowflying stealthy cruise missiles that can simultaneously attack target from several directions124 us vulnerability to cruise missile attack was highlighted during the 2003 iraq war during the conflict us and kuwaiti patriot theater missile defense batteries intercepted and destroyed all nine iraqi ballistic missiles launched against the coalition but failed to detect or intercept the five hy2cssc3 seersucker cruise missiles launched against kuwait125 all the more troubling was the fact that the hy 2cssc3 missiles were developed in the 1970s and are considered large and slow compared to more modern cruise missiles this demonstrated vulnerability could further the attractiveness of cruise missiles to countries looking for means to strike us targets 121 musharraf says n korea links over bbc news nov 7 2003 122 ibid 123 for additional information see crs report rs21252 cruise missile proliferation 124

missiles as well as number of other antiship and air ground submarine and shiplaunched cruise missiles china is also reportedly developing ramjet powered127 cruise missile ff1 and yj91 and has sold yj1 and yj2 missiles to iran where these missiles are now being indigenously produced under license to the chinese government it is not unreasonable to assume that china will export more cruise missiles in the future and that more countries will in turn begin building cruise missiles under license with some eventually achieving selfsufficiency in cruise missile production india has reportedly purchased the russian ssn27 cruise missile for land ship and submarine use in addition to its joint brahmos program there have also been reports that taiwan has tested ramjet powered hsiungfeng 3 cruise missile and that israel is developing nuclear armed cruise missile reports which the israeli government denies france germany sweden italy south africa and the united kingdom all have either individual or cooperative land attack cruise missile programs ongoing and like the chinese some of these advanced missiles could be exported to other countries further complicating the security environment implications based on reported program progress it is reasonable to conclude that the development and acquisition of ballistic and cruise missiles continues to remain central security goal for number of countries of concern to the united states while shorterrange ballistic missiles are of concern particularly in terms of their use on the battlefield number of combat proven and developmental ballistic missile defense systems such as the us patriot and the israeli arrow provide means to counter these systems china country that has had longrange ballistic missiles and nuclear warheads for number of decades appears to be modernizing and upgrading its capability not necessarily to directly rival or surpass the united states but as some suggest as means to obtain even greater strategic freedom of action some speculate that iran and north korea countries with significant us military presence near their borders are attempting to achieve basic nuclear missile capability in order to deter us military action some believe that these countries in various stages of nuclear missile development can be deterred from further progress either through diplomacy or some form of coercion others say that short of physical destruction of their programs countries like north korea and iran will eventually achieve the capability to deliver nuclear weapons to various ranges with ballistic missiles cruise missile programs are far more widespread than ballistic missile programs largely due to their relative affordability and the dual use nature of their technology while cruise missiles may not be able to deliver significant payloads over great distances their stealth and accuracy afford their possessors potential asymmetric advantage 126 information in this paragraph is taken from janes strategic weapons systems issue 42 jan 2005 p 16 127 ramjet engines provide increased speed and performance over the more commonly used turbojet cruise missile engines and are generally lower volume and weight than turbojets but ramjet engines are not considered particularly fuel efficient crs26 in order to address the implications of progressively improving and diversified ballistic and cruise missile threats the united states has relied on nonproliferation and counterproliferation activities in various combinations and in varied degrees of application some analysts contend that past administrations relied too heavily on nonproliferation activities which are considerably less expensive and controversial than many counterproliferation programs and blame this imbalance for the current state of missile proliferation the current bush administration is accused by other experts as being too heavily skewed in the direction of counterproliferation as witnessed by the national missile defense program and the proliferation security initiative but still other experts note that much of the emphasis on counterproliferation is an inevitable result of the events of september 11 2001 us counter and nonproliferation policy128 the national security strategy of the united states of america published in september 2002 calls for proactive counterproliferation efforts and strengthened nonproliferation efforts against terrorist and hostile states129 while missiles are not singled out in the strategy they are implicitly part of the administrations definition of wmd the december 2002 national strategy to combat weapons of mass destruction goes into far greater detail on how the threat of wmds and missiles will be dealt with130 this strategy explicitly states that the united states our friends and allies and the broader international community must undertake every effort to prevent states and terrorists from acquiring wmd and missiles the primary means by which this goal is to be achieved is through counterproliferation and nonproliferation activities the strategy states that effective interdiction is critical part of the us strategy to combat wmd and their delivery means another approach is the widely publicized concept of preemption while preemption has been an underlying assumption in previous national security strategies it has assumed prominent role in the current strategy some have called for preempting wmd and missile programs in north korea and iran but the use of eliminating iraqs wmds as the basis for going to war in iraq in 2003 and the subsequent revelation that iraq had previously eliminated these programs has likely eliminated preemption from further practical consideration in the area of nonproliferation the strategy calls for the strengthening of the missile technology control regime mtcr including the support for universal adherence to the international code of conduct against ballistic missile proliferation also part of this strategy is the implementation of bilateral and multilateral agreements to stop the spread of missile proliferation the proliferation security initiative psi announced by president bush on may 31 2003 is an international initiative which focuses on the interdiction of 128 see also crs report rl31559 proliferation control regimes background and status 129 national security strategy of the united states of america sept 2002 p 14 130 national strategy to combat weapons of mass destruction dec 2002 crs27 shipment of wmd and associated delivery systems and technology131 more than 60 countries currently support the psi and while details surrounding its implementation are few largely attributed to intelligence and security considerations us secretary of state rice noted that the psi was responsible for stopping 11 wmd related transfers since 2004 although it is unclear how many of these transfers were missilerelated on june 29 2005 president bush issued an unclassified executive order titled blocking property of weapons of mass destruction proliferators and their supporters132 intended to freeze assets of individuals or companies in the united states that are doing business with entities in iran north korea an syria suspected to be involved in wmd proliferation the executive order annex contains the name of eight companies and freezes their us assets and prohibits us citizens or companies from conducting business transactions with them while there appears to be little emphasis placed on the mtcr and code of conduct by the administration the psi and moves to freeze assets of companies involved in wmd proliferation suggest that the administration is embarking on more aggressive form of nonproliferation while some may consider these moves confrontational and in the case of the psi somewhat questionable from legal perspective others suggest that traditional treaties and agreements which generally are not subscribed to by nations of concern have done little to deter more aggressive countries such as north korea and iran from advancing their missile programs 131 for additional
