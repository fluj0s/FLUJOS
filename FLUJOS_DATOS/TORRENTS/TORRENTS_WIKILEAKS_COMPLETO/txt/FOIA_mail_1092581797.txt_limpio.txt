programme date sun aug 15 105637 2004 cc pjonesueaacuk susan thanks for the comments cheers phil at 1551 13082004 0600 susan solomon wrote dear phil dear kevin thanks for your message its very good to hear that you are getting together and will have time to talk about this i will make few points and suggestions below for your consideration safe travels susan martin susan et kevin and i will be at gcos meeting monweds next week in geneva so will have some time to discuss our chapter ive sent kevin some thoughts about boundaries between chapters if you can provide your views on few issues then it will help us in our discussions 1 we have extended outlines which clarify some issues but how rigid are they i say this wrt the overviewsvisions you expect on the monday pm of the trieste meeting the extended outlines show you what the thought process was at marrakech and potsdam that led to the present outlines its your report and you may wish to do things differently where that may involve other chapters such work would need to be coordinateddecided jointly but most things are not like that 2 in chapter 3 we have section 39 on synthesisconsistency amongst obs does this involve obs such as glacier retreat and changes in sea ice snow cover from chapters 46 chapters 46 dont have similar sections we had some discussions on that in potsdam in particular if i recall dividing up the observations into three chapters solves some problems and raises others and this is one of them my own thinking has been that issues such as the consistency of glacier retreat with observations may be better handled in the ice chapter which presumably will be going into bit more depth on processes affecting glaciers from the ice physics point of view providing bit deeper basis for the assessment the consistency of observations between the three observations chapters could then be dealt with in the technical summary drawing on the findings from all three but it is probably going to be helpful if we have discussion on this among the three chapters and come to common view 3 chapter 1 has section on new data and data rescue i guess we should be involved in that but also ch 9 on attribution as it has to be worthwhile also the new data and rescued data could be useful for model validation i expect ch 3 to heavily use reanalysis based results yes we expected there would need to be discussion on that it may involve subset of people who should be urged to get together as needed 4 chapter 3 has sst and all the circulation indices so here we need to liaise with ch 5 and 6 and eventually with 9 yes agreed and kevin and others tried to work that into the outline in potsdam 5 i agree with kevin though on whether formal meetings of the whole of the chapters are needed might this be better done with the clas and you there will be lot to do in trieste and we want to make efficient use of peoples time it is probably true that not all the people need to be involved when the points youve made so far are discussed the morning 1hour sessions with all clas are also intended to be forum where some of these kinds of issues the broader ones could be handled 6 considering all the above i reckon we need to meet with ch 4 and 6 on glacier retreat snow sea ice and temperature chapters 6 and 9 on what they expect from us and similarly with chapter 5 although i feel this is clear in the extended outline finally chapters 1 3 and 6 and maybe 9 need to discuss data rescue and new techniques that sounds right to i would add your number 7 below into that mix as well its really up to you to decide how you want to handle it but prompted by your message the one from kevin below and some others i think it will be helpful for us to compile list of all such issues raised so i am asking the tsu to do that combining with another set that we received in the comments from governments they actually raised number of such comments quite rightly 7 the appendices in chapters 35 need some sort of coordination bests susan at 1131 11082004 0600 kevin trenberth wrote martin susan et in thinking more about chapter 3 i believe we will have issues on who and what is covered on 1 enso related stuff chapter 3 vs chapter 5 2 consistency of retreat of glaciers snow and ice vs temperatures chapter 3 vs chapter 4 there are probably others but these may require some negotiation unless it is already settled in your mind whether formal meeting between chapters is needed or whether the clas can meet and agree is not yet clear to kevin ipccwg1 wrote dear wgi clas and bureau members please find
