what it perceived were shortcomings in the appointment process during presidential transitions the report asserted that delays in filling top executive branch leadership positions such as those experienced during the 20002001 transition could compromise national security policymaking in the early months of new administration although the unique circumstances of the 2000 presidential race truncated the ensuing transition period the commissions observations could be applied to other recent transitions lengthy appointment processes during presidential transitions particularly between those of different political parties have been of concern to observers for more than 20 years the process is likely to develop bottleneck during this time even under the best of circumstances due to the large number of candidates who must be selected vetted and in the case of positions filled through appointment by the president with the advice and consent of the senate pas positions considered by that body the advice and consent appointment process has three stages selection and vetting senate consideration and presidential appointment congress has taken steps to accelerate appointments during presidential transitions in recent decades senate committees have provided for prenomination consideration of cabinetlevel nominatio ns examples of such actions are provided in this report in addition recently adopted statutory provisions appear designed to facilitate faster processing of appointments during presidential transitions among the new statutory provisions were those enacted by congress in response to 911 commission recommendations mainly in the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 also part of this act was sense of the senate resolution stating that nominations to national security positions should be submitted by the presidentelect to the senate by inauguration day and that senate consideration of all such nominations should be completed within 30 days of submission the president has certain powersconstitutional recess appointment authority and statutory authority under the federal vacancies reform act of 1998that he could under certain circumstances use to unilaterally fill pas positions on temporary basis the final portion of the report provides comprehensive data and analyses related to the length of time taken during recent partyturnover transitions to fill cabinetlevel positions and selected higherlevel subcabinet positions in general transitionperiod cabinetlevel nominees were selected vetted considered and confirmed expeditiously they generally took office shortly after the new presidents inauguration on average the interval between election day and final disposition of nominations to selected subcabinet pos itions was more than twice as long as that of nominations to cabinetlevel positions though nominees to subcabinet positions in some departments were faster than others the prenomi nation portion of this period was notably longer than the period of senate consideration the senate confirmed more than half of the selected subcabinet nominations 23 days or fewer after the nomination was submitted

report the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states known as the 911 commission identified what it perceived were shortcomings in the appointment process during presidential transitions that could compromise national security policymaking in the early months of new admi nistration the commission noted in particular the abbreviated transition period resulting from the delayed resolution of the 2000 presidential race as the report stated given that presidential election in the united states brings wholesale change in personnel this loss of time hampered the new administration in identifying recruiting clearing and obtaining senate confirmation of key appointees 1 the commission reported among other findings that the new george w bush administration did not have its deputy cabinet officers in place until the spring of 2001 and the critical subcabinet officials were not confirmed until the summerif then in other words the new administrationlike others before itdid not have its team on the job until at least six months after it took office 2 although the unique circumstances of the 2000 presidential race truncated the ensuing transition period the commissions observations could be applied to other recent transitions the length of presidential transitions particularly between those of different political parties has been of concern to observers for more than 20 years 3 the appointment process is likely to develop bottleneck during this time even under the best of circumstances due to the large number of candidates who must be selected vetted and in the case of positions filled through appointment by the president with the advice and consent of the senate pas positions considered by that body by the end of the first 100 days of the reagan presidency nominees had been confirmed for only 20 of vacant pas positions at the same juncture at the outset of the clinton administration nominees had been confirmed for only 10 of these openings at the end of the first 100 days of the presidency of george w bush nominees had been confirmed for only 6 of pas vacancies 4 delays in installing new leadership would not be welcome at any time but they may be particularly problematic during the transition period between presidents as noted by the 911 commission new president is likely to need his or her top advisers in place to maintain continuity in national security policymaking5 furthermore the president has limited time following his or her election to initiate an administrative and legislative agenda as the 911 commission pointed out presidential transitions involve largescale changes in the political leadership of the executive branch table 1 summarizes office of personnel management opm data indicating that more than 2500 political appointees occupied positions in the 15 departments as of september 1 2008 these officials included toplevel policymaking presidential appointees political managers and confidential support

the federal bureau of investigation fbi internal revenue service irs office of government ethics oge and an ethics official for the agency to which the president wishes to appoint the candidate once the office of the counsel has cleared the candidate the nomination is ready to be submitted to the senate candidates for higherlevel positions such as cabinet secretaries are often accorded priority

an incoming president can of course begin the process of selecting the members of his administration at any time during recent decades most major candidates have begun preparing for potential presidency before election day by assigning small number of advisors to begin developing transition plans7 with regard to the selection of personnel the 2008 candidates and their transition advisors were aided by recently enacted statute the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 known as the intelligence reform act8 included provision that directs the office of personnel management opm to transmit an electronic record on presidentially appointed positions with specified contents to each major party presidential candidate not later than 15 days after his or her

is at the discretion of the committee chair senate or committee rule requires that committee or the full senate act on any nomination13 most nominations however proceed through the process in routine timely fashion during the last presidential transition in the 107th congress the senate took median14 of 36 days to confirm nomination to fulltime departmental position15 the senate confirmation process begins at the committee level the rules and procedures of the committees frequently include timetables specifying minimum periods between steps in the process committee activity on nominations generally includes investigation hearing and reporting stages during the investigation phase many committees require nominees to fill out questionnaires that the committee has prepared if the committee acts on nomination the process typically begins with hearing where the nominee and other interested parties may testify and senators may question the nominee 16 after the hearingif there is onethe committee usually votes to report the nomination to the senate the committee may choose to report the nomination favorably unfavorably or without recommendation the full senate may then take up the nomination and vote on it confirmation of nomination by the senate requires simple majority if there is opposition to the nomination however 10 pl 108458 7601c 118 stat 3857 11 pl 108458 7601a 118

filibuster if nomination is subject to filibuster it can take 60 votes to bring an end to senate consideration of the nomination that is invoke cloture and get to final vote senators may also place holds on nominations to prevent them from being considered or for other reasons hold is an informal senate practice in which senator requests that his or her party leader delay floor action on particular matter in this case nomination it is up to the senate majority leader whether to honor the request of the senator wishing the hold or to try to bring the nomination to vote hold will not necessarily have the effect of killing nomination but it could signal that the senate may not be able to consider the nomination without considerable delay and the need for supermajority vote to invoke cloture 17 although the senate confirms most nominations some are not confirmed rarely however is nomination voted down on the senate floor most rejections occur in committee either by committee vote or by committee inaction rejections in committee occur for variety of reasons including opposition to the nomination inadequate amount of time for consideration of the nomination or factors that may have nothing to do with the merits of the nomination if nomination is not acted upon by the senate by the end of congress it is returned to the president pending nominations also may be returned automatically to the president at the beginning of recess of 30 days or longer but the senate rule providing for this return is often waived 18 the 911 commission which expressed concern about delays in the confirmation process for the nations national security team recommended that the senate change its rules to require that all action on these nominations such as hearings committee meetings and floor votes be conducted within 30 days of the senates receipt of the nomination19 the senate adopted sense of the senate resolution stating that the 30day target should be the goal20 such sense of the senate language is not binding on the chamber but represents position that at least majority of the senators endorsed

under regular procedure senate action on nominations is triggered by the presidents submission of the nomination to the senate during recent presidential transitions however it appears that the senate has developed flexible informal process to allow quick action on nominations to cabinet and other highlevel positions when the president is swornin on january 20 one of his first official acts is typically to send to the senate many if not all of his nominations to cabinet positions and some other highlevel positions 21 it is not uncommon for the senate to confirm many of those individuals on

possible that the president could be in the position of trying to make new policy withou t his top people in place to carry out his plans but the tight timeline would typically allow the senate very little time to review the nominations to some of the most important positions in the federal government the senate appears to have developed method for handling this situation by allowing its committees to act on an anticipated or expected nomination as shown in appendix which is discussed in detail later in this report senate committees held hearings on most nominations to cabinet positions at the outset of the reagan clinton and george w bush administrations before inauguration day some committees also reported out the nominations before january 20 during the transition from president carter to president reagan for example senate committees held confirmation hearings and voted to recommend confirmation of reagans nominees to be secretaries of defense state and treasury before the formal submission of the nominees on january 20 that allowed the full senate to vote almost immediately on those nominations the senate followed the same pattern for the three positions during the transition from president george h w bush to president clinton and senate committees reported nominations to two of the positions during the transition from president clinton to president george w bush delays in senate organization at the start of the 107 th congress prevented the senate finance committee from acting on the nominee for secretary of the treasury and the committee consented to be discharged from its responsibilities on the nomination to allow the senate to act on the nomination on january 20 22 the senate foreign relations committee voted to report the nomination of alexander m haig jr to be president reagans secretary of state on january 15 1981 during the final session of its confirmation hearing on the nomination the chair of the committee moved that in anticipation of the nomination that it be approved subject to the formal receipt of it from the new president of the united states 23 when the senate finance committee acted upon the

nomination for the position has been submitted to the senate for confirmation and is pending when an executive agency position requiring confirmation becomes vacant it may be filled temporarily under the vacancies act in one of three ways first the first assistant to such position may automatically assume the functions and duties of the office this provision may be of limited utility to new president because he probably would not yet have installed first assistant of his own choosing nonetheless if the first assistant who becomes the acting leader is career executive he or she might lend continuity to agency operations and reduce organizational confusion and paralysis during the transition the vacancies act also provides that the president may direct an officer in any agency who is occupying position requiring senate confirmati on to perform the tasks associated with the vacant position although this option would allow new president to authorize one of his confirmed appointees to perform key tasks it might be of limited utility in the early months of the new administration when pas positions in general are thinly staffed individuals the president might designate to serve under this provision include appointees of the presidents party who are incumbents in fixedterm membership positions on boards and commissions and holdover appointees from the previous administration who support the presidents policy preferences finally the vacancies act provides that the president may temporarily fill the vacant position with any officer or employee of the subject agency who has been occupying position for which the rate of pay is equal to or greater than the minimum rate of pay at the gs15 level and who has been with the agency for at least 90 of the preceding 365 days under this provision the president could draw for example from among an agencys career senior executive service members and this might allow him to select as temporary office holder an individual who supports his policy preferences second form of limitedterm appointment without senate confirmation is presidential recess appointment the presidents authority to make recess appointments is conferred by the constitution which states that the president shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the senate by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session 29 such appointments during withinsession senate breaks are termed intrasession recess appointments and those which occur during betweensession recesses are known as intersession recess appointments intrasession recess appointments have however sometimes provoked controversy in the senate and there is also an academic literature that has drawn their legitimacy into question30 notwithstanding the ongoing discourse in this area recent presidents have made recess appointments during both kinds of recesses recess appointments expire at the end of the next session of congress as result recess appointment may last for less than year or nearly two years depending on when the appointment is made31 29 article 2 2 cl 3 of the constitution 30 regarding senate controversy see sen

this report the length of the appointment process during presidential transitions particularly between incoming and outgoing presidents of different political parties has been of concern to observers for more than 20 years 32 the 911 commission drew fresh attention to this issue in 2004 recommending changes that might accelerate the selection clearance and senate consideration processes particularly for national security positions33 congress responded by enacting new statutory provisions related to the selection and vetting process as well as provision expressing sense of the senate regarding timetable for submission and consideration of highlevel national security nominations during transitions see selection and vetting during presidential transitions and the senate confirmation process and presidential transitions above it could be argued that with federal government efforts to address the nations economic and financial downturn underway during the 20082009 presidential transition the pace at which top leadership positions at the department of the treasury are filled would also be of concern given these concerns and reform measures congress might elect to evaluate the length of the 20082009 transitionperiod appointment process baseline data about past transitionperiod appointments could be helpful in such an effort the 20082009 transition is transition during which the incoming president is of political party different from the outgoing president arguably other recent partyturnover transitions would be more comparable to this one than would be transitions between presidents of the same political party 34 appendix provides continued asked questions by henry b hogue and crs report rl33310 recess appointments made by president george w bush january 20

those positions that were included in appendix c appendix and appendix c each provide information about the intervals in elapsed days between different points in the appointment process35 these points include election day which is the point after which the successful candidate and his supporters turn their attention from campaigning to selecting governing team announcement of proposed nominee submission of nomination senate committee hearing on the nomination senate committee report or discharge and final disposition by the senate 36 the remainder of this section provides brief analyses of

the analysis presented here summarizes the data presented in appendix cabinetlevel pas positions considered in this analysis include all heads of departments37 the administrator of the environmental protection agency epa the director of the office of management and budget omb the us trade representative and the director of the office of national drug control policy ondcp 38 table 2 shows for each position across the three transitions the mean length of the intervals between specified points in the process election day and the announcement the announcement and the first hearing date the announcement and the final disposition of the nomination usually confirmation and election day and final disposition of the nomination the table also provides continued richard thornburgh and secretary of education lauro f cavazos each of whom had been appointed by president ronald w reagan remained in office 35 the appendices differ slightly with regard to the intervals they provide because the transitionperiod appointment process for cabinetlevel positions differs from the usual appointment process appendix does not provide the interval between submission and final disposition for example as discussed in the sections identified senate committees often begin consideration of prospective cabinet level nominations before the new president takes office and has the authority to submit formal nominations consequently the submissiontofinal disposition interval would not be meaningful measure of the senate consideration period see the senate confirmation process and presidential transitions above 36 as noted earlier in the report confirmation by the senate must be followed by formal presidential appointment and swearing in but these steps may be carried out quickly at the discretion of the administration and are generally inconsequential in pace of the overall process 37 as noted in the table nomination has been made to the position of secretary of homeland security during presidential transition the department of homeland secur ity which was established in 2003 was not in existence during any prior transition 38 department heads are generally considered to be members of the cabinet by tradition other officials may be accorded cabinet rank at the presidents discretion for the purposes of this table the category of cabinetrank nominees includes nominees to the four additional pas positions given cabinet rank by president george w bush all of these positions as well as others were given cabinet rank by president clinton president

categories of cabinet nominees department head nominees cabinetrank nominees and all cabinet nominees39 39 two measures of central tendency are presented here the mean and the median the mean is the more familiar measure and it was calculated in each instance by adding together the elapsed times for all of the cases and dividing the resulting sum by the total number of cases the median is the middle number in set of observations or in this case because of an even number of observations the average of the two middle numbers in data sets such as those under discussion here where the data are skewed b ecause of limited number of extreme values the median is often considered to be the more accurate of the two measures of central tendency httpwikileaksorgwikicrsr40119

were confirmed within 91 days approximately three months of the election this means that the average cabinet appointment was confirmed within about two weeks after inauguration day this finding ggests that on the whole the transitionperiod appointment process has been effective at instal ling the top leaders of new administration soon after the new president takes office cabinetlevel nominees do not all move through the process this quickly however as table 2 shows there are notable differences between the mean interval from election day to final disposition for department head nominees 80 days and for cabinetrank nominees 133 days department head nominees were announced sooner brought before the committee of jurisdiction more quickly and confirmed at an earlier date than cabinetrank nominees there was more variation in the intervals between election day and final disposition among the cabinetrank nominees than the department head nominees the overall duration of the appointment process for omb director and us trade representative nominees was similar to that of department head nominees on aver age the epa administrator nominations were confirmed more than month later than nominees to these two positions most notably nominations to the position of director of the office of national drug control policy took far longer to go through every stage of the process than any other cabinet nomination with regard to the epa administrator nominations the data in table 2 suggest that the nominations were announced later than and brought before the committee of jurisdiction for hearing less quickly than the average department head nomination as the data in appendix show however one of the three epa nominations president reagans nomination of ann m gorsuch took twice as long as either of the other two to get to final disposition this single nomination appears to account for most of the variation from the department head average both transition period nominations to the position of ondcp director 40 on the other hand were anomolous among all cabinetlevel nominations as the data in appendix show both of these nominations took much longer than other cabinet nominations but the elapsed time between election day and final disposition for presiden t bushs nomination of john p walters was 393 days 168 days longer than the same period for president clintons nomination of lee p brown because of these extreme values for cabinetrank nominees the mean length of the process is much greater than the median

positions considered in this analysis include selected higherlevel subcabinet posts in the federal government organizations that are most involved with policymaking related to national security and to the federal response to the economic and financial downturn complete 40 as noted in appendix the position of ondpc director was established near the end of the reagan administration so there were only two transitionperiod appointments prior to the 20082009 transition httpwikileaksorgwikicrsr40119 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsr40119g8g146g149g149g146g151g144g561g3 g141g159g146g140g142g561g138g151g141

method by which they were chosen are provided in appendix b table 3 provides at the department level the mean and median length of the intervals between specified points in the process election day and nomination submission submission and hearing hearing and report or discharge report or discharge and final disposition of the nomination usually confirmation submission and final disposition and election day and final disposition of the nomination the table does not provide this information for the department of homeland security dhs or the intelligence community in each of these cases only one position was included in the selected group of subcabinet positions these cases would not necessarily be representative of all dhs or the intelligence community subcabinet positions the nominees to positions in these agencies are however included in the mean and median values in the rows entitled all specified subcabinet nominees at the bottom of the table g8g146g151g141g146g151g144g156g561 for many of the intervals in table 3 the mean is notably greater than the median this suggests that these data include limited number of extreme values41 in such cases the median is often considered to be the more accurate of the two measures of central tendency consequently the analysis in this subsection will focus on the median the median length of the total process from election day to final disposition for all specified subcabinet nominees was 182 days this means that half of the nominees to positions in this group were confirmed within approximately six months of election day or in other words within approximately 3½ months of inauguration day th remaining half were confirmed after that point state department nominees on average completed the process most swiftly half the nominations reached the point of final disposition within 139 days or about 4½ months after election day the median interval between elec tion day and nomination submission at 121 days or roughly four months is shorter for state depa rtment nominees than it is for any of the other groups of nominees and this appears to account for the faster progress of these nominees nominees to department of energy positions took the longest to be confirmed on average the median interval between election and confirmation for the seven nominees was 234 days or nearly eight months in large part this appears to be due to relatively long interval between election day and the submission of nominations to the senate half of these nominations were submitted 196 days about 6½ months or more after election day once the energy department nominations were submitted the median number of days before confirmation was 25 less than one month 41 review of the data in appendix c verified that this is correct nomina tion with one or more time intervals that are far longer than average is not necessarily one that faced problematic process or led to extended vacancy in the position in question for example president bush submitted his first nomination to the position of under secretary of energy for nuclear securityadministrator national nuclear security administration on february 4 2003 819 days after the presidential election and more than two years into his presidency in this case however the incumbent under the clinton administration john gordon remained in office until july 2002 following gordons departure linton f brooks who was then deputy administrator for defense nuclear nonproliferation b ecame acting administrator he was president bushs nominee to the position and was confirmed on may 1 2003 approximately three months after the nomination was submitted httpwikileaksorgwikicrsr40119 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsr40119g8g146g149g149g146g151g144g561g3 g141g159g146g140g142g561g138g151g141

interval between election and submission is nearly six times longer than the median interval between submission and final disposition in other words during the past three partyturnover transitions the

cabinetlevel nominees are selected vetted considered and confirmed expeditiously they generally take office shortly after the new presidents inauguration nominations to be director of ondcp positi on that was accorded cabinet rank by president clinton and president bush were different they took far longer than other cabinetlevel nominations to be confirmed on average the interval between election day and final disposition of nominations to selected subcabinet positions was more than twice as long as that of nominations to cabinetlevel positions there were notable differences in the average election to final disposition interval among the subcabinet positions in different departments on average state department subcabinet nominations were processed and confirmed more quickly than those of any other department the prenomination portion of this period was notably longer than the period of senate consideration the senate confirmed more than half of the selected subcabinet nominations

subcabinet positions in the departments most involved with policymaking related to natio nal security and to the federal response to the economic and financial downturn two stage process was used to select this group first relevant criteria were used to identify an appropriate pool of positions second those positions to which nomination had been made during at leas t one previous presidential transition were selected from this pool the inclusion of the national security related positions was based on 911 commission recommendation that the presidentelect submit the nominations of the entire new national security team through the level of under secretary of cabinet departments not later than january 20 and that the senate adopt special rules requiring hearings and votes to confirm or reject national security nominees within 30 days of their submission 42 the commission did not further specify which departments or under secretaries should be treated in this manner in an effort to select positions for analysis that might match those intended by the commission criteria similar to those in the passages above were adopted positions were to be part of the department of state the department of defense the department of ju stice the department of energy the department of homeland security or the intelligence community and either 1 at level ii of the executive schedule 2 titled as under secretaries or 3 for those organizations without under secretaries the equivalent title at level iii of the executive schedule it could be argued that with federal government efforts to address the nations economic and financial downturn underway during the 20082009 presidential transition the pace at which top leadership positions at the department of the tr easury are filled would also be of concern for this reason treasury positions similar to those in the other organizations were included in addition two new positions specifically associated with the federal governments efforts the assistant secretary for financial stability and the special inspector general for the troubled asset relief program were included the list below shows the positions that met the criteria specified above the positions are listed by organization and the organizations are listed in the order established the subcabinet positions that were actually subject to analysis in this report were drawn from this pool given the nature and purpose of the study the group selected for analysis includes only those positions to which nomination has been made during at least one presidential transition positions that have come into existence since the 20002001 transition were not included in the final pool selected positions are marked with an asterisk in the list below department of
