publishers 1989 p 63by numerous military coups 25 presidents 22 years of military rule and 13 years of peronism2 when the military intervened in 1943 the regime came to be dominated by colonel serving as secretary of labor juan peron who went on to build formidable political base through support from the rapidly grow ing union movement perons mobilization of the working class had an enduring effect on argentinas political system over the next four decades even when peron was ousted by the military in 1955 peronism as political movement survived despite attempts by the military and antiperonist sectors to defeat it after his ouster series of civilian and military g overnments ruled until 1973 when peron was reelected to office after 18 years of exile just year later however peron died and was succeeded by his s econd wife isabel who had little political experience economic and political chaos ensued with political violence surging and argentina experiencing its first bout of hype rinflation as result the military intervened once again in 1976 but this time ruled direc tly until 1983 when it fell into disrepute in the aftermath of its failure in the falkland islands islas malvinas war with great britain in 1982 it was during this period that th military conducted the so called dirty war against leftists guerrillas and their sy mpathizers and thousands of argentines disappeared in 1983 argentina returned to civilian demo cratic rule with the election of raul alfonsin of the moderate radical civic uni on ucr alfonsin wa s widely credited with restoring democratic institutions but economic conditions during his tenure were chaotic with hyperinflation and considerable labor unrest as result alfonsin left office six months before his sixyear term ended letting the winner of the 1989 election carlos menem of the justicialist party pj or the peronist party take office early menem transformed argentina from stat edominated protectionist economy to one committed to free market principles and open to trade most state enterprises were privatized hyperinflation was eliminated and the econom was opened up to foreign trade and investment in 1991 under the di rection of minister of economy domingo cavallo the government pegged the argentine peso to the us dollar and limited the printing of pesos to the extent that they were backed by us dollars policy which helped keep inflation in check but as is now known became major factor in argentinas recent financial turmoil the dollar peg led to an overvaluation of the peso and continued overspending led to large increases in external debt what made menems transformation of argentina even more extraordinary was that he broke with the traditional peronist prot ectionist policies favorable to th workingclass and labor yet increasing corruption and high unemployment at the end of mene ms second term were factors that led to the defeat of his party in the october 1999 elections from rua to duhalde fernando rua won the october 1999 presidential race as the candidate of coa lition known as the alliance for work justice and education that brought together ruas moderate radical civic union ucr and the leftist front for country in solid arity frepaso although there was initialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21113crs3 optimism when rua took office in d ecember 1999 that optimism had faded by the end of 2000 because of doubts bout the governments ability to bring about economic recovery and because of corruption in the administration while the government negotiated several fi nancial arrangements with th imf in 2000 and 2001 it was unable to fulfill imfimposed conditions relating to spending cuts the imf ultimately declined further financial support in december 2001 because argentina could not produce balanced budget argentines began rapidl withdrawing dollars from banks until the government limited withdrawals to 1000 per month the denial of access to bank funds combined with already high poverty and unempl oyment rates after f our years of recession sparked widespread opposition to the government as confidence in the government evapor ated widespread demonstrations erupted around the country with thousands calling for th presidents resignation protests turned violent with rioters battling police with stones and bottles 27 people were killed in the protests and hundreds were inju red some blamed riot po lice for overreacting to peaceful demonstrations as result of the violen t protests president rua fled the presidential palace and resigned on decembe r 20 2001 paving the way for series of interim presidents from the peronist party peronist senator eduardo duhalde ultimately became president on january 1 2002 with mandate from congress to serve out the remainder of ruas term duhalde who had been vice president under menem from 19891991 governor of the buenos aires province and the pjs 1999 presidential candidate was one of th most wellknown and powe rful peronist leaders president duhalde faced daunting politi cal and economic challenges when he assumed office most significantly the ability to quell social unrest associated with the countrys financial instability protests agains t banks and politicians c ontinued in the first half of 2002 but the widespread social vi olence of december 2001 was not repeated and the duhalde government survived duhalde initially promised such populist measures as increasing the states role in the economy nd protecting local industries but he did not pursue protectionist economic model in the end the arge ntine econom stabilized under the duhalde government as part of his economic plan duhalde abandoned the argentine currencys onetoone peg to the u s dollar that had been in place since 1991 and ultimately adopted unified floating ex change rate in february 2002 while the duhalde government was unable to secure imf financing in 2002 because of lack of progress on key fiscal and other structural reforms it did secure sevenmonth imf arrangement in january 2003 valued at almo st 3 billion the duhalde government was also able to clear argentinas arrears with the world bank and the interamerican development bank which allowe d new loans in early 2003 to finance social safety net programs in order to reduce the impact of the economic crisis on the poor challenges for

menems neoliberal rhetoric and vowed to demand reduction in debt and interest rates when negotiating with international creditors kirchner was viewed as somewhat of political outsider not associated with the corruption legacy of the past and his candidacy attracted independents an important factor given that traditional politicians had been discredited progress and challenges for kirchner president kirchners bold policy moves in the areas of human rights institu tional reform and econo mic policy have helped restore argentines faith in government he has attacked corruption in the

argentinas relations with the imf unde r the kirchner government have been contentious at times in september 2003 afte r months of tough negotiations argentina reached threeyear standby agreement th at provided credit line of about 125 billion although imf accords are not normally politica lly popular the accord was widely praised in argentina as an agreement with realistic fiscal targets that would enable argentina to deal with such issues as employment and social equity argentina suspended its imf loan program in august 2004 because of imf pressu re on completion of bt negotiations with bondholders and on argentine progress in imp lementing key economic reforms in january 2006 argentina ultimately chose to repay its 95 million debt owed to the imf in order to give the government autonomy on economic policy although the move was politically popular in argentina some critics ar gue that it would have been wiser to pay down other more expensive debt or to use th money on infrastructure or social spending president kirchner remains widely popular for many observers the october 2005 legislative elections served as re ferendum on the kirchner government and demonstrated continued strong support one third of the senate and onehalf of the chamber of deputies were contested in the elections kirchner emerged from the elections with his supporters having major ity of 40 seats in the 72member senate and 108 seats in the 257member chamber of depu ties including number of prokirchner supporters from parties other than the pj th contest was significant because it asserted kirchners dominance over the peronist party faction led by former president duhalde most analysts believe that kirchner w ould likely win the october 2007 presidential election if he chooses
