consumers6 in the private health insurance market most people get health coverage through the group market this market provides health benefits to groups of people that ar drawn together by an employer or other organization such as tr ade union such groups are generally formed for some purpose other than obtaining insurance like employment while most americans receive their health coverage through the workplace as current employee pendent of an employee or retiree some individuals do not have access to employersponsored in surance esi they may be workers who do not qualify for an offer of health benefits from their employer eg because the workers have parttime or seasonal employment status or they may work for company that does not provide health insura nce at all or they may be unemployed public programs also are source of health coverage but individuals and families must meet eligibility requirements in order to qualify for benefits individuals who cannot access esi and are not eligible for pub lic programs may seek health insurance in the nongroup individual market applicants to the individual insurance market must go through robust medical underwriting the process by which an insurer considers information about an applicant and determines 1 whether to ffer an insurance policy in the first place and 2 the terms of that policy eg the monthly premium the information that health insurer considers may include personal characteristics such as an individuals health conditions family medical history and other relevant factors though uncommon the insurance carrier ma ask an applicant to undergo physical exam or provide specimens in the group market insurers forgo underwriting in the traditional sense that is reviewing each persons demographics and medical history instead an insurer would consider th overall characteristics of the group and calculate premium for set of benefits that would be charged to each person in the group regardless of their individual health status for very small groups insurers may individually underw rite policies if permitted by law federal and state laws restrict somewhat insurers ability to reject applications or design coverage based on health factors in the nong roup market nonetheless some applicants are rejected from the individual market altogether others may receive insurance offers with riders that exclude coverage for specific health condition or body part or othe rs may be charged premiums that are higher than thosehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31745crs3 7 m pauly and percy cost and performance comparison

excellent or very good8 thereby excluding persons with moderate to severe health conditions from this private market high risk pools were designed to assist such individuals who because of their health conditions have very few options for private health coverage health policy context high risk pools appeal to policymakers who prefer an incremental approach to coverage expansion and reliance on current state oversight of health insurance9 supporters of high risk pools contend that states can use their existing regulatory infrastructure as well as their knowledge of health care markets to efficiently insure previously uninsurable individuals s upporters also contend that the private nongroup market will benefit they reason th at by removing high risk persons from the individual market and placing them in publiclysubsidized insurance pools coverage in the individual market will become more affordable they argue that better risk spreading helps to stabilize the market promote competition and retain insurance carriers earning the support of such organizations10 moreover high risk pools function as safety net fo r the nongroup market by assuring that individuals have access to health insurance as long as they are able and willing to pay for it others contend that high risk pools are generally too sm all and underfunded to meet the needs of the majority of persons who cannot access health insurance in the private market by design high risk pool s experience losses but federal attempts to subsidize these losses have been limited waiting lists for enrollment are common and premiums combined with other costs haring requirements can often make the coverage offered by these pools unaffordable as result some researchers remain skeptical that high risk pools will

fee some states fund the losses of their risk pools by requiring insurers across the state to pay assessments generally the amount of insurers assessment is based on their share of the total premiums sold in the state for each year some states also provide tax credits to these insurers thus reducing the insurers ta x liability and enabling them to recover some or all of their expe nditures on the assessments under the latter of these funding mechanisms the state assumes part or all of the cost burden for the losses of the risk pools 16 in ks annual maximum applies to certain plans in fl and ky lifetime maximums apply to specified plans 17 hipaa also provides protecti ons to certain people who wish to enroll in the group health insurance market see the aforementioned crs report rl31634 for

state funds and other sources15 almost all states with risk pools assess fee on insurance carriers although 13 of those st ates offset those assessments with tax credits eleven states use general reve

generally reflect coverage that is available in the private market states usually offer more than one plan from which enrollees may choose deductibles and other costshari ng requirements vary from stat to state most state pools do not place maximum annual limits on benefits except for california idaho kansas louisiana tennessee utah and west virginia in contrast nearly all pools have lifetime maximums on benefits except fo r indiana kentucky and new mexico16 eligibility states establish the eligibility criteria for highrisk pools as noted many states allow hipaaelig ible persons to enroll
