ropes software industry iv executive summary under an initiative of commissioner viviane reding the european commission invited representatives of europes softwa re industry to put forward concrete ideas for european software strate gy this report represents the industrys response to that call group of leading industry experts soft ware vendors smes business associations and analysts have collaborated in reviewi ng the status of the industry identifying the main issues facing it and formulat ing recommendations for addressing them the issues are complex and go to the heart of competition for current players while we have been unable to agree on all aspects we have reached consensus on key areas the result we believe presents co mpelling vision for the european software industry significance of software software is everywhere today yet its in strumental role in the modern digital economy is often overlooked with market revenues of over 200 billion in europe and growth rates of between 6 and 8 software is the largest and the fastestgrowing segment of the information and communication technologies ict market furthermore software is embedded within the majority of products we use today and key enabler for innovation growth nd employment in almost all sectors of the economy software has become the ne rve centre of all modern societies although there have been signs of consolidation over recent years the industry remains highly fragmented despite excellent skills and research european companies rarely become global leaders their small size makes it difficult for european software smes to grow fast enough in an increasingly globalised market to operate internationally or to create busi ness relationships in other member states as result europe is punching below its weight in software at the same time the software market worldwide is undergoing massive change customers expectations of software are ch anging proliferation of softwarebased devices and infrastructures is emerging creating new opportunities for software technological developments such as serviceoriented architectures soa and softwareasaservice saas are revolu tionising the way software is produced applied and consumed and for the longer term new concepts are emerging around the future internet where software will be an essential pillar as result europe still has all to play for in the software market the innovation necessary to create economic growth drive societal change and address environmental challenges relies on ict at the heart of which is software new market paradigm is emerging software 20 where the competitive environment and market dynamics are totally different the software 20 paradigm challenges all current market players and offers huge oppo rtunities for europes software industry this is new world with new rules and europe must compete software should be key part of an information society strategy for europe posti2010 software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry v the software 20 world in the software 20 world software will be developed delivered and consumed in discrete chunks known as services designed to meet users specific and highly personalised needs liberated from the pc and mainstream it systems software based services will be accessible across mu ltitude of devices and appliances in whole variety of settings the software 20 marketplace will comprise rich blend of service offerings according to spectrum of licensing terms and pricing models some free some subscription some payper use some advertisingled furthermore users will be key part of the market ec osystem acting both as consumers and co producers the future internet and the software 20 market paradigm are intimately bound together software will drive the next gene ration of the internet as it grows to occupy an evermore central positi on in our society and economy we see three key challenges for europe in seizing the opportunities presented by software 20 challenge 1 promoting hu man talent in software firstly we must promote human talent so as to nurture not just the best technical skills but also the creativity innovation nd entrepreneurship necessary to create and grow successful software 20 busine sses among actions in this area we recommend creation of european software expe rtise network esen to improve skills capacities within the software industry maintain careful multistakeholder balance in ict training driven by associative partnerships industry gove rnments and third parties alongside public support for industrybased ict sk ills standards and certifications promote the creation of european framework for the accreditation of ict educational programmes at university level within the bologna process in association with industry strengthen the development of new university 20 models to adapt to the social computing phenomena and the networked information economy and to establish ict businessuniversi ty associative partnerships incentivise access to universitylevel education through eufunded scholarships ensure access to access throughout th entire trainingemployment value chain foster einclusion general eskills an d lifelong ict learning among the labour force through multistakeholder partnerships challenge 2 creating innovative capacity secondly we must build the innovative capacity necessary for fastpaced software and service innovation key feature of so ftware 20 to prosper and thrive our main recommendations here are software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry vi launch new programme eurosoft to support innovation in software based smes create european software fund to invest in highgrowth european software companies using the existing instrument run by the european investment fund benchmark and promote national publicprivate funding schemes specific or adapted to the software sector so as to boost publicprivate funding in strategic innovation encourage collaboration between oss communities to overcome fragmentation and link them into global frameworks challenge 3 shaping the future internet thirdly europes software industry must embrace the future internet putting it at the heart of development and business strategies for software 20 businesses our main recommendations here are the commission should ensure consistent regulatory environment for the future internet across europe support for international activities to velop an internet control architecture that allows for fair and equal experience for all users of the future internet further studies of the european opportunities and requirements on cloud services in the future intern et infrastructure to identify any potential barriers commitment from stakeholders to re inforce the openness of the future internet for vendors this means ensuri ng the interoperability of software products based on open nonproprietary standards for public authorities it means reinforcing openness of the internet by funding and procuring open standards based products and solutions rebooting europes software industry we strongly believe that the sector should continue to be marketdriven and that regulatory intervention should be kept to the minimum and limited to addressing market failures any policy measures should be neutral with respect to technology vendor and the underlying software and business models given the dynamic development of new technologies and business models policies that are designed to foster specific technologies or software and business models could hinder innovation and distort competition rather policymakers should ensure levelplaying field and favourable environment for all market players with determination and common vision we in europe can seize the opportunities and establish top positions in the market for software and services that is now emerging we must enable european webservices based industry software 20 which will provide major new market s and new business models for software the time has come to reboot europes software industry software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 1 1 introduction software is everywhere today it is in th personal computers we use to write emails or make calculations it is in the mobile phones we use to call friends and business partners it is in the games consoles that ou r children play at home software is in the cars we drive in the ehealth applications used by our doctors and in the sophisticated systems professionals use to track criminals manage our transport networks and keep the lights on but becaus software is ubiquitous its significance to europe is not always easy to identify or appreciate yet the instrumental role of software in the digital economy should not be overlooked with market revenues of over 200 billion in europe and growth rates of between 6 and 8 software is the larges t and the fastestgrowing segment of the information and communication technologies ict market furthermore software is embedded within the majority of products we use today and key enabler for innovation growth and employment in almo st all sectors of th economy software has become the nerve centre of all modern societies in her speech at the truffle 100 event on 19 november 2007 commissioner viviane reding both recognised the importance of the software industry and indicated her willingness to discuss how to leverage its co ntribution to the lisbon strategy the thrust of her analysis was that europe is punching below its weight in software despite excellent skills and research european companies rarely become global leaders europe is major producer of inhouse and embedded software but remains large net importer of packaged software things are changing however with the shift towards new paradigms such as soft ware as service saas and the future internet where europe could still take the lead she invited the industry to come forward with concrete ideas to help put to gether european software strategy to realise this potential this document summarises the european softwa re industrys response to that call it presents the collective views of leading industry experts software vendors smes business associations and analysts wh have engaged in process of open discussion and exchange at the invitation of the european commission 1 this group has collaborated in reviewing the status of the industry identifying the main issues facing it and formulating recommendations for addressing them the group as whole met on two occasions during the period january april 2009 while individuals also participated in series of working groups physically and online group members are listed in annex 1 our main conclusion is that europe still has all to play for in the software market the innovation necessary to create economic growth drive societal change and address environmental challenges relies on ict at the heart of which is software the sector is undergoing massive change with developments such as saas and serviceoriented architectures soa revolu tionising the way software is produced applied and consumed at the same time new paradigms are emerging around the future internet where software will be an ssential pillar this is new world with new rules and europe must compete software should be key part of an information societ strategy for europe posti2010 1 specifically these discussions have been led by dg info rmation society media unit d3 software and services infrastructures and architectu res and have also involved other commission services software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 2 why do we need european software strategy europe has made much progress in ict over the last decade and software has benefited from this in the internet and telecommunications fields deregulation and vigorous policymaking have boosted the ic t sector including software the ict task force was one of several initiatives take n under the european unions industrial policy which aims to help create more favourable environment for business in the eu and was designed to complement the co mmissions main ictrelated initiative i2010 the european software indus try participated in this effort 2 the eus most impressive effort in the field of software is the priority given to embedded software that has led to heavy investment in the industryled artemis initiative3 however this covers only discrete but very important subsector of the software industry see below europes packaged software sector also face s very specific challenges such as need for rare mix of skills atypical innovati on and sales cycles and software piracy meanwhile it is clear that the future paradigms will be very different from the present with profound impacts on all of europes software industry this report highlights the issues and demonstrates wh the eus demandside approach has to be complemented by softwarespecific supplyside strategy such strategy could maximise the impact of software as an enabler of competitiveness in post industrial society and economy try to redress the balance in importexp ort of software and related services mitigate europes dependence on non european providers and technologies to date an absence of policy in this area has made it difficult for the commission and policymakers to act yet industry needs clear policy framework within which to plan and operate we must find way to reboot the european software industry what is software the creation of software encompasses many different activities which together form the software value chain the main aspects include architecture consulting analysis concepts developing code ie programming testing implementation marketing and distribution maintenance eg software update management helpdesk and training education the software sector actually comprises several different types of companies independent software vendors isvs also referred to as packaged software companies these are producers nd vendors of commercially available packaged software they offer packag ed software through sale lease or rental or as service revenue typically includes fees for initial and continued righttouse software licenses 2 for ict task force see httpeceuropaeuenterpriseictpolicytaskforcereportsicttf_reportpdf 3 artemis is joint technology initiati ve launched by the eu to support re search in embedded software systems and services see httpwwwartemisjueu software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 3 it services companies these are companies for whom major part of their business consists in developing custom so ftware applications that are turnkey solutions for specific client this is very different business to packaged software although many small companies in europe sell both embedded systems software embedded software is computer software or firmware which plays an integral role in the electronics it is supplied with it is written for machines that are not firs t and foremost computers manufacturers in wide range of sectors include embedded software in their products key users include electronic components mechatronics consumer electronics automobile aerospace defence heal th network telecom equipment embedded software is very different to pa ckaged and custom software specifically it has user interface with which to interact embedded software already accounts for significant part of development and production costs in these industries and will drive all major product innovations in the years ahead today european manufacturers have strong position in the field of embedded systems and software and major european initiatives such as artemis have been launched to support these activities for these reasons embedded software should not be focus of this report our focus therefore is primarily on packaged software and related services and the role of software in the evolution of networks especially the future internet 2 software and services in europe sector overview 21 the european software market the european software industry is significant contributor to the european economy and key driver of innovation and cha nge spending on software and related services is worth around 258 billion to the european economy or around 26 of gdp4 the software industry creates tax revenues is major source of highvalue jobs and has downstream multiplier effects throughout the economy the observation that much of europes p oor growth performance compared to the us is due to lack of investment in ict has been widely made in summary ict accounted for as much as 04 percentage points of the 052 point difference between gdp per head growth rates in the us and the euro zone big three germany france italy in 1995 2002 5 the european ict rd expenditure per inhabitant is only about one third of the amount spent by the us or japan6 and the total and per capita ict rd investments are significantly larger in the us and in japan than in europe europe is unlikely to close this gap unless significant progress is made in areas such as skills innovation and competition 4 idc economic impact study 2007the

software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 4 it is not our purpose here to give detailed statistical picture of the european software market such analyses are read ily available elsewhere few selective figures serve to illustrate the position however software is growing sector the software market is growing more rapidly than the ict sector as whole according to one analyst ref 4 between 2006 and 2011 in the eu software will grow at compound rate of 69 per annum versus 60 for the ict sector overall growth is particularly strong in central and eastern europe which has some of the fastest ict growth worldwide cagr of 205 between 2002 and 2006 and 141 predicted for 20062011 software creates value the annual revenue per employee in the software industry is over 100000 per employee which is among the highest rates in the whole economy 7 software contributes to greater productivity use of software is one of the key drivers of productivity growth in almost all european economic sectors packaged software and related integration and cons ulting activities are key source for productivity improvements in service industries such as retailing transport and logistics and professional services em bedded software defines the attributes and functionalities of products and serv ices in sectors such as automotive aerospace medical equipment au tomation telecoms and consumer electronics software is major focus for research and innovation total investment in software rd from 2002 to 2015 for key sectors is forecast to grow by 128 to 133 billion which would almost double the growth rate for these sectors total rd 74 european packaged software companies in the truffle 100 have collective workforce of 175000 of whic h 38000 are employed in research and development software is source of highvalue jobs the benefits of software are felt most dramatically in terms of employment in 2007 the eu software industry employed 43 million people 55 of all ict jobs employment is forecast to grow at 50 per annum for the eu as whole and around 14 pa in central and eastern europe while official statistics and market studie s focus primarily on proprietary software where data are easier to obtain open source software oss 8 is now key feature of the european software market and of increasing economic significance one study on the economic impact of oss prepared in 2006 shows that european firms have invested an estimated 12 billion in develo ping oss and these firms have total of 565000 employees and 263 billion in annual revenue it is unclear if

quoted by comptia software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 5 europe represents around one third 36 of the global software market figure 1 however europes overall trade position in software products is poor around two thirds of the packaged software sold in europe is produced elsewhere europe is therefore net importer of packaged software although there are differences between countries overall reliable data is lacking pie chart to be added bas ed on eito 2007 figures according to oecd figures in 2002 59 of the software produced in europe was developed internally by user organisations 24 was spent on packaged software and 16 on outside subcontractors 10 22 the european software industry within packaged and custom software three major subsegments can be identified system infrastructure software proprietary as well as open operating system and systemlevel software used across all types of hardware from mainframe to pc tools collaboration and content tools

heavily on local ie nation alregional markets us companies are at an advantage here due to large home market and common language consolidation is moving up gear but the european industry is still highly fragmented in western europe the top 10 players account for 46 of the software market15 the top four consisting of the four biggest global players reach 37 the share of the top 10 has risen in recent year s as consolidation has accelerated at the top of the market several top european software vendors have been acquired mostly by us companies finally apart from industrylevel aggregations we note that the quality of statistical information on the european software mark et and sector is poor and needs to be improved 3 the competitive environment in this section we briefly review the work ings of the european software market and the principal factors influencing competit ion fragmentation competing software development and business models and the influence of quasilegal issues standardisation interoperability and ipr are the main themes 31 fragmented market the fragmentation in the industry highlighted above has number of implications for how the european software industry operates struggling to scale in fast consolidating global market software smes in europe face vicious circle when it comes to growth to grow fast enough and face bigger competitors on their domestic market and ultimately go global they need better access to skills to finance and to public procurement but access to skills financ and public procurement in europe today is all the more difficult when you are small thus many european software companies remain small and very often increase the share of services in their revenues to survive which drives them apart from pure 14 idc figures quoted by ntas 15 eito figures quoted by ntas software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 7 software vendor business and its potential economies of scale this small size also hampers their pricing power on th eir domestic european market where they more and more compete with global leaders within the current economic downturn this vicious ci rcle is all the more dangerous inefficient and fragmented labour markets despite recent improvements the growth in demand for appropriately skilled labour continues to outstrip the growth in supply given the lack of suitable graduates and experienced personnel many companies have to recruit staff from abroad but while many smes could easily contribute to the eu economic growth by hiring more employees including from other member states employing workers across borders has proven to be extremely difficult barriers to doing business internationally relatively few european ict smes trade internationally recent studies show that very limited share of european ict smes sold products outs ide their national market finnish german italian and dutch firms are most likely to sell their products internationally while not all firms will wish to sell their products abroad there is clearly huge untapped potential for those that do barriers to partnering with firms within the eu similarly smes often encounter difficulties creating partnerships with other companies based in another member state this is for number of reasons in particular difficulty to get access to information on potential sme partners in other countries fragmented work permit system difficulties linked to the legal system of another country difficulties faced in litigationarbitration cases due to different national provisions and procedures barriers to participation in european processes processes on the european level including standardisation are too heavy and cumbersome for smes to participate effectively and are especial ly unattractive for driving innovation in smes the main innovators come fr om technical background and might also steer the business side these pe rsons usually have little time and interest for working on european networks and events fragmented regulatory landscape despite substantial efforts single market is still far from reality in europe the lack of harmonized rules in finance and financial infrastructures represent barrier to crossborder cooperation of smes laws are very di fferent across europe and as noted above mobility of workers between member states is hindered by lack of harmonized employment rules social schemes and tax provisions other issues arising from fragmentation to which we turn in detail later include difficulties in relation to public procuremen t educational standards and innovation software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 8 32 model competition the business environment in software is complex interplay of three related and often overlapping models 1 the software model how the softwares intellectual property is released or controlled proprietary software is software model in which the software remains under control of the proprietor of the software typically the developing party and users obtain certain permissions on the software by accepting licence typical conditions include time limitations for the licence use for certain purpose on certain computer or by certain person as well as payment of royalties to the proprietor for obtaining the licence over recent years an alternate software model open source software oss has emerged defined by high level of user control ov er the software in combination with far reaching freedoms to inspect the source code and to study and innovate upon the software 2 the development model how the software is physically developed here there are various approaches ranging from development by single person or organisation using limited cooper ation model through to open co development while some software models offer advantages for certain development models and are traditionally seen as aligned eg oss allowing for easy implementation of codevelopment issues across boundaries including individuals and companies of varying sizes the choices of software model and development model are largely orthogonal it has become common practice to work with different combinations of software and development models 3 the business model how the software is marketed and sold business models are intimately connected to the issue of revenue generation and are largely orthogonal to the choice of both software model and development model although both typically have some influence some sources of revenue are effectively unavailable for one software model or another for example the proprietary model provides direct licensing revenue from distribution or usage this revenue is not available in the sa way with the oss software model although very similar revenue streams can be implemented through contractual constructions trademarks andor certification having shaken off its garagehobbyist origin s oss is now credible alternative to proprietary offerings and in some areas is the only alternative to dominant commercial products lack of market confidence remains however due to concerns such as availability of support sk ill levels understanding of licence terms and liability oss tends to push the integrat ion function into the hands of users as opposed to vendors as is the case for co mmercial products users are then exposed to issues problems and extra support and in tegration costs which can be offputting oss is often quoted as european success story the facts do not entirely bear this out however while european experts and contributors are prominent and highly regarded in the community worldwide ma ny of the technologies developed in europe are exploited by us companies according to one estimate 90 of the business derived from oss is generated by noneuropean players 16 in addition most 16 ms comment nessi figures full reference needed is this consistent with comptias claim an estimated 12 billion has been invested by european firms in open source software development software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 9 oss consortia the nonprofit organisations managing oss development and marketing are based in the united states and funded by us it companies europe must address this imbalance we need to exploit oss better and make sure the benefits stay in europe with european developers users and entrepreneurs the various business models that can be built on top of the proprietary or the oss software models overlap to large extent most business models can be built on either software model custom developmen t cots servicebased approaches saas appliances advertising models can all be based on proprietary or oss software models or combination of the two ho wever the overlap is not total some business models are tied to one software model or the other and some business models depend on mix of both models ov erall the rising popularity of oss has increased the ability for business model i nnovation and new models will emerge in the future see further discussion in section 4 33 standards interoperability and ipr constellation of issues around standardis ation interoperability and intellectual property rights ipr influences how the software industry operates and have been intensely discussed for several years th are controversial areas with well established one could even say entrenched and divergent views within the industry we have discussed these issues at length within the european software industry panel and in particular the working groups and on the whole have been unable to shed any new light or make progress most issues are known and are already subject to fierce political and in so cases legal fights and lengthy reports there is not space here to elaborate the arguments of all the different camps nor would it be productive to do so in th absence of relevant conclusions and policy recommendations so in these key areas we have agreed to differ while recognising that all three issues are of fundamental importance to the prosperity and success of europes software industry aspects of the debate are referenced in the subsequent sections where relevant in particular there are implications in relation to innovation and public procurement to which we return in section 6 we confine ourselves here to brief exposition of the issues at level and in terms to which we can all nearly agree 331 standardisation in software standardisation plays crucial role in the velopment of the software industry as it is key element for innovation and interoperability standards can help to ensure that an ict product or service is fit fo r purpose and that competing products and services can communicate with one another and share information as result standards can increase users efficiency reduce transaction and implementation costs and promote competition in new fields such as the future internet standards could be pivotal in giving europe better competitive edge europes approach to standardisation europe has well organised standardisatio n landscape on the basis of directive 9834ec it takes lessons from the past nd gives european standardisation clear priority over national standardisation with the european telecommunications standards institute etsi europe has created global player and home of the successful gsm standard consumer protection standards and new approach are also seen to work well software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 10 there is well established cooperation between the european standardisation organisations by some common co mmittees sometimes they have trouble agreeing but this is inevitable the cooperation between the and the commission also works rather well and th mandate system allows the commission to benefit from the insight the recent study by dg enterprise ref showed that on the whole the european standardisation system works pretty well for classic manufacturing industries although there are some flaws with respect to information and communication technologies but the shortcomings are just that flaws nobody is calling for radical overhaul the changes required amount to an evolution not revolution the european standardisation system needs improvements rather than fundamental reform any additional measures in this area arising from the europe software strategy should reinforce these efforts nevertheless there are opportunities for improvement in both the international and national systems all stakeholders emphasized that standa rdisation efforts should under normal circumstances be voluntary marketled and industrydriven the initiation and drafting of standards should be marketled their acceptance and usage should be voluntary and flexible and the development process should be open and transparent allowing for implementation in range of competitive products to ensure consumer choice in addition certain representatives drew attention to the world trade organisation wto criteria about openness accountability and due process standardisation also has some conno tation to public interest thus triggering some higher requirements these factors are especially important for sm both as developers of technologies but also as users moreover given the inte rnational character of the industry it is important for europe to focus its efforts on benefiting and influencing the development of international standards rather than on promoting european standards once they have been adopted th is should also apply to the reference of standards in public procurement recognition of fora and consortia due to the rapid evolution of the industry many standardisation developments have been undertaken by industry consortia outside of the official standardisation bodies 17 formal standards processes tend to be too slow for fastpaced market such as software industrybased consor tia and other forums also known as standards developing organisations sdos are seen as being able to respond more quickly to market requirements and so have been much more widely used in developing software specifications in some cases this has led to dominant proprietary platform becoming the facto standard while both formal and informal processe s coexist this fragmentation has led to need for an indepth reflection on the coherence and efficiency of the entire standardisation landscape calls by cust omers for greater interoperability among software and other ict products and serv ices have also raised the question of whether standards could be better used in this sector 17 the main european and international bodies in software are the european committ ee for standardisation cen and the international standardisation or ganisation iso exampl of industry consortia and forums include the motion picture experts group mpeg the institute of electrical and electr onic engineers ieee and the worldwide web consortium w3c software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 11 one approach could be to reform the ma ndate system for standardisation as recommended by the dg enterprise study the commission has the possibility to issue mandates to the three to ask them for action actions can range from simple reports to request for the elaboratio n of standard this is useful tool for the commission to influence and connect to the standards world but the mandates sometimes surprise the community outsid the eu standardisation system this mandating system could be extended to allo w for actions also by industry fora and consortia and the commission could engage in consultation before issuing mandate in conclusion it is clear that standards are essential in achieving interoperability which is vital for the success of the european software industry in world markets on the other hand standards on their own will not drive innovation and in our view are of secondary importance to issues such as entrepreneurial capacity innovation and skills 332 interoperability in software interoperability is one of those terms that is difficult to define and tends to mean different things to different people one definition drawn from ieee ref is interoperability is the ability of an it system to communicate and exchange information with other it systems in way that all it systems can use that information interoperability is an emerging principle of greater collaboration and interconnection between ict systems at time when the european economy and market need dynamo of growth from within unleashing the power of truly open specification based interoperable ict systems within the european internal market could re vitalize economies spreading efficiency and effectiveness in all vertical industries that have become it intensive while the role of interoperability extends far beyond the reach of the software domain its innovative capacity is not well known outside the ict industry there is great need to raise awareness about core interoperability principles such as open standards and specification and open architec tures there is also potentially role europe can play in framing the debate and implementation of interoperability across various industry domains in addition our debate on this subject noted the following issues interoperability is not the only goal of standards standardisation is mostly associated with the goal of interoperability but as noted in the dg enterprise study standardisation in europe can have variety of goals the eu standardisation system is designed to also draw up standards for the new approach legislation the regulator sets framework that is filled out and maintained by standardisation organizations although standards can help facilitate interoperability 18 they are panacea standards change over time as do the products in which they are 18 interoperability has number of dimensions here it can be applied internally among the softwarebased systems within an organisation between the systems of different organisations such as within supply chains and for interconnecting future systems with ex isting systems futureproofing software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 12 used the evolution cycles of the standard and the products that implement it are rarely in synch leading to different generations of the standard being enacted which brings its own interoperability challenges these choices may have been made by engineers for the best of reasons to improve the welfare of consumers the aim should be to foster interoperability that is practical and meets market needs we must guard against laws that define interoperability too strictly and so dr ive flexibility out of this constantly changing process interoperability is being applied at ever higher levels whereas once interoperability was applied at purely technical level such as communication between devices on network it is now being applied at ever higher levels the web brought interoperability to the syntactical level to data while developments in areas such as egovernment seek to apply it at the organisational level as well yet the higher we get in interoperability the less there is room for competition so sdos have to be careful to leave room for competition this sometimes leads to tensions as those not well positioned in the competition call fo r standardisation to overcome their weak market position 333 intellectual property protection strategic value of intellectual property intellectual property rights ipr are an ssential feature of the software industry enabling software vendors to invest in innovation and attract venture capital protection of ip encourages investment offering the potential for return on that investment it also facilitates trading in innovations so that innovations can be composed and can evolve further over time over the last decade the significance of ip has become even more apparent as technological developments have made pira cy and patent infringements easier at the same time softwarebased systems have become part of the critical infrastructure of companies governmental in stitutions and society at large in this new environment companies need to be able to choose from portfolio of ipr to ensure their rights as creators are protected from illegal and illegitimate copying the most appropriate means of protection will vary depending on the type of software the investment made in developing it its usage and the software and business models adopted the main options are patents used to protect the technical solution implemented in the software program if it is novel and inventive 19 copyright covers the program as form of expression20 19 in europe patents are not generally available for software known in legal jargon as software as such but inventions with technical effect th at are implemented by software som etimes called computerimplemented inventions or ciis are patentable in the same way as other inventions nati onal patent offices and the european patent office have granted patents on ciis sinc 1973 computerimpleme nted inventions which only solve business problem using computer rather than technical problem are cons idered unpatentable as lacking an inventive step although they are allowed in the united st ates controversial proposals to widen cii provisions in europe to include business methods were reje cted by the european parliament in 2006 check date 20 specifically copyright protects ag ainst unauthorised copying of source code object code sometimes called machine or compiled code the underlying sign materials and other expression of software software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 13 trade secrets used to protect the va luable and confidential information contained in program trademarks used to protect product and service brands copyright and trade secrets have been the traditional forms of ip protection for software commercial software companies typi cally distribute their works in object code form and rely on copyright to prev ent unauthorised copying and distribution contrary to perceptions in some quarters even open source developers rely on copyright to ensure that their innovations are freely distributed and not expropriated and made subject to more restrict ive terms by their competitors is software special ms comment this section is from the original report based on the first meeting and is not reflected in the wg reports but is retained for the time being is the software sector different to ot her technology industries in its ipr requirements we believe it is for number of reasons firstly the number of software patent s has grown significantly over recent years partly due to defensive strategi by some players this has led to situations such as patent holes or p atent trolls where patentee does not declare patent until technology is widespread and patent thicketsfences unused patents being used to block innovation many of these patents are of questionable quality secondly patenting has implications in terms of standards and interoperability patenting in some areas of the software market is particularly powerful eg apis 21 thirdly unusually within the patenting field software is an intangible the end result is not hardware or device or drug but computer code the sectors ip provisions will become in creasingly important in future as the boundaries between hardware nd software are blurred in software companies need to share knowledge to innovate leading to high degree of collaboration and pooling of resources innovation is generally incremental rather than through big br eakthroughs but involves rapid cycles patenting on the other hand is slow and the period of the grant is much longer than the period of exploitation the current ipr system is out of tune with this fast moving collaborative incr emental innovation model number of other factors influence the efficiency and effectiveness of ip protection for software litigation procedures for solving infringement must be fair and be seen to be fair enforcement of iprs in overse as markets must be efficient and workable and patent assessment and search procedures should be speeded up regarding the latter point we note as welcome development the use of open exchanges to share information between patent offices and interested communities 22 ipr and standards 21 application programming interface enabling interfaces that support the building of software applications 22 reference or url needed software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 14 the position regarding ipr in standards is particularly problematic our discussions identified number of approaches royaltyfree approaches this camp opposes patents on ciis in general and such patents in standards on frand terms especially the community is broader than just open source but ss has some specific arguments the main one being that oss projects cannot deal with patents in standards to make oss implementations of standa rds possible standards should be unencumbered and bear royalties frand this camp argues that the free reasonable and nondiscriminatory access frand provisions provide an incentive for rights owners to contribute their ipbased technology for use in standards by assuring that their innovations are protected and can be licensed on reasonable terms among other benefits this assures retu rn on their investment in research and development proponents of frand do not exclude participation in royaltyfree standardisation however and in general the issue is more complicated than just frand vs royaltyfree frand with ex third camp argues against patent holdup problem that can occur because an implementer has reduced bargaining position with the holder of essential patent claims visàvis licensing terms once standard is finalised after reviewing the issue in some detail number of sdos have decided to permit the voluntary disclosure of those licensing terms ex there have b een additional proposals to the effect that sdos should mandate the disclosure by the patent holder of the licensing terms for its essential claims before the standard is approved license of right license of right lor to use patented invention guarantees that any interested party will have legitimate access to the patent to develop interoperable softwa re without fear of patent holders trying to assert their exclusive patent rights to block the development of new products as result the lor ensures that patent protection will not be used strategically to prevent legitimate followon innovation in the software industry lor has been described as benevolent frand because there is firm commitment to negotiate without the threat of injunctions for the moment voluntary lor regimes ex ist in several member states as noted previously the issues are extr emely complex and we do not attempt to dissect them further here campaigning for software in existing forums in conclusion accessible robust and effectiv ip protection remains essential to the software industry the software industry has specific requirements in relation to ipr and it is essential that any new horizontal measures cater for the industrys special situation the problems are real and urgent and in particular it is necessary to reduce complexity of the system and improve its flexibility and responsiveness while we have agreed to differ within our own deliberations we look forward to meaningful and concrete progress on these issues within existing forums software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 15 software is the foundation of innovation and adding value in the 21st century it cannot easily be accommodated within system created for the industrial age paradigm shift is needed 4 business and technology trends globally the software market is facing period of unprecedented change new technologies and business models with ma ss appeal are being introduced to the market almost on daily basis software has reached critical mass and has become ubiquitous in many aspects of 21st century life as result the driving force of consumer demand will continue to push this sector to reach new horizons for some time to come new technologies also bring with them new ways of doing business which can occasionally make existing regulation or incentives obsolete the main trends we see affecting the software market are the following 41 shifts in customer demand within the business world market dema nd is evolving in variety of ways globalisation today the world is flat the tr end towards globalisation has led economies to become increasingly interre lated companies operate in similar manner throughout the world and citizens seek to transcend nationality and location as the key determinants in th eir social and business transactions in short geographical and national barrier s are reducing changing the influence of given individual company or state and challenging the business models applied to industries and economies software vendors need to adapt their business models to meet the requirements of increasingly globalised customers changing market expectations to address the need for flexibility and fiscal responsibility companies of all sizes are looking at how they use and consume it in particular they are revisiting the trad itional buy capex vs rent opex tradeoff serviceoriented models vs softwareoriented model allow companies to scale when needed pu tting less strain on the business by minimising capital expenditures and trul operationalising costs which can be charged to specific cost centre this shift has significant implications for the business models of traditional software companies shifting to or introducing consumptionbased software model will have drastic impact on revenue recognition sales compensation model and gotomarket strategy modular business structures over the past decade the quest for agility and innovation has led organisations to cut through the traditional silomatrix structures to more cellular mode ls both internally and externally this componentisation of the economic world and subsequently of enterprises entire value chains induces rearchitect ing of information systems in much more modular way known in software development as service oriented architectures see below this impacts the software industry which will supply the components necessary to build these next generation information systems and address the transformation needs of the current business networks software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 16 consumerisation of it the shift to opex is helping to drive an evolution in the it buying centre by empowering those outside of it to make software buying decisions it purchasing is becoming less hierarchical with purchasing decisions migrating from cios to line of business lob leaders with specific goals these lob users are increasingly tech savvy nd looking for business solutions that mirror their consumer experiences on si tes like google ebay and facebook lob executives are demanding solutions that offer accelerated innovation rapid deployment fast timetovalue and low risk avoiding long purchasing and deployment cycles thus endusers are now becoming empowered to make buying decisions and in turn are influencing cios these requirements for new user experiences are making the softwa re market more consumer oriented generation shift the geny influence generationy the generation of young people who have grown up with the internet is now entering the work force geny works and communicates differently to the retiring baby boomers and other generations that have gone before and their expectations of work will be defined by their learning styles the development of the internet as business medium and the corresponding usage by ge ny will have significant impact on the it market especially for enterprise software in summary business users expect more flex ible and personalised it environments and subscribed services in an always connected mode those tools complementing their business transaction pr ocessing systems will reinforce their ability to interact collaborate contribute decide and adapt to their fast changing environment fusing their professional social and private lives user expectations for software will change based on experiences with websites and users will demand easy to consume realtime information where many legacy applications face challenges new consumers in the consumer market several specific trends can also be observed proliferation of softwarebased devices and infrastructures the number and variety of computing communication nd purposebuilt devices is growing and systems are becoming more complex thus software in devices becomes more and more important users are looking for integrated solutions that include offline software services mobile devices or large servers with emphasis on sharing and reuse this creates opportunit ies to create new services that connect the various pieces of the ict infrastructure be it in manufacturing process or consumer offering each combination cr eates unique offerings for the user this trend also creates increased demands on the network infrastructure from localhome environments right through to the global level these demands cover multiple angles bandwidth requirements latency expectations number of devices connected etc increased amount of endpointtoendpoint traffic as opposed to hubtoendpoint leads to growing importance of peertopeer technologies hence the need to differentiate at policy level legitimate vs illegal uses of p2p explosive growth of comp uting power available on the network in form of large number of small devices leads to interesting opportunities in systemlevel optimization with increase in efficiency but also raises all sorts of questions about privacy security control of information etc software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 17 ownership of customer relationships more sophisticated services and offerings to consumers together with splintering audiences mean controlling the flow of information becomes all important whoe ver controls those flows will own the customer relationship and be able to charge premium customers increasing expectations will inevitably lead to closer links between the media and ict industries and in some case conflicts usergenerated content consumers are increasingly able and willing to contribute to the creation of content the need to share co ntent coming from different sources requires increasing levels of interoperability and standards support and pushes the limits of existing legal frameworks on privacy information control and data protection free is the ideal price point conditioned by advertisingfunded applications and services consumers expect more and mo re offerings to be free or near free the underlying trend is separation of user and payer one example being adfunded software services 42 evolution in technology we have identified four main technology drivers affecting the software industry serviceoriented architecture soa cloud computing enterprise 20 and semantic web which are summarised below 421 service oriented architecture soa serviceoriented architecture soa is new paradigm in software development whereby flexible standardised architectu re is used to allow set of reusable applications to be combined into intero perable services so serviceoriented architecture is simply syst ematic approach to exposing as many systems as possible as to collection of services that later ca n be combined or reused across multitude of projects serviceoriented architectures are poised to transform business by enabling more flexible and agile it infrastructures ind eed it is an essential tool for software vendors to address the complex needs of enterprises and business networks that have become volatile and moving ta rgets in globalised economy the key change agent in this transformation is middleware leading companies are gaining operational efficiencies and business agilit through adaptable reusable business processes and services built on portfo lios of open middleware products that transform their clientserver infrastructures into services oriented setups unlike clientserver systems characterized by tangled webs of tightlycoupled integrations that are expensive to mainta in and update soa is based on loosely coupled services whose interface exists independently of the implementation services can be built used and reused ba sed on changing business need and easily integrated across heterogeneous platforms creating such reusable software building blocks confusingly called services that can combine with other services to form new business applications yields cost savings since developers do not have to build applications from scratch software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 18 the additional flexibility benefits both customers and vendors in fact the technology drivers of soabased software contributes towards reoutfitting legacy systems across europe by building interope rability layers on top of them andor replacing them with stateoftheart open standards based systems most applications hr crm financial management supply chain similarly rely on interoperability regardless of the industry they are destined to serve finally all layers of technology need to be interope rable while middleware and service layers are current focus of standardisation more needs to be done public funding of such activities could help towards the greater adoption of and participation in standards activities by smes and in the innovation within the european software market the soa concept is widely understood among business and it circles and almost everyone agrees with its benefits however the route to soa is less clear in fact even though most corporations realise the benefits soa adoption has been sluggish at best why the disconnect the reason is that changes of this magnitude require strategy and many corporations understanda bly dont know where to start as an example of what some vendors are doing oracles application integration aia project 23 gives programmers and customers toolkit and library that leads to manageable adaptable and upgradeable soa integration with less time lower cost and minimum risk 24 422 cloud computing cloud computing has become the generic term for itrelated services that are used as flexible services it serves as an umbre lla term for the provision of set of these services such as storage computing po wer software development environments and application combined with service delivery through the internet to consumers and businesses accordingly cloud offerings today roughl fall into three categories namely hardware clouds development platform s and application delivery clouds addressing the different target audiences of service providers software developers and users alternate terms for the same respective offerings and the ones which will be used here are infrastructureasaservice iaas platformasaservice paas and softwareasaservice saas the main innovation in cloud computing is that the it infrastructure longer lies with the user meaning that even inexperi enced users can access these services the key feature of all of these ict service offe rings is the breaking up of the previously monolithic ownership and administrative contro l of the assets at the various layers of the stack and distributing them across multip separate entities this has number of advantages and benefits operating efficiency using clouds is more efficient and more flexible than maintaining internal it departments which may lead to new wave of outsourcing moreover resource sharing vi clouds offers an overall optimizing energy usage 23 oracle aia see httpwwworaclecomapplicationsoracle applicationintegrationarchitecturehtml 24

business models by restructuring the value chains in the ict industry the dynamics for new service offerings are changed dramatically by shifting from huge initial capital investments to paywhatyouuse business models low barriers to entry the biggest advantage lies in very low initial barrier to entry for all players and flexible co nsumption this would benefit small businesses in particular wanting to launch innovative business ideas effective usage of cloud computing could give companies competitive edge the uptake of cloud services by endusers has been fairly uniform across the globe however adoption by enterprises in europe lags behind other regions while recent gartner study showed plans for saas adoption in many enterprises actual current usage in europe somewhat lags behind the us by 62 versus 67 and strongly trails the adoption of saas in asiapacific at 89 reservations about cloud computing deri ve from concerns about dependability vulnerability and lockin to providers as well as securityrelated issues when there are longer true internal systems there is uniform service level agreement sla and the thirdparty cloud providers involved are dealing with sensitive data indeed hardware breakdowns loss of dat and critical reduction in performance have occurred in relation to todays clo ud computing offers therefore many users are choosing to combine internal it and cl oud computing in terms of data privacy and jurisdiction national standards and re gulations have resulted in few providers storing regional hardware and most ch oosing instead to use european and american infrastructures in general the stion that arises is how national privacy and security standards can be ensured in global cloud environment from european perspective two issues should be addressed firstly cloud computing could potentially develop into an essential infrastructure of the information economy as did roads and electric grids for the classic industrial society thus creating deep dependence on the reliability and availability of the supply and freedom of access and the balance of power between providers and consumers since cl oud computing by its very nature is global there are shortterm concerns of any geographic region being at disadvantage despite the current dominance of us providers at least lowlevel interfaces for hardware clouds are re asonably standardised and there is healthy level of competition still europe should strive to also develop hardware cloud infrastructures since this will become strategic asset in the digital economy moreover europe needs to be much more active in developing development and application clouds regardless of underlying hardware infrastructures secondly europe should increase the use of cloud computing throughout the c n m i n p r t i c u l r b s m s w r c m m n d t r g t d c t i n t f s t r education about the opportunities and pitf alls of cloud computing and to ensure regulatory framework around clouds that ensures privacy dependability and fair distribution of power between providers and users finally it should be stressed that openness interoperability and collaboration should be the guiding principles for the developmen t of cloud computing as they have been for the internet so far hence global standardisation efforts should be key priority software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 20 423 enterprise 20 enterprise 20 is what happens when web 20 gets down to business social networking tools applied in the firm are about to generate an enterprise 20 based on collaboration tools which will significan tly affect most it applications across domains but does enterprise 20 simply mean using web 20 technologies such as wikis blogs mashups and gadgets within the organisation dramatic changes are affecting traditiona l business models across most industries making the case for different approach competitive advantage today is achieved not through command control and operat ional excellence but rather through collaboration communication and management excellence enterprise 20 facilitates this more open approach to management and leadership and is already making its way into business software invigorating the feedback process around the tools themselves and the processes they govern web 20 technologies will impact the way system services will be accessed and combined to create final applications co mbined with semantic web technologies see below they will drive the evolution of the web the open and collaborative nature of web 20 technologies will enable endusers to assemble disassemble and reassemble applications they will also enable them to share applications and knowledge with other users employees within the company in the context of enterprise 20 these newlycreated app lications also need to be secure the popularity of social networking web applic ations are indicative of shift in the way people communicate with each other these are becoming the preferred method of communication between not only friends and family but also between businesses customers partners and market s in their work environment digital native managers and professionals expect the same methods of communication this is because social networking applications have for the first time technologically enabled conversational communication on mass scale organisations know that online communities formed around specific interests could help promote their products and services however the public web has few and often rules of engagement or controls over what is said or how content is presented this is where enterprise 20 technology differentiates itself from web 20 technology because it originates from with in the business users of enterprise 20 technologies begin as known rather than anonymous entities with specific identity or role after all they are empl oyees of an organisation working toward common goal the success of the business unlike piecemeal deployment of distinct islands of information or capability the enterprise 20 platform allows services to be snapped in turned on and rolled out without long expensive integration projects most importantly the platform model means that employees are not required to constantly learn new software products and business processes in order to use the technology in summary enterprise 20 is an integrative business strategy that combines multiple disciplines technologies and experi ences it shows that the era of the pure technology drivers if it ever existe d is longer the dominant force of contemporary computing software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 21 424 the semantic web the term semantic web refers to var iety of developments and technologies aimed at making the web more user friendly by unlocking the knowledge embedded in multimedia content and real life objects semantic technologies are body of tech nologies relating to metadata formats modern forms of artificial intelligence ai technology and autonomic selflearning systems these technologies are important to business because of their ability to create exponential value in reducing costs intelligent internet searches are probably the best example of semantic web technology in action if the semantic web was here google search for yacht racing would yield americas cup results even without using that search term semantic interoperability is about drawing together data from different sources and relating data to real life objects the semantic web puts html data into machinereadable format so that computers can aggregate it and understand these relationships 25 these standards and descriptors enable web developers to add layers of meaning to web documents supplying framework for defining how data is linked and how its intended relationships are expressed metadata management is key requirement for nextgeneration enterprise software and semantic technologies are key to metadata management the adoption of semantic technologies can only happen while driving open standards and delivering wide range of software products using thos technologies we believe that semantic technologies will see wide adoption in the next few years but will require commitment from industry understanding from endusers and vision while there are four typical ways business could use semantic web technology search web services grid computing and content ma nagementcompliance many other areas will be ripe for it soon 425 future networks the work to migrate to new internet prot ocol ie the standa rd that enables the connection communication and data tran sfer between computing endpoints is essential ipv626 standard currently being developed by ietf is an important part of the next generation of internet technology ipv6 fixes number of problems in the current ipv4 protocol such as the limited number of available ipv4 addresses it is expected to gradually replace ipv4 with the two coexisting for number of years during transition period overall ipv6 will improve the performance of the internet and will enable wide range of devices and services to be integrated into our homes businesses and while on the move the introduction of ipv6 ongside unrestricted access to broadband is of great importance together they will help to offer citizens wider access to an advanced information society however as vint cerf sometimes called the father of the internet has said the value of ipv6 can be realised only if the deployment effort is broadly based on global scale currently its penetration is still less than one 25 for example extensible markup language xml and da talanguage standards such as resource description framework rdf and web ontology language owl two world wide web consor tium w3c standards

business models are converging the competition between the proprietary and oss software models has led to heterogeneous ecosystem in which several trends can be observed models are converging as companies become increasingly active outside of their traditional parameters socalled commerc ial software providers are developing and offering open source programs and components while companies typically considered open source are offering commerc ial software for sale further the two are actively working together to produce software for example red hat the best known open source producer also ships so commercial software products that run on top of its open source platform ib m offers integrated open source and commercial solutions and even microsoft typically viewed as the archetypal commercial software vendor actually pr oduces products along spectrum of software models some change regarding the direction of software model choices can be observed many companies have tended towards oss in particular mixed model companies moving to fully oss software model to verage the full benefits of the model for their strategic growth established large co mpanies tend to use oss components for diversification and to reduce cost in areas which do not determine the differentiator for their business model for new market trants the choice of software model is between proprietary mixed or fully oss decision intertwined with considerations of development and business model requirements the competition between software models s generally led to more choice for the users and has impacted on the way in which the proprietary model is being applied an example is the practice by some vendor s to offer customers th full source code of solution upon discontinuation of support for particular software product this seeks to emulate some of the advantages of oss for customers of companies using the proprietary model and while the effectiveness of this particular offer depends upon the particular terms the example demonstrates the positive impact that software model competition can provide in summary large enterprises seem to leverage the benefits of either software model for their individual business model and combine them quite freely with various development models from their pers pective the future is mixed smaller enterprises tend to focus more on one soft ware model or another with some mixing applied for particular business model constella tions overall there is wide variety of business models available and the co mpetition between software models is helping to drive innovation in business models 432 software becoming service softwareasaservice saas is delivery mo where functionality is delivered over the network and users pay for what they consume rather than per copy or by license the enduser receives the benefits provided by the software without the need to install or operate it the provider takes the responsibility for operating the software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 23 software on their own premises and the nduser simply utilises the software over the network the saas market is still embryonic accord ing to idc global saas spending in 2007 amounted to 57m of which the european market accounts for around 10 but explosive growth is forecasted over 50 per year and it is expected to become mainstream within few years although generally associated with browserbased delivery in fact saas is not tied to any particular product or technology nor is it tied with particular business model certain business models subscriptions payasyougo usagebased billing are easier to implement using an saas delivery model but these models are not exclusive to saas for endusers saas provides both advan tages and disadvantages the advantages include better clarity of costs absence or reduction of substantial upfront investment increased efficiency due to economies of scale faster development cycles and incremental delivery of new or improved functionality without extra costs however saas also has its drawbacks less control or even loss of control over user data limited opportunities for cust omisation increased vendor lockin and switching cost increased complexity of integrating various saas applications potential issues with regulatory compliance pecially in the area of data protection and need for producers to acquire operationa l skills in addition to development skills saas is most suitable to standardised rvices which are relatively common across many companies and do not form base for companys competitive advantage and its differentiation visavis competition this is more than just an incremental development saas represents new paradigm for software provision it offers the potentia l for users to be able to build and evolve their systems more flexibly and for new supp liers to readily join pool of service suppliers and compete on an equal footing with installed suppliers such trend would require major change from european companies offering packaged software shifting to pure saas business model implies complete change to revenue recognition and strong investment in new skills to move from productoriented to serviceoriented company for instance they would increasingly need to recraft their sales pr oposition and retool their sales approaches to deal with the increasing number of technical queries 433 business model innovations two other innovative business models are also apparent appliance or embedded software service appliance or embedded is another model of delivering the benefits of so ftware to the enduser traditionally embedded software is associated with specific applications like industrial automation solutions controllers etc however recently an increasing number of companies have started to offer more traditional software in the appliance form the essence of this delivery model is combining hardware software and more recently internet or intranetbased serv ices in single easytosetup easyto operate package the appliance model shar some benefits with saas ease of software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 24 implementation ease of use lower maintenance fees however unlike saas the enduser retains full control over data in this case data warehouse appliances and search ppliances are the most visible examples of traditional server software being livered in the appliance form looking at the consumer space the vast majority of todays consumer electronics devices have very high software component and an increasing number are including access to services as key features of th package for example all three of the latestgeneration game consoles are actu ally package of hardware software other core components and online services advertising model advertising is unlike saas or appliance truly different business model in the software industry product or service is provided to the enduser free with the software provider earning money from selling advertising services essentially the software provider sells advertisers access to its customer base the revenue thus generated depends on size of the user base ability to target ads to maximize relevancy to particular target audience the advertising model allows companies to create and monetize products and services which are valuable to the enduser but for which the user is not necessarily willing to pay thus foster ing innovation in new areas use of advertising in the software industry did not start with google for example many developers of trybeforeyoubuy products include advertising in trial versions to complement direct sales revenue this model requires the provider to be able to collect store and utilize considerable amount of information about users of its software raising potential regulatory concerns in the area of pri vacy data protection and crossborder transactions 44 software shaping society in addition to technology and business trends there are public policy initiatives that impact the software industry foremost are policies related to green it and it security policies in relation to ehealth egovernment and einclusion could also be highlighted green it and energy efficiency as computing becomes increasingly pervasiv the energy consumption attributable to computing is climbing despite the clar ion call to action to reduce consumption and reverse greenhouse effects at the same time the rising cost of energy is refocusing it leaders on efficiency and total cost of ownership particularly in the context of the worldwide financial crisis energy is an increasingly scarce and expens ive resource this reality will continue to have profound effect on how it solutions are designed deployed and used particularly at the data centre level wh ile virtualization and other powersaving technologies may go part of the way to so lving the problem virtualizing inherently inefficient applications has obvious limits todays most utilized approaches primarily focused on infrastructure optimization may be too narrow to deal with the power challenges of tomorrow methods of optimizing infrastructure usage are required that run the entire ecosystem spanning software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 25 the disciplines of application architecture and design data centre management and it operations there are multiple examples of applications in use today which are extremely inefficient for instance pplications that run on multiprocessor computers but only effectively make use of single processor or servers that only run applications at certain times of the day optimizing software for energy efficiency could lead to acceleration or slowdown of certain technology trends increase dema nd for new skills and potentially increase complexity and cost of software development process it security governments in several countries are developing policies that are designed to increase the security of public it systems however in some cases there is at least risk that these policies may be misused to unduly protect or foster the national it industry china may serve as an actual example on 27 august 2007 china filed 13 technical barriers to trade notifications to the wo rld trade organisation covering broad range of software and hardware product areas including secure routers smartcards chips operating systems data backup and recovery or security audit products the main concern here is forced intellectual property transfer required encryption codes and lacking compatibility between the cc and international standards iso 1540812005 and common criteria 27 the crucial issue is that china defines stategovernment applicatio ns wider than the norm the regulation would create significant tr ade barriers to software vendors doing business in china some companies might even decide to pull out of china or drastically scale down their offerings following interventions by the eu japan and the us china temporarily suspended the regulation however final decision has yet to be taken we can expect these types of disputes to increase in future as governments ramp up their critical infrastructure programmes 45 towards new market structure these market technological and business tre nds effectively amount to revolution for the european software industry wave of consolidation is sweeping the industry as companies seek to safeguard their position within maturing market new business models are emerging as companies try to gain competitive advantage and seek out new niches and innovations such as virtualisation and softwareoriented architectures soa enable software to be in creasingly sold as service as result over the next 510 years we will see new market structure emerging one which offers europe immense opportunities 27 the common criteria for information tec hnology security evaluation abbreviate d as common criteria or cc is an international standard isoiec 15408 for computer securi ty certification the fact that ccra is an open standard is crucial it means there is guarantee that all parties have access to the inno vation going on that way there would not be the need for such far reachi ng chinese it security legislation software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 26 451 consolidation creates new opportunities as noted above the european software industry is highly fragmented and relies heavily on local markets while there has been some consolidation it has been slower than in other sectors the main driver here is the speed to scale acquiring another software producer can also be the best way for company to expand beyond national borders to enlarge its customer base and to implement diversification strategies the degree of consolidation depends very much on the maturity of given market segment every year new technologies nd innovative software are produced by young companies that are quickly able to become leaders in these new markets once the market has developed consolidatio n takes hold and very often they are acquired by one of the top software vendors usually from outside europe but in this fast evolving environment the top pl ayers of today will not necessarily be the top players of tomorrow europe therefore still has the opportunity to establish leading positions the challenge essentially is how to im prove interoperability for software users while guaranteeing more open market for software suppliers business models entrepreneurial capacity innovation ecos ystems and access to finance are all important issues here and are addresse d in detail in the following sections eulevel initiatives such as the european research area era the european technology platforms etps and the joint chnology initiatives jtis are helping to integrate european efforts and reduce frag mentation at least within the research domain these could be means to encourage smes to work with regional centres and networks in addition the transition to the future internet is an opportunity to reinforce europewide approach see section 7 452 deverticalisation offe ring new platforms for smes the shift to soa and related technologies will stimulate the industry to change in other ways beyond simple consolidation st rong deverticalisation is envisaged ie the breaking down of vertical niches leading to the emergence of few leading software systems manufacturers toge ther with many software component developers moreover the software sy stem of manufacturer will become platform for the component developers hence in few years from now the software market may look very si milar to the automotive industry one key impact of deverticalisation will be small and mediumsized players will longer be at disadvantage many innovative companies will emerge fostering creativity in the software world companies will thrive as tier1 tier2 tier3 etc component developers providing spare pa rts to the integrator the platform provider who will remain responsible for delivering an integrated package to the client among these spare parts whether proprietary or open source will be the regionallocal adapters that will continue to be required for the foreseeable future especially in europe as national regulatio ns will survive possibly for many years to come for the software systems manufacturers and platform providers the competition will likely stay global leading american comp anies seem already well advanced in the platform competition so europe must get it s act together if it wants to play this game software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 27 453 new innovation ecosystems shifts in demand and new technologies ar creating new ecosystems for software development and use in particular there is trend towards increased coinnovation where users and independent developers work closely with originators in developing effective solutions some of these charac teristics initially emerged in the open source model facilitated by the broad gr ants contained in its licenses however these trends have become significant factor in the proprietary world as well within the sap ecosystem for instance members of the sap enterprise services community esc collaborate with sap employ ees to define services and features for future releases of products while more than 15 million members of the sap developer network sdn share their experi ence with each other and developers working for sap top contributors obtain sap mentor status gain direct exposure to top executives and have more influence on the sap product strategy coinnovation has profound effect on the market with increased user involvement in consultation design testing and improvement noticeable in every approach to software today one result of this is to blur the distinction between what constitutes user and what constitutes provider indeed the open source model notably empowers all users to become providers while the proprietary paradigm does not encourage this level of user freedom the relationship between providers and users has become less static than before the trend towards coinnovation is also an important driver behind interoperability these new innovation ecosystems reflect an emerging trend of new business models that combine elements of both the traditio nal proprietary and open source software models it is important that such trends as with purely proprietary and purely open source models are fairly facilitated by policy makers 454 software 20 the new market paradigm after it has consolidated deverticalised and coinnovated what will the future software industry look like the answer we believe is totally different from how it looks today from these three factors new landscape will emerge one where the competitive environment and dynamics are totally diffe rent this new market paradigm which we call software 20 challenges all current market players whichever camp they are in large and small vendor and servic provider proprietary and open source but it also we believe offers huge oppo rtunities for europes software industry in the software 20 world software will be developed delivered and consumed in discrete chunks designed to meet users specific and highly personalised needs ie as services liberated from the pc and mainst ream it systems softwarebased services will be accessible across multitud of devices and appliances in whole variety of settings the software 20 marketplace will comprise rich blend of offerings according to spectrum of licens ing terms and pricing models some free some subscription some payperuse some advertisingled furthermore users will be key part of the market ecosystem ac ting both as consumers and coproducers the future internet will feature large in this software 20 world many sectors will be shaped by the future internet as it weaves together new seamless world of information content servic and things but the softwa re sector will be affected software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 28 more than most this is for two reasons firstly software will provide the building blocks of the future internet which in componentised world will be delivered as services secondly the software sector s own development models and business models are migrating to servicebased appr oaches and will utilise the future internet infrastructure thus the future internet and the software 20 market paradigm are intimately bound together software will drive the next ge neration of the internet as it grows to occupy an evermore central positi on in our society and economy we see three key challenges for europe in seizing the opportunities presented by software 20 we must promote human talent so as to nurture not just the best technical skills but also the creativity innovatio n and entrepreneurship necessary to create and grow successful software 20 businesses we must build the innovative capacity necessary for fastpaced software and service innovation key feature of software 20 to prosper and thrive we must embrace the future internet itself putting it at the heart of development and business strategies for software 20 businesses while the remainder of our report concentrat on these three aspects we note that the offfield issues of standards interope rability and ipr will also be important in the software 20 context and may need to be revisited in that light 5 challenge 1 promoting human talent in software 51 skills for the knowledge economy for the european software industry to succeed in global markets it has to attract and retain the top talent the best software programmers managers and entrepreneurs yet like other areas of the ict industry software is affected by lack of experienced and well qualified people an it skills shortage is now serious nd worsening problem throughout europe and at all levels of it use from consum ers and business users through to software engineers the number of it graduates has dropped considerably over recent years especially in the software sector in the uk for example the number of software engineering students has dropped by 60 in the past five years 28 similar falls have been seen in other european countries the roots of this problem lie in variety of factors social ec onomic cultural and structural poorly defined career paths in ict the unattractive even nerdy image of software in the eyes of the public the lack of interest shown by young people in science at school in all western countries all of these contribute to the situation which we can justifiably call skills crisis now unfolding 28 wwwvnunetcomvnunetnews2159726 20bnriskukskillsshortage software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 29 this shortage is compromising europes gr owth in several ways it prevents large sections of the population from participating in the eeconomy it makes the european workforce less attractive to compan ies seeking to base operations here it provides an incentive to outsource software development to other regions it inhibits the uptake of new technologies by european organisations and it is threatening to put brake on europes technolo gical innovation and development we must do more to maintain and develo p the european skillbase in software and its applications t h n d i s n t j u s t f r i t s p c ialists but for software engineers skilled in applying software and services chnology in all other application domains and industrial sectors in such fastevolving sector replenishing the knowledge of existing practitioners is also key requirement moreover general public that is comfortable with it enthusiastic about us ing it at work and at home and excited about its future prospects will offer an vironment in which the youth will be drawn to it as profession and so supply the future scientists and engineers there is also strong business dimension here as noted in section 3 the key challenges for smes are human challenges european software smes often have strong technical competences but need help in developing management capacity and business skills technical skills are gene rally well covered by training providers but areas such as marketing finance nd entrepreneurship need to be improved again the key difference in software is the fastmoving business environment 52 reshaping professional education and lifelong learning the starting point to address this skills crisis should be the education system rethink of educational structures is required given the pace of technological change simple technical training is not sufficient to produce the fullyrounded employees needed by europes software industry further educational styles which teach rote learning rather than fostering creative dynamics in school do not give new engineers the necessary freedom to think in addition the eurostat data identified rge ict skills gaps between highly educated only 11 with basic computer skills ve rsus poorly educated 61 with basic computer skills with that variance in stat istics and the stated european objectives of more aggressively bringing in underrepresented groups series of scholarships for basic level maths and science education may be useful underprivileged or lowerincome individuals could thus access better educational institutions incentivise university level educ ation in computer engineering there are simply too few technical graduates graduating in itrelated fields this means dual effort to promote more interest among young people in these fields is critical along with increasing immigration for highly skilled workers as the world economic forum wef has highlighted consiste ntly education is critical ingredient of competitiveness the quality of scienc and mathematics education management training and specialised eskills training fo r the workforce is vital to achieving the economic benefits of ict use foster access to lifelong learning the need to constantly upgrade skills s been recognised by the commission as critical to improving europes competitive capacity given the fundamental software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 30 importance of this recommendation it bears further mention here companies find new graduates unable to fulfil essential technical roles indeed as with doctors and lawyers technical engineers must engage in lifelong learning programmes european businesses recognise the challenge and are concerned for instance idc found that 75 of the respondents in survey across 10 european countries believe that the level of ict skills of their employees w ill influence the compet itiveness of their organisations its ability to innovate and its ability to grow the role of multistakeholder partnerships is essential part of the challenge with inadequate ducational structures comes fundamentally to the speed with which technology changes human capacity must be fostered to drive change rather than hinder it while some of this can happen through modifications to the educational system and increased capacity in maths and science there is only so much nontech nology dedicated institution can do yet dynamism and new approaches in skills training is essential to supplement there needs to be close cooperation between ll stakeholders concerned that may mean enhanced partnerships between universit and private sector institutions as envisaged under the bologna process it may mean more ictspecific training centres or it may mean investment by individual companies to promote the greater welfare of the industry by augmenting its technical capacity the commission has clearly recognised the value of publicprivate or multi stakeholder partnerships in developi ng eskills further the commission has thoroughly analyzed the situation with respect to publicprivate partnerships throughout europe in the findings of multistakeholder partne rships for eskills in europe we concur with commission findings and encourage full implementation and ongoing research in this area to support the growth of multistakeholder partnerships for ict education and training actions promote the creation of european framework for the accreditation of ict educational programmes at university level within the bologna process in association with industry erasmus and other programmes like the eurec master degree for renewable energy allow the creation support and promotion of much needed european acad emic qualifications in the field of ict the european commission should as part of the european software strategy strengthen similar academic skills initiatives in the ict and software area accordingly the european union should also strive to ease as much as possible the access of noneu students to these eu hightech education programmes strengthen the development of new university 20 models to adapt to the social computing phenomena and the networked information economy and to establish ict businessuniversity associative partnerships the traditional european university conc ept is gradually evolving towards university 20 model which integrat ict and software skills in all university activities the virtual space of university 20 emerges as the framework for universities to adapt to the social computing phenomena and the networked information economy in this virtual space associative partnerships between the academic an d business worlds will be established for the benefit of the european software interests software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 31 to incentivise access to universitylevel education the eu should consider funding scholarships for underprivilege d individuals and others to undertake software engineering and related degrees in cooperation between industry and universities maintain careful multistakeholder balance in ict training driven by associative partnerships industry governments and third parties alongside public support for indust rybased ict skills standards and certifications ict digital literacy and professional training eskills credentials and industrybased certific ations whether proprietary or open source are part of much wider policy debate in europe as with the debate on technical standards this discussion is being engulfed in the notion of mandatory formal european quality standardisation by some policy initiatives specifically there is ques tion of whether to rely on formal or informal training and certification syst ems and whether best practices of tested informal delivery of global industrybased eskills standards and certifications have to be aligned to european quality criteria as with the issue of technical and software standard s the issue of eskills standards is not an eitheror question it is not choice simply of formal or informal standards and certification ict sk ills training like ict technology development is dynamic and rapidly changing any work in this field requires close coordination among all relevan t players government sponsored training on its own will naturally fail to respond to the rapidly changing market private certifications alone will not meet existing demand in this environment government should maintain careful partnership with the business and training sectors and with independent organisations multistakeholder partnerships that drive credential value communication and greater awareness are critical in addition authorities should recognize ict skills value credentials and support industrybased ict skills certif ications to keep european software industries competitive 53 enhancing skills capacities within the software industry widening the skill base these business marketing sales and projec t management skills are key enabler for the health growth and competitiveness of the software industry in europe clear understanding and mastering of ict as the backbone of business processes and as catalyst for productivity and competitiv eness is necessary throughout the whole business valuechain furthermore with the ever increasing use and reliance on digital technology across the economy and society as whole pr ofessional capacities in software development and engineering as well as related management and marketing skills will be widely required in all areas of business and industry especially the fast growing service sectors facilitating mobility software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 32 in software as elsewhere skilled worker s are becoming increasingly mobile changes in the work model with an increasing number of dispersed offices and project engagements rather than long term employ ment and the willingness of graduates to follow career abroad have had significant impact on employers this trend has been reflected in offshoring both within the european union and beyond currently cumbersome work and residency permit requirements impede and sometimes even prevent software vendors from employing third country nationals on paneuropean projects resulting in lowe r levels of service to customers and lost opportunities for the providers more must be done to improve the mobility of skilled workers at all levels as students researchers and employees and in this respect we welcome the commissions propos als for blue card scheme for highly qualified employment 29 as globalised sector foreign competition is an established feature of the software market and one that has exercised both industry and policymakers at length in recent years given the skills crisis it may be necessary to rethink our perspective on this issue increasingly foreign talent is an advantage to be leveraged by european companies rather than replacement fo r european talent in this globally competitive environment european industr has to compete for talent worldwide europe needs the best and bri ghtest wherever they are access to foreign engineering talent complements and strengthens existing european talent competition from emerging markets drives european producers to be more competitive and to link up strategically with complementary technology large established multinational players provide muchneeded research budget access to technology and large economic impacts in the european ic t ecosystem because it is already strong vibrant and competitive european industry has itself managed these challenges and turned them into very succ essful economic and innovative stimulants ownership nationality location these terms are increasingly irrelevant in the technology sector actions creation of european software expertise network esen to improve skills capacities within the software industry europe needs more coordination in developing the skills of the existing workforce with regards to product software development as we ll as running and expanding product software company the esen would not be new institution but an open network bringing together established centres and companies it would be created by ictsme oriented associ ations existing national ict trade associations and existing software expert ise centres it would act as hub for all existing players and facilitat cooperation between them esen will enable packaged software companies to share expertise and improve some of the most critical skills of the existing workforce in europe software engineering gotomarket notably crossborder and management it will contribute to furt her enhance the quality of madein europe software capitalising on european research and best practice in 29 council directive on the conditions of try and residence of thirdcountry na tionals for the purposes of highly qualified employment the directive woul d introduce blue card work permit system whereby after an initial two year period third country nationals woul d be allowed to work across the 27 memb er states and not be restricted to work opportunities in the member state that initially grants the work permit software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 33 methods and tools relying heavily on pr ocess maturity and systematic reuse in the long term the activities of th is network would lead to specialisation and to collaboration agreements betw een both the participants and their member companies 54 promoting digitally literate society as noted above the skills cris is is not confined to soft ware but is symptomatic of issues facing the digital economy more generally europe already has mature policy agenda in the eskills area backed up by strong analysis and recommendations specifically this includes among others the efforts of bodies such as the european eskills forum the ict task force report the european commissions communication on eskills for the 21st century fostering competitiveness growth and jobs september 2007 and the competitiveness council conclusions on longterm strategy for skills november 2007 this latter strategy for instance includes commitments on motivating and empowering future generations with eskills promoting ict practitioner education and training boosting the employability of the workforc with ict user skills and providing foresight and support for future skills needed in the changing environment in short there is strong consensus on eskills development in europe we welcome and wholeheartedly support these effort s what is required now is action initiatives under the european software strategy should aim to extend and build on current action plans by focusing on professional software skills within the industry itself and in other domains and application sectors we applaud the commission for recognising the persistent problem of digital illiteracy in the communication and also through its monitoring and research we agree that the ambitious goal of digital literacy will not be reached by itself europe needs long term einclusion strategy to avoid the risk of 3040 of the european population being marginalised and the comm unication represents an important step in this direction in this respect we would especially like to single out the call to bring the industrybased and formal education closer together if we want eskills to be disseminated throughout the population we need to pursue more flexible approaches to learning bridging the differ ent interests of industry governments and of all stakeholders concerned in order to achieve this common goal we believe one of the most important concepts from these discussions is something summarised as access to access throughout the entire trainingemployment value chain from access to technology and physi cal infrastructure in schools access to training and content curricula and certific ations access to public funding and finally access to labour placements each is keyre f each of these elements needs to work in tandem or the cycle simply does not work in 2008 the eskills industry leadership board ilb 30 in conjunction with eu bodies and other institutional actors developed set of critical recommendations on the accesstoaccess concept these called on policymakers european citizens and relevant stakeholders to build on tested be st practices and to highlight the role of 30 see wwweskillsilborg software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 34 multistakeholder partnerships to prov ide sustainable ict training and industry based qualification schemes recognised cr edentials and certifications ref finally it is important to recognise that ictsmes are everywhere and embedded in their communities and hence can be key abler to transmit eskills throughout the economy actions foster einclusion general eskills and lifelong ict learning among the labour force through multistakeholder partnerships with industry and other stakeholders concerned as above ensure access to access throughout the entire trainingemployment value chain including access to technology and physical infrastructure in schools access to training and content curricula and certifications access to public funding and finally access to labour placements government and industry efforts should support the ilbs existing work in this area improve the image of the ict and software industries especially targeting the youth and women through continuous european awareness campaign on hightech basic ict education capa bilities and professional ict careers opportunities in europe 6 challenge 2 creating innovative capacity 61 the innovation environment less innovationdriven environment in eu rope leading to slower adoption of software studies show that enterprises especially smes in europe are much slower to adopt ict than their american competitors refs on of the main reasons for this is that it is much less frequently seen as key diffe rentiator to be more competitive in the united states companies will hesitate less to rethink and change their organisation if they see competitive advantage through ict there is also more inhouse software in europe and lower degree of propensity to acquire packaged software offered by software vendors especially from europe an vendors that are often seen as too small although there are important diffe rences between countries the general innovation ecosystem is weaker less clus tering between companies research labs venture capitalists and business angels less massively funded universities strategic use of public procurement to b oost innovative smes furthermore small european software companies suffer from widespread risk averse mentality private and public customers banks etc the european commission has done lot to stimulate demand and remove the barriers to enable the successful adoption of ict the eus i2010 strategic framework the lead market initiative nd the launch of the competitiveness and innovation programme are crucial steps in the right direction but there is still long way to go this demand side approach mu st continue including current standards policy orientations and increased visibility of the sectoral ebusiness watch but it has to be complemented with softwarespecific supply side approach software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 35 research and innovation are performing well under potential software is major focus for research nd innovation and is recognised as being source of systemic innovation in other sectors however the innovation level at european scale is undermined by the current high fragmentation of the european ict industry in this industry excellent rd has often proved to be counterproductive if not combined with excellent development strategy marketing and channel policy european software companies tend to have good rd but have suffered from insufficient anticipation of gotomark et and industrialisation phases product marketing packaging setting up customer support service etc this is mainly due to lack of marketing and managerial skills one approach is productisation standardis ation of the firms offering so that the cost and effort of selling and serving an additional customer decreases productisation results in making the product easier to market sell and deploy studies in finland have shown that companies that start to productize their offering usually go through transformation process from technology companies to product companies and then to marketing companies according to one respected finnish entrepreneur this is still disadvantage compared to us companies which are marketing organisations from day one nevertheless one of these finnish studies ref demonstrated that innovations indeed h ave statistically significant positive relationship with firm growth however th is only occurs in cases where firms have made both technological and ntechnological innovations thus europe must encourage not only research but innovation this will be especially important in the context of so ftware 20 where innovation will be even faster and much closer to the market good policy should target and encourage companies that invest in the complete innovation value chain idea concept development including translation and do cumentation validationpilot and goto market product marketing business development european rd funding schemes could be used to target and stimulate this value chain approach in particular helping them make the transition to software 20 businesses access to research funding software smes experience the same difficulties in accessing rd funding schemes as smes in general the barriers include lack of information too much red tape generated by calls burdensome submission and negotiation processes project management and reporting rules etc although improved since 2007 the existing european programmes are still too complex too often they are still only accessible to the happy few companies that have the information and the knowhow to apply or to big companies that can afford to employ specialised teams we support the proposal for twostep approach as proposed in the 2008 aho evaluati on report ref allowing applicants to access initial seed funding to develop an idea some difficulties are more specific to so ftware companies the innovation cycle in software is faster with less massive rd th an in other hightech sectors it hardly matches the pace of traditional european rd projects very often software companies have already developed the tec hnology and need to focus on pilots demonstrators and gotomarket activities software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 36 furthermore in the software industry most of the early investments eg in people algorithms and code are not counted as assets in accountancy terms moreover experts and venture capitalists involved in the evaluation process often do not know the sector and are reluctant to fund companies with balance sheets that appear very weak ip issues are also particularly sensitive when contemplating whether to enter into european projects software smes do not see how they will receive satisfying return even in small and medium projects as protective measures imply full and complex process finally the topdown approach of the strategic research agendas which define top level eu research priorities is hurdle for software smes that can not be well represented in such process fostering innovation ecosystems the growing maturity of the it ecosystem can be observed in the form of commoditisation of software and growing relevance of interconnectivity as demonstrated by the discussions around in teroperability and open standards as observed in other industries eg automotive these trends will inevitably lead to an increased reuse and recombination factor where only differentiating components are produced inhouse while generic components are being reused or codeveloped welldeveloped oss ecosystem is an ideal breeding ground for such an economy the increasingly welldeveloped legal infr astructure around oss also thanks to initiatives such as the european public li cense eupl provides solid and reliable foundation for public and commercial activity with clearly established ground rules that fall into more than three basic categories while these trends and their impact seem largely inevitable europe is in the uniquely favourable position of already h aving healthy oss ecosystem in place that it can build upon actions launch the eurosoft programme supporting innovation in software based smes this ambitious new programme would address the difficulties encountered by software smes in accessing public funding schemes for research development and innovation modelled on the successful eurostars programme which operates under eureka rules this would fund projects focussing on innovation rather than just rd and would cover the whole innovation cycle including validationp ilot gotomarket both locally and beyond domestic borders within the eu it would award label to companies for meeting series of criteria such as usability of products in different european languages and cultures such programme should be tested on small scale before being rolled out europewide encouraging collaboration between oss communities europe has already done valuable work in oss and the specific research and development efforts of dg infso in the field of oss have contributed in various ways to the growth of healthy european it ecosystem this work should be built upon and intensified so as to spread the benefits from these projects both in form of available products and services as well as increased reuse and software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 37 recombination factor the commission should try to get things more organised and shared by and between oss actors and communities europe has several oss consortiums foundations and communities these have many common needs and issues but suffer from fragmentation they should be encouraged to operate in more global frameworks maybe by joining their efforts goals and roadma ps they could be used as well as vehicle to capitalise and build on top of open software resulting from european rd projects possibly add opportunities in the green it agenda as strategic innovation theme promote the use of software in making it greener and in sustainable development more generally 62 public procurement today it is widely acknowledged that ic t and in particular modern software solutions are essential to enhance the cost efficiency as well as the quality of public services in turn public sector investment s in technology will reduce administrative burden for businesses and citizens and will significantly contribute to european growth and competitiveness public admini strations in the eu have yet to fully exploit the potential of ict however memb er states investment in egovernment is not sufficient and crossborder public services are still the exception consequently truly internal market for egovernment app lications does not exist despite various eu initiatives such as the i2010 egov ernment action plan and ministerial declarations on egovernment the public sector is by far the largest procurer of software and therefore public procurement policies can exert huge leverage in the european software market the large majority of public procurement contract s of interest to software businesses fall under national procurement legislation this has enormous macroeconomic implications and strongly impacts the ict industry and wider business stakeholders public procurement presents particular ba rriers for smes who are often not able to accommodate the high costs and slow processes involved in public tenders there is an increasing willingness in europe to utilise procurement to promote particular business or standards development models most recently eu initiatives in particular the eif have sought to prefer products that follow certain implementations of open standards implementations which some argue are too narrowlydefined individual member states have followed the eus lead adopting formal policies in favour of one technology or software model over another this may exclude many popular solutions based on widelyrecognised open standards in particular by excluding technologies im plementing randbased standards these decisions may impact the choices of ot her organisations that work with the government sector inhibiting the ability of software companies to compete on level playing field in addition it is impo rtant to recognise that eu policies influence public procurement around the world others argue that the current position is st acked heavily in favour of incumbent large proprietary suppliers with the result that lockin has occurred to significant extent precluding new suppliers or alternative mo dels according to one analysis this affects up to 90 of public sector organisations in europe ref ofe way around software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 38 this is for schemes which aim to identify and avoid lockin in new procurements and developments one such scheme certified open is currently being reviewed and trialled in partnership with european national government this is controversial area for which we have been unable to agree detailed recommendations we offer instead the following observations and suggestions 1 technology neutrality and consumer choice as the guiding principles of european public procurement in software voluntary industryled standard setting is the most effective way to develop platformneutral and marketbased standa rds when these standards are open and available to all through reasonable and nondiscriminatory licensing they help developers to create products that can interoperate with each other it is important that government policy recognizes that open standards which are available to any software developers are not synonymous with and do not require open source software either for their adoption or utility developers of commercial software that may not typically publish their source co often contribute technology and intellectual property needed to develop new standards promoting competition vendor choice and ad aptability to evolution in technologies and user needs should be the guiding principles here in general the marketplace is the best way to ensure innovation in soft ware development consumers should be allowed to select which model works best for them and public procurement policy should not discriminate in favour of or against one model over another 2 public procurement can be vehicle for promoting innovative applications in todays market innovation occurs not ju st in product development whether in software or hardware but also in areas ch as integration and service delivery this may be an aspect of saas or use of social networking in communication with citizens etc as key purchasers of softwarebased systems public procurers can be prime movers in helping to bring innovative applic ations to market often such provider will be small local sme integrator working in tight niche market the oss business model may be particularly well tuned to such an approach because of its focus on shared development lead markets in which public agencies become early adopters of new technology have been discussed for some years and could also be means for promoting innovation through public procurement 3 results of publicfunded research should be widely available for many years governments have made im portant contributions to technology by funding basic software research when publ ic funds are used to support software research and development the innovations t h t r s u l t f r m t h i s w r k s h u l d b licensed in ways that take into account bo th the desirability of broadly sharing those advances as well as the desirability of applying those advances to commercialised products the dissemination of results broadly in this manner contributes to sustainable cycle of innovation in which government funding for basic research advances the set of knowledge available to the public while helping spur advances in commercial products these products in turn create the jobs profits and tax revenue necessary to fund future rounds of public research software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 39 4 removing onerous co ntract conditions currently the european software and services industry is heavily weighted in favour of small sme organisations yet current go vernment procurement practice is equally heavily weighted towards awarding contract s to large consortia andor with heavy financial penalties such an approach whilst understandable in the past needs to be reviewed in the light of new business models the move to softwareasaservice and the impact it is having on european suppliers 63 financing software innovation few people perceive the software industry as capital intensive yet access to capital is one of the major critical success factor s when it comes to speed of delivery factors such as packaging and gotomarket require much investment even if the early stage is the most critical capital is even more needed during the development stage for international expansion and acquisitions the european industry faces number of barriers here firstly venture capital markets in europe are less mature than in the us given that venture capital is needed to start businesses the european software industry is held back by lack of development finance ms comment strong statement which needs to be backed up by data secondly the software industry suffers from lack of appreciation by investors of intangible assets and misperceptions due to its resemblance to valueadd services industries thirdly europes riskaverse environment is not conducive to serial entrepreneurs in contrast to the dynamic investment environment of the united states these shortcomings could become even more challenging in the future as businesses strive to embrace software 2 0 while european software companies have traditionally been technologycentric so lution providers the global trend now is towards services many of them have already added the saas delivery model to their offering but heavy investment will be requi red to compete with more business and processoriented global players as the ma rket takes off against the background of the current credit crunch these investment demands will not be easy to meet and could soon escalate into crisis actions encourage investment in innovative companies with special attention to highgrowth companies the socalled gazelles this will help accelerate the adoption of softwarespecific measures by member states this in turn raises the need for single definition of innovative enterprise that would qualify for this sort of support ch companies should be innovation centric as opposed to rd centric under existing definitions and should also include medium size enterprises software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 40 benchmark and promote national public private funding schemes specific or adapted to the software sector so as to boost publicprivate funding in strategic innovation joint initiatives between government and private financial institutions appear to be the most efficient way to leverage public financing examples are found throughout the member states while at european level industryled joint technology initiatives jtis pool public and private at least 50 investment in areas where existing funding mechanisms cannot deliver the scale and speed needed benchmarking of these initiatives both within europe and outside can provide successful case studies and help to spread best practice create european software fund within the existing instrument run by the european investment fund the new high growth and innovative smes facility gif created within the co mpetitiveness and innovation framework programme cip funds venture funds that in turn invest in innovative smes this is relatively new and little known at present but critical mass will be important to attract investors and increase visibility of this instrument software suffers from big venture capital shortage and as strategic sector for europe public policy should make massive effort to correct the market failure the european software fund should be set up as separate facility within the gif with additional budget it would focus on investments below 250k implemented through vent ure funds investing in innovative smes as well as introducing investors to entrepreneurs the fund should also help software companies to asse ss their needs and get investor ready 7 challenge 3 shaping the future internet 71 the future internet an d the software industry over the last 30 years the internet has revolutionised our economy and society from an obscure academic network in the early 1980s the internet has grown into truly worldwide open infrastructure for information communication and commerce the internet is now central part of our lives in all sorts of ways and in many activities is displacing traditional channels as peoples first port of call it is the global network of the 21st century we are now witnessing the emergence of the next generation of the internet which will lead to wealth of new services and will have an even greater impact on society and the economy than the internet today in fact the future internet will be the essential part of europes future ict infr astructure which will be instrumental to fostering the internal market as well as to achieving the goals of the lisbon agenda and ensuring growth productivity and employment in europe the future of the european software industry is intimately bound to the future internet in that the industry will be founded on internetbased business models as well as software being fundamental enabler of the future internet the future internet is key feature of software 20 the webbased computing environment cloud computing opens range of new opportunities for innovation efficiencies and collaboration provided that the challenges for openness and standardisation of this new emerging internet platform software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 41 are met however the scope of the future internet is far broader than software and impacts all aspects of the ict market consequently our recommendations are concerned with the future internet rather than the software industry per more specifically we are concerned with abling european webservices based industry which will provide new markets nd new business models for the current software industry 72 overview of the future internet the future internet will be enabled by so ftware and will introduce dramatic changes in the economy over the next decade and it will unquestionably define europes future competitiveness the scope of the future internet can be characterised by the internet of services the internet of things and the network and data centre infrastructure services that underpin them the internet of services makes use of servic eoriented architecture soa flexible standardised architecture that allows var ious applications to be combined into interoperable services see annex 1 the in ternet of services also uses semantic technologies that understand the meaning of information and make content video audio print more accessible including by machine thus data from various sources and different formats can easily be combined and processed toward wealth of innovative webbased services in parallel things are becoming smarter the internet of things combines the power of ubiquitous networking connectivity with modern sensor technologies such as radio frequency identification rfid it merges the digital world with the physical world in the sense that information concer ning the identity location and condition of physical objects can be made available through the internet anytime and anywhere moreover these objects possess the capability to communicate with each other and therefore can become active participants in global business processes the internet of services and the internet of things represent very broad trends that will impact the european software industry more specifically it represents realisation of the technology trends describe d in section 4 in area s such as software asaservice saas cloud computing serviceoriented architecture soa and platform as service paas deverticalisat ion of the software industry will occur as result of soa and saas leading to the emergence of software systems assemblers and platform providers and of software component providers within the next decade people will use th eir computers completely differently to how they do today access to data app lications and content will be seamless and device agnostic internet connected devices are moving towards software infrastructure middleware applicat ion frameworks that enable them to consume and provide web services and thus participate both in the internet of things and internet of services core services components will be made available through service apis and protocols to create rich enduser experience mixing communication web and local tools these components could include realtime communications multimedia conferencing data sharing identificati on and authentication user and service profiles information search payment transactions and maps software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 42 73 impact on the european economy the impact of this future internet on the european economy and society will be significant the future internet will invigorate innovation resulting in tremendous productivity gains the benefits of these gains will be reflected most especially within the retail manufacturing logistics services and energy sectors according to industry experts rfid technologies could lead to efficiency enhancements of 40 in th luxury goods industry or even 100 in the food sector indeed rapid adop tion of the internet of things and services throughout the european economy could be instrumental in closing the productivity gap with the united states and secure european competitiveness in the years to come an other area for productivity gains is the adoption of collaborative tools fa cilitated by enterprise 20 and cloud computing approaches the future internet will shape the future of the services sector the future internet will undoubtedly become one of the major growth engines in all knowledgebased societies it will be business opportunity especially for startups and smes and could lead to the creation of highlevel jobs as services comprise twothirds of europe n g d p i t i s c l r t h t u r p c n only sustain economic growth and prosperity by developing strong web based services industries moreover webbased services developed in europe could easily be exported to global markets future internet will improve competitiveness servicebased approaches allow companies to cut costs and this will enable growth in particular by small businesses it used to be that every growing business would at some point have to make big investme nt in computers and software for accounting systems customer manageme nt systems email servers maybe even phone or video conferencing systems increasingly all of those services will be available via the network cloud and users will only pay for the services they use so small busine sses can scale up without making huge capital investments 31 by bringing sophisticated computer systems that were previously accessible only to larger players within the reach of small businesses cloud computing levels the playing field given that small businesses generate most of the jobs in the economy this is small trend the future internet will br ing disruptive technologies that will create tremendous business opportunities fo r the ict sector itself the world market for technologies products and pplications related to the internet of things alone is estimated at 776 billion by 2012 with average annual growth rates of almost 50 as explained above saas also presents major growth market platformasaservic could become major enabler for innovation especially by smaller it firms in europe see below 31 for instance the uk broadband stakeh olders group bbsg estimates the online model would save companies 350 year per person in support costs if 30 of sme st aff made the switch to cloud computing the savings across the uk would total 620m year software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 43 74 challenges for europe in the future internet there are many technical commercial and regulatory challenges in the development of the future internet not least of which is the development of shared vision these are being discussed and addressed in many fora within europe and internationally here we focus on those we believe are the most significant for europe generally and the software industry in particular 741 european infrastructure for the future internet the broad vision of the future internet is predicated on number of developments in the evolution of the underlying infrastructure ubiquitous and pervasive connectivity increasing the availability and predictability of highbandwidth for all users and the availability of ondemand c loud computing and storage resources whilst positive progress is being made in all aspects it is important to recognise that there are issues in each area that could impact the opportunities for growth in the european software industry they include openness is under threat as the web continues to increase in economic and social importance so the incentives fo r some economic operators to deviate from the currently prevailing open and co llaborative model are accentuated for example platforms based on closed and ve ndorspecific specifications that lock in customers thus denying them access to innovation from third parties and constraining the available market for those third parties or discrimination by internet service providers and network operators in favour of their own or affiliated applications and services over those offered by competitors fair nondiscriminatory transparent and competitive playing field that ensures consumer choice mu st be maintained so that endusers can reach the internet applications content and services they desire without anticompetitive discrimination or restrictions only then can the internet keep innovating and drive the economy giving consumers and enterprises greater choice at an affordable cost and delivering maximum benefit to the european and global economy major investments in infrastructure required driven by regulation the internet is increasingly critical component underpinning traditional industry value chains as well as the basis for entire ly new markets in the internets open ecosystem all parties depend on one another and the development of advanced internet access offerings to consumers nd businesses is essential for innovation by application and content providers moreover the unprecedented wave of innovation in internet applications nd content is driving user demand for significantly increased bandwidth consequently significant investment is now required in the development of the internet within europe in both core and access networks clear and consistent regulation will be essential to allow the necessary investment to be made on sound commercial basis and preserve the natural cycle of innovation and investment in the internet accountability of resource use the tcp protocol includes mechanisms to manage and counter the effects of tr affic congestion across the internet however there remain opportunities for i ndividuals and application providers to exploit the architecture and provide themselves access to network capacity that software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 44 results in degradation of the experience of others these typically manifest themselves through inconsiderate use of p2p udp whilst individuals citizens and businesses should be free to use the internet as they wish they should not be able to do this at the expense of ot hers ie they should be accountable for their use of internet resources the ietf is studying and developing responses to these issues but solutions will require uptake across the industry security of future internet infrastructure in addition to the connectivity afforded by the internet ondemand computing and storage resources in the form of cloud services are increasingly considered critical part of the future internet infrastructure the markets for these services have only just begun to emerge and there are significant opportunities for european companies to develop and capitalise on both in europe and globally however whilst there is significant operational infrastructure wi thin europe it is important for the commission to consider that europe is currently dependent on relatively few us companies for commercial control of th critical services moreover there are significant financial and regulatory barriers for any european company wishing to develop competing servic for example the varying planning regulations required to establish significant data centre sites actions the commission should support consistent regulatory environment across europe that allows for an adequate retu rn on the investment required to develop the necessary network infrastructure and that the return should reflect the risk premium the commission should support international activities to develop an internet control architecture that allows for fa ir and equal experience for all users of the future internet without discrimination and should promote its adoption across europe the commission should study further the european opportunities and requirements on cloud services in the future internet infrastructure to identify any potential barriers 742 the future internet as an open platform for innovation open standards are the guarantors of today s internet the internet is predominantly based on open standards for protocol and data formats notably tcp ip http and xmlhtml these standards give any and all users both internet access and the ability to create innovative content and offer innovative services on the internet moreover and crucially the most importan t internet standards are not just open they are also nonproprietary neither prior permission nor royalties are required to implement them this means that all hard ware software and service vendors can freely create products which interoperate perfectly with others across the internet this ability of different software applicat ions and services to access and exchange data via the internet to read and write the same file formats and to use the same protocols and open standards is the vita l condition for the continued development and dynamism of our increasingly networked world software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 45 moreover with significant cloud computing environment emerging policymakers should be vigilant of attempts to levera ge closed standards built on proprietary technologies protocols formats and progra mming technologies to the internet it is important that the internet logic and soft ware players industrywide demands for openness survive any potential pressure from players with other business models furthermore the internet industry has developed range of dynamic standards setting processes and it is important that 1 these processes remain open and transparent and 2 all players effectively implement web standards and do not fork agreed standards for instance by adding proprietary extensions that create facto closed standards actions public authorities should seek to ensure commitment from vendors to the interoperability of software products based on open nonproprietary standards the very foundation of the internet public authorities should ensure that public rd funding and public procurement reinforce the openness of the internet by funding and procuring open standards based products and solutions 743 accountability in the provision of composed internet services in the internet of services service accessed by an enduser through web interface or using dedicated device may rely on numerous internal services hosted by different parties the responsibility for the quality of service the security the reliability of the composed service will thus be shared by these parties the responsibility chain replicating the service invocation chain should be accessible to the enduser as well as some informatio n of the different actors involved actions the commission should encourage the emergence of quality label and appropriate referencing of the elementary services available in the internet of services this should be based on functional and nonfunctional requirements availability guarantees of persistence of the service legal information of the service provider location of the data hosted by the service conformance to privacy protection schemes and may lead to the creation of repositories of critical services hosted by third parties by delegation similar to what is done today regarding domain names promote the emergence of european trusted third parties to authenticate users and services providers in the future internet and to enable access rights management on individual or composite services this would be key step in protecting service providers against fra ud or illegitimate uses and users from undue access to their data software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 46 8 conclusions 81 rebooting europes software industry in concluding firstly we wish to than k the commission and the commissioner for inviting an open debate on the future of europes software industry wideranging and probing analysis within field th at up to now has lacked clear policy framework is long overdue the issues are complex and often the discussion has been highly charged while we have been unable to agree in all areas we are united in our desire to see the european software industry succeed although some of us would have wished to have gone further the challenges we have identified are real and significant and warrant serious attention from both the industry and from policymakers our investigation comes at pivotal mome nt for the software industry worldwide traditional business models are breaking do wn the sector itself is globalised technology evolution is opening up many new possibilities and customer demands for and expectations of software are changing fundamentally whichever camp people sit in they will have to change what is required is new spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship in software we must nurture attract and retain the top talent the best programmers managers entrepreneurs wherever it is to be found we must build innovative capacity and create ecosystems best suited to the indus trys particular innovation model and we must drive coherent european approach to the future internet to which the future of the software industry is intimately bound with determination and common vision we in europe can seize these opportunities and establish top posi tions in the market for software and services that is now emerging we must enable european webservices based industry software 20 which will provide major new markets and new business models for software the time has come to press the reset button and reboot europes software industry 82 the role of policy first and foremost it will be the responsib ility of the european software vendors to exploit this potential indeed we strongly believe that the sector should continue to be marketdriven and that regulatory intervention should be kept to the minimum and limited to addressing market failures however eu policymakers have role to play to ensure favourable environment for both the development of strong european software industry and the adoption of software by enterprises consum ers and administrations in europe recommendations in relevant areas were presented above and are not repeated here rather we take the opportunity to set out some principles for action and to comment on other issues which seem relevant to us policies must be model neutral we repeat again that any policy measures should be neutral with respect to technology vendor and the underlying software 20 rebooting eu ropes software industry 47 software and business models given the dynamic development of new technologies and business models polic ies that are designed to foster specific technologies or software and business models could hinder innovation and distort competition rather policymakers should ensure levelplaying field and favourable vironment for all market players in this respect the european commission should help to address the bottlenecks for the growth of the wh ole european software industry that were identified in the previous sections toward trulyfunctioning internal market obviously one of the major stumbling blocks for the development of strong european software industry is the fragmented market st ructure in europe national markets differ significantly in terms of regulation ipr labour law and so forth we have not addressed these issues in detail against this background we would like to encourage the commission to launch an empirical study to analyse the specific barriers for an internal market for software in the eu and propose policy measures to address them lowering barriers to trade the eu in its trade policy should ensure fair access for european software vendors to third markets this in particular holds true for it security policies such s i n c h i n i n t h i s r s p c t t h commission should deepen the engagement to break the existing market access barriers share models of info rmation assurance and promote eu third country collaborations raising visibility of the eu ropean software industry while there is an increasing awareness among european policy makers about the growing importance of ict for society and the ec onomy the role of software in this context is often overlooked we therefore recommend that any european software strategy should strive to raise the visibility of the european software industry otherwise the impact of such strategy especially with respect to adoption of proposed measures in eu member states will be rather limited we particularly propose to closely link the european software strategy with the eu stimulus packages the new lisbon strategy and the eu programmes related to energy efficiency annex 1 list of participants to be added
