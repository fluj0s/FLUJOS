from ben santer santer1llnlgov to pjonesueaacuk subject re fwd data availability date mon 02 feb 2009 100255 0800 replyto santer1llnlgov xflowed dear phil yes this is the same geoff smith who wrote to do you know who he is from his comments about the rms he seems to be brit in his email to you mr smith notes that there is strong case to be made that intermediate results eg collation of such data and the relevant code should be made available in studies such as this one since there is an important possibility of errors in trying to replicate such collation this is key point douglass et already audited our collation of the primary temperature data ie our calculation of synthetic msu temperatures as ive already told mr smith douglass et obtained synthetic msu temperatures very similar to the ones published in our ijoc paper mr smith does not understand this nor does he understand that the algorithms used to calculate synthetic msu temperatures from raw model temperature data have already been published and documented in the peerreviewed literature i think it would be useful to raise these issues with paul hardaker cheers ben pjonesueaacuk wrote ben is this the smith who has emailed why does he think youve not informed your coauthors that youve made the data available most odd though he does accept that the raw data was already there pity that loads of people on ca including mcintyre didnt seem to accept or realise this im not on an rms committee at the moment but i could try and contact paul hardaker if you think it might be useful possibly need to explain what is raw and what is intermediate i wasnt going to give this guy smith the satisfaction of reply cheers phil original message subject data availability from smithg smithg49starhubnetsg date sun february 1 2009

15 november 2008 pages 17031722 as you are coauthor of the referenced paper you may be interested to know of developments in case you have not heard already you will be aware that intermediate data monthly model data 49 series used for statistical analysis in santer et 2008 or link to url with file of the data as used it the paper had been requested from the first author dr santer refusal has been posted on line but in the meantime the data is now available at http wwwpcmdillnlgovprojectsmsuindexphp perhaps you had this data already but other coauthors have reportedly claimed earlier they did not have the data typical reported response to foia request was i have examined my files and have monthly time series from climate models used in the paper referred to and correspondence regarding said time series one disputes dr santers claim that the primary model data is publicly available but there is strong case to be made that intermediate results eg collation of such data and the relevant code should be made available in studies such as this one since there is an important possibility of errors in trying to replicate such collation the archiving of such intermediate results is required for econometrics journals among others it is further reported on line that the posting of the data was not pursuant to an foia order but posted voluntarily although likely at the request of the funding agency the department of energy office of science i hope other scientists will take this type of voluntary action you may have heard that professor hardaker the ceo of the royal meteorological society which publishes the international journal of climatology has confirmed the issue of data archiving will be on the agenda for the next meeting of the societys scientific publishing committee there is need for journals as well as funding agencies and publishing scientists themselves to establish and enforce good data and code archiving policies more precise definition of recorded factual material commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to validate research findings is probably overdue i hope the hadley centre will take lead in this issue from time to time ill look at the progress on archiving but in the meantime reply is necessary kind regards geoff smith dear prof jones ref santer et consistency of modelled and observed temperature trends
