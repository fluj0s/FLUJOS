policies the lagos government has continued the countrys export oriented economic strategy the economy registered positive growth rates from the mid1980s through 1998 but contracted in 1999 because of the asian economic crisis in 2000 the economy rebounded but economic growth slowed in 2001 and in 2002 because of the global and regional economic slowdown economic growth is forecast to increase by 35 in 2003 and 45 in 2004 fueled by improvement in consumer and investor confidence and chiles trade liberalization efforts us relations with chile which improved considerably with the nations return

million chile returned to democratic rule in 1990 after 17 years of military government under general augusto pinochet since then chiles democratic transition civilmilitary relations have been tense at times the arrest of pinochet in london by british authorities in 1998 underscored political divisions in chile that have endured since the general stepped down as president in 1990 nevertheless chilean democracy appears to have emerged stronger with the civilian government more firmly in charge of the military the current administration of president ricardo lagos inaugurated in march 2000 to sixyear term after close runoff election is chiles third elected government since the return to civilian rule president lagos socialist was the candidate of the ruling centerleft coalition of parties for democracy or concertacion that has ruled since the countrys return to democracy in tight race he defeated joaquin lavin of the rightist alliance for chile or alianza by margin of 513 to 487 lagos succeeded christian democrat eduardo frei who had been elected president in december 1993 prior to that in march 1990 christian democrat patricio alywin became the first democratically elected president inaugurated since the military violently overthrew the government of president allende socialist in september 1973 at the time of the 1973 coup chile was deeply divided president allende had initiated program of nationalizing banks and private industries including us owned copper mining companies which ultimately led to severe economic deterioration marked by runaway inflation food shortages and increasing political violence by both government opponents and supporters in the aftermath of the coup the military regime was responsible for widespread human rights violations including the execution or disappearance of thousands of chileans an official truth and reconciliation commission in chile reported in 1996 that there had been 3197 cases of murders and disappearances committed during pinochets rule1 this does not account for the thousands of cases of torture that allegedly took place under military rule according to the department of states human rights report covering 2002 the chilean government especially the judiciary 1 pinochet era toll latin american weekly report september 5 1996 p 408 chile panel issues final pinochet regime death toll charlotte observer august 23 1996 p 20a crs2 has taken significant steps to allow for the investigation of human rights abuses committed under military rule the report noted however that military authorities were unwilling or unable to provide full accounting for the fate of many of the over 3000 persons who disappeared or were killed since 1992 survivors of the victims have received over 96 million in assistance such as pensions and educational benefits from the chilean government according to the human rights report chile is governed under 1980 constitution written by the former military government and approved by referendum that includes provisions to protect the interests of the military although technically subordinate to the president the military acts with considerable autonomy as noted above although chile has weathered the transition to democracy civilmilitary relations have been tense at times in 1995 civilmilitary relations were strained over the imprisonment of two highranking military officers for the 1976 assassination in washington dc of chilean opposition leader orlando letelier and his us aide ronni moffitt pinochets 1998 arrest and its effect on chilean politics the october 1998 arrest of pinochet in london on human rights violations initially prompted sometimes violent street demonstrations by thousands of chileans on both sides of the issue exacerbating political schisms in chile that had not been evident to such degree since the countrys return to democracy pinochet who ruled chile from 1973 until 1990 had resigned as military commander in march 1998 but was immediately sworn in as lifelong senator under the constitution after his arrest in london british court eventually ruled that pinochet as former head of state was not immune from prosecution and could be extradited to spain to face charges for human rights atrocities committed in chile but pinochet was allowed to return home to chile in march 2000 because of his deteriorated health2 within days of returning to chile however pinochet faced numerous charges against him in chilean courts for human rights violations during his rule in august 2000 chiles supreme court stripped pinochet of his immunity as lifelong senator for prosecution in 1973 case known as the caravan of death in which 19 persons disappeared3 many observers viewed the action as victory for chilean democracy president lagos stated that the indictment should be interpreted as an expression of what is happening in the country the strengthening of the democratic system4 while chilean court ultimately ruled in july 2001that pinochet was mentally unfit to stand trial the stripping of his immunity was an important precedent for the countrys political system pinochet ultimately resigned his position as senatorfor life in july 2002 2 for background on legal proceedings in great britain see crs report rl30117 pinochet extradition case selected legal issues by david m ackerman 3 us

absence during the countrys presidential elections in december 1999 and january 2000 in sense freed chilean politics from the long shadow that the general had usually cast on elections since the return to democracy the candidate of the rightist alianza coalition joaquin lavin broke with hardcore pinochet supporters in an attempt to appeal to centrist voters and even went so far as to agree with his opponent that pinochet and other military officers involved in human rights abuses should be prosecuted by chilean courts5 lavins reinvention of the chilean right contributed in part to his strong showing in the election and made him potentially strong contender in the next presidential election in 2005 chilean congress chileans went to the polls on december 16 2001 to elect all 120 members of the chamber of deputies the lower house of chiles national congress and 18 of the 38 elected members of chiles senate while the ruling concertacion coalition maintained its control of the chamber of deputies its representation declined from 70 to 63 seats the big loser in concertacion was the centrist christian democratic party pdc whose representation fell from 38 seats to 24 seats the opposition rightist alianza coalition won 57 seats in the lower house the big winner in alianza was the independent democratic union udi the party of joaquin lavin currently the mayor of santiago whose representation grew from 22 seats to 35 seats making it the party with the largest number of seats in the chamber of deputies in 2002 corruption scandal led to six deputies having their voting rights suspended 5 from concertacion and 1 from alianza but this did not jeopardize the ruling coalitions control of the lower chamber by 5856 margin in the current congress the concertacion coalition has deputies from the centrist pdc and three leftist parties the party for democracy ppd the socialist party ps of president lagos and the social democratic radical party prsd the rightist alianza coalition has deputies from the udi and the national renovation party rn in the senate as result of the elections there is now relative balance of power between concertacion and the alianza coalitions with each having 24 seats the now 48member senate consists of 38 elected seats 20 of these were chosen in the december 1997 elections and 18 were chosen in the december 2001 elections 9 seats that are appointed for 8year terms and one lifelong seat for former president frei as noted above former president pinochet had lifelong seat but resigned this in july 2002 corruption scandals in late 2002 and early 2003 series of corruption scandals shook the lagos government and political parties across the spectrum the scandals involved the theft of some 110 million from chiles business development bank influence peddling by chilean legislators and kickbacks to senior management of government agencies on government contracts6 as noted above the scandals resulted in the suspension of six deputies in congress more significantly the 5 sebastian rotella chile elects first socialist leader since 73 coup angeles times january 17 2000 6 jon jeter spate of scandals sullies chile squeakyclean reputation

aim of modernizing chiles institutions and increasing transparency in government the goal is for congress to approve package of 49 bills by the end of the year involving host of state modernization political transparency and proeconomic growth measures7 economic conditions chile is generally recognized as latin americas bestperforming market economy and is viewed by many as model for the successful implementation of marketoriented economic reform measures the government of president ricardo lagos has continued the countrys exportoriented economic strategy the economy registered positive growth rates from the mid1980s through 1998 averaging real growth rate of 8 annually but contracted in 1999 by 11 this was due in large part to the asian economic crisis that reduced demand for chiles exports in key export markets and because of the crisis role in lowering the world price of copper chiles main export commodity which accounts for about 40 of export earnings in 2000 the economy rebounded with growth rate of 54 but economic growth slowed to 31 in 2001 and 21 in 2002 because of the global and regional economic slowdown economic growth is forecast to increase by 35 in 2003 and 45 in 2004 fueled by improvement in consumer and investor confidence and chiles trade liberalization efforts8 despite recent banking and government contract scandals chiles economic fundamentals remain sound and there is political consensus in the country to maintain liberal market economy and prudent fiscal and monetary policies the countrys relatively high domestic savings rate nearly 21 in 2002 fostered in part by mandatory retirement contributions administered by private pension fund management firms9 is the highest in the western hemisphere which reduces chiles dependence on shortterm foreign capital compared to countries with lower savings rates under both military and civilian rule chile has pursued an exportled growth strategy although copper is still the dominant export chile has diversified its export sector and major exports now include fish forestry products fruit and wine the economy remains somewhat vulnerable however because of its reliance on the export of primary products the country ran trade deficits from 19961998 yet has 7 chile outlook for 200304 domestic politics economist intelligence unit chile country report may 2003 8 chile outlook for

tariff over several years from 11 to current level of 6 beginning in january 2003 chiles foreign trade is diversified among many partners including asia the european union and latin america in addition to the united states which was the market for about 20 of chiles exports and the origin of almost 15 of its imports11 as part of its export growth strategy chile has pursued free trade negotiations with several countries in addition to that concluded with the united states in december 2002 and is an active participant in negotiations for free trade area of the americas ftaa in 1996 chile signed bilateral free trade agreements with both canada and mexico and in 2002 it concluded negotiations for free trade agreements with south korea and the european union in 1996 chile signed an

pacific rim region critics of the pinochet regime 19731990 argued that the gap between rich and poor had widened under military rule because the state dismantled many public services since the return to civilian rule the government has increased social spending and introduced numerous programs targeted at reducing poverty according to the department of state the poverty rate decreased from 45 in 1987 to 206 in 200112 uschilean relations uschilean relations which improved considerably with the nations return to democracy in 1990 are close and are characterized by strong commercial ties and

status of bilateral negotiations for free trade agreement the issue of advanced combat fighter sales to chile and chiles privately administered pension system which president bush suggested might provide some lessons for the modernization of the us social security system13 in the aftermath of 911 chile joined other latin american nations in strongly condemning the terrorist attacks on new york and washington14 at special session on september 19 2001 oas members invoked the 1947 interamerican treaty of reciprocal assistance also known as the rio treaty which obligates signatories of the treaty to come to one anothers defense in case of outside attack when the united states commenced military action in afghanistan president lagos firmly backed the action and reiterated chiles solidarity and support for the united states15 during the crisis with iraq chiles seat on the security council heightened the countrys international prominence chiles opposition to second security council resolution sponsored by the united states the united kingdom and spain authorizing the use of force to disarm iraq brought criticism from us officials chile had announced its decision to oppose the second resolution which reflected the opinion of many latin american nations but ultimately the resolution was withdrawn before being voted upon in other recent activities in international fora chile has been on the same side as the united states for example it backed attempts to produce strong resolution against the recent cuban human rights crackdown in the commission on human rights unchr and the organization of american states oas chile has also been one of the six friends of venezuela which also includes the united states that have been supporting the efforts of the oas secretary general in facilitating resolution to the political crisis in venezuela there had been concern in chile about the negative effect of chiles iraq position on relations with the united states especially over the delay in the signing the bilateral free trade agreement which originally was to be signed in april 2003 but in the aftermath of the signing of free trade agreement in june

potential free trade agreement for chile such an agreement is viewed as an important means to continue the countrys exportoriented growth strategy for the united states although free trade with chile is of relatively minor economic importance the agreement could be further step on the road to hemispheric free trade in 2002 us exports to chile amounted to 26 billion making chile the 34th largest us export market major exports included computer and office equipment construction equipment telecommunications equipment and transportation equipment us imports from chile in 2002 amounted to almost 38 billion making chile the 36th largest source of us imports major imports included copper seafood especially salmon wood and wood products fruit especially grapes and wine from 1989 until 2000 the united states ran trade surplus with chile with the largest surplus of 2 billion registered in 1997 but in 2001 and 2002 the united states ran trade deficit with chile with the 2002 deficit approaching 12 billion18 while the united states is an important trade partner for chile accounting for about 20 of chiles exports and 15 of chiles imports the country has other significant partners in europe asia and latin america19 initially chile was invited to become part of the north american free trade agreement nafta in 1994 but the clinton administration was unable to secure congressional approval for fast track negotiating authority chile indicated that it would not start negotiations without such authority later in november 2000 the clinton administration announced that the two countries would pursue bilateral free trade agreement and chile withdrew its insistence that the administration secure fast track authority before the beginning of negotiations negotiations began in december 2000 and while there was some expectation that negotiations would be completed within year number of issues stretched out the negotiation process topics at issue in the negotiations included market access chiles price band system on some agricultural commodities labor and environmental provisions and enforcement intellectual property rights and investor state disputes 16 chile sees

bilateral free trade agreement in december 2002 the agreement was signed on june 6 2003 in miami by united states trade representative robert zellick and chilean foreign minister maria soledad alvear valenzuela paving the way for the congresses of both countries to consider the agreement if approved the fta would enter into force on january 1 2004 at the signing of the agreement united states trade representative robert zoellick asserted that the uschile fta is an historic agreement that sets high benchmark for future ftas he maintained that the agreement slashes tariffs and quotas reduces barriers for services protects leadingedge intellectual property keeps pace with new technologies and new ways of doing business ensures regulatory transparency and promotes labor and environmental protections20 under the agreement more than 85 of trade in consumer and industrial products would be tarifffree immediately with most remaining tariffs lifted within 4 years in the agriculture sector about 75 of farm goods would be tarifffree within 4 years with all tariffs and quotas phased out in 12 years21 the international trade commission issued report on the fta in june 2003 and concluded that the economywide effects on us trade production and economic welfare of the ftas tariff reductions are likely to be negligible to very small in looking at specific economic sectors the itc report concluded that increased import competition from chile would include dairy products textiles apparel and leather products and agricultural products such as avocados prepared and preserved fruit and methanol increased us exports to chile would include transportation equipment and machinery exports textiles apparel and leather products and coal oil and gas motor vehicles and telecommunications equipment22 us congressional action in the united states congress considered implementing legislation for the agreement under socalled fasttrack procedures the house approved hr 2738 the united stateschile free trade implementation act on july 24 2003 by vote of 270156 and the senate approved the measure on july 31 by vote of 6631 supporters of the uschile fta in the united states made several policy arguments advocating the agreement they maintained that the agreement would have significant impact on us relations with latin america and would demonstrate that the united states is committed to the region countering critics who have complained that the united states is neglecting the region they also argued that the chile fta could increase momentum for completing negotiations for the regionwide free trade area of the americas supporters of the agreement also 20 united states and chile sign historic agreement us department of state international information programs washington file june 6 2003 21 ibid 22 us international trade commission uschile free trade agreement potential economywide and selected sectoral effects usitc publication 3605 june 2003 crs9 argued that the agreement would be significant for us business because of the elimination of tariff barriers to the chilean market as well as the elimination of chiles price band system on agricultural commodities such as wheat and flour they maintained that the agreement would eliminate the disadvantage that us companies in chile have compared to the companies of other countries that have free trade agreements with chile such as canada and the european union some supporters also lauded recent agreement by chile to accept us meat processing standards for beef pork and lamb although the agreement was not part of the fta it was prompted by some members of congress who said that failure to reach such an agreement could have threatened support of the fta in the us congress23 finally another argument made by some supporters is that the agreement would help spur more reform in chile in such areas as transparent rules for contracting services the protection of intellectual property rights and enforcement of labor and environmental standards critics of the free trade agreement with chile also set forth several policy arguments some members while believing that the labor and environmental enforcement provisions of the chile agreement were acceptable because chile has acceptable domestic standards feared that such provisions could be become models for free trade agreements with other countries that do not have adequate labor or environmental standards specifically some opposed the use of the chile ftas environmental and labor provisions as model for the uscentral america free trade agreement cafta currently being negotiated24 some members who ended up voting for the uschile fta warned that they would not support it as model for ftas with other nations that do not have high labor and environmental standards us labor organizations such as the aflcio called on congress to reject the chile agreement because they viewed it as step backward from the labor provisions set forth in the usjordan free trade agreement and the generalized system of preferences25 they criticized the chile fta for only having enforceable labor provisions related to countrys enforcement of its own labor laws not sanctions for failing to enforce labor or environmental laws in order to gain competitive advantage or sanctions to deny trade benefits if countries are not taking steps to afford internationally recognized worker rights some critics of the chile fta also argued that the united states trade representative overstepped its negotiating authority by including immigration provisions in the agreement they opposed the agreements because of provisions allowing more foreign professional workers into the united states chilean action on the fta the chilean congress which delayed its consideration of the agreement until the us congress took action is expected to vote on the measure by late october or early november 2003 the procedure in the chilean congress is for the agreement to be referred to joint special committee and 23 uschile mean inspection could lead to modest export gains inside us trade june 13 2003 24 see crs report rl31870 the

2003 crs10 then for both houses the chamber of deputies and the senate to vote on the measure there appears to be broad support for the fta in chile the chilean business community has been especially supportive of the bilateral agreement and leaders in the two major political coalitions concertacion and alianza support the accord nevertheless there has been some criticism from chilean farmers environmental groups and some politicians some 30 representatives in chiles bicameral congress both from the right and the left reportedly have warned that unless some protection is afforded to traditional chilean farmers who produce for the internal market that they will likely vote against the agreement26 for some 200000 small farmers in southern chile who produce such products as wheat dairy products beef and beets for the internal market the trade agreement will reportedly be disastrous chiles southern agriculture consortium cas which represents farmers in southern chile maintains that because of the climate the farmers do not have the option of growing alternative crops if their markets disappear27 some chilean environmental groups such as sustainable chile and the terram foundation criticize the free trade agreement because they believe it will result in downward pressure on chilean environmental standards instead of providing mechanism to elevate standards28 environmental and labor conditions in chile although chile faces significant environmental problems because of past insufficient attention in the countrys rush toward development the chilean government has been working since 1994 to establish regulations and enforcement mechanisms29 the governments national environmental commission conama established in 1990 coordinates other agencies with regard to the environment and promotes environmental policies in the country conama is responsible for implementation of 1994 environmental framework law which includes setting regulations and standards and monitoring enforcement its priorities include air pollution and the regulation of liquid and toxic waste under the environmental framework law environmental impact studies are required

and infrastructure projects in the country for example us company savia international in august 2000 withdrew its proposal for 200 million project to tap 103000 hectares of natural forests while in february 2001 another us company boise cascade pulled out of 160 million project to build board manufacturing plant and deepwater port32 in other cases environmental groups have been active in supporting conservation projects including the highprofile nature reserve project of us businessman douglas tompkins in july 2001 the chilean government and tompkins resolved dispute and agreed to create the continents largest nature sanctuary in southern chile for over decade tompkins spent millions buying parcels of land to piece together the 700000 acre pumalin park but the project met strong opposition from some chilean business interests and others who feared such extensive involvement in chile by americans some observers maintain that one reason the chilean government went ahead with the project was because of its desire to reach free trade agreement with the united states approval of the project would demonstrate that the government is environmentally responsible33 with regard to worker rights for the most part chile has enjoyed calm labor relations since the countrys return to democracy and the climate for collective bargaining has improved over the past decade the government is signatory to all international labor organization ilo core conventions on worker rights34 about 10 of the countrys work force is unionized until 2001 labor code provisions made it difficult for trade unions to organize in many sectors but the chilean congress approved major labor reform bill that went into force in december 2001 that loosened restrictions on participating in unions and collective bargaining chiles unified workers central cut which represents the countrys five major labor confederations strongly supported the legislation the lagos government deemed the labor reform crucial for its negotiation of free trade agreement with the united states 31 chile governments environmental agenda includes santiago transport emission trading plans international

statement crs12 sale of combat fighter aircraft for several years significant issue in bilateral relations has been the potential sale of advanced combat fighter aircraft to chile in august 1997 after review of us security policy in latin america the clinton administration announced that the president had decided to establish process for casebycase consideration of requests for advanced arms transfers to latin american nations35 an earlier sign of this policy change had occurred in march 1997 when the clinton administration allowed us aircraft companies lockheed martin and mcdonnell douglas now boeing to provide technical data to chile on its combat planes the chilean air force wanted to buy the fighter aircraft as part of program to replace is current fleet of 2030 year old planes because of budget cutbacks however chile postponed decision on such sales until late december 2000 when it announced that it would purchase 1012 f16s from lockheed martin in order to modernize its military aircraft in the next step of the process in accordance with the terms of the arms export control act the administration submitted justification of the sale to congress in june 2001 which gave congress the opportunity to disapprove the sale by enactment of joint resolution according to press reports the bush administration had reached an agreement with senate democrats that allowed the sale to go forward as long it did not include advanced mediumrange airtoair missiles amraam which some senators feared would spark an arms race in the region36 preliminary agreement was reached between the chilean military and lockheed martin in november 2001 for the purchase of 10 f16 fighter jets and in late january 2002 president lagos decided to go ahead with the purchase reportedly worth 660 million with delivery of the planes in 200637 before the president made his decision he ordered new review of the sale to be conducted by the newly appointed defense minister michelle bachelet the first female defense minister who concluded that the planes were needed to modernize the armed forces in light of economic difficulties facing chile and the region some in chile called for postponement of the sale the rightist udi asked the government to postpone the sale for 3 years38 in addition some concern was raised by other south american countries such as peru who reportedly fear military buildup in the region chiles defense ministry responded that the purchase was not the beginning of an arms buildup in the region but means of replacing obsolete military equipment the
