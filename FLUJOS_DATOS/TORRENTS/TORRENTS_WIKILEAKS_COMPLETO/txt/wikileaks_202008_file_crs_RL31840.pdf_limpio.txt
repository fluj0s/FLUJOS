cong 2nd sess sdoc 10128 1992 p 480congressional budget resolutions motions to instruct conferees background the congressional budget act of 1974 re quires the house and senate to reach agreement on at least one budget resolution each year1 in most years the house and senate initially pa ss separate versions of budget resolution and then resolve their differences through regular conference procedures but sometimes the differences have been resolved by means of the two chambers formally exchanging amendments when conference procedure is use d both the house and the senate have procedures whereby the full bodies may issue instructions to conferees on legislation2 conferees are expected generally to uphold the positions reflected in the legislation that was passed by the chamber they represent motions to instruct the conferees usually urge them to support pa rticular positions taken by their chamber or urge them to oppose particular positions taken by the other chamber at the same time it is understood that conferees must make concessions in order to reach final compromise it is not uncommon therefore for instructions to urge conferees of one chamber to recede to one or more positions of the other chamber if motion or resolution instructing conferees is agreed to the instructions are not binding on the conferees and point of order would lie against the conference report on the ground that the instructions had been violated3 as one scholar has noted conferees may disregard the instructions particularly when they feel the need for room to maneuver or compromise the

their instructions or authority4 instructions to conferees on budget re solution usually are issued in the form of motion but in at least one instance the senate adopted simple resolution containing such instructions house and senate practices the practices of the house and senate regarding motions to instruct budget resolution conferees differ markedly in key respects some of these differences are discussed below in terms of the frequency and number of motions and the prerogative to offer such motions several additiona l procedural issues also are discussed frequency of motions the house resorts to such motions regularly while the senate uses them only occasionally as table 1 shows the house considered 18 such motions in 15 of the last 19 year s covering fy1991fy2009 the table lists another motion for fy2005 that member announced he would offer but the house vitiated the motion before it was c onsidered accordingly it is not reflected in the count the house regularly used such motions in earlier years as well with regard to the four years in whic h the house did not consider motion to instruct conferees the house and senate di d not both appoint conferees in three years for

prerogative of the minority party in 13 of the 14 instances identified in table 1 when only one motion was c onsidered the motion was made by the ranking minority member of the house budget committee in the remaining instance the motion was made by another member of the minority party with regard to the fy2005 budget resolution all four of the motions considered were offered by members of the minority party two of them serving on the house budget committee the fifth motion which was not considered by the house also was offered by member of the minority party motion to instruct conferees
