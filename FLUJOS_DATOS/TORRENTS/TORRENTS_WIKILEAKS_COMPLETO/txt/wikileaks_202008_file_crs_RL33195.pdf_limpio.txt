yeh american law division december 14 2005 abstract the united states supreme court will hear oral argument this term in appeals from two state supreme court cases hammon v indiana and davis v washington concerning the admissibility of excited utterance statements made by nontestifying witnesses at criminal trials in the landmark crawford v washington case in 2004 the court held that the sixth amendments confrontation clause forbids hearsay testimonial evidence from being introduced against the accused unless the witness is unavailable to testify and the defendant has had prior opportunity to crossexamine the witness however the crawford court declined to provide comprehensive deﬁnition of testimonial leaving such task for another day this omission has caused state and federal courts to struggle over which outofcourt statements are testimonial for purposes of triggering the crawford requirements the confusion has arisen most often in cases involving outofcourt statements made by nontestifying witnesses to investigating police oﬃcers at crime scene or during 911 emergency calls these excited utterance statements have traditionally been admitted into evidence under an exception to the hearsay exclusionary rules followed by courts however since crawford the lower courts have disagreed over whether spontaneous utterances are considered testimonial statements subject to the sixth amendments crossexamination mandate these two cases oﬀer the court an opportunity to resolve this uncertainty by more clearly explaining what constitutes testimonial statements the outcome has the potential to impact signiﬁcantly the strategy and method of prosecuting criminal cases particularly the use of outofcourt accusations against defendants in domestic violence and

onfrontation clause background the rules of evidence and hearsay the rules of evidence govern the use of evidence1 in civil and criminal judicial pro ceedings courts apply these rules when determining what types of evidence such as testimony and tangible objects may be admitted at trial in the federal court system the federal rules of evidence fre2 are followed while many state and local courts have adopted their own rules that often closely llel the federal ones hearsay is particular type of evidence hearsay is prior outofcourt statement of declarant3 affirmatively offered at trial either orally by another person or in written form in order to prove the truth of the matter asserted4 under the fre hearsay evidence is inadmissible unless it falls within one of the numerous exceptions to the hearsay rules5 one reason for the general prohibition on hearsay is to minimize the danger of unreliable evid ence from being introduced at trial since hearsay is the statement of person who is not testifying at trial under oath and not subject to crossexamination the relia bility of the evidence is questionable excited utterances if an outofcourt statement was made under certain circumstances that help to ensure its reliability it may be admissible evidence even though it is hearsay one such exception to the hearsay exclusionary rule is statement that qualifies as an excited utterance the fre defines an excited utterance as statement relating to startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excite ment caused by the event or condition6 the underlying rationale of this exception is th at such spontaneous statement is likelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33195crs2 7 see crawford v washington 541 us 36 58 n8 2004 explaining that at common law historically spontaneous d eclaration was potentially admissi ble only if the statement was made immediately upon the hurt received and before the declarant had time to devise or contrive any thing

case see crs report rs21888 confrontation clause reshaped crawford v washington by estela i velez pollack 13 crawford 541 us at 51 14 id citation omitted this example by the crawford court suggests that the constitutional right to confrontation may not pply to declarants hearsay statement to bystander and other individuals who are not agents of the governmentto be truthful since the shocked declarant had time to reflect and deliberate before making it7 the confrontation clause and crawford v washington the sixth amendment to the united states constitution provides that in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him8 the purpose of the confrontation clause is to prevent depositions or ex parte affidavits from being used against the defendant in lieu of personal examination and crossexamination of the witness in which the accused has an opportunity not only of testing the recollection and sifting the conscience of the witness but of compelling him to stand face to face with the jury in order that they may look at him and judge by his demeanor upon the stand and the manner in which he gives his testimony whether he is worthy of belief9 although the confrontation clause aims to protect similar values as the hearsay rules they do not overlap completely so evidence that might be admissible under hearsay exception may be found to violat the defendants constitutional right of confrontation while an outofcourt stat ement that is erroneously admitted in violation of the exclusionary rule may not necessarily be deni of the defendants sixth amendment rights10 in march 2004 the us supreme court in crawford v washington11 had the opportunity to interpret the meaning of th phrase witnesses against as it appears in the confrontation clause12 the court determined that the phrase encompasses more than just those individuals who actually testify at trial but also includes anyone who bears testimony13 in turn testimony is typically solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact an accuser who makes formal statement to government officers bears testimony in sense that person who makes casual remark to an acquaintance does not14 thus not all hearsay implicates the sixth amendment s core concerns but an outofcourthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33195crs3 15 id however

concurring 21 united states v brito 427 f3d 53 55 1st cir 2005statement that is testimonial would trigge r the defendants right to be confronted with the witnesses against him15 according to the court examples of testimonial statements include at minimum prior testimony offered at preliminary hearing or before grand jury formal statements made in response to police interrogations and sworn affidav its and depositions16 in landmark decision the crawford court announced the new guiding principle applicable to the rules of evid ence in criminal trial the confrontation clause bars the introduction into evidence of hearsay testimonial statements in criminal prosecution unless th declarant is unavailable17 and the defendant has had prior opportunity to crossexamine the declarant only if tes timonial statements made by outofcourt declarants are tested i n the crucible of crossexamination may such evidence be admitted in criminal trial wit hout violating the defendants confrontation rights18 unfortunately the crawford court expressly stated that it would leave for another day any effort to spell out co mprehensive definition of testimonial19 this refusal to articulate precise definition of key term left the late chief justice william rehnquist joined by justice sa ndra day oconnor to observe in concurring opinion the thousands of federal prosecutors and the tens of thousands of state prosecutors need answers as to what be yond the specific kinds of testimony the court lists is covered by the new rule they need them now not months or years from now rules of criminal evidence are applied every day in courts throughout the country and parties should not be left in the dark in this manner20 this assessment of the consequences of the courts deferra l appears to have been prescient in the time since crawford federal and state c ourts have struggled and disagreed over the meaning of testimonial this miasma of uncertainty21 has arisen most often in cases involving out ofcourt statements ma by nontestifying witnesses to investigating police officers at an alleged crime scene or during tapehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33195crs4 22 although these statements are offered most frequently in domestic violence cases they may also be introduced in murder robbery burglary and assault prosecutions leonard post eyes on clarifying cra wford thousands of ca ses

domestic violence prosecutions because the offenders id entity is often not readily apparent from the physical evidence or because the perpetrator may try to ascribe the victims injuries to fall or some other innocent accidentrecordings of 911 emergency calls22 until crawford was handed down such statements would probably have been admissible under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule applying crawford to excited utterances howev er has divided courts across the country into three categories some finding excited utterances nontestimonial and thus admissible under the hearsay exception some ruling that spontaneous statements are subject to the confrontati on clause and others electing to examine the circumstances of each case to determine whether the declarant has provided the functional equivalent of testimony to government officer in an effort to resolve this conflict the us supreme court has ag reed to hear oral argument this term in two cases hammon v indiana23 and davis v washington 24 concerning the admissibility at cr iminal tria ls of excited utteran ce statements made by non testifying witnesses hammon and davis both of these cases involve domestic violence prosecutions in which the government attempted to in troduce outofcourt statements made by individuals who declined to testify at trial this scenario is not uncommon in domestic violence cases according to recent law review article batterers put hydraulic pressures on domestic violence victims to recant drop the case or fail to appear at trial25 as consequence the government frequently must go forward without the cooperation or testimony of the allege d victim by introducing into evidence their outofcourt statements or those of othe r eyewitnesses made to responding police officers or to 911 operators26 these hearsay statements are often the only other evidence of the abuse besides the victims complaint27 the statements may be admissible under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule however few states havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33195crs5 28 id at 708 citing cal evid code 1370 allowing the admission of hearsay statements by victims of domestic violence who are unavailable to testify at the time of the trial and or rev stat 4046026 admitting hearsay statements made by victim of domestic violence within twentyfour hours of the incident whether or not victim is presently available as witness 29 hammon 829 ne 2d at 447 30 id at 448 31 id at 456 32 id at 458specifically created hearsay exceptions for statements made by adult victims of domestic violence28 statements made to investigating police at crime scenes i n hammon v indiana hershel hammon was convicted of domestic battery of his wife amy hammon during an argument29 amy had been subpoenaed to testify but she failed to appear at the trial under indianas excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule the trial court admitted po lice officers testimony regarding amys responses to his questioning at the scene of the domestic disturbance specifically that hershel had punched her and thrown her down into the glass of the gas heater30 hershel did not have prior opportunity to crossexamine amy about these statements made to the police officer the indiana supreme court upheld the ad missibility of this evidence under state law but then considered its constitutionality in light of crawford the court rejected adopting categorical approach to classifyin g excited utterances as either testimonial or nontestimonial statements instead the court announced its interpretation of testimonial which is to be applied by ll indiana state courts in future cases testimonial statement is one given or taken in significant part for purposes of preserving it for potential future us in legal proceedings in evaluating whether statement is for purposes of future legal utility the motive of the questioner more than that of the declar ant is determinative but if either is principally motivated by desire to preserve the statement it is sufficient to render the statement testimonial31 applying this test to the facts of the case the indiana court concluded that amys outofcourt statements did not qua lify as testimonial and thus were not subject to the crawford requirements the initial exchange between mooney and amy fell into the category of preliminary investigation in which th officer was essentially attempting to determine whether anything requiring po lice action had occurred and if so what officer mooney responding to reported emergency was principally in the process of accomplishing the preliminary tasks of securing and assessing the scene amys motivation was to convey basic facts and there is suggestion that amy wanted her initial responses to be preserved or otherwise used against her husband at trial32 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33195crs6 33 id at 457 34 id 35 davis 111 p3d at 847 36 id 37 id at 849 38 id at 850 39 id at 851 40 id the hammon court opined that responses to initial inquiries by officers arriving at crime scene are typically not testimonial33 furthermore police at crime scene are attempting to determine whether an offense has occurred protect victims or apprehend suspect rather than trying to obtain and preserve statements in anticipation of potential criminal prosecution34 911 calls in davis v washington adrian davis was convicted of violating protective nocontact order when he assaulted michelle mccottry35 shortly after the attack mccottry called 911 identified her assailant as adrian davis and explained that he had used his fists to b eat her the governments only witnesses at trial were the two police officers who re sponded to the 911 emergency call but they could not testify as to the cause of mccottrys physical injuries the government was unable to locate mccottry at the time of the trial and thus she did not testify the tape recording of the 911 call was the only evidence that connected davis to the assault36 the trial court admitted the 911 tape recording under the state of washingtons excited utterance exception the washington supreme court explained that this case turned primarily on whether mccottrys 911 call constitute s testimonial statement under crawford the court distinguished 911 ca lls made by individuals seeking emergency help to be rescued from peril whic h would not be considered testimonial from calls made to the police to report crime out of sire to bear witness which would more likely be testimonial37 the court adopted caseby case approach to statements made to 911 operators stating that th circumstances of the 911 call must be scrutinized to determine whether the d eclarant knowingly provided the functional equivalent of testimony to government agent38 finally the court explained that 911 emergency calls might contain both stimonial and nontestim onial statements and that the portion of the call that is nontestimonial could be admitted without subjecting the entire statement to the crawford requirements39 under the facts of the case the washington high court ruled that there was evidence to suggest that mccottry sought to bear witness when she called 911 instead she was in immediate grave dang er and called 911 to seek protection from peril an amicus curiae br ief filed on behalf of the defendant argued that it is common knowledge that 911 calls may later be used to prosecute the perpetrator of the abuse40 however the court found evid ence to suggest mccottry had such knowledge or that it influenced her decisi on to call 911 consequently the courthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33195crs7 41 id 42 hammon 829 ne 2d at 446 43 davis 111 p3d at 849 44 united states v braun 416 f3d 703 707 8th cir 2005 45 people v corella 122 cal app 4th 461 469 2004held that the portion of mcco ttrys 911 call that identified davis as her assailant was nontestimonial and as such did not vi olate daviss confrontation rights41 comparison of the hammon and davis definitions of testimonial although both the hammon and davis courts determined that the excited utterances at issue in their respective cases were nontestimonial in nature they formulated different tests to evaluate them the hammon court reasoned that an excited utterance should be considered testimonial where prin cipal motive of either the person making the statement or the person or organization receiving it is to preserve it for future use in legal proceedings42 thus the hammon approach is to focus on the motivations of the questioner and the declarant in contrast the davis court advocates examining the circumstances which generated the excited utterance specifically whether the statement was made in an effort to obtain emergency help from dire situation or whether it was made out of desire to provide evidence for use in future trial43 the davis approach concerns itself with the context in which the outofcourt statement was made in addition to the motivations of the questioner and responder three general approaches of lower courts the subtle difference between the indiana and washington supreme courts in hammon and davis reflects the variety of approaches that lower courts have taken in trying to apply crawford to excited utterances stat and federal court efforts to decide whether excited utterances may or may not be classified as testimonial hearsay can be categorized into three main groups per nontestimonial per testimonial and caseby case evaluation per nontestimonial several courts have deci ded that excited utterances are necessarily nontestimonial in nature because they are made under the influence of stressful event and as such ar emotional and spontaneous rather than deliberate and calculated statements44 the rationale for this view is that excited utterances made without reflection or delib eration are not ma in contemplation of their testimonial use in future trial45 courts espousing this approach will thus admit an excited utterance under the trad itional hearsay exception without requiring the outofcourt statement to satisfy the crawford crossexamina tion requirements per testimonial some courts believe that all statements made to government agent after an alleged crime s occurred are per testimonial and thus subject to crawford the highest state court in ma ssachusetts is leading proponent of this proposition httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33195crs8 46 commonwealth v gonsalves 833 ne 2d 549 556 mass 2005 47 id at 557 48 id at 556 the court in davis also advocates this distinction although it may be important to note that the washington court ruled on statements made to 911 operators whereas the massachusetts court was considering responses given to police at crime scene however 911 operators may be civilian employees of the police department or even police officers see eg people v cortes 781 nys2d 401 405 ny sup ct 2004 in addition it is doubtful that in the face of immediate danger caller to 911 is contemplating how her statements might later be used at trial minnesota v wright 701 nw 2d 802 811 minn 2005 49 wright 701 nw 2d at 812 50 id at 81213we conclude that questioning by law enforcement agents whether police prosecutors or others acting directly on their behalf is interrogation this includes investigatory interrogation such as preliminary fact gathering and assessment whether crime has taken place under our reading of crawford statements elicited by such interrogation are per testimonial and therefore implicate the confrontation clause further analysis is needed the statements are inadmissible unless the decl arant testifies at trial or formally is unavailable and was previously subject to crossexamination46 however the massachusetts court allo wed narrow exception to its general rule statements made in response to emergency questioning by law enforcement to secure volatile scene or determine the need for or provide medical care are not per testimonial47 this qualification reflects th courts acknowle dgment of law enforcements different functions on the one hand peacekeeping and community caretaking and on the other detecting investigating and gathering evidence related to criminal offense48 the focus of the community caretaking exception is on the emergency nature of the s ituation and statements made to law enforcement during this stage would not be considered tes timonial once the peril has passed and the police enter the investigatory stage any statements made to law enforcement would be testimonial and subject to crawford casebycase evaluation the overwhelming majority of courts49 that have considered excited utterances in the crawford aftermath have rejected categorical approaches and instead favored casebycase multiplefactor balancing test to evaluate whether statement qualifies as testimonial hearsay however as the hammon and davis courts demonstrate this approach can create disparity as to the circumstances court should examine among the relevant considerations are50 whether the declarant was victim or an observer the declarants purpose in speaking with the officer eg to obtain emergency assistance or to bear testimony whether it was the police or the declarant who initiated theconversation the location where the statements were made eg the declarantshome squad car or the police station the declarants emotional state when the statement was madehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33195crs9 51 gonsalves 833 ne 2d at 559 52 major robert wm best to be or not to be testim onial that is the question 2005 army law 65 74 53 gonsalves 833 ne 2d at 559 noting th at the prosecution can s till present powerful evidence that crime has occurred and that the defendant was the perpetrator such as the responding officers testimony as to the complainants physical appearance her screams her medical records and photographs and th fact that one else was in position to have inflicted her injuriesthe level of formality and structur of the conversation between the officer and declarant the officers purpose in speaking w ith the declarant eg to secure the scene determine what happened or collect evidence if and how the statements were recorded in addition to these factors courts have disagreed whether subjective or objective test should be used in assessing the purpose or motivation of the declarant most courts suggest that the proper inquiry is whether reasonable person in the declarants position would anticipate the st atements being used against the accused in investigating and prosecuting the crime51 however some observers have argued that the objective or subjective intent of the declarant is irrelevant if the defining characteristic of testimonial statement is whether the statement is made to government agent52 this view of the confrontati on clause would thus scrutinize the purpose of the questioner in eliciting the declarants excited utterance conclusion by granting certiorari to review the state court opinions in hammon v indiana and davis v washington the us supreme court this term will have an opportunity to clarify what kind of statements qualify for testimonial hearsay and thus are subject to the constitutional crossexamin ation principles previously announced in crawford v washington by articulating definitive standard the court may resolve the uncertainty among the lower courts that have tried to apply crawford to excited utterances the courts decision in these two cases has the potential to significantly alter the strategy and met hod of prosecuting criminal cases particularly in domestic violence and gangrelated cases that often rely on outofcourt accusations in the absence of the initial complaining witness53 the outcome also may further limit the hearsay rules of evidence as the court could determine that the confrontation clause trumps the excited utterance exception at least when such statements are made to government agents
