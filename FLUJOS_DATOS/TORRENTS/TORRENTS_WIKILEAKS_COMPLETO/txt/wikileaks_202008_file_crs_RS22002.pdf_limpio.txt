agreement between israel and egypt the ustr designated the first three qizs in egypt and in 2005 expanded two of these and added fourth2 qizs in nutshell qizs can be compared to free trade zones qizs are typically industrial parks housing manufacturing operations they simplify cooperative production between countries because they 1 are enclaves of infrastructure in developing countries where infrastructure may be sparse and 2 are fiscally outside the customs territory of country thus on raw materials flowing into and goods moving out of zones customs procedures are streamlined and tariffs do not apply until the item formally enters country as an import for consumption qizs are distinguished from other trade zones as follows trade zones in general are standalone entities within one country not directly connected to other countries b produce for export to or domestic consumption in any country and c operate solely under the authority of and conditions determined by the host government qizs however have operations in two countries israel and either jordan or egypt b produce goods solely for export to the united states and c operate under both the authority of the host countries and the oversight authority of the united states which determines conditions for and authorizes tariff relief for qiz imports pl 104234 requires that artic eligible for qiz status must 1 be

of all qiz exports and 86 of all jord anian exports to the united states the reason for continuing qiz dominance is that qiz products enter the united states free of duty whereas under the usjordan fta tari ffs will not be fully eliminated until the end of the tenyear phasein peri od in 2011 nevertheless in 2005 the growth in qiz exports from jordan leveled off to only 2 grow th over 2004 exports this growth slowdown could have been affected by th removal of textile and clothi ng quotas but not tariffs that occurred with the january 2005 expiration of the 1995 wto agreement on textiles and clothing trade in general and qiz trade in particular has been major engine of growth for jordans economy in the past few years the economist intelligence unit eiu projects that from an average

jordanian press reports and international economists however close to half of these jobs have been filled by expatriates mainly from southern asia9 breakdown of the number of workers employed at each

greater cairo and suez canal zones several f actors contributed to egypts desire for qiz participation at this time first was the january 1 2005 end of quotas on textiles and apparel which dominate egypts as well as jordans exports to the united states under wto agreement this meant that the flood of similar articles from china and india to the united states could crowd out egyptian exports and could result in the loss of 150000 job opportunities in the industry10 and some of the 32 billion us foreign direct investment in egypt in ddition egypt was in search of sources for increased economic

implications although the creation of qizs has been positive step toward jordans and egypts economic growth jordan like other non oilproducin g middle east countries f aces enormous challenges to its long term econom ic well being for some countries in the region lack of adequate wate r resources impedes growth jordan is one of the ten most waterdeprived countries in the world beyond natural resources the regions human resources also need to be fu rther developed in order to s pur economic development for example most experts note that jordans workforce is still largely unskilled which hinders the economys transformation from one based on smallscale agriculture and pastoral grazing to laborintensive indus trialized economy spite recent government investment in higher education and vocational training jordanian workers according to one jordanian businessman lack vocationa l experience and strong work ethic13 some factories located in qizs have high numbers of more productive foreign workers from china and southeast asia14 in order to increase the competitiveness of jordanian labor the ministry of labor has launched several programs aimed at recruiting skilled rural workers particularly women the social impact of qizs although most experts note that companies based in qizs continue to hire fo reign laborers thousands of jo rdanians particularly women from the rural countryside have found jobs at garment factories in qizs in traditional society such as jordan many of these wo men had little previous work experience and were largely caretakers of their home despite the low wages paid by apparel factories in the qizs some women have been able to support their families where the father or husband had fallen sick or die d and others have been able to supplement the income of the male breadwinner however traditional attitudes toward womans place in the home persist and many families continue to prohibit female members from working inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22002crs6 15 jordans peace dividend op cit 16 source of data us department of comme rce trade policy information system tpisqizs in response the jordanian ministry of labor has worked to ease the adjustment of women moving from the home to new job by providing free transportation to work subsidizing the cost of food in qizs and pa ying for dormitories near factories to cut commuting times according to the jordanian trade minister new sort of culture is being established where girls are going to work they are supporting their families and they are raising the standard of living in their villages15 the long term effect of female employment in qizs has yet to be measure d and there is some concern that over time jordanian women may have difficulty in ach ieving higher wages in global economy where apparel manufacturers can easily relocate to cheaper labor markets impact on the arabisraeli peace process when the qiz program came into being in 1996 many observers regarded it as vehicle to support the development of peaceful relations and normalization of commercial ties between israel and the two arab states jordan and egypt with which it had signed peace treaties in both cases however cold peace continues to prevail between israel and the two arab states since the conclusion of the jordanisrael peace treaty in october 1994 large numbe rs of jordanians particularly islamic fundamentalists those of palestinian origi n and members of the professional unions tinue to oppose normalization with is rael and resist the expansion of commercial relations with the establishment of 13 qizs in jordan there has been an increase in the volume of bilateral trade t hough the overall totals re main modest trade between israel and jordan in 2004 were nearly six times what they were in 1997 israels exports to jordan in 2004 were roughl 133 million up from about 21 million in 1997 israels imports from jordan were r oughly 51 million up from about 125 million in 199716 it is possible that some incremental improvement in bilateral relations could occur over time as result of increased commercial contacts and joint participation in mechanisms related to the qiz program recent issues in may of 2006 the national labor committee nlc human rights advocacy group issued 161page report alleging sw eatshoplike conditions in 28 out of 100 qiz plants in jordan the report usjordan free trade agreement descends into human trafficking and involuntary servitude was compiled from interviews with over 100 foreign guest workers in jordan and workers fo rcibly returned to bangladesh in response to the allegations the ustr raised the matter with the jordanian government jordans trade minister sharif zubi subsequently indi cated that the report incorrectly identified three sweatshops that are not ev in jordan and that three others had been closed before the report was released in may in addition he noted that the jordanian government had formed nine inspections teams to investigat the entire garment trade in the country and is working with the international labor organization us labor committees the ustr the state department and
