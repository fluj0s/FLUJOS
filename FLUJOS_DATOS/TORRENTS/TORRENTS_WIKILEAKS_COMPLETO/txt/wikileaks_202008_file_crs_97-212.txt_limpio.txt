increase of 21 over the fy1997 legislative branch budget authority this budget authority represents compromise between the housepassed version of 2172 billion and the senatepassed version of 2284 billion1 conferees increased the house version by 77 million or 35 and decreased the senate version by 35 million or 15 introduction since the late 1970s the legislative branch appropriations bill has been divided into two titles title i congressional operations contains budget authorities for activities directly serving congress included in this title are the budgets of the house senate joint items joint house and senate activities congressional budget office architect of the capitol except library buildings and grounds congressional research service within the library of congress and congressional printing and binding within the government printing office title ii related agencies contains budgets for activities not directly supporting congress included in this title are the budgets of the botanic garden library of congress except congressional research service library buildings and grounds within the architect of the capitol government printing office except congressional printing and binding costs and the general accounting office periodically since fy1978 the legislative bill has also contained additional titles for such purposes as capital improvements and special onetime functions total budget authority in the fy1998 legislative branch appropriations act is 2249 billion title i budget authority is 70 of the total and title ii budget authority is 30 additionally there are legislative budget authorities that are not included in the regular legislative branch appropriations annual act or subsequent supplemental appropriations acts these include permanent budget authorities trust fund budget authorities and other budget 1 by custom the housepassed version does not contain funding for internal senate activities and vice versa however these house and senate figures reflect budget authorities for the internal activities of the other house for comparison purposes authorities2 tables providing detailed information on the various funds in the bill as well as breakdown of staffing appear at the end of this report although most legislative branch budget authority is contained in the annual and supplemental legislative branch appropriations bills additional permanent budget authorities are also available to the legislative branch budget authorities appropriated permanently are available as the result of previously enacted legislation and do not require annual action3 other legislative funding appears in the form of trust funds trust funds are monies held in accounts that are credited with collections from specific sources earmarked by law for defined purpose trust funds do not appear in the annual legislative branch bill since they are not budget authority they are included in the budget either as budget receipts or offsetting collections4 the us budget also includes some nonlegislative entities within the legislative branch budget these entities are funded in other appropriations bills these nonlegislative entities are placed within the legislative budget section by the office of management and budget for bookkeeping purposes5 status table 1 status of legislative branch appropriations

headings 1 us tax court and 2 other legislative branch agencies legislative branch boards and commissions included in the latter category were prospective payment assessment commission physician payment review commission gambling impact study commission and subcategory for other legislative branch boards and commissions the us budget does not give information on the budget authorities of entities in this subcategory to obtain more accurate picture of the legislative budget the budget authorities for nonlegislative entities should be subtracted from the total legislative budget authority provided in the us budget the fy1998 us budget shows fy1997 total legislative budget authority of 2526 billion including permanent budget authority trust funds and nonlegislative entities after removing nonlegislative entities the total is 2484 billion including permanent budget authority and trust funds additionally excluding permanent budget authority and trust funds the total is 2129 billion the figure of 2129 billion is an estimate in the us budget hence the figure differs from the budget authority in the fy1997 bill of 2169 billion 72297 71597 91897 pl 105 92497 92497 62497

branch was governed during the interim by continuing resolution that generally funded programs at the fy1997 level hjres 94 pl 10546 september 30 1997 major issues that drove discussions on the fy1998 bill the effort in recent years to trim the legislative budget continued during consideration of the fy1998 funding level early in 1997 representative james t walsh chairman of the house subcommittee on legislative branch appropriations noted that cuts made in recent years in the budget for the house of representatives have shown that the house can reduce its expenses and in so doing not hinder the capabilities of the house as an institution19 among issues that drove consideration of the fy1998 legislative branch appropriations bill were the following how much to appropriate for the architects request to undertake several capitol improvements whether legislative staff levels should be further reduced whether to agree to funds authorized for committee investigations of alleged campaign violations by the administration and congress what appropriation needs were for technology development including online information electronic document printing and legislative information system what functions of the architect of the capitol could be privatized how much should funding be increased for security enhancement for the capitol and other congressional buildings what the funding levels for the primary congressional support agencies should be including the government printing office the congressional budget office the library of congress and the general accounting office and at what level the joint committee on taxation should be funded funding level issues each spring as members of the house and senate subcommittees on legislative branch appropriations consider funding requests from legislative agencies they are faced with three primary options to maintain flat budget to provide modest increase or to approve budget decrease statements by members of the subcommittees and the house leadership indicated early support for modest increase in the fy1998 budget 19 us congress house committee on appropriations subcommittee on legislative branch appropriations legislative branch appropriations for 1998 hearings part 2 105th cong 2nd sess feb 1997 washington gpo 1997 p 4 in 1997 the house and senate agreed to slightly differing levels on july 28 1997 the house passed hr 2209 providing for decrease of 06 excluding senate funds earlier on july 16 1997 the senate passed its version of the fy1998 bill with 35 increase over fy1997 excluding house activities flat budget flat budget typically provides new funds for mandatory cost increases but denies any additional funding requests flat budget is usually difficult to achieve due to number of factors among the factors affecting consideration of the fy1998 bill were the following 1 the leaderships continued interest in increasing the electronic capabilities of the house and senate 2 increases in house and senate committee funds and 3 anticipated costs associated with repairs to the capitol complex buildings earlier in 1997 the chairman of the house subcommittee on legislative branch appropriations stated his desire to hold the fy1998 budget as close to the fy1997 level as possible20 chairman walsh also stated that he was open to modifications if increases were found necessary to maintain the smooth operation of congress on the senate side concern too was expressed that an fy1998 funding level be approved that would enable congress to operate efficiently it was also emphasized that congress was already working at reduced funding level during the senate hearings senator robert bennett chairman of the senate subcommittee on legislative branch appropriations commented that congress had achieved significant reductions in its budget particularly in committee staff21 he added that the subcommittee would need to exert care in looking at the needs of the legislative branch senator byron dorgan another member of the subcommittee stated at the same hearing that he did not believe most people realized that the legislative branch had already been significantly downsized22 modest increase proposals by midsummer actions in the senate and house indicated the likelihood of modest increase the senate version of the fy1998 bill provided for new budget authority of 1538 billion excluding house activities this represented an increase of 35 or 516 million above the fy1997 level the house appropriations committee approved reduction of 06 as the bill was sent to conference many observers felt it possible that the conferees would settle for slight increase which they did in approving 21 increase earlier indications of support for modest increase were the fy1998 section 302b allocations of the house and senate appropriations committees23 the house appropriations committee approved its allocations on june 18 1997 allowing for an fy1998

year for their subcommittees in turn the subcommittees are to adhere to the allocations branch budget authority of 2339 billion24 the senate appropriations committee approved 2439 billion for its fy1998 new legislative branch budget authority on june 19 199725 the house allocation allowed for 62 increase over the fy1997 budget authority of 2203 billion the senate allocation allowed for 107 increase26 another indication of support for modest increase in the fy1998 legislative budget was the fy1998 budget request that congress submitted to the president and was in turn presented by him in the us budget for fy1998 usually the us budget estimates are higher than the budgets congress actually approves excluding senate activities the fy1998 house budget request for legislative branch activities was 1855 billion excluding senate activities the fy1997 budget authority was 1722 billion27 the fy1998 request was an increase of 133 million or 77 over the fy1997 appropriation for all legislative activities28 although the increase was almost 8 the fy1998 request was actually decrease from the fy1995 appropriation level the fy1998 request of 1855 billion was almost 1 less than the fy1995 appropriation level for legislative branch activities again excluding those of the senate of 1869 billion29 including senate activities estimates in the fy1998 us budget reflected an increase in the total legislative budget of 84 over the fy1997 appropriation the fy1997 funding level was 2203 billion the fy1998 estimate was 2387 billion both figures excluded permanent budget authority and trust funds budget decrease the decrease of 06 approved by the house on july 28 reflected an earlier trend toward decreased legislative budget although decrease in the total fy1998 bill seemed unlikely with the senates 35 increase both houses did approve reduction for fy1997 the fy1997 legislative branch appropriations approved in the regular annual act provided for budget of 2165 billion the fy1996 budget was 2187 billion this was decrease of 22 million or 10 24 us congress house committee on appropriations report of the subdivision of budget totals for fiscal year 1998 105th cong lst

allocation by 4 million 27 senate activities are funded in two places in the legislative branch appropriations bill the senate heading for operations of the senate and the architect of the capitol heading for senate office buildings and grounds 28 this figure was determined by subtracting senate activities of 441 million for senate operations and 40 million for senate activities under the architect of the capitol from the total fy1997 legislative branch appropriation of 2203 billion 29 the figure 1869 billion was determined by subtracting senate activities of 461 million for senate operations and 48 million for senate activities under the architect of the capitol from total fy1995 legislative branch appropriations of 2378 billion technology funding house and senate legislative information systems both houses continued to take steps to reduce duplication of effort in tracking legislation to upgrade legislative tracking systems and to ensure that congress achieves the needed reprogramming of its computers by the year 200030 to accomplish most of this the house and senate continued to develop their legislative information systems that create and manage legislative data files earlier both houses had directed the congressional research service crs to develop data retrieval system with the technical support of the library of congress loc and in collaboration with other legislative branch agencies such as the general printing office gpo31 the house legislative information system is to be administered by the house clerk and the senate system by the secretary of the senate both the clerk and the secretary continue to exchange information on developments of their own systems in 1997 they reported to the house oversight committee and the senate committee on rules and administration their recommendations regarding the electronic transfer of legislative data among other issues their recommendations included transferals between the two houses and among all legislative entities the house and senate legislative information systems are expected to reduce duplication through consolidation of existing legislative data services and to support the transition the systems will be designed to complement the gpo access service which was created by the 1993 gpo information enhancement act32 house system beginning with fy1996 the house oversight committee and the house clerk have worked jointly in developing the house legislative information system and continue to do so in fy1996 the committee directed the clerk of the house to study methods for increasing electronic printing of house documents the committee further directed that subsequent proposals of the clerk be coordinated with the gpo and all house entities requiring printing and storage of documents in testimony on february 4 1997 the clerk addressed progress on her plans drawn in response to these directives in her fy1998 budget proposal the clerk requested new house appropriations subheading for proposed document management system dms the dms was to be funded in the subheading document management system under the heading allowances and expenses under the account salaries and expenses of the house the primary purpose of the new subheading would be to assist in maintaining accountability of the systems costs the proposed dms she explained would provide document management system for creating tracking editing sharing printing and transmitting documents the primary purpose of the system the clerk emphasized was to 30 see discussion on the need to reprogram computers by the year 2000 later in this section 31 the senate directed crs and the library to develop retrieval system in the fy1997 legislative branch appropriations bill the language was contained in an amendment that was dropped in the act but maintained in the conference report subsequent to passage of the fy1997 bill the chairman of the house oversight committee directed crs and the library to ensure that the retrieval system being developed for the senate also meets the requirements of the house the chairmans directive was contained in letter to the crs director dated oct 9 1996 32 the government printing office went online in june 1994 providing bill texts contents of the congressional record and copies of federal regulations among other documents allow the house to move from its dependency on the gpo for preparing printing and distributing house documents33 the dms would also allow simultaneous electronic transmission of floor debates committee hearings and other legislative activities although development of the dms would be costly the clerk anticipated that the electronic transfer of data will provide savings of about 1 million year to the house34 according to the clerk house rules would need to be amended to enable development of the dms35 in anticipation of the development of the dms the house report on the fy1998 bill contained language that directed the congressional research service and the library of congress to devote sufficient resources to accomplish the following during fy1998 1 provide comparable functionality so that legacy retrieval systems can be retired by 123198 2 improve productivity of congressional staff by making significant progress in implementing previously identified highpriority functionality and 3 improve the accuracy usability and timeliness of legislative information retrieval36 senate system in 1997 the secretary of the senate continued work begun in 1996 on the development and implementation of the senates legislative information service the secretary of the senate was directed to develop legislative information system for the senate in the fy1997 legislative branch appropriations act37 the act directed that the secretary oversee the systems development and implementation subject to approval of the senate committee on rules and administration like the house the senate system provides means for creating tracking editing sharing and transmitting documents earlier in fy1995 the library of congress loc was requested by the house committee on appropriations to analyze duplication of legislative information systems supporting congress including those of the senate and house pursuant to the librarys findings the committee directed loc to prepare plan for consolidating these overlapping services both the analysis and plan were developed by the crs with the librarys support the fy1997 legislative branch appropriations act funded the senate system by authorizing the secretary to use unspent fy1995 monies previously appropriated for the office of the secretary of the senate and to remain available until september 30 1998 the secretary was also authorized to transfer as he determines necessary funds already appropriated to his office for the purpose of development of the senate financial management system to the development of the legislative information system 33 us

join the internet and expand their usage of it for example house internet usage increased by 800 in 1995 and 199639 throughout the united states internet usage has more than doubled since july 199540 it is anticipated that congress will face significant expenses in expanding its technological capacity to meet the demands of increased constituent communications via the internet it is expected that eventually however most expenses will be offset by savings it is estimated that during the 105th congress savings will be almost 750000 for 1 replacement of the ibm mainframe by an ibm cmos enterprise

reprogramming computer systems by the year 2000 this is necessary because most computers use twodigit year system for purposes of dating the system assumes 1 and 9 are the first two digits of the year if not reprogrammed computers using the two digit system will think the year 2000 00 actually is 1900 the result would be data errors and possibly computer shutdowns according to the office of management and budget omb it will cost the federal government including congress an estimated 23 billion to make these adjustments this figure is considered by the chairman of the house subcommittee

new budget is 21 increase over fy1997 and reflects recognition of recent cuts major funding trends guide to determining legislative budget trends interpretation of budget trends is determined primarily by three factors selection of current or constant dollars to express budget authority constant dollars reflecting the impact of inflation selection of budget authority contained in annual appropriations bills with or without permanent budget authority permanent budget authority not requiring annual approval by congress and selection of fiscal years to be compared current dollar data reflect actual budget authority appropriated each year constant dollar data reflect the conversion of actual budget authority into equivalent 1997 dollars for example congress appropriated budget authority of 41793000 for the senate in fy1968 excluding permanent budget authority converted into 1997 dollars 41793000 is 194433526 when comparing the growth of the senate budget from fy1968fy1997 in current dollars the increase amounts to 9557 in constant dollars the increase is 1269 the constant dollar figure indicates budget growth after adjustment for inflation differences also appear based on the choice of fiscal years used to compare budget authority for example comparison of budget growth between fy1968 and fy1997 shows the following changes in total legislative budgets after adjustment for inflation fy1968 fy1997 85 fy1972fy1997 99 and fy1978fy1997 11371 changes in the 1970s significantly affected congress budget implementation by congress of the 1970 legislative reorganization act increased both the budgets and staffs of congressional committees and support agencies costs of the 1970 act are reflected in increased budgets for congress from fy1971 through fy1978 for example the increase in total legislative budget authority from fy1969 pre1970 reorganization act through fy1973 year of significant implementation of the 1970 reorganization act was 645 the legislative budget during the 1970s reflected implementation of the 1974 congressional budget and impoundment control act which created the house and senate budget committees and the congressional budget office significant funding also began for development of house and senate computer capabilities this growth in the legislative budget stabilized by fy1978 and has remained fairly level since that time 69 for example gao contracted with boozallen and hamilton for the librarys recent audit with price waterhouse for the audits of the house of representatives and with other major auditing
