states with the idea of forming fr ee trade agreement fta mexicos main motivation in pursuing an fta with the united states was to stabilize the mexican economy by attracting foreign direct investment the mexican economy had experienced many difficulties throughout most of the 1980s with significant deepening of poverty the intention of xico in entering nafta was to increase export diversification by attracting foreign direct investment fdi which would help create jobs increase wage ra tes and reduce poverty at the time that nafta went into eff ect the expectation among supporters was that the agreement would improve investor confidence in mexico attract investment and narrow the income differentials betw een mexico and the united states and canada measuring the effects of na fta on the mexican economy is difficult because the economy was also affected by ot her factors such as economic cycles in the united states mexicos largest trading partner and currency fluctuations in addition mexicos unilatera l trade liberalization meas ures of the 1980s and the currency crisis of 1995 both affected ec onomic growth per capita gross domestic product gdp and real wages while nafta may have broug ht economic and social benefits to the mexican economy as whole the benefits have not been evenly distributed throughout the country wages and employment tend to be higher in states experiencing higher levels of fdi and trade the agricultu ral sector experienced higher amount of worker displacement after nafta because of increased competition from the united states and because of mexican domestic agricultural reforms in terms of regional effects initial conditions in mexico determined which mexican states experienced stronger economic growth as result of nafta states with higher levels of telecommunications and transportation infrastructure gained more benefits than poorer states with lower levels of educa tion infrastructure and institutional capacity some economists argue that while trade liberalization may narrow income disparities over the long run with other countries it ma indirectly lead to larger disparities in income levels within country this re port will be

international economics 1992from the 1930s through part of the 1980s mexico maintained strong protectionist trade policy in an effort to be independent of an foreign power and as means to industrialization mexico tablished policy of import substitution in the 1930s consisting of broad general pr otection of the entire industrial sector mexico placed high restrictions on foreign investment and controlled the exchange rate to encourage domestic industrial gr owth mexico also nationalized the oil industry during this time these protectioni st economic policies remained in effect until the country began to experience seri of economic challenges caused by number of factors the 1980s in mexico were marked by inflation2 and declining standard of living the 1982 debt crisis in which th mexican government was unable to meet its foreign debt obligations was primary cause of the economic challenges the country faced in the early to mid1980s much of the governments efforts in addressing the challenges were placed on privatizing state industries and moving toward trade liberalization in the late 1980s and early into the 1990s the mexican government implemented series of m easures to restruct ure the economy that included steps toward unila teral trade liberalization mexican began to reverse its protecti onist stance in the mid1980s when the government was forced to declare that it wa s unable to repay its debts and to default on its loans then president miguel madrid took steps to open and liberalize the mexican economy and initiated procedur to replace import substitution policies with policies aimed at attracting foreign investment lowering trade barriers and making the country competitive in nonoil exports in 1986 mexico acceded to the general agreement on tariffs and trad gatt assuring further trade liberalization measures and closer ties with the united states in november 1987 the united states nd mexico entered into bilateral understanding on trade and investment called the framework of principles and procedures for consultation regarding trade and investment relations3 prior to this agreement there had been legal framework to govern commercial relations between the two countries there were two parts to the agreement one served as mechanism to address trade issues and th other established an agenda for the removal or reduction of trade barriers seven topics were listed in the agenda for possible future discussions textiles agriculture steel investment technology transfer and intellectual property electroni cs and information on the service sector under this framework understanding two s ectoral agreements were reached which liberalized trade in steel textiles and coholic beverages in addition working groups started

significantly improved trade relations between mexico and the united states and other imp rovements in trade relations followed marking the advances in trade relations between the two countries mexico proposed negotiations for free trade agreement with the united states in june 1990 then president carlos salinas gortari of mexico and then president george hw bush issued joint statement in support of negotiating free trade agreement economic conditions in mexico before and after nafta the mexican economy is strongly tied to economic conditions in the united states making it very sensitive to econo mic developments in the united states5 mexico is highly reliant on exports and mo st of mexicos exports go to the united states in 2007 mexicos exports as percent of gdp equaled 33 up from 10 twenty years ago and over 80 of mexicos exports went to the united states the state of the mexican economy is important to the united states because of the close trade and investment ties between the two c ountries and because of other social and political issues that could be affected by economic conditions particularly poverty and how it relates to migration issues not all changes in economic growth or trade and investment patterns in mexico since 1994 can be attributed to nafta the economy has also been affected by other economic factors such as economic gr owth in the united states and currency fluctuations also traderelated jo b gains and losses since nafta may have accelerated trends that were ongoing prior to nafta and may not be totally attributable to the trade agreement it is difficult to isolate the economic effects of nafta from other economic or political factors for example mexico has experienced at least two major events outside of nafta that had economic consequences mexicos unilateral trade liberalization measures prior to nafta and the currency crisis of 1995 both affected economic growth per capita gdp and real wages in mexico in the mid1990s mexico experienced financial crisis caused by number of complex financial economic and political factors the early 1990s in mexico were marked by large increase in foreign investment as investor confidence in the

about currency devaluation in response to these concerns the mexican government issued shortterm dollar indexed notes to finance the growing current account deficit7 the mexican government expected investor confidence to be restored after the august 1994 presidential election fore ign investment flows however did not recover to the level of expectation in the months following the election the current account deficit widened as imports surged due to an overvalued peso the government began to experience shortterm liquidity crisis8 by december 1994 the continued decrease in the inflows of foreign direct investment and foreign exchange reserves put pressure on the g overnment to abandon its previous fixed exchange rate policy and adopt floatin g exchange rate regime as result mexicos currency plunged by around 50 within six months sending the country into deep recession9 in the aftermath of the 1994 devaluati on the mexican government took several steps to restructure the economy and lesse n the impact of the currency crisis among the more disadvantaged sectors of th economy the united states and the international monetary fund imf assist ed the mexican government by putting together an emergency financial suppor t package of up to 50 billion mexico adopted tight monetary and fi scal policies to reduce infla tion and absorb some of the costs of the banking sector crisis the austerity plan also included an increase in the valueadded tax budget cuts and increas in electricity and gasoline prices10 the peso steadily depreciated through th end of the 1990s which led to greater exports and helped the countrys exporting i ndustries however the peso devaluation also resulted in decline in real income hurting mostly the poorest segments of the population but also the

reinforced the high sensitivity of mexican economic sectors to economic developm ents in the united states21 several economists have noted that it is likely that nafta contributed to mexicos economic recovery directly and indirectly after the 1995 currency crisis mexico responded to the crisis by implementing strong economic adjustment program but also by fully adhering to its nafta obligations to liberalize trade with the united states and canada nafta may have supported the resolve of the mexican government to continue with the course of marketbased economic reforms resulting in increasing investor confidence in mexico the world bank study estimates that fdi in mexico would have been approximately 40 lower without nafta22 one of the main arguments in favor of nafta at the time it was being proposed by policymakers was that the agreement would improve economic conditions in mexico and narrow the income gap between mexico and the united states studies that have addre ssed the issue of economic convergence23 have noted that economic convergence in north ameri ca might not materialize under free trade as long as fundament differences in in itial c onditions persist over time one study argues that nafta is not enough to help narrow the disparities in economic conditions between mexico and the united states and that mexico needs to invest more in education innovati on and infrastructure and in the quality of national institutions the study states that in come convergence between latin american country and the united states is limited by the wide differe nces in the quality of domestic institutions in the innovation dyna mics of domestic firms and in the skills of the labor force24 another study also notes that the ability of mexico to improve economic conditions depends on its capacity to improve its national institutions adding that mexican institutions did not improve significantly more than those of other latin american countries during the postnafta

for the rise in wages for more highly skilled workers is the technological change brought about by trade others link the rise in wage differentials to trade and the changes in prices of skillintensive goods that result from trade liberalization as prices for skillintensive goods decline after trade liberalization the demand for skilled worker s rises and wages rise the authors of the report conclude that the sharp increase in wage inequality in mexico was caused by technological change they argue that trade liberalization alone had almost effect on the wage gap but that the tec

regions and sectors wages and employment tend to be higher in states ex periencing higher levels of foreign direct investment and trade the effects of trad liberalization have varied widely among regions and while trade liberalization may narrow income disparities over the long run with other countries it ma indirectly lead to larger disparities in income levels within country studies have found that initial conditions in mexico determined which mexican states experienced stronger economic growth as result of nafta31 states with less developed infrastructure transportati on and communications did not receive the benefits from nafta as other states telecommunications infrastructure and human capital were especially important in determining the economic performance of individuals states the stat with more telephone serv ice and higher skilled labor force experienced more positive impacts northern and central states grew faster throughout the 1990s modestly reducing the in come differentials with those of the mexico city area poorer southern states grew slower during the same time period due to low levels of education infrastru cture and quality of local

agricultural sector in mexico and the perception that nafta has caused higher amount of worker displacement in the agricultural sector th an in other sectors of the economy while some of the changes in th agricultural sector are direct result of nafta as mexico faced increasing im port competition from the united states many of the changes are also attributable to mexicos unilateral agricultural reform measures mexico began to reform its ag ricultural sector in the 1980s most domestic agricultural and trade policy reform measures included privatization and resulted in increased competition mexicos unilatera l reform measures included eliminating state enterprises related to agriculture and removing staple price supports and subsidies33 with the reform of mexicos agrarian law lands that had been distributed to ejidos or community rural groups following the 1910 revolution gained the right to privatize another major reform was the abolishment of conasupo mexicos primary agency for government intervention in agriculture the agency bought staples from farmers at guaranteed prices and processed the products or sold them at low prices to processors nd consumers by 1999 the company was abolished34 many of mexicos domestic reforms in agriculture coincided with nafta negotiations beginning in 1991 nd continued beyond the implementation of nafta in 1994 the unilateral reforms in the agricultural sector make it difficult to separate those effects fro m the effects of nafta mexican productivity exports and prices with mexicos entry into nafta the expectation was that relative prices for certain mexican crops would decrease while prices for other crops would likely remain the same this was based on th economic expectation that by removing mexicos price and trade interventions in basic crops such as grains and oilseeds prices for the same goods in mexico and the united states would equalize prices for crops that were exported such as fruits and vegetables were expected to stay the same because these had not been subject to major government intervention before or since nafta nafta and mexicos internal reforms were expected to lead to the law of one price for all agricultural goods produced in north america this meant that prices for basic crops such as grains and oilseeds produced in mexico which previously had fixed prices by the gove rnment would decline as these goods faced competition from us goods nafta and agriculture reform measures were also expected to increase effici ency in mexicos agricultural production as farmers adjusted to

after nafta mexican prices of basi c crops such as maize dropped and subsequently mexican imports of those crops increased mexican agricultural production however did not decrease afte r nafta the mexican governments unilateral liberalization of corn and nafta were both factors in declining prices of corn in mexico in 1993 the price of co rn in mexico was 484 per bushel the price fell to 365

likely took place within the first ten years of implementation from 1993 to 2003 mexican exports to the united states in agricultural pr oducts increased fro m 27 billion in 1993 to 63 billion in 2003 while mexican exports to canada increased from 136 million to 409 million over the same time period mexican imports from the united states also increased during this time period from 36 billion in 1993 to 79 billion in 2003 mexican exports to the united states sharply increased in the following categories sugar and related products 595 beverages excluding fru it juices 584 and grains and feeds 328 us foreign direct investment in the mexican food processing industry more than doubled from 23 billion in 1993 to 57 billion in 200039 employment changes in agricultural employment in mexico since nafta implementation cannot be attributed entirely to trade lib eralization not only because of mexicos unilateral reform measures which coinci ded with nafta but also because these changes may result from the industrializati on process some economists argue that as countries become more industrialized agriculture plays smaller role in the economy and employs smaller share of th workforce one study covering 76 countries shows that 1 increase in per capita gdp is associated with reduction in agriculture valueadded as share of gdp by about 06 percentage points in south korea for example the ag ricultural share of gdp declined from about 25 in 1970 to 5 in 2000 due to rapid industrialization40 report by the institute for interna tional economics iie on the achievements and challenges of nafta discusses the ffect of nafta on the agricultural sector the report uses international comparisons that suggest that the mexican agricultural labor force as proportion of total labor was very high at the time of nafta and that many farmers were likely to lose thei r jobs as the country became more efficient in agricultural production the study cites an estimate that once all mexican tariffs were eliminated total farm employment in mexico would dec line by an estimated 800000 workers41 agricultural production in mexico has been increasingly centered on largescale farms factorytype livestock lots and capitalintensive food processing which puts pressure on sma llscale farms and household farmers in mexico another study states that the number of mexicans employed in rural agriculture declined from 81 million to 68 million and that the value added42 by mexican agriculture dropped from about 32 billion in 1993 to about 25 billion in 200343

not change significantly after nafta althoug h there were shifts in production as the agricultural sector adjusted to trad liberalization one study found that some commercial farmers shifted production from staple crops to crops for export purposes and that yields of basic crops increased after nafta but only for those crops grown under irrigated conditions44 the study states that mexicos productivity of irrigated lands increased after nafta but nonex port nonirrigated agriculture did not increase the study also cited disparity in agricultural productivity between the northern and southern states due to th poor transportation nd irrigation networks in the central and southern states of mexico making transportation costs very expensive another reason is access to credit those with small farms in the rural areas have difficulties finding access to cr edit without government guarantees mexican commercial banks often hesitate to provide loans because of the historically high default rate on agricultural loans to help address this problem the mexican government created financiera rural in 2002 which helps provide access to microcredits for farmers to buy mach inery equipment and technology45 the effect of nafta on ruralurban mig ration within mexico or on migration from mexico to the united states is difficult to quantify because of the various factors affecting migration mexican migration after nafta was affected by combination of higher efficiency in mexican agricultural productivity sectoral adjustments to trade as some sectors experienced higher growth than others urban growth in mexico and demands for unskilled labor in the united states study by the carnegie endowment for internationa l peace discusses the experience of mexico since the enactment of nafta the studys analysis focuses on people the communities they live in and the choices they make in response to their social and economic environment the study states that nafta accelerated the transition of mexico to liberalized economy but did not create the necessary conditions for the public and private sectors to respond to the economic social and environmental effects of increased trade with its nafta partners one of the studys conclusion is that naftas agricultural policies did not benefit subsistence farmers while providing larger commercial fa rmers with substantial support46 on the issue of mexicos demographi c patterns one study found that nafta has had minor role in mexicos ruralur ban migration the study argues that the observed trend of migration fro m rural areas of mexico to urban centers is directly the result of agricultural liberalization ho wever the study also notes that these migration patterns have been in place since 196047 therefore it is not

mexicos farming structure when pr oposing development policies48 mexican programs for farmers anticipating the possible effects of nafta on farmers the mexican government established the program of direct support for the countryside programa apoyos directos campo procampo in 1993 procampo provided income support to fa rmers over 15year transitional period through hectarebased direct payments to producers however budget austerity caused by mexicos 1995 peso crisis resulted in budget cuts for the program another mexican program alianza campo or alianza was created in 1995 to improve
