with respect to the eﬀects of tax reform on the level of saving first public dissaving in the form of federal budget deﬁcits reduces net national saving so if tax reform adds to the federal budget deﬁcit then everything else being equal tax reform would reduce net national savings second even if tax reform is revenue neutral the oﬀsetting nature of income and substitution eﬀects reduces the

the presidents advisory panel on tax reform was tasked to issue report with revenueneutral policy options for reforming the federal internal revenue code1 another major directive to the advisory panel was to recommend modifications to the tax system that would provide simple and straightforward ways for americans to save free of tax which they argue would increase saving in the united states in its november 2005 report the presidents panel presents two major options for reforming the federal tax system the first option is the simplified income tax plan sit2 this plan basically starts with the current federal income tax system and makes incremental changes albeit significant changes in some areas to achieve its stated goals of making the tax system simple fair and more conducive to savings and growth under this plan the various incentives for saving under current law would be replaced by three new and expanded saving programs save at work save for retirement and save for family and refundable savers tax credit this plan would also introduce more consistent treatment of savings held outside of taxpreferred accounts the plan would exclude 75 of the capital gains on sales of stock in us corporations and eliminate the taxation of corporate dividends earned in the united states the advisory panels second reform option is hybrid income and consumption tax called the growth and investment tax plan git basically it contains the same three new savings programs as under the simplified income tax and the refundable savers tax credit contributions under the save at work program under the git plan would be made on an aftertax basis rather than on pretax basis as would be the case under the sit plan unlike the first option where capital income from the corporate sector would be tax exempt or taxed at reduced rates at the individual level the git plan would impose 15 flat tax on all capital income from savings outside of these three new accounts as described in the panels report the growth and investment tax plan deviates from pure consumption tax by imposing this 15 tax on the return to savings on income earned outside of the three savings programs although the panel considered proposal for pure consumption tax which it called the progressive consumption tax plan that option was not included in the panels final recommendations to the president nevertheless some observers including several panel members believe that adopting pure consumption tax would be the best way to increase private saving

are many different rates of saving and alternative means of measuring them as result some discussions of the us saving rate essentially end up comparing apples and oranges 1 us president bush

is composed of two major parts private saving and public saving3 private saving can be further broken down into its components personal saving and business saving personal saving represents household aftertax income not used for consumption gross business saving represents the portion of aftertax profits retained after distribution of dividends and the funds set aside to replace plant and equipment that has worn out depreciated net business saving is calculated by subtracting depreciation the portion of gross savings that is applied towards replacing facilities and equipment that has worn out from retained earnings net private saving is the sum of personal saving and net business saving the second major component of total saving is public sector saving government saving public sector saving includes government at the federal state and local levels if the net budget position of the public sector is in surplus then the public sector is net saver if the net budget position of the public sector is in deficit then the public sector is net dissaver net national saving is the sum of net private saving and public saving it is important to note that net national saving can change increase or decrease if either net private saving or public saving changes g22g138g161g561g20g142g143g152g155g150g561g138g151g141g561g20g142g159g142g151g158g142g561g16g142g158g157g155g138g149g146g157g162g561 as outlined in the preceding paragraphs if there is an increase in the federal deficit then absent any offsetting changes net national saving will go down therefore the effects of tax reform on federal revenue will have direct bearing on the level of saving in the economy if under tax reform federal revenues fall and the deficit increases then net saving will decrease conversely if federal revenues rise and the deficit decreases then net saving will increase how do the advisory panels proposals affect federal revenue the panel was tasked to issue report with revenueneutral policy options for reforming the federal internal revenue code however the executive order establishing the advisory panel specifies neither the baseline nor the time horizon for achieving revenue neutrality the congressional budget office cbo produces baseline projections of the budget semi annually so that policymakers have common starting point from which to debate policy changes the purpose of the baseline is to project revenues and outlays under current law over the next 10 years cbo describes the baseline projection as benchmark for measuring the budgetary effects of proposed changes in federal revenues or spending by statute cbos baseline projections must estimate the future paths of federal spending and revenues under current law and policies the baseline is therefore not intended to be prediction of future budgetary outcomes instead it is meant to serve as neutral benchmark that lawmakers can use to measure the effects of proposed changes to spending and taxes so for that reason and others actual budgetary outcomes are almost certain to differ from cbos baseline projections 4 3 for more detailed discussion of saving as defined in the national income and product accounts and for discussion of saving as policy goal see crs report rl32119 can

under current law absent any changes over the next 10 years5 the advisory panel report however indicates that its reform plans meet the goal of revenue neutrality when compared to the administrations revenue baseline rather than the cbo baseline the administrations baseline assumes that the 200120032004 tax cuts will be made permanent and that all of the administrations fy2006 budget proposals affecting federal revenues are enacted the cbo baseline on the other hand assumes that the 200120032004 tax cuts will expire at the end of 2010 as is specified under current law in addition the cbo baseline does not include the administrations fy2006 budget proposals affecting revenues as result when compared to current law as defined in the cbo baseline the administrations baseline projects lower federal revenues over the next 10 years so when compared to the cbo revenue baseline the reform proposals will result in significant reduction in federal revenue over the next 10 years some analysts have calculated that the reform plans would reduce federal revenues by almost 14 trillion compared to the revenues under cbo current law baseline over the next 10 years 6

policy through incentives for saving or disincentives for borrowing can be used to influence the level of private saving this line of reasoning argues that saving incentives in the tax code will increase the aftertax return to saving and as result taxpayers would be willing to substitute future consumption saving for present consumption this substitution effect would cause aggregate private saving to rise there is an additional effect however that occurs simultaneously with this substitution effect that might actually cause the level of saving to decline an increase in the aftertax rate of return would mean that an individual could actually save less and still achieve the same level of consumption in the future in other words in addition to the substitution effect there is an income effect which makes an individual richer and could induce him to consume more in the present to fully appreciate the income and substitution effects associated with tax incentives for increased saving consider the following example assume that an individual has 28 marginal tax rate and invests 100 in an account paying 10 interest after five years the account will have grown to 14157 100 investment earning 72 interest after taxes for five years now consider what would happen if the tax on interest earnings were eliminated in this case the aftertax rate of return would increase from 72 to 10 as result of this increase in the aftertax rate of return the taxpayer might be expected to increase his savings and his future consumption by reducing current consumption continued

his savings account at the end of five years characteristic of target saver in this case since the aftertax rate of return on saving has gone up the taxpayer need only save 8790 to reach his goal 8790 at 10 interest would grow to 14157 after five years because the income effect associated with the tax incentive has made the taxpayer richer the taxpayer can actually reduce his savings by 1210 this example brings to light an important point with regard to the ultimate effects of tax incentives on the level of saving point which applies to incentives targeting both personal and business saving if tax incentive to promote private saving is deficit financed the revenue loss from the tax reduction on saving is not recouped by raising other taxes then the income effect may well dominate and the level of national saving could drop depending on how the tax incentive is designed the reduction might manifest itself directly as reduction in private saving or as reduction in both private and public saving for deficit financed tax incentive to increase total saving each dollar of tax reduction public dissaving would have to be matched by more than dollar increase in private saving only if the tax incentives for saving are fully tax financed the revenue loss from the saving incentive is made up by raising other taxes will the income effects be eliminated even under these conditions however the overall effectiveness of the tax incentives on the level of savings is unclear for example even if one switched from an income to consumptionbased tax the overall effect on the level of saving cannot be determined priori lifecycle models tend to predict an increase in saving in response to changing from an income to consumption tax these models show an increase in savings for two main reasons 7 first under consumption tax the old retirees who are dissavers because they are drawing down their accumulated capital to finance consumption would pay higher taxes and the young would pay lower taxes compared to what they would pay under an income tax in fact for young taxpayers consumption tax is the equivalent of exempting the rate of return on all savings from tax as discussed in the preceding paragraphs for the young this results in substitution effect and an income effect with the net effect of these two forces uncertain because of their higher taxes however retired workers would have to reduce their consumption in order to pay what amounts to double tax on their accumulated assets that is the income on their assets was taxed first when it was earned under the income tax and now both the income and the principal will be taxed again when spent under the consumption tax so while the effects on young taxpayers are uncertain retired taxpayers have to reduce consumption increase saving and the overall effect would tend to increase aggregate saving in the economy it is important to note however that any transition rules enacted to mitigate these increased taxes on the elderly would dampen the stimulus to new saving second the lifecycle models which show an incr ease in saving from switching from an income to consumption tax tend to rely on somewhat idealized assumptions for example they assume that all taxpayers have perfect information and the sophistication to map out their consumption 7 for more detailed discussion see crs report rl32603 the

believe that the tax system will not change over their lifetimes if these id ealized assumptions are relaxed then the effects on saving of switching from an income to consumption tax are inconclusive in addition the empirical evidence regarding the effect of tax incentives on saving is inconclusive for instance the economic tax recovery act of 1981 reduced marginal income tax rates expanded the availability of individual retirement accounts iras and accelerated depreciation deductions lifecycle models would predict that these changes would increase private savings but that did not happen 8 because of the inconclusive empirical evidence and the theoretical ambiguities it cannot be determined definitively that even switching to pure consumption tax would significantly increase the level of saving in the economy g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 gregg esenwein 8 see crs report rl32603 the flat tax valueadded tax and
