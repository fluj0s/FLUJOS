tritz specialists in social legislation domestic social policy division integrating medicare and medicaid services through managed care summary this report discusses efforts to improve the delivery of health and longterm care services for individuals who are dually enrolled in medicaid and medicare ie dual eligibles which generally includes the elderly and some individuals with disabilities dual eligibles are more likely than other medicare beneficiaries to be in fair or poor health cognitively andor functionally impaired and have more chronic ailments and conditions the medicaid and medicare programs that provide services to dual eligibles are administered by different units of government guided by different laws and regulations and cover different set of services for these individuals these differences can lead to fragmentation and inefficiencies some federal and state policymakers have tried to address these challenges and develop coordinated andor integrated approach to delivering medicare and medicaid services through managed care the program of allinclusive care for the elderly pace as well as state programs in arizona massachusetts minnesota new york texas and wisconsin are some of the managed care programs discussed in this report recently the medicare modernization act pl 108173 established the medicare special needs plan snp option which was intended to improve care coordination and service delivery for certain groups of medicare beneficiaries under the snp option medicare managed care plans are allowed to limit enrollment to certain types of beneficiaries such as dual eligibles snp plans may choose to better coordinate the care of dual eligibles by contracting with the state medicaid agency to also provide medicaid services but snp plans are not required to do so it is too soon to tell the extent to which the new snp option will actually increase participation in integrated medicaremedicaid managed care plans there are variety of challenges in developing enacting and implementing integrated medicare and medicaid programs the specific circumstances will vary by state but some of the challenges have included reconciling conflicting operational requirements between medicaid and medicare ensuring sufficient experience of managed care plans with the needs of dual eligibles and addressing provider and beneficiary resistance to managed care these and other challenges are discussed in this report finally this report describes policy considerations and legislation that have been introduced in this area during the last several sessions of congress recent interest in integrated managed care suggests that the 110th congress may consider expanding these plans to promote more efficient and costeffective delivery of health care for dual eligibles this report will be updated to reflect significant policy or programmatic changes at the national level contents introduction 1 rationale for integration through managed

managed care introduction this report discusses efforts to improve the delivery of health and longterm care services for nearly 7 million individuals nationwide who are enrolled in both medicare and medicaid known as dual eligibles1 there are several subcategories of dual eligibles although all duals receive medicarecovered services some receive full medicaid benefits and others receive only assistance with medicare cost sharing this report is focused on those dual eligibles who receive both medicare benefits and the full range of medicaid benefits offered in their state dual eligible beneficiaries are generally elderly or have significant disabilities and are more likely than other medicare beneficiaries to be in fair or poor health cognitively andor functionally impaired and have more chronic ailments and conditions dual eligibles also use disproportionate share of medicare and medicaid services in 2002 the most recent data available dual eligibles accounted for 16 of medicare beneficiaries and 22 of medicare spending2 for medicaid based on fy2003 data dual eligibles comprised 13 of medicaid beneficiaries and 41 of medicaid expenditures3 the medicare and medicaid programs are administered by different units of government guided by different laws and regulations and cover different set of services which can lead to fragmentation confusion and inefficiencies in the delivery of services for dual eligibles medicare is federally administered by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms medicare generally covers primary and acute care services eg physician hospital and limited set of long term care services eg postacute shortterm stays in skilled nursing facilities and postacute home health care services starting january 1 2006 medicare also began offering voluntary prescription drug coverage under new part d benefit dual eligibles were required to switch from medicaid to the new part d benefit to receive their prescription drugs4 1 crs

implications of the medicare continued crs2 medicaid is meanstested program administered by each state within broad federal guidelines medicaid benefits include primary and acute medical services as well as longterm care service within broad federal guidelines each state may define its own package of covered medical services resulting in considerable variation in the types of services covered across states in addition to choosing whether service is covered states may also limit the amount duration or scope of service meaning that they can limit the number of hours days or type of coverage for particular service for example state may specify that payment for inpatient hospital services cannot exceed 40 days of coverage in 12month period5 for dual eligibles if service is covered by medicare and medicaid medicare is the primary payer medicaid pays for services above and beyond what medicare covers referred to as wraparound coverage medicaid may also cover some beneficiary costsharing associated with particular medicare services for medicaid benefits that are not covered by medicare such as certain longterm care services medicaid covers the cost of these benefits unless there is another liable thirdparty payer medicaid is generally the payer of last resort table 1 below briefly describes various medicare and medicaid services that may be covered for dual eligible individuals full discussion of the rules and requirements for each service type is beyond the scope of this report table 1 comparison of coverage under medicare and medicaid for selected service types

medicaidbenefitsindexjspcfid5623668cftoken81000927 some federal and state policymakers have tried to address the challenges of the fragmentation in medicare and medicaid services by developing coordinated andor integrated approach to delivering both medicare and medicaid services through managed care this report 1 explains the rationale for integrated managed care programs and describes the various approaches to integration 2 reviews existing medicaremedicaid integration projects 3 outlines common challenges faced in developing these projects and 4 provides policy considerations for congress rationale for integration through managed care as described above the medicare and medicaid services that dual eligibles receive do not blend seamlessly with one another the programs almost always have different eligibility requirements and scope of coverage for the same or similar services as shown in table 1 above in some cases there are incentives for providers and payers to shift costs from one program to another eg moving an individual from medicaidfunded nursing home to medicarefunded hospital stay when an individual could have remained in nursing facility for treatment or unnecessarily placing an individual enrolled in medicare managed care plan in crs5 medicaidfunded nursing facility which may save dollars for one program but generate higher total expenditures on an individual than without the costshifting possible results of this fragmentation can include providers lacking information about the full range of services someone receives which could compromise health care decisionmaking and health outcomes fragmentation can also lead to cost inefficiencies in medicare and medicaid as well as beneficiary confusion about what is covered and by whom to improve coordination between medicare and medicaid one approach has been to integrate these two programs through managed care under managed care single entity managed care organization mco receives two fixed predetermined monthly payments ie the capitation rates these payments include one made by cms on behalf of the medicare program and the other made by the medicaid agency on behalf of the medicaid program there are different types of integration plans some plans developed by federal and state policymakers cover the full range of medicaid benefits others have excluded certain medicaid benefits from managed care eg longterm stays in nursing facility the managed care plans may also establish various clinical care coordination efforts to further integrate services and address an individuals health care needs such as developing an interdisciplinary care team examples of federal and state projects that integrate medicaid and medicare are provided later in this report the advantages cited by policymakers for integrating medicare and medicaid under managed care program are provided below readers should note that medicaremedicaid integration projects are not the only method of achieving these program improvements reducing fragmentation and improving service coordination removing the incentive to costshift from one program to another and increasing care accountability enhancing the quality of care and improving health outcomes increasing flexibility in the types of services that can be provided to beneficiaries focusing on prevention and care coordination activities in delivering health care services reducing hospitalization and nursing home use with more emphasis placed on home and communitybased supports and creating budget predictability for state medicaid agencies particularly in preparation for demographic changes with the aging of the population though supporters of integrated medicaremedicaid projects have cited many advantages managed care is not without opposition as discussed in more detail later in this report providers may have concerns about the additional requirements or financial impact of operating under managed care environment beneficiaries may be concerned that their ability to select provider will be restricted or they may have to change providers that cost considerations by the managed care plan will crs6 reduce the quality and availability of services and that the contracted managed care plans and available providers may lack knowledge and experience with the needs of dual eligibles many of whom have chronic health care conditions types of integration and federal authority the integration of medicare and medicaid can occur through various contractual arrangements between the federal and state governments and the mco6 in some cases the state will initiate an integrated medicare and medicaid program require that medicaid managed care plans also become medicareapproved plans and develop contractual relationship or agreement with cms to coordinate both medicare and medicaid requirements eg memorandum of agreement between the state and cms in other cases the managed care plan initiates an integrated medicare and medicaid program without coordinated effort by cms and the state to streamline the requirements of medicaid and medicare operations7 in cases where the managed care plan is initiating the integration project the state and cms must still be willing to contract with and work with the plan to successfully implement the project most managed care programs in medicaid and medicare including medicaremedicaid integration projects require some form of federal approval under one of several possible authorities certain types of federal approval will occur more quickly than others brief discussion of each managed care authority is provided below as well as the program options for managed care for dual eligibles under medicaid managed care programs are available using the following program authorities prepaid health plans these are generally used if state wants to include only few services in managed care plan enrollment in the program must be voluntary section 1915a or section 1932 of the social security act these authorities include managed care options that are available under the medicaid state plan they do not require waiver enrollment in managed care programs for dual eligibles must be voluntary under these authorities section 1915b waiver of the social security act this waiver allows states to require that dually eligible individuals enroll in managed care program to receive their services the waiver must be costeffective over twoyear period section 1115 waiver of the social security act this waiver authority is very broad in this context it allows states to expand 6 in this report the discussion of managed care plans includes pace programs because they operate under capitated payment methodology 7 for more detailed discussion of

program by definition medicaremedicaid integration project is described in more detail below though not specific managed care authority section 1915c of the social security act has been combined with one of the authorities listed above to provide home and communitybased longterm care services under managed care environment several states minnesota and texas for example have received approval for these types of combination waivers eg section 1915ac or section 1915bc waivers enrollment in medicare managed care programs must be voluntary for all beneficiaries medicare managed care programs can be developed under the following program authorities medicare advantage medicare advantage ma is the voluntary managed care option under medicare law part c of title xviii of the social security act managed care plans that apply to cms to become an ma plan must provide all medicarecovered items and services including in most cases prescription drugs for enrollees generally ma plans have been

medicaremedicaid integration projects this section describes managed care enrollment for dual eligibles generally under medicaid and medicare under medicaid managed care has become fairly widely accepted service delivery system for many medicaid beneficiaries in june 2004 only three states alaska new hampshire and wyoming did not enroll beneficiaries in some form of medicaid managed care in june 2004 61 of medicaid beneficiaries were enrolled in some form of managed care many states 23 in june 2004 however continue to exclude dual eligibles from managed care enrollment11 nationwide about 35 of dual eligibles in fy2003 the most recent data available were enrolled in some form of medicaid managed care program12 see figure 1 10 refers to section 222 of the social security amendments of

under medicaid managed care to acute and primary care services eg physicians hospital few states however also deliver longterm care services through managed care in 2004 an estimated 23 of individuals receiving longterm care were receiving these services through managed care including both dual eligibles and nondual eligibles13 because nearly 70 of medicaid expenditures for dual eligibles is spent on longterm care services states developing integrated medicaremedicaid programs have significant financial incentive to include longterm care services in the scope of covered benefits under managed care where their exposure to expenditures is limited to monthly capitation payment however as discussed in more detail later in this report most managed health care companies have limited experience in managing longterm care services under medicare though managed care options have been available under the program since the early 1980s the percentage of medicare beneficiaries enrolled has been much lower than that of medicaid since enrollment in managed care must be voluntary to encourage enrollment some managed care plans offer beneficiaries supplemental benefits eg eyeglasses dental

rates under medicaid and medicare as described earlier in medicaremedicaid integration projects managed care plan becomes both medicaid managed care plan and medicare managed care plan the mco receives two fixed predetermined monthly payments ie the capitation rates from the state medicaid agency and cms to provide the medicaid and medicare services beneficiary needs although the plan may operate as an integrated plan the managed care plan must follow separate requirements for medicaid and medicare to become an approved managed care plan plans are also paid through separate medicare and medicaid payment mechanisms which use different methodologies to set capitation payments for an individual additional details about the bidding and ratesetting process for medicaid and medicare are described below for medicaid the process to select managed care plan and the methodology to set the capitation payment rate vary widely by state most states issue request for proposal rfp that outlines the features of the proposed managed care program eg covered beneficiaries and services required grievance and appeal processes required provider networks interested managed care plans submit proposals to the state in response to the rfp from those responses the state selects the managed care organizations and awards it medicaid managed care contract to provide the medicaid services specified in the rfp often states enter into multiyear contracts with these organizations some states allow for public comment period while developing an rfp others do not the process for establishing the capitation rates for medicaid also varies widely by state federal law and regulation require that the capitation payments meet an actuarial soundness requirement and are approved by cms so long as the capitation payment meets these two requirements the state has significant amount of flexibility in how it establishes and negotiates the payment rates for specific year for example states may use different data sources to establish baseline medical costs or different factors to account for medical inflation among providers some states adjust the payment rates to account for disability or institutional status or pregnancy others only consider demographic factors such as age and gender some states have collaborative process between the state and the managed care plan to 14 s peterson

medicaid services apr 2006 crs11 establish the payment rates in other states plans are less involved in the rate development process16 under medicare beginning in 2006 medicare advantage ma plans are selected through federally administered bidding process an organization applying to become an ma plan submits an annual application to cms that meets certain requirements and bid of the expected costs for providing services in specific geographic area the bid includes the costs of providing medicare part and b benefits part d prescription drugs if applicable and supplemental benefits if any including reductions in cost sharing cmss payment to an ma organization for an ma plans coverage of medicare part and b ab benefits depends on the relationship of the plans bid to an established benchmark for that geographic area for ma plans with basic ab bid below the benchmark cms will pay the ma organization the basic ab bid amount adjusted by the individual enrollees risk factor plus the rebate amount the individual enrollees risk factor is determined using cmsdeveloped model that accounts for individual differences in health status known as the hierarchical condition category cmshcc model the rebate part of the payment is 75 of the difference between the plan bid and benchmark and is used to provide mandatory supplemental benefits or reductions in part b or part d premiums cms retains the other 25 for plan with bid equal to or above its benchmark cms pays the ma organization the plan benchmark adjusted by the individual enrollees risk factor using the cmshcc model in addition cms pays the bid amount if any for part d basic coverage17 medicare special needs plans and passive enrollment as discussed above the medicare modernization act of 2003 mma created new type of medicare advantage ma plan known as the special needs plan snp snps must follow all of the ma program rules but are permitted to limit enrollment to certain categories of medicare beneficiaries including 1 dual eligibles 2 individuals with severe and disabling chronic health care conditions and 3 those who are institutionalized previously medicare managed care plans had to enroll all medicare beneficiaries and could not limit enrollment to certain population though plans are not required to integrate with state medicaid programs the snp option was intended to improve care coordination for individuals with complex health care needs one approach to increased care coordination would be the development of medicaremedicaid integration projects which the snp option facilitates 16 g catterrall et rate setting and actuarial soundness in medicaid managed care report for the association for community affiliated plans and the medical health plans of america jan 23

permitted subset of snps 42 plans in 13 states to passively enroll dual eligible individuals into the plans medicare snp program if the individual was already enrolled in the plans medicaid managed care plan the passive enrollment process was onetime event that was part of the implementation of the new medicare drug benefit dual eligibles were moved from the medicare fee forservice system into medicare snp starting on january 1 2006 individuals could opt out of passive enrollment and switch to another prescription drug plan and back to the medicare feeforservice system for other medicare services the passive enrollment process significantly increased the level of beneficiary participation in single plan with both medicare and medicaid contract some of these plans are making concerted effort to integrate medicare and medicaid services18 the snp market is in the early stages of development in 2006 276 snps participated with plans available in some areas of 41 states and puerto rico most of the snp plans in 2006 focused on dual eligibles19 however it is unclear how many of the snp plans are contracting with both cms and state medicaid agency or intend to do so in the future and to what extent the medicare and medicaid services are delivered in an integrated manner summary of medicaremedicaid integration projects several federal and state programs currently offer integrated medicare and medicaid services20 each of these programs is described in more detail below program of allinclusive care for the elderly pace the program of allinclusive care for the elderly pace covers an integrated set of medicare and medicaid services including both acute and longterm care for program participants pace was initially authorized by congress as demonstration in 1986 however the balanced budget act of 1997 bba97 pl 10533 established pace as permanent option under both medicaid and medicare unlike other state integration programs the pace program operates under coordinated set 18 the pennsylvania health law project filed class action lawsuit against cms for allowing plans to passively enroll beneficiaries into medicare managed care under the lawsuits settlement agreement

under managed care but these programs were generally not integrated with medicaid managed care these demonstrations included the two social health maintenance organization shmoi and shmoii demonstrations and evercare all of these demonstrations have become medicare special needs plans snps and are longer demonstrations for additional information see httpwwwcmshhsgovdemoprojects

individuals qualify for pace if they reside in pace service area are aged 55 or older and meet nursing facility level of care the pace program is modeled after the on lok demonstration in san francisco california21 the pace staff includes an interdisciplinary team of staff physicians nurses social workers case managers and other professionals pace services are generally delivered at specific site that is also an adult day center but may also be supplemented by in home services or referrals22 the medicare capitation payment methodology for pace differs from the methodology used for other medicare advantage organizations discussed earlier in this report the medicare capitation payment for pace is based on combination of two formulas 1 county rate multiplied by uniform demographic pace frailty adjuster to account for functional limitations such as eating or walking and 2 riskadjusted payment methodology used by the general medicare advantage program23 the medicare capitation payment for pace along with three state integration projects discussed later in this report is in the process of transitioning to the methodology of the overall medicare advantage program based on 100 risk adjustment cms is still determining whether an additional frailty factor will be applied to all medicare advantage plans in the future under the medicaid program the monthly capitation rate is negotiated between the pace provider and the state medicaid agency and is specified in the contract between them24 because pace enrollees regularly attend adult day centers where pace services are provided and because of the interdisciplinary staffing model most pace sites are generally implemented in urban areas and enrollment is limited to few hundred individuals at each site as of november 2005 there were 34 pace sites nationwide enrolling about 11200 individuals25 to promote the development of additional pace sites in rural areas the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109 171 established grant program for up to 15 pilot pace providers in rural areas 21 for full history of pace see httpwwwnpaonlineorgwebsitearticleaspid12 22 an adult day center refers to services

pace sites for additional details see httpwwwnpaonlineorgwebsitearticleaspid71 crs14 state integration programs several states have also developed medicaremedicaid integration projects for dual eligibles26 these programs vary in design and in the scope of services covered some states such as arizona and texas have mandatory medicaid managed care programs that enroll both dual eligible and nondual beneficiaries some of the participating managed care plans may also offer companion medicare managed care plan for dual eligibles the managed care plan is responsible for integrating the services for dual eligibles at the plan level even though the plan may be responsible for integrating services the state must be willing to contract with the plan for the medicaid services and may have requirements in the medicaid contract that plan become certified as medicare advantage plan other states such as wisconsin minnesota and massachusetts have developed voluntary medicaremedicaid integration projects and have actively worked with cms to streamline medicare and medicaid requirements for participating plans by developing formal agreements between the state and cms in these projects the state requires that participating plans are approved as both medicaid and medicare managed care plans these and other operational state integration projects are discussed in more detail below arizona health care costcontainment system ahcccs arizona operates statewide mandatory managed care program for most medicaid beneficiaries referred to as the arizona health care costcontainment system ahcccs arizona also has separate component of ahcccs for those who qualify for longterm care services known as the arizona longterm care system altcs collectively these programs cover most medicaid services through managed care27 in the fall of 2005 cms allowed six medicare advantage snp ma snp plans in arizona to passively enroll any dual eligible in medicare managed care if the individual was enrolled in that same organization under medicaid managed care plan dual eligibles who do not opt out of passive enrollment will be enrolled in the same managed care plan for both their medicare and medicaid services several of these plans are actively integrating both medicare and medicaid services for these individuals in spring 2006 arizona issued solicitation to recompete the managed care contracts with plans to implement and operate altcs as part of that solicitation arizona required that managed care plans either become an ma snp or have formal relationship with an ma or ma snp organization to improve care coordination for dual eligibles28 in may 2006 arizona awarded contracts to eight managed care plans under this solicitation to provide altcs services 26 some of these projects also enroll nondual medicaidonly beneficiaries 27 see httpwwwahcccsstateazuspublicationsoverview2004contentsasp 28 see httpwwwazahcccsgovcontractingbidderslibraryaltcsconferencealtcs_

be ma plans and that individuals enroll in the same managed care company for their medicare and medicaid services as part of massachusettss program cms under section 222 demonstration authority permitted the medicare capitation payment to be calculated using the pace program methodology applying frailty adjuster to account for the increased level of impairment among enrollees29 similar to

include frailty adjuster minnesota senior health options msho and disability health options mndho for nearly 10 years minnesota has operated voluntary integrated medicare and medicaid projects one initiative for the elderly msho starting in 1997 and another for adults with disabilities mndho starting in 2001 the minnesota integration projects cover all medicare services and most medicaid acute and longterm care services similar to massachusetts the medicare capitation payment uses the pace payment methodology described earlier under the authority of section 222 demonstration the additional frailty adjuster will also be phased out effective december 31 2007 in 2005 msho expanded to become statewide option for beneficiaries though msho is voluntary individuals who do not choose msho are required to enroll in another medicaid managed care program for adults with severe disabilities under age 65 mndho is voluntary alternative to the medicaid feeforservice system and is available in seven counties in 2006 all participating msho and mndho plans became medicare snps under an agreement between the state and cms these medicare managed care plans are permitted to continue operating separate programs for the elderly and adults with disabilities through december 200730 following the medicare passive enrollment process for dual eligibles described earlier in this report msho

medicaid program this plan provides all medicare services and certain medicaid services including most acute care services not covered by medicare and limited set of longterm care services32 participating plans must be both medicare advantage and medicaid managed care plans the medicaid advantage program is available statewide and in march 2006 enrolled about 3800 dual eligibles33 texas

the program covers most medicaid recipients who are elderly or have disabilities in harris county which includes houston as of june 2004 texas starplus enrolled about 52900 individuals including both dual eligibles and nondual eligibles dual eligibles have the choice between two medicaid managed care plans both of the plans are also certified as medicare snps and receive medicare capitation rate to cover all medicare services34 enrollment in the medicare managed care portion is voluntary to encourage beneficiary participation the plans and the state highlight the additional prevention and care coordination activities that are available if dual eligible enrolls in the companion medicare plan for his or her medicare services in fall 2005 20000 dual eligibles who were participating in texas starplus were passively enrolled into their companion medicare managed care plan35 texas starplus was slated for expansion to all the states urban areas but ultimately was not approved by the state legislature because the expansion efforts would have made urban hospitals ineligible for approximately 75 million per year in funds generated through the federal upper payment limit upl

these plans may not be distinguishable from nonintegrated plans for example several large medicaid managed care organizations have become medicare snps in hawaii oregon arizona and rhode island41 it is unclear what level of integration this will bring some plans may be covering both medicare and medicaid services but not integrating those services through coordinated delivery system for example the medicaid and medicare services may be delivered by different organizational units of the plan the scope of services may also differ plans in the states discussed earlier are providing and integrating both acute and some longterm care services however plans in other states may be solely focused on integrating acute care services with longterm care services still provided through the medicaid feeforservice system finally private nonprofit organization the center for health care strategies inc awarded funding to five states florida minnesota new mexico new york and washington to integrate the financing delivery and administration of primary acute longterm care and behavioral health services the initiative is focused on beneficiaries who are elderly and those with disabilities who are either enrolled in medicaid or are dual eligible some of these states have existing projects that they are expanding others are in the initial stages of development results of integration projects the studies evaluating integrated medicare and medicaid programs have been somewhat limited in the length of the evaluation period but have generally evaluated broad range of topics eg cost utilization consumer satisfaction this report focuses on the available outcomes related to service utilization cost and mortality generally evaluations of medicaremedicaid integration projects have shown decreased utilization of highcost services such as emergency room hospital and nursing facility services and increased access to home and communitybased long term care services evaluations of the fiscal impact of these programs have been inconclusive in some cases expenditures were higher than feeforservice comparison group in other cases the net cost was comparable there were savings to medicare that were offset by higher medicaid expenditures42 in the area of mortality results were mixed in evaluations of pace and the wpp program the mortality rates for pace enrollees and younger adults with disabilities in wpp were lower than for comparison groups4344 an evaluation of minnesotas msho program found differences in mortality rates for msho 41 j packertursman regence balks at

group the evaluation did however find significant differences in the reported burden of family caregivers with the families of msho enrollees having more positive outcomes45 challenges in developing medicaremedicaid integration projects this section discusses common challenges in developing integrated medicare and medicaid programs though specific circumstances will vary by state and by program46 the description of challenges is not intended to presuppose that managed care is preferable to the traditional feeforservice approach while reducing fragmentation of services and increasing care coordination seem to be worthy policy goals other factors eg freedom of choice in ones provider must also be evaluated47 level of state investment and expected returns on investment though states may see benefit from the greater budget predictability and accountability through managed care the available studies indicate that cost savings for dual eligibles will likely be realized by medicare andor the managed care plan because of the lower utilization of primarily medicarefunded services eg emergency room inpatient hospital and shortterm nursing facility stays and the increased utilization of medicaidfunded home and communitybased long term care services eg personal care and medicaid home and communitybased waiver services48 depending upon the structure of the program states may see some medicaid savings if there are reductions in longterm nursing facility stays under these integrated programs or if the medicare capitation payment results in coverage of supplemental services that otherwise would have been covered by medicaid in addition to issues related to the impact of these programs on the medicaid budget developing medicaremedicaid integration projects takes substantial investment in state time and resources for the existing state projects that required federal waivers for medicaid under section 1115 or medicare under section 222 45 r kane et outcomes of managed care

concerns about managed care see r kronick waiting for godot wishes and worries in managed care journal of health politics policy and law vol 24 5 oct 1999 pp 10991106 48 states that also include elderly and those with disabilities who are not dual eligibles may realize savings from lower utilization in medicaidfunded highcost highintensity services eg hospital crs20 the federal approval process took several years with the availability of the medicare snp option federal approval for the medicare managed care program may happen significantly faster than in the past for medicaid in states that are interested in pursuing integration projects in which medicaid enrollment would be mandatory or would have other features that require federal waiver the investment of time and resources may still be considerable for integration projects with voluntary enrollment federal approval may happen more quickly because of the various medicaid managed care options under the state plan beyond the time it takes to receive federal approval for integrated programs state may also need to become familiar with the medicare managed care rules and regulations and may have to determine how to structure the delivery of longterm care services in managed care environment eg service requirements quality assurance mechanisms availability of qualified plans rate setting and compatibility with states existing home and communitybased waiver programs under section 1915c of the social security act though many states are familiar with the delivery of acute care services via managed care fewer states have experience with managed longterm care services which has different infrastructure set of providers and constituencies than the acute care system conflicting medicare and medicaid requirements other significant challenges include the conflicting requirements between medicare and medicaid law and the differing requirements for program administration such as enrollment and disenrollment policies beneficiary marketing grievance and appeal processes payment schedules quality requirements oversight and data collection these conflicts in some cases pose barriers to operating integrated medicaremedicaid programs recently cms states and other technical assistance providers have been working to address these conflicts by identifying specific areas of conflict and posing administrative solutions some areas can be addressed by cms through its administrative or regulatory authority and other areas may require legislation to resolve the issues for example integrated medicaremedicaid managed care plans are subject to separate auditing requirements under medicare as conducted by cms or cms contractors and medicaid as conducted by the state medicaid agency andor the state health department cms and the state could consider streamlining or coordinating the audits to make the process more efficient once these issues are addressed second step will be to ensure that there is consistent application across cms regional offices since some of the decisionmaking authority for these types of programs resides in each regional office some of these issues have been addressed in administrative guidance issued by cms in july 2006 cms released several how to guides for states and managed care plans that are implementing medicaremedicaid integration projects the guides address the areas of enrollment marketing and quality and are intended to clarify crs21 medicare and medicaid rules and suggest processes that states and the plans can use to fulfill medicare and medicaid requirements49 the issue of conflicting requirements does not apply to pace demonstrations the pace sites follow separate administrative review process and have separate statutory and regulatory guidance managed care payment rates the ratesetting process for integrated medicare and medicaid projects may be difficult for some states to develop the state may not know the details of the medicare contract eg what the plan submitted as bid and what supplemental benefits the plan might offer states may have difficulty determining how the plans medicare managed care bid fits with what the state would be paying the plan for its medicaid services this is complicated by the fact that the current medicare advantage payment methodology is changing starting in 2004 ma payments began including riskadjustment factor calculated by the cms hierarchical condition category or hcc model the cmshcc model continues to be updated and refined50 another challenge is that while many states are familiar with setting managed care rates for acute care services they may not have experience in ratesetting that includes longterm care services which has different utilization pattern and different set of providers some questions may include the following how should the state account for individual differences in health status through risk adjustment for the elderly and those with disabilities how can available data sources be used to inform the ratesetting process for longterm care51 in addition states may want to build certain policy incentives into the rates for example to serve individuals in the community instead of in an institution addressing these issues may pose challenge for some states federal waiver approval if the states proposed program requires waiver of medicaid law primarily for those programs with mandatory enrollment one of the challenges states face is how proposed medicaremedicaid integration project can meet any budgetneutrality or costeffectiveness requirements associated with waiver generally budget neutrality or costeffectiveness requirements do not consider savings to medicare as offsetting any increases in medicaid expenditures the fiscal impacts of the program 49 see httpwwwcmshhsgovdualeligible04_integratedmedicareandmedicaidmodels asp 50 see httpwwwcmshhsgovmedicareadvtgspecratestatsdownloadsannouncement

medicare are evaluated separately as described earlier it is not clear that medicaid costs decrease under medicaremedicaid integration projects willingness of medicare advantage plan to contract with the state medicaid agency some medicare advantage plans including snps may not be interested in participating in riskbased contract for medicaid services such as longterm care these plans may focus efforts on solely delivering medicare services and rely on medicaid feeforservice to provide wraparound benefits the specific reasons will vary but some of the concerns in contracting with the state could include limited experience with covering longterm care which has different financial risks providers service requirements and beneficiary concerns than acute care services limited familiarity or experience with medicaid contracting rules or states administrative processes the potential for or frequency of changes to the states medicaid program rates benefit package the expected level of enrollment which may not be sufficient to take on the financial risk of participation particularly if the program has voluntary enrollment and the level of medicaid managed care rates or the ratesetting methodology ability of medicaid longterm care providers to meet managed care requirements and cover acute and primary services public or private organizations with experience in providing longterm care services may be interested in becoming managed care plan under an integrated medicaremedicaid program however these providers may have limited experience with operating managed care plan or covering acute and primary services developing knowledge and expertise in these areas may take significant investment of time and resources some of these areas include 1 managing financial risk for various types of services ie primary acute and longterm care 2 developing and administering operation and information systems that gather analyze and report how participants are using covered services and 3 establishing process to allocate resources under managed care for those groups that have experience with medicaid managed care there may be other areas of knowledge and investment needed to become qualified medicare advantage plan for example the organization may have to become familiar with the medicare bidding process and meet other medicare requirements such as having crs23 certain amount of available capital in the organization and meeting minimum enrollment thresholds52 provider issues upper payment limit policies and managed care under the medicaid program states have broad flexibility in determining the payment rates for medicaid providers however the total payments to hospitals and nursing facilities cannot exceed an upper payment limit upl which is the rate that medicare would have paid federal regulations outline the methodology states must use to report expenditures to ensure that medicaid expenditures do not exceed the upl limits some states have also used these upl provisions to draw down additional federal medicaid funding53 under current federal guidelines states are not permitted to collect this additional funding by applying the upl to medicaid managed care rates under managed care program states andor providers would be required to forego the additional federal medicaid dollars generated through upl funding arrangements this loss of federal funding could provide significant disincentive to states and providers to develop or participate in managed care programs54 alternatively lower inpatient hospital and emergency room utilization have been sources of savings for medicaremedicaid integration projects though these savings largely accrue to medicare for dual eligibles55 in considering these integration projects state will have to consider the following how much if any additional federal upl funding would be lost by implementing medicaremedicaid integration project what if any impact would there be on public hospitals what would be the expected cost or savings to the state budget in texas which was considering statewide expansion of its integrated managed care program the loss of federal revenue generated through upl payments would have decreased funding to hospitals by approximately 75 million per year 52 pers communication m bella and l palmer 53 for additional information see crs report rl31021 medicaid upper payment limits and intergovernmental transfers current issues and recent regulatory and legislative action by elicia j herz 54 this issue is not unique to integrated medicaremedicaid projects these requirements also apply to other medicaid managed care programs some states implementing managed care have received waivers from cms under section 1115 of the social security act which has allowed them to preserve upl funding 55 if the medicaid managed care program also includes nondual eligibles savings would accrue to medicaid since the services normally covered by medicare for dual eligibles eg hospital stays would be covered by medicaid crs24 and was significant enough barrier to block the proposed expansion of its integrated managed care program5657 other provider concerns in other cases providers have been resistant to developing integrated medicaremedicaid managed care programs there are concerns that the programs would change the patientprovider relationship increase the providers administrative burden move the payment authority from the state agency or legislature to managed care plan58 or impose more requirements for payment than existed under the feeforservice system some of these concerns were expressed by the texas medical association tma in the recent proposed expansion of texas starplus excerpted below while physicians support elements of starplus such as better integration and management of the continuum of care for eligible patients tma and local medical societies do not believe that another medicaid managed care model can be integrated into the system without causing it to collapse in areas with medicaid managed care already physicians and health care providers are already at their breaking points the expansion of starplus or other medicaid managed care pilots will exacerbate existing medicaid provider shortages for example if expanded physicians in dallas would have to contend with star the physical health medicaid managed care program northstar the medicaid behavioral health pilot chip and starplus each of the programs has different administrative and claims payment requirements adding complexity to system few physicians are willing to navigate today59 providers also have concerns that the programs would affect their current funding or service delivery system for example in 2005 californias state budget proposed piloting an integrated medicaremedicaid program in three counties one of the concerns raised about the proposal was that the new program would disrupt the existing countybased inhome supportive services program ihss60 this concern was significant factor in changing the proposal released in the 2006 budget which now proposes to integrate all medicare and medicaid services except countybased ihss services in some states groups representing the nursing home industry have also expressed concerns about managed care programs that include longterm care services these types of programs have generally been shown to decrease nursing home utilization and increase the availability and provision of home and community based services groups representing the nursing home industry may express concerns if in their view such programs would divert money that would otherwise be spent 56 httpwwwhhscstatetxuspubs022305_fippmcehtml 57

on nursing facility services or if they have concerns that the negotiating power of the plan would lower payment rates attractiveness of managed care to beneficiaries as described earlier medicare beneficiaries generally can voluntarily choose whether to enroll in medicare managed care states offering integrated medicaremedicaid programs have either voluntary enrollment or mandatory medicaid enrollment with incentives to voluntarily enroll in companion medicare managed care plan in massachusetts certain medicaid benefits eg vision dental maintained in the medicaremedicaid integrated senior care options program were cut from the feeforservice program making the integrated medicaremedicaid program more attractive to beneficiaries61 some possible concerns of dual eligibles about joining managed care program may include 1 the limitations to an individuals choices and flexibility in the services he or she receives 2 the expertise of the managed care plan about disability and chronic conditions 3 the breadth and scope of covered benefits 4 the continuity with existing physiciansservice providers and 5 the concern that the plans financial incentives for savings will ultimately result in limiting services and quality policy considerations for congress looking at the challenges in developing integrated medicaid and medicare programs there may be opportunities for further policy exploration it should be noted that action in any of these areas would need to be weighed against prevailing fiscal constraints efforts to ensure fiscal accountability since servicespecific utilization information may be less available under managed care and possible conflicts with other important societal goals such as maintaining beneficiary choice over his or her health care provider with these qualifications the following are offered as brief illustrations of policy options that congress could consider as part of its interest in and oversight of this area conducting evaluations and developing recommendations for regulatory andor statutory changes adding statutory language or explicit waiver or demonstration authority to both medicaid and medicare law to allow for these types of programs under single authority giving states the option to require dual eligibles to enroll in managed care projects that integrate with medicare through medicaid state plan option streamlining federal oversight andor administration of these demonstrations to avoid conflicting requirements providing development grants and technical assistance to states 61 p saucier

several bills have been introduced during the last several congresses to encourage the development of integrated medicaremedicaid programs for example in the 109th congress senator grassley introduced s 1602 the improving longterm care choices act of 2005 which included provisions to require the secretary of the department of health and human services to consult with stakeholders and issue regulations to remove administrative barriers to integration of medicare and medicaid for dual eligibles the legislation also would have required the secretary to submit recommendations to congress on how to remove statutory barriers to integration this bill was referred to the senate finance committee in the 108th congress the medicare special needs plan was enacted as part of the mma in addition senator baucus introduced s 2562 the medicare quality improvement act of 2004 which would have required the medicare payment advisory commission medpac to study and report on care coordination programs for individuals dually eligible for medicaid and medicare the study and report were to include the impact of care coordination programs on beneficiaries and on the cost and savings to medicare and medicaid including whether any savings from care coordination programs are counted as benefit to either program this bill was referred to the senate finance committee in the 106th congress representative stark introduced hr 4981 the chronic illness care improvement act of 2000 this legislation would have added specific waiver authority under medicare and medicaid to establish coordinated integrated crs27 projects for dual eligibles this provision would have allowed medicare managed care rules to be waived to permit greater coordination with medicaid and would have mandated that the costeffectiveness test be evaluated using the cost and savings attributable to both the medicare and medicaid programs this bill was referred to the house subcommittee on health and environment crs28 appendix states with legislative action to consider or enact an integrated medicaremedicaid program california the california state budget for 2005 and 2006 proposed an integrated medicaid and medicare program for dual eligibles the program would have been piloted in three counties in the state the 2005 proposal resulted in significant concerns by the countybased inhome support providers the revised 2006 budget proposed an integrated medicaremedicaid managed care plan that does not include countybased inhome support services6263 florida as part of floridas efforts to restructure its medicaid program the state is also developing an integrated managed care program for the elderly in january 2006 florida submitted medicaid waiver application to cms to create the florida senior care program which would contract with managed care programs to provide all medicaid services cover all medicare copayments and deductibles and coordinate with medicare services florida senior care would be piloted in two areas of the state and would enroll most medicaid beneficiaries aged 60 or older one pilot area would have mandatory enrollment the other would have voluntary enrollment at this point it is unclear to what extent the managed care plans will also become medicare advantage plans if the plans become ma plans additional integration may occur at the plan level
