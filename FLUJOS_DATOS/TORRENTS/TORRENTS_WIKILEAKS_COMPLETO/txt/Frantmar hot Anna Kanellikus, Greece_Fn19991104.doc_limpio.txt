to file note date 4 november 1999 from tia healy trust department telephon345 949 7212 fax 345 949 0993 subject frantmar trust conversation with sabina duerr gerber 4 november 1999 145pm jbtc office george town i expressed my concern at the situation regarding the interest payments being received into the company account and mentioned that i thought it would be preferable if mrs k opened personal bank account in zurich and that the payments could come from there sabina said that she thought that mrs k would be very reluctant to open personal account and that it was unlikely that she would be happy having payments made form greece to personal account in switzerland i was worried that it might then appear that frantmar v was making the loan to the greek companies as they were paying the interest to frantmar sabina assured that there were also written loan agreements between mrs k and the greek companies and that she expressly asked them to pay the interest to frantmar v we must therefore resolve to accept the payments as additions to the trust according to sabina mrs k hopes to be able to repay the loans in full in due course tia healy
