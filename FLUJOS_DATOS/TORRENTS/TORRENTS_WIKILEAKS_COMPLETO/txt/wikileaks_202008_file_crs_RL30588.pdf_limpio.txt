stabilize afghanistan are increasingly negative to the point where some senior us officials say they are not sure the effort is winning these assessments emphasize an expanding militant presence in some areas previously considered secure and increased numbers of civilian and military deaths both the official us as well as outside assessments increasingly point to pakistans failure to prevent taliban and other militant infiltration into afghanistan as cause of the security deterioration the bush administration has concluded several recent reviews of us strategy and has made actionable recommendations to the incoming obama administration which is expected to favor greater emphasis on afghanistan and to revamp us strategy there appears to be little clear consensus on new strategy although most us officials and commanders agree that u s strategy must go beyond adding us troops to include enhancing nonmilitary steps such as economic development and improved coordination among international donors building local governing structures and reform of the afghan central government the bush administration also increased direct us action against militant concentrations inside pakistan growing component of us strategy is to try to compel the afghan government to redress its widely acknowledged corruption and lack of capacity which is causing popular disillusionment however some experts believe there is substantial progress to build on including completion of the posttaliban political transition with the convening of parliament following parliamentary elections in september 2005 presidential ections in october 2004 and adoption of new constitution in january 2004 the parliament has become an arena for formerly armed factions to resolve differences as well as center of political pressure on president hamid karzai afghan citizens including women are enjoying personal freedoms forbidden by the taliban with international and afghan criticism of karzais leadership growing he will be tested politically in the presidential and provincial elections planned for the fall of 2009 and parliamentary and district elections are to follow one year later although possibly subject to security conditions the united states and partner countries now deploy 51000 troop na toled international security assistance force isaf that commands peacekeeping

durrani afghanistan was territory inhabited by tribes and tribal confederations linked to neighboring nations not distinct entity king amanullah khan 19191929 launched attacks on british forces in afghanistan shortly after taking power and won complete independence from britain as recognized in the treaty of rawalpindi august 8 1919 he was considered secular modernizer presiding over government in which all ethnic minorities participated he was succeeded by king mohammad nadir shah 19291933 and then by king mohammad zahir shah zahir shahs reign 1933 1973 is remembered fondly by many older afghans for promulgating constitution in 1964 that established national legislature and promoting freedoms for women including freeing them from covering their face and hair however possibly believing that he could limit soviet support for communist factions in afghanistan zahir shah also entered into significant political and arms purchase relationship with the soviet union afghanistans slide into instability began in the 1970s when the diametrically opposed communist party and islamic movements grew in strength while receiving medical treatment in italy zahir shah was overthrown by his cousin mohammad daoud military leader who established dictatorship with strong state involvement in the economy daoud was overthrown and killed 1 in 1978 by communist military officers led by nur mohammad taraki he was displaced year later by hafizullah amin leader of rival communist faction both leaders drew their strength from rural ethnic pashtuns and tried to impose radical socialist change on traditional society in part by redistributing land and bringing more women into government thsi attempt at rapid modernization sparked rebellion by islamic parties opposed to such moves the soviet union sent troops into afghanistan on december 27 1979 to prevent seizure of power by the islamic militias known as the mujahedin islamic fighters upon their invasion the soviets replaced hafizullah amin with an ally perceived as pliable babrak karmal soviet occupation forces which numbered about 120000 were never able to pacify the outlying areas of the country the mujahedin benefited from us weapons and assistance provided through the central intelligence agency cia in cooperation with pakistans interservice intelligence directorate isi that weaponry included portable shoulderfired antiaircraft systems called stingers which proved highly effective against soviet aircraft the mujahedin also hid and stored weaponry in large netw ork of natural and manmade tunnels and caves throughout afghanistan the soviet unions loss mounted and soviet domestic opinion turned antiwar in 1986 after the reformist mikhail gorbachev became leader the soviets replaced karmal with the director of afghan intelligence najibullah ahmedzai known by his first name on april 14 1988 gorbachev agreed to unbrokered accord the geneva accords requiring it to withdraw the withdrawal was completed by february 15 1989 leaving in place the weak najibullah government warming of relations mo ved the united states and soviet union to try for political settlement to the afghan conflict trend accelerated by the 1991 collapse of the soviet union which reduced moscows capacity for supporting communist regimes in the third world on september 13 1991 moscow and washington agreed to joint cutoff of military aid to the afghan combatants 1 daouds grave was discovered outside kabul in early 2008

economic and covert military assistance was provided by the us to the afghan mujahedin from 1980 until the end of the soviet occupation in 1989 press reports say the covert aid program grew from about 20 million per year in fy1980 to about 300 million per year during fy1986fy1990 the soviet pullout decreased the perceived strategic value of afghanistan causing reduction in subsequent covert funding2 as indicated below in table 5 us assistance to afghanistan remained at relatively low levels from the time of the soviet withdrawal validating the views of many that the united states largely considered its role in afghanistan completed when soviets troops left and there was little support for major us effort to rebuild the country the united states closed its embassy in kabul in january 1989 as the soviet union was completing its pullout and it remained so until the fall of the taliban in 2001 with soviet backing withdrawn on march 18 19 92 najibullah publicly agreed to step down once an interim government was formed that announcement set off wave of rebellions primarily by uzbek and tajik militia commanders in northern afghanistan who joined prominent mujahedin commander ahmad shah masud of the islamic society largely tajik party headed by burhannudin rabbani masud had earned reputation as brilliant strategist by preventing the soviets from occupying his power base in the panjshir valley of northeastern afghanistan najibullah fell and the mujahedin regime began april 18 19923 2 for fy1991 congress reportedly cut covert aid appropriations to the mujahedin from 300

parties rabbani became president in june 1992 with agreement that he would serve until december 1994 he refused to step down at that time saying that po litical authority would disintegrate without clear successor kabul was subsequently shelled by other mujahedin factions particularly that of nominal prime minister gulbuddin hikmat yar pashtun who accused rabbani of monopolizing power hikmatyars radical islamist hizbeislami islamic party had received large proportion of the us aid during the antisoviet war in 19931994 afghan islamic clerics and students mostly of rural pashtun origin formed the taliban movement many were former mujahedin who had become disillusioned with conflict among mujahedin parties and had moved into pakistan to study in islamic seminaries madrassas they practiced an orthodox sunni islam called wahhabism also practiced in saudi arabia and consonant with conservative pashtun tribal traditions they viewed the rabbani government as corrupt antipashtun and responsible for civil war the four years of civil war 19921996 created popular support for the taliban as movement that could deliver afghanistan from the warfare with the help of defections the taliban seized control of the southeastern city of qandahar in november 1994 by february 1995 it had reached the gates of kabul after which an 18month stalemate around the capital ensued in september 1995 the taliban captured herat province bordering iran and imprisoned its governor ismail khan ally of rabbani and masud who later escaped and took refuge in iran in september 1996 taliban victories near kabul led to the withdrawal of rabbani and masud to the panjshir valley north of kabul with most of their heavy weapons the taliban took control of kabul on september 27 1996 taliban gunmen

international and domestic support as it imposed strict adherence to islamic customs in areas it controlled and employed harsh punishments including executions the taliban authorized its ministry for the promotion of virtue and the suppression of vice to use physical punishments to enforce strict islamic practices including bans on television western music and dancing it prohibited women from attending school or working outside the home except in health care and it publicly executed some women for adultery in what many consider its most extreme action in march 2001 the taliban blew up two

elections are scheduled for summerfall 2009 exact date set the national front perhaps sensing electoral weakness for karzai wanted the elections to be held in june 2009 close to the constitutionally mandated timeframe of may 2009 but karzai apparently with the backing of the independent electoral commission that will run the elections has pressed for an early fall time frame parliamentary district and municipal elections are expected to follow in 2010 elections for villagelevel commun ity development councils cdcs are held on constant basisif all these positions are counted there are 300000 elected positions at all levels of afghan governance security conditions are expected to complicate the national elections in 2009 if not derail them outright but voter registration updating of 2004 voter roles has been somewhat heavier than expected with over 2 million voters updating their registration as of december 2008 us commanders reported good progress in kunar and nuristan provinces where violence is regular and registration updating targeted for completion by march 2009 is beginning in restive southern afghanistan thus far disproportionate number of registrants are women partly because of some reports of improper registration by men of long lists of women who do not show up at registration centers in person if security conditions preclude the elections and some pashtuns say their areas are too unsafe to hold fair election that represents them proportionately the constitution provides for special presidential selection process by loya jirga karzai has said clearly since august 2008 that he will seek reelection the tworound election virtually assures victory by pashtun antikarzai pashtuns are trying to coalesce around one challenger possibly former interior minister

corruption arrived in kabul on december 20 2008 to nomination for president by 32 political parties and 342 peoples councils some observers say there is an alternate election strategy under discussion in which pashtun such as jalali might head united front ticket possibly with former foreign minister dr abdullah tajik running as first vice presidential ticketmate however senior uf leader rabbani is said to be unwilling to step aside as senior leader of the uf and wants to run himself at the head of this ticket others in the uf qa nooni and rabbani reportedly are leaning against run other possible candidates include hazara leader mohammad mohaqqeq ramazan bashardost another hazara sabit pashtun mentioned above and pashtun monarchist figures pir gaylani and hedayat arsala amin rumors have abated that us ambassador to the afghanborn zalmay khalilzad might himself run although some say this issue is still open some us observers are said to believe that despite the maneuvering and the decline in his popularity during 20072008 karzai is still the favorite in the election however some observers believe that presidentelect obama might prefer new leadership in kabul that perception might have been reinforced by the january 2009 visit to afghanistan of vice presidentelect joseph biden at which he reportedly was forthright with karzai about the shortcomings of the afghan central

to have pashtun leadership but with nonpashtuns in key deputy or subordinate positions one prominent example is the defense ministry in which the chief of staff is tajik bismillah khan who reports to pashtun defense minister abd rahim wardak the parliament has emerged unexpectedly to some as relatively vibrant body that does create some accountability it has asserted itself on several occasions for example in the process of confirming postelection cabinet and in forcing karzai to oust several major conservatives from the supreme court in favor of those with more experience in modern jurisprudence in mid2007 parliament enacted law granting amnesty to commanders who fought in the various afghan wars since the soviet invasionsome of whom are now members of parliamentin an attempt to put past schisms to rest in building new afghanistan the law was rewritten to give victims the ability to bring accusations of past abuses forward its status is unclear because karzai did not veto it but he did not sign it either in sign of tension between karzai and parliamentary opposition in may 2007 the national front bloc engineered vote of confidence against foreign minister rangeen spanta for failing to prevent iran from expelling 50000 afghan refugees over onemonth period karzai opposed spantas dismissal on the grounds that refugee affairs are not his ministrys prime jurisdiction the afghan supreme court has sided with karzai and spanta remains in position on the other hand on some less contentious issues the executive and the legislature appear to be working well since the end of 2007 the wolesi jirga has passed and forwarded to the meshrano jirga several laws including labor law mines law law on economic cooperatives and convention on tobacco control the wolesi jirga also has confirmed karzai nominees in several cabinet shifts in 2008 as well as for the one remainin g justice to fill out the supreme court still the parliament has had difficulty obtaining quorum because

with permanent national government fully assembled us policy has been to attempt to expand governance throughout the country in testimony to the senate armed services committee on february 28 2008 director of national intelligence mike mcconnell said that the karzai government controls only 30 of the country while the taliban controls 10 and tribes and local groups control the remainder us and nato officials in kabul told crs in march 2008 they consider that assessment too pessimistic us commanders and officials assert that taliban militants are able to infiltrate ungoverned space contributing to the persistence and in some areas the expansion of the taliban insurgency because building the central government has gone slowly there has been some us shift during 2008 away from reliance only on strengthening central government and instead promoting more local solutions to security and governance some argue that afghans have always sought substantial regional aut onomy others say that corruption in the central government and at the local level is causing afghans to turn to supporting taliban insurgents in response to some of the criticism there appears to be shift in us

removed as herat governor in september 2004 and later appointed minister of water and energy on the other hand khan was tapped by karzai to help calm herat after sunnishiite clashes there in february

obama administration is to press karzai to weed out official corruption some for example former coordinator for counternarcotics and justice reform thomas schweich in july 27 2008 new york times article have gone so far as to assert karzai is deliberately trying to curry political support from officials in his government whom he knows to be corrupt and involved in the narcotics trade it is widely believed that karzai has shielded his brother ahmad wali karzai from prosecution for alleged involvement in drug trafficking another move that disappointed some outside observers was karzais firing of attorney general abd jabbar sabit on july 16 2008 after he declared his intention to run against karzai in 2009 presidential elections sabit had been appointed in 2007 to crack down on governmental corruption and some say he was performing that task effectively other observers say sabit was himself involved in corruption and the firing demonstrates that karzai is cracking down on

governance reflecting shift from the 20012007 approach of building only the central government the approach represents an attempt to rebuild some of the tribal and other local structures such as shuras traditional local councilsthat were destroyed in the course of constant warfare over several decades the leader in this initiative has been the independent directorate of local governance idlg formed in august 2007 and headed by jelani popal it reports to karzais office this represented first and foremost an attempt to institute systematic process for selecting capable governors and district leaders by taking the screening function away from the interior ministry the directorate is also selecting police chiefs and other local office holders and in many cases has already begun removing allegedly corrupt local officials part of its mission is to empower localities to decide on development projects by empowering local development councils the idlg also has an ambitious plan of local elections from 2008 through the next several years in 2008 with the support of the bush administration the idlg launched the governments social outreach program intended to draw closer connections between tribes and localities to the central government the program includes small payments to tribal leaders and participants in part to keep them on the side of the go vernment and to inform on taliban insurgent movements since its formation the united states has provided over 103 million to the idlg for its strategic work plan and its operations and outreach as of september 25

the march 2008 replacement of the ineffective helmand governor asadullah wafa with gulab mangal mangal is considered competent administrator but he is from laghman province not helmand somewhat to the consternation of helmand residents office of drugs and crime unodc and other officials say mangal is taking effective action against poppy cultivation in the province but that he might not be receiving the needed help from the central government or international donors that is needed some observers speculate that it is only british opposition that is preventing karzai from replacing mangal with the former governor sher muhammad akunzadeh governor until 2005 who purportedly committed nu merous human rights abuses in the course of fighting the taliban in the province and pparently remains powerful informally there the unodc report on narcotics in august 2008 also credited the strong leadership of ghul agha shirzai nangarhars governor for moving that province into the poppy free column in 2008 the governor of qandahar was changed to fo rmer general rahmatullah raufi replacing asadullah khalid after the august 7 2008 taliban assault on the qandahar prison sarposa that led to the

adheres to international standards of human rights practices and presumably is able to earn the support of the afghan people the state department report on human rights practices for 2007 released march 11 200812 said that afghanistans human rights record remained poor but attributed this primarily to weak governance corruption drug trafficking and the legacy of decades of conflict virtually all observers agree that afghans are freer than they were under the taliban however some recent restrictions appear to reflect the governments sensitivity to afghanistans conservative nature rather than politicallymotivated action the press is relatively free and afghan political groupings and parties are able to meet and organize freely but there are also abuses based on ethnicity or political factionalism and arbitrary implementation of justice by local leaders in debate over new press law both houses of parliament approved joint version but karzai has vetoed it on the grounds that it gives the government too much control over private media even in the absence of the law media policy remains highly conservative in april 2008 the ministry of information and culture banned five

conservative parliamentarians to pass legislation to ban loud music men and women mingling in public video games and other behavior common in the west since the taliban era more than 40 private radio stations seven television networks and 350 independent newspapers have opened at the same time press reports and the state department say that there are growing numbers of arrests or intimidation of

reports the afghan government is promoting the advancement of women but numerous abuses such as denial of educational and employment opportunities continue primarily because of afghanistans conservative traditions major development in posttaliban afghanistan was the formation of ministry of womens affairs dedicated to improving womens rights althoug h numerous accounts say the ministrys influence is limited and it is now headed by male the deputy minister is female among other activities it promotes the involvement of women in business ventures three female ministers were in the 20042006 cabinet former presidential candidate masooda jalal ministry of womens affairs sediqa balkhi minister for martyrs and the disabled and amina afzali minister of youth however karzai nominated only one minister of womens affairs soraya sobhrang in the cabinet that followed the parliamentary elections and she was voted down by islamist conservatives in parliament leaving women in the cabinet the deputy minister is female in march 2005 karzai appointed former minister of womens affairs habiba sohrabi as governor of bamiyan province inhabited mostly by hazaras she hosted visiting first lady laura bush during her visit to bamiyan in june 2008 the constitution reserves for women at least 17 of the 102 seats in the upper house and 68 of the 249 seats in the lower house of parliament some women were elected even without the setasides and there are 23 serving in the upper house there are also 121 women holding seats in the 420 provincial council seats nationwide however some ngos nd other groups believe that the women elected by the quota system are not viewed as equally legitimate parliamentarians more generally women are performing jobs that were rarely held by women even before the taliban came to power in 1996 including in the new police force there are now 67 female judges and 447 female journalists working nationwide the most senior afghan woman in the police force was assassinated in qandahar in september 2008 press reports say afghan women are increasingly learning how to drive under the new government the wearing of the full body covering called the burqa is

as one of the most significant problems facing afghanistan generating what us commanders estimate to be about 100 million per year for the taliban afghanistan is the source of about 93 of the worlds illicit opium supply and according to unodc leaving aside 19th century china country in the world has ever produced narcotics on such deadly scale some tentative signs of progress have begun to emerge although it is not certain whether the progress will be sustained the unodc report of november 2008 was the most positive such report since at least 2005 saying the opium flood waters in afghanistan have started to recede the estimate is based on drop in area under opium cultivation of 19 an overall opium production drop of 6 and large increase in the number of poppy free provinces from 13 in the 2007 report to 18 out of 34 tota l provinces now the unodc report attributed the progress to strong leadership by some gover nors atta mohammad of balkh ghul agha shirzai of nangarhar and monshi abdul majid of badakhsha n in particular as well as to drought that contributed to crop failure in some areas still there is poppy cultivation growth in helmand province which now produces about 65 of afgh anistans total poppy crop and other southern provinces where the taliban insurgency is highly active there is also trend indicating that some poppy growers are turning to marijuana cultivation and trafficking perhaps sensing less pressure on that activity on june 11 2008 the security council adopted resolution 1817 called for greater international cooperation to stop the movement of chemical precursors used to process opium into afghanistan in march 2007 the administration created post of coordinator for counternarcotics and justice reform in afghanistan naming thomas schweich of the bureau of international narcotics and law enforcement inl to that post the us strategy still follows schweichs august 9 2007 announced program that seeks to better integrate counternarcotics and counter insurgency and to enhance alternative livelihoods 14 schwiech departed that post in june 2008 and as noted above has written opinion pieces critical of us and afghan counternarcotics strategy in afghanistan encouraging alternative livelihoods is the preferred emphasis of the afghan government and the afghan side maintains that narcotics flourish in areas where there is security and not the other way around the united states has provided in 2008 38 million in good performers funds to provinces that have eliminated poppy cultivation us officials emphasize eradication in concert with interdiction and building up alternative livelihoods ustrained afghanistan counternarcotics police eradicate poppy fields by cutting down the crop manually on the ground however there has been debate between some in the us 13 for detailed discussion and us funding on the issue see crs report rl32686 afghanistan narcotics and us policy by christopher m blanchard 14 text of the strategy see

reports that the taliban in some areas under their control are setting up courts and other shadow government structures the attack on sarposa prison particularly shook confidence in us and nato policy

was declared successful by june 21 in october 2008 taliban militants massed near the capital of helmand lashkar gah but were defeated by nato forces before launching an actual assault the upsurge in attacks in the eastern sector has caused particular consternation because throughout 2007 us commanders were heralding substantial progress in reducing taliban attacks in that sector the progress was attributed to the fact that us troopsthose of which are under na toisaf and those under oef are mostly in the eastern sectorwere able to achieve significant coverage of the area to be able to hold

continued it was reported in september 2008 that both the us military and nato were conducting number of different strategy reviews the reviews were in part intended to prevent an unraveling of the effort from the time of the us election until presidentelect obama takes over another intention was to try to help the incoming obama administration formulate its strategy many experts appear to agree that there is need to better integrate military approaches with enhanced efforts to build afghan government capacity and accomplish economic development in classic counterinsurgency strategy that secures and wins support of the afghan population others believe that the complexities of afghanistan limit what can be achieved and that the united states can achieve the quickest gains by focusing

case during the bush administration but press reports say there is disa greement over what aspects of strategy should be emphasized matter what strategy is decided it is clear that us troop levels in afghanistan will increase it was announced in september 2008 by president bush that about 5000 more us forces would be sent to afghanistan by early 2009 the depl oyment of an army aviation brigade

depend on the rate of drawdown of us troops from iraq beyond the addition of troops there is growing question of equipment some experts say that the united states is too reliant on armor in

2006 karzai and international force donors have been considering arming some local tribal militias arbokai in eastern afghanistan building on established tribal structures to help in local policing karzai argued that these militias provide security and are loyal to the nation and central government and that arming them is not inconsistent with the disarmament programs discussed above until mid2008 us military commanders opposed assisting tribal militias anywhere in afghanistan for fear of creating new rivals to the central government but the urgent security needs in afghanistan caused reconsideration the upper house of the afghan parliament also passed resolution in november 2008 opposing the concept despite the reservations since september 2008 press reports have said that there will be afghan led coordination of tribal or local militias as part of broader emphasis on local bottomup solutions to security the militia formation will be conducted as part of the idlgs social outreach program which was discussed above and is intended to strengthen the ability of local communities to keep taliban infiltrators out it is being termed the community guard program and will be funded with dod cerp funds participants in the program will be given reported 200 per month general petraeus endorsed this new tactic during his first visit to afghanistan as centcom commander on november 5 2008 the formation of the local militias is reportedly to begin in wardak province in early 2009 and then be tested in ghazni lowgar and kapisa provinces us commanders say that us weapons will be supplied to the militias but this is an afghanled program and some reports say the afghan government might provide weapons to the local armed groups although us commanders say they will be able to keep the militias under control some experts fear that the militias could become an additional source of arbitrary administration of justice and of corruption against local populations and question the apparent usafghan deviation from the postseptember 11 commitment to building the central government as the only legitimate source of afghan armed force

nonafghan forces and would limit the us of airstrikes detentions and house raids 23 in late november 2008 at multilateral conference karzai called for timetable for withdrawal of international forces

the most recent one available among unfulfilled pledges are 3200 trainers that are needed for afghan security forces it is likely this requirement will be filled by american forces another key point of contention has been natos chronic equipment shortagesparticularly helicopters both for transport and attackfor the afghanistan mission one idea considered at nato meeting in scotland on december 13 2007 was for us or other donors to pay for the upgrading of helicopters that partner countries might possess but have inadequate resources to adapt to afghanistans harsh flying conditions in 2007 to

of that contributor the concept paper now titled the strategic vision was endorsed by the nato summit in bucharest romania in april 2008 one of the most thorny issues has been the us effort to persuade other na to countries to adopt flexible rules of engagement that allow all contributing forces to perform combat missions although perhaps not as aggressively as do us fo rces all have agreed that their forces would come to each others defense in times of emergency anywhere in afghanistan at the nato summit in april 2008 na to countries pledged to continue to work remove the other socalled national caveats on their troops operations that us commanders say limit operational flexibility for example some nations refuse to conduct nighttime combat others have refused to carry afghan personnel on their helicopters others do not fight after snowfall these caveats were troubling to those na to countries with forces in heavy combat zones such as canada which feel they are bearing the brunt of the fighting at the same time the united states has adapted some approaches from its partners there was early skepticism of the dutch approach in uruzgan which focuses heavily on building relationships with tribal leaders and identifying reconstruction priorities and not on actively combating taliban formations the netherlands says this approach is key to longterm pacification of the south and the united states subsequently altered its strategy in the eastern sector somewhat to approach that used by the netherlands see crs report rl33627 nato in afghanistan test of the

being fully capable of conducting their primary missions 29 this report also cited us officers as observing continuing personnel problems desertion absentee ill discipline and drug abuse although some concerns have been addressed some accounts say that typical ana unit is only at about 50 of its authorized strength at any given time the gao study said that there are significant shortages in about 40 of equipment items although cstc envisions that all ana brigades are equipped to 85 of requirements as of the end of 2008 few soldiers have helmets many have armored vehicles or armor the tables

musharraf acted against qaeda only when it threatened him directly for example after the december 2003 assassination attempts against him by that organization musharraf announced his resignation and the new governing coalition fractured in august 2008 leaving the newly dominant party of the late pakistani secular leader benazir bhuttonow in the hands of her widower president asif ali zardariwith substantial discretion over pakistans policy afghan leaders still resent pakistan as the most public defender of the taliban movement when it was in power and they suspect it wants to have the option to restore talibanlike regime pakistan was one of only three countries to formally recognize it as the legitimate government saudi arabia and the united arab emirates are the others pakistan viewed the taliban as providing pakistan strategic depth against rival india and it remains wary that any afghan government might fall under the influence of india which pakistan says is using its diplomatic facilities in afghanistan to train and recruit antipakistan insurgents and is using its reconstruction funds to build influence there pakistan ended its public support for the taliban after the september 11 2001 attacks but pakistanafghanistan relations began deteriorating after the march 2006 afghan accusation that pakistan was allowing taliban remnants including mullah umar to operating there in january 2007 karzai strongly criticized pakistani plan to mine and fence their common border in an effort to prevent infiltration of militants to afghanistan saying the move would separate tribes and families that straddle the border the us shift toward more critical position increased following new york times report february 19 2007 that qaeda had reestablished some small qaeda terrorist training camps in pakistan near the afghan border this possibly was an outgrowth of september 5 2006 agreement between pakistan and tribal elders in this region to exchange an end to pakistani military incursions into the tribal areas for pr omise by the tribal elders to expel militants from the border area in july 2007 us counterterrorism officials publicly deemed the agreement

exerting its traditional influence over western afghanistan which iran borders and was on ce part of the persian empire and to protect afghanistans shiite minority irans assistance to afghanistan has totaled about 1164 billion since the fall of the taliban mainly to build roads and schools and provide electricity and shops to afghan cities and villages near the iranian border this makes iran among the top financial donors to afghanistan after the fall of the taliban in late 2001 president bush warned iran against meddling in afghanistan partly in response to the us criticism in february 2002 iran expelled karzai opponent gulbuddin hikmatyar but it did not arrest him iran did not oppose karzais firing of iran ally ismail khan as herat governor in september 2004 although iran has opposed

from the past five years when irans influence with political leaders in afghanistan appeared to wane and us criticism of irans role in afghanistan was muted the state department report on

systems manpads on april 17 2007 us military personnel in afghanistan captured shipment of iranian weapons that purportedly was bound for taliban fighters on june 6 2007 nato officers said they caught iran redhanded shipping heavy arms c4 explosives and advanced roadside bombs explosivelyforced projectiles efps such as those found in iraq to taliban fighters in afghanistan another such shipment was intercepted in western afghanistan on september 6 2007 gen mcneill said the convoy was sent with the knowledge of at least the iranian military because such shipments would appear to conflict with irans support for karzai and for nonpashtun factions in afghanistan us military officers did not attribute the shipments to deliberate iranian government decision to arm the taliban however some us officials say the shipments are large enough that the iranian gove rnment would have to have known about them in attempting to explain the shipments some experts believe irans policy might be shifting somewhat to gain leverage against the united states in afghanistan and on other issues by causing us combat deaths there is little dispute that irans relations with afghanistan are much improved from the time of the taliban which iran saw as threat to its interests in afghanistan especially after taliban forces captured herat the western province that borders iran in september 1995 iran subsequently drew even closer to the northern alliance than previously providing its groups with fuel funds and ammunition 39 in september 1998 iranian and taliban forces nearly came into direct conflict when iran discovered that nine of its diplomats were killed in the course of the talibans offensive in northern afghanistan iran massed forces at the border and threatened military action but the crisis cooled without major clash possibly out of fear that pakistan would intervene on behalf of the taliban iran offered search and rescue assistance in afghanistan during the usled war to topple the taliban and it also allowed us humanitarian aid to the afghan people to transit iran about 300000 afghan refugees have returned from iran since the taliban fell but about 12 million remain

almost the exact reverse of those of pakistan indias goal is to deny pakistan str ategic depth in afghanistan and india supported the northern alliance against the taliban in the mid1990s possible reflection of these ties is that tajikistan allows india to use one of its air bases tajikistan supports the mostly tajik northern alliance india saw the talibans hosting of qaeda as major threat to india itself because of qaedas association with radical islamic organizations in pakistan dedicated to ending indian control of parts of jammu and kashmir some of these groups have committed major acts of terrorism in india for its part pakistan accuses india of using its nine consulates in afghanistan to spread indian influence the growing indian financial and political influence might have

during 19961998 the clinton administration supported proposed natural gas and oil pipelines through western afghanistan as an incentive for the warring factions to cooperate consortium led by angelesbased unocal corporation proposed 25 billion central asia ga s pipeline centgas which is now estimated to cost 37 billion to construct that would originate in southern turkmenistan and pass through afghanistan to pakistan with possible extensions into india45 the deterioration in ustaliban relations after 1998 largely ended hopes for the pipeline projects while the taliban was in power prospects for the project have improved in the posttaliban period in summit meeting in late may 2002 between the leaders of turkmenistan afghanistan and pakistan the three countries agreed to revive the gas pipeline project sponsors of the project held an inaugural meeting on july 9 2002 in turkmenistan signing series of preliminary agreements turkmenistans leadership president gurbanguly berdimukhamedov succeeding the late saparmurad niyazov favors the project as well some us officials view this project as superior alternative to proposed gas pipeline from iran to india transiting

late 1985 following internal debate the reagan administration provided about 2000 manportable stinger antiaircraft missiles to the mujahedin for use against soviet aircraft prior to the usled war against the taliban and qaeda common estimates suggested that 200300 stingers remained at large although more recent estimates put the number below 100 48 the stinger issue resurfaced in conjunction with 2001 us war effort when us pilots reported that the taliban fired some stingers at us aircraft during the war hits were reported any stingers that survived the antit aliban war are likely controlled by afghans now allied to the united states and presumably pose less of threat however there are concerns that remaining stingers could be sold to terrorists for use against civilian aircraft in february 2002 the afghan government found and returned to the united states dozens of stingers 49 in late 48 saleem farrukh where are the missing stinger missiles pakistan friday times

stingers back at reported cost of 150000 each50 in 1992 after the fall of the russianbacked government of najibullah the united states reportedly spent about 10 million to buy the stingers back at premium from individual mujahedin commanders the new york times reported on july 24 1993 that the buy back effort failed because the united states was competing with other buyers including iran and north korea and that the cia would spend about 55 million in fy1994 in renewed stinger buyback effort on march 7 1994 the washington post reported that the cia had recovered only fraction maybe 50 or 100 of the atlarge stingers the danger of these weapons has become apparent on several occasions iran bought 16 of the missiles in 1987 and fired one against us helicopters some reportedly were transferred to lebanese hizballah india claimed that it was stinger supplied to islamic rebels in kashmir probably by sympathizers in afghanistan that sh ot down an indian helicopter over kashmir in
