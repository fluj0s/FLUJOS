6306c13 shspec274 levels of case here is where we are at technically we are developing dianometry to point where one can give series of tests and decide what you need to do with case there are six types of processes that are learnable and workable direct processing of postulates is not included although rising scale processes do sometimes work especially on level 1 cases the scale of case levels is invaluable and the six types of processes handle all levels the six processes are the only ones that raise case up the levels the only problem lies in how well they are known and how reliably they are executed we are working on how you can tell where pc is so you can tell what to use on him lacking this data you can just process the pc and go up or fall back to hit his level here are the case levels 1 ot track you can even go higher than level 1 for instance you can tell the thetan how to handle theta trap you can also teach him how to maintain game so he wont have to go downscale to have one what you can do with this level consists of education and practice only 2 this is theoretical state usually parts of the time track are missing and those parts that are there are under handling although the thetan at this case level is theoretically supposed to have total access to his time track with nothing aberrative on it the perfect time track is unobtainable it would fold up before it got there at this level we work to get the person over the idea that he has to have time track by handling engrams the thetan learns to block out facsimiles special process is used here 3 at this level the pc has partly visible time track that is however very aberrative he has lots of engrams but he can run them at this level you would use engram running by chains blocking that sort of thing out 4 this is an occluded case with black invisible andor spotted field lower levels can also have such fields so be careful at this level you can still run engrams if you have made sure that you are not actually dealing with level 7 or 8 you can run him on r3n r3n is strippeddown directive routine 3 which uses line plots it has to do with implant gpms r3n2 is an abbreviated form of r3n see 6305c14 shspec263 implant gpms and 6305c21 shspec266 the helatrobus implants see also pp 426 456457 below 5 dubin case easy to restimulate this case should be run on arc break straightwire duplication what there are processes that produce change in the pc without necessarily giving change in case level processes can be powerful enough to overwhelm the pcs power of choice so you can change the case but the pc may not recognize it so his reality and confront havent improved that is what occurs when you run higherlevel process on lowerlevel case that is why it is idiocy just to cure someone of an illness he will just get sick again you have just worked directly against his hidden standard your real object is to advance the case up the reality scale so you had better use the process that corresponds to the pcs case or reality level you should see improvement both directly in terms of upgrade of case level attitude towards existence etc and indirectly by seeing ta motion if there is ta the pc is not improving with regard to his viewpoint of existence level of communication etc level 4 or 3 cases can also be run on arc break straightwire fur repair or boost 6 dubin of dubin this case is distinguished from level 5 by the degree of franticness and the terrible automaticity of the bank it is not common type of case but it is struggle to audit because the track wont hold still to be looked at nothing bites because of this constant motion of the time track the level 6 case longer has the power of stopping motion you could call this type of case the grouped automatic time track or the moving time track case you cant run straightwire on him because of the constant motion of the track such cases should be run on cchs repetitive processes work as do sec checks and to lesser degree prepchecks so does general ow done as an excuse for sec checks and prepchecks it is not done as strictly repetitive process the overts you get are very light and feathery that is ok the bottom rung on level 6 has passed beyond the ability to run bank 7 this case can only confront his own evaluations these cases can get enormously interested in cchs because that stuff is dangerous to them they cant run the bank it is not there to be run it is utterly unconfrontable 8 the unawareness case this case can only be run on reach and withdraw being virtually or actually unconscious if you have someone who is in coma take his hand and with commands have him touch the blanket touch the sheet etc the perpetual boiloff case needs reach and withdraw just like the guy in the coma reach and withdraw runs several levels above level 8 for instance it runs up to levels 5 and 6 but here on level 7 you must flatten cchs or you will leave the pc parked the pc at this level will run heavily on these processes you can run processes at levels higher than the case level for which they are primarily intended they dont do much damage if left unflat if the case level is several levels higher than that of the process but dont overestimate the case level and get loses the six types of processing are 1 reach and withdraw 2 cchs 3 sec check 4 repetitive processes 5 r3n implants 6 r3r route 1 could be added as way of handling level 7 case almost any case reacts to almost any of these processes but what you want to do is to improve the level of the case with economy of time there are certain processes that will do it fastest and host of others that dont fit the pcs case level the fastest process is the one that we are after for instance we just run enough r3n to clear off implants so that we can get at other parts of the track you can run someone on implants for long time but what you are after is unburdening the track enough so that you can run gpms there are more implants per unit time in the pt area ie the last 5000 years then there were earlier but the only really thorough workmanlike job that was done was in the helatrobus implant darwins theory of evolution came from one implant case level improves to the degree that charge is removed case level is determined by the amount of encysted and unreleased charge not by the inherent power of the thetan concerned different cases may have different tolerance of charge but the levels will still be determined by the amount of charge the auditors sole interest is to relieve charge in order to change case manifestations the index of charge off is amount of ta or dialwide rocket reads that start out like mad and turn into fall if you are running engrams without getting ta watch it you are just stirring up the bank and not discharging anything the pc will get unhappy with you just give the pc the rfactor that you are going to run more implants to get them out of the road so we can get this earlier material discharged let the ta run into the case on arc break straightwire this may take two sessions if necessary you can drop back to cchs and sec checking or even reach and withdraw it is better to start low and run high underestimate the pcs ability so as to avoid giving the pc loses and keep his confidence and hope factor up the variable is the ability of the case to rise up the scale of course the lower the case level the slower charge blows level 5 and 6 cases will get into rows about being underrun but when the case is being run in the direction of up the case will forgive you almost anything the lower the case the more they estimate their ability to be they dont feel confident enough to see their limits such people do take social pride in their case level there is statusseeking in auditing god forbid let ta motion be there instead and we will all have won
