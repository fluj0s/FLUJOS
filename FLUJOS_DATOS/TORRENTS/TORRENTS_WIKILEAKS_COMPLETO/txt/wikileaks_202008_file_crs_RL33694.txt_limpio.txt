appropriations for fy2007 including the fy2007 budget request and house and senate legislative action the report concludes with discussion of state grants provided under the perkins basic state grants and the techprep programs overall federal funding for career and technical education federal funding for career and technical education through the perkins act has increased modestly since fy2000 table 1 this funding principally supports state grants under the basic state grants and techprep programs funds are also appropriated to support national programs focused on research development dissemination evaluation and assessment prior to fy2006 funds were also appropriated to support occupational and employment information activities and the techprep demonstration program5 total funding was about 1193 billion in fy2000 and about 1296 billion in fy2006 an 87 increase6 over the same period appropriations for basic state grants increased 114 from 104 billion to 116 billion funding for all other programs authorized by the perkins act decreased from fy2000 to fy2006 primarily due to funding decreases in fy2006 appropriations for example funding for both the techprep demonstration program and the occupational and employment information program was eliminated in fy2006 national programs decreased by 221 from fy2005 to fy2006 for an overall decrease in funding from fy2000 to fy2006 of 476 funding for basic state grants and techprep was also reduced in 4 on september 29 2006 the fy2007 department of defense appropriations bill hr 5631 was signed by the president pl 109289 division b of the act included continuing resolution to continue federal funding for discretionary programs through november 17 2006 on november 17 2006 pl 109369 extended the continuing resolution through december 8 2006 on december 9 2006 pl 109383 subsequently extended the continuing resolution through february 15 2007 5 pl 109270 did not reauthorize the techprep demonstration program the occupational and employment information program was reauthorized but neither the house nor the senate committee on appropriationsreported bills would provide funding for the program in fy2007 6 total appropriations for perkins iii peaked in fy2004 at 1328 million and have declined in subsequent years crs3 fy2006 due to the 1 acrosstheboard reduction required by the defense appropriations act pl 109148 basic state grants accounted for the majority of fy2006 funding followed by funding for techprep fy2007 appropriations in its fy2007 budget request similar to its fy2005 and fy2006 budget requests the bush administration proposed the elimination of all dedicated federal funding for career and technical education7 according to the budget request federal funding for career and technical education would still be available through new high school initiative being proposed by the administration the high school reform initiative hsri the hsri would be funded at 1475 billion for fy2007 the program would support interventions designed to address the academic performance of students most at risk of failure to meet academic standards and annual assessments administered in high school8 states would receive formula grants and would in turn award competitive grants to leas funds could be used by leas for number of interventions including programs that combine rigorous academic courses with demanding vocational and technical education courses in order to provide students with highquality academic and technical training dropout prevention programs and college preparation programs for lowincome students9 7 in its fy2005 and fy2006 budget requests the administration also proposed the elimination of the current federal career and technical education programs in fy2006 the administration proposed the creation of high school intervention initiative funded at 12 billion this initiative similar to the initiative proposed for fy2007 would have placed increased emphasis on testing and accountability at the high school level us department of education fy2006 justifications of appropriation estimates to congress p m20 in fy2005 the administration requested 1 billion to

office note fy2003 fy2004 and fy2005 appropriations include the acrosstheboard reduction as calculated by ed the fy2006 appropriation includes the 1 acrosstheboard reduction required by the fy2006 defense appropriations act pl 109148 the appropriation was calculated by the us department of education budget service january 4 2006 the fy2006 estimates are subject to change details may not add to totals due to rounding crs5 incentive grants were authorized under section 503 of the workforce investment act wia pl 105220 beginning on july 1 2000 the secretary of labor was authorized to award grant to each state that exceeded state adjusted performance levels for title i of wia the expected levels of performance for title ii of wia and the adjusted levels of performance for perkins iii perkins iii provided specific funding authorization to support these incentive grants for fy2000fy2003 funds were not authorized for fy1999 while the perkins act was not reauthorized until 2006 funding continued to be provided for incentive grants through fy2006 pl 109270 eliminated the setaside for incentive grant funding beginning in fy2007 funds previously set aside for this purpose will be provided to states through the basic state grants formula b the us department of education ed was unable to negotiate performance levels with states for fy1999 as states lacked sufficient data for all of the core indicators of performance specified in statutory language thus ed was unable to award incentive grants based on states meeting agreed upon performance levels for fy2000 congress reallocated the 054 setaside for incentive grants to basic state grants c funds were appropriated for this program until fy2001 d the administrations budget request for fy2004 fy2005 and fy2006 requested funding for this program currently authorized by perkins iv under the higher education account the administration proposes reauthorizing this program under the higher education act which is scheduled for reauthorization in the 110th congress for fy2003 and subsequent fiscal years funding for this program is not reflected in this table for comparability purposes as ed longer includes it under career and technical education in its budget tables national programs include research development dissemination evaluation and assessment na not applicable while the hsri would provide some flexibility in how funds are used the hsri would also require new high school assessments to be administered currently under the elementary and secondary education act as amended by the child left behind act pl 107110 high school students must be tested at least once in grades 1012 in language arts and mathematics the hsri would require that students be tested annually in language arts and mathematics in at least two additional high school grades states would be required to use some of their hsri funding to support these efforts assessments would have to be in place by the 2010 2011 school year10 leas would be held accountable by their state for improving secondary school student performance given the emphasis that would be placed on student assessments it is possible that leas that would receive competitive grants through this initiative could choose to pursue interventions other than career and technical education it is also possible that leas currently using federal dollars to support their career and technical education programs may not receive competitive grant through the hsri possibly reducing or eliminating career and technical education options for students in those leas in addition grants would be awarded at the postsecondary level11 congress however did not authorize the hsri rather it reauthorized the perkins act in addition congress has not acted to include the hsri in fy2007 10 the fy2006 budget request included 250 million specifically for high school assessments program to aid states in developing and implementing the additional required assessments 11 about 383 of basic state grants funding under the perkins act in 2001 was allocated to the postsecondary level us department of education office of the under secretary policy and program studies services 2004 national assessment of vocational education final report to congress p 209 crs6 appropriations acting instead to continue funding for career and technical education and most of the programs authorized under the perkins act12 both the house committee on appropriations hr 5647 hrept 109515 and the senate committee on appropriations s 3708 srept 109287 have reported fy2007 appropriations bills that would provide level funding for career and technical education at 129630600013 state grants as previously mentioned the largest program funded by the perkins act is the basic state grants program the program primarily supports career and technical education activities at the secondary and postsecondary levels in leas area career and technical education schools and institutions of higher education uses of funds include for example establishing linkages between secondary and postsecondary career and technical education providing professional development supporting career and academic counseling and transitioning students from subbaccalaureate career and technical education programs to baccalaureate degree programs including the development of articulation agreements while substantially smaller in terms of funding the techprep program focuses on combining and coordinating secondary and postsecondary career and technical education activities into coherent sequence of courses funds for the basic state grants program and the techprep program are distributed to states by formula14 the formulas are based primarily on population factors and per capita income factors weights are assigned to individuals in three population groups ages 15 to 19 ages 20 to 24 and ages 25 to 65 with the largest weights assigned to the youngest population group per capita income pci is defined as the total personal income in state divided by the population of the state it affects the weighted population count for each state through an allotment ratio15 this helps to provide states with lower pcis with additional grant funds and vice versa the distribution of funds is also affected by minimum grant provision and hold harmless provision that provides all states with at least their fy1998 grant amount assuming appropriations are sufficient to do so16 tables 2 and 3 provide 12 as previously mentioned the occupational and employment information program did not receive funding in fy2006 and neither the administrations budget request nor the house and senatereported bills would provide funding for the program in fy2007 the program was reauthorized however by pl 109270 the techprep demonstration program did not receive funding in fy2006 and was not reauthorized by pl 109270 13 for more information about fy2007 appropriations for programs administered by the us department of education see crs report rl33576 labor health and human services and education fy2007 appropriations by paul m irwin 14 for additional information about state grants for career and technical education see crs report rl33676 career and technical education state grant formula by rebecca r skinner and richard n apling 15 the allotment ratio is calculated by dividing the pci for given state by the pci for all states combined the result is multiplied by 05 and subtracted from one 16 if appropriations were insufficient to provide all states with at least the same amount of continued crs7 state grants for the basic state grants and techprep programs respectively for fy2001 through fy2005 actual grant amounts are included for fy2006 grant amounts for
