the federal and state governments with respect to public health emergency powers including requiring the use of mandatory vaccines is discussed this report will be updated as warranted history and precedent historically the preservation of the public health has been the primary responsibility of state and local governments and the author ity to enact laws relevant to the protection of the public health derives from the states general police powers1 with respect to the preservation of the public health in cases of communicable disease outbreaks these powers may include the institution of measures such as quarantine and isolation2 or the enactment of mandatory vaccination laws3 mandatory vaccination laws were first enacted in the early nineteenth century beginning with massachusetts smallpox vaccination law in 18094 jacobson v massachusetts5 is the seminal case regarding states or municipalitys authority to institute mandatory vaccination program as an exercise of its police powershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21414crs2 6 id at 31 the massachusetts statute in question r eads as follows boards of health if in their opinion it is necessary for public health or safety shall

1980 see world health organization smallpox fact sheet at httpwwwwhointmediacentrefactsheetssmallpox one author has suggested that while mr jacobson might be successful in his refusa l to be vaccinated against smallpox today since smallpox has been eradicated the threat of terro rists using smallpox as weapon might make the use of the vaccine reasonable measure yet again andrew zoltan

potential role in terrorism by frank grottron in jacobson the supreme court upheld massachuse tts law that gave municipal boards of health the authority to require the vaccination of persons over the age of 21 against smallpox and determined that the vaccination program instituted in the city of cambridge had real and substantial relation to the protection of the public health and safety6 in upholding the law the court noted that the police power of state must be held to embrace at least such reasonable regulations established directly by legislative enactment as will protect the public h ealth and the public safety7 the court added that such laws were within the full discretion of the state and that federal powers with respect to such laws extended only to ensure that the state laws did not contravene the constitution of the united states or infringe any right gr anted or secured by that instrument8 the court addressed cons titutional concerns raised by the petitioner in jacobson but remained unconvinced that his rights were contravened by the mandatory vaccination program the petitioner argued that compulsory vaccinati on law is unreasonable arbitrary and oppressive and therefore hostile to the inhe rent right of every freeman to care for his own body and health in such way as to him seems best and that the execution of such law against one who objects to vaccination matter for what reason is nothing short of an assault upon his person9 the court rejected the petitioners constitutional challenge and noted that the liberty secured by the constitution of the united states to every person within its jurisdiction does not import an absolute right in each person to be at all times and in all circumstances wholly free from restraint10 however the court did acknowledge limits to the states power to protect the public health and set forth reasonablene ss test for public health measures11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21414crs3 12 james g hodge jr and lawrence

school children to be vaccinated and at the same time continuedit might be that an acknowledged power of local community to protect itself against an epidemic threatening the safety of all might be exercised in particular circumstances and in refere nce to particular persons in such an arbitrary unreasonable manner or might go so far beyond what was reasonably required for the safety of the public as to authorize or compel the courts to interfere for the protection of such persons state mandatory vaccination laws school vaccination requirements every state has law requiring children to be vaccinated before they roll in public or private school12 early statutes required vaccination against smallpox and were am ended as new vaccines were introduced13 many modern school vaccination laws are the result of measles outbreaks in the 1960s and 1970s14 generally states use the centers for disease control and preventions schedule of immunizations as guide and require children to be vaccinated against number of diseases on the sche dule including diphtheria measles rubella and polio15 despite the widespread imposition of school vaccination requirements many states provide exemptions for medical religious or philosophical reasons these provisions vary state by state with medical exemptions for children who may suffer adverse effects from the vaccine being the most common thus all states allow medical exemptions for those whose immune systems are compromised w ho are allergic to vaccines are ill at the time of vaccination or ve other medical indications to

individuals may be subject to quarantine to prevent the spread of contagious or possibl contagious disease32 role of the federal government federal jurisdiction over public health matters derives from the commerce clause which states that congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states33 thus under the public health service act the secretary of the department of health and human services has authority to make and enforce regulations necessary to prevent the introduction transmission or spread of communicable diseases from fore ign countries into the states or possessions or from one state or possession into any other state or possession34 while this language appears to confer broad authority to pr omulgate regulations necessary to prevent the spread of disease current regulations deal primarily with the use of quarantine measures to halt the spread of certain communicable diseases35 the public health service act does not specifically authorize any mandatory vaccination programs nor do there appear to be any regulations regarding the implementation of mandatory vaccination program at the federal level during pub lic health emergency36 as noted above state and local govern ments have the primary responsibility for protecting the public health and this has been reflected in the enactment of the various state laws requiring that school children be v accinated against certain diseases before enrolling in school and authorizing mandato ry vaccination procedures during public health emergency any federal mandatory vaccination program applicable to the general public would likely be limited to areas of existin g federal jurisdiction ie interstate and foreign commerce similar to the federal quarantine authority37 this limitation on federal jurisdiction acknowledges that states have the primary responsibility for protecting the public health but that under certain circumst ances federal intervention may be necessary
