statistics us district and circuit courts 19451976 summary statistics regarding procedural actions taken from nomination through confirmation on us district and circuit court nominations have been compiled by crs for the period january 3 1945 through october 1 1976 the statistics are complete for the 79th through the 94th congresses 19451976 among other things the statistics for the 19451976 period show during the administrations of presidents truman eisenhower kennedy johnson nixon and ford the senate confirmation percentage for district and circuit court nominations combined never went below 75 the president with the highest confirmation percentage for district and circuit court nominations combined was richard m nixon with 979 and the president with the lowest confirmation percentage was harry s truman with 751 agreement the great majority of each presidents nominations were either confirmed or returned an average of two nominations per president were withdrawn four nominations were disapproved by senate vote during that period the confirmation percentage for district and circuit court nominations combined was greater than 81 for every congress from the 79th through the 94th except the 80th 81st and 82nd congresses the only time the average number of days elapsing between nomination date and confirmation exceeded 63 days was in the 86th congress during the 19451976 period congress averaged over 100 days between nomination dates and hearing committee vote or senate vote the senate returned substantially more nominations during the 81st and 87th congresses than during any other congress in the 19451976 period the vast majority of judicial nominations submitted during the 19451976 period received committee hearings and votes as well as full senate votes during the 81st congress however there was reduction in the share of nominations receiving committee and senate action four of the six nominations that failed to receive vote to report favorably from the judiciary committee were reported adversely to the senate floor where all four were rejected by voice vote this report will not be updated however the statistical tables in this

circuit courts 19451976 introduction1 congress has devoted much attention to the lower federal court confirmation process in recent years various crs reports are now available that explore this process2 in particular crs report rl31635 judicial nomination statistics us district and circuit courts 19772003 by denis steven rutkus and mitchel sollenberger provides statistical tables for recent years this report provides similar statistics concerning actions taken on us district and circuit court nominations from january 3 1945 to october 1 1976 procedural steps for judicial appointments the process for making lifetime appointments to judgeships in the us district courts and us courts of appeals involves the same formal steps as in the appointment of supreme court justices3 the process begins when the president selects someone to fill judicial vacancy submitting nomination in writing to the senate usually on the same day it is received by the senate the nomination is referred by the senate executive clerk to the committee on the judiciary the senate committee having jurisdiction over district and appellate as well as most other federal court nominations in the next step in the appointment process the judiciary committee holds hearing on the nomination then the committee votes on whether to report the nomination to the full senate the final step occurs when the senate votes to confirm or disapprove the nomination confirmation requires 1 this report was built on the research and writing done for earlier statistical reports by denis steven rutkus and mitchel sollenberger 2

denis steven rutkus and crs report rs20986 senate confirmation process an overview by lorraine h tong crs2 simple majority vote if the senate votes in the negative on whether to confirm resolution of disapproval is forwarded to the president4 as with nominations in general judicial nominations sometimes fail to advance through each procedural step in the appointment process after referral to committee nomination might fail to receive hearing or after receiving hearing it might fail to receive committee vote on whether it should be reported even if reported by committee it might fail to receive vote by the senate on whether to confirm if it fails to receive senate vote the nomination ultimately will either be withdrawn by the president or returned to the president by the secretary of the senate upon senate adjournment or recess of more than 30 days5 methodology in preparing statistical tables in the following pages eight tables provide statistics concerning procedural actions that were taken on us district court and us court of appeals nominations during the period january 3 1945 through october 1 1976 the time period begins with the convening of the 79th congress and carries through the second session of the 94th congress the period coincides with the terms in office of presidents harry s truman 79th82nd congresses dwight d eisenhower 83rd86th congresses john f kennedy 87th88th congresses lyndon b johnson 88th90th congresses richard m nixon 91st93rd congresses and gerald r ford 93rd94th congresses depending on the table statistics are broken down by year presidency or congress statistical considerations the reader should be aware that certain tables may use different statistical calculations table titles and footnotes should be closely monitored in order to guide the reader through the data and calculations used for each table in particular the footnotes will be invaluable when comparing similar data from different tables because of the uniqueness of some of the calculations for example table 2 and table 3 appear to calculate the same data however they do it in different ways table 2 calculates the total number of nominations submitted and confirmed by president whereas table 3 calculates the number of nominations confirmed withdrawn returned and rejected by groups of congresses one result of ordering data by president or by congress is the appearance of the same information in different places in table 2 if president nominates an individual at the end of his term and during the first few days of new congress that information will go into the nominated column in table 3 however the same information will likely go into different column because the data are arranged by groups of congresses and not by president this anomaly results because 4 for further reading regarding the senates role in the consideration of judicial nominations see crs report rl31980 senate consideration of presidential nominations committee and floor procedure by elizabeth rybicki 5 rule xxxi paragraph 6 standing rules of the senate provides in part that if the senate shall adjourn or take recess for more than thirty days all nominations pending and not finally acted upon at the time of taking such adjournment or recess shall be returned by the secretary to the president and shall not again be considered unless they shall again be made to the senate by the president crs3 presidents term in office ends the january after the presidential election has occurred since the congress convenes in january the outgoing president has time to submit judicial nominations these submitted nominations are therefore totaled into the succeeding presidents first congress an example would be president truman during his presidency he submitted 156 district court nominations however the congresses that sat during his presidency 79th82nd considered only 154 two were submitted to the 83rd congress just prior to the eisenhower inauguration data collected by crs the following tables except table 16 were generated from crs database of nomination dates and actions created by the author the data for the crs database were collected from the various volumes of the journal of the executive proceedings of the senate and final editions of the legislative and executive calendar of the senate judiciary committee which are published at the close of each congress and include calendar of actions taken on every judicial nomination referred to the committee during that congress data collection focused on the dates and procedural actions taken on nominations to judgeships in the us district courts including the territorial district courts and the us courts of appeals the us court of appeals system often called the circuit court system is currently composed of 12 geographic circuits and an additional nationwide circuit having specialized subject matter jurisdiction note from 1945 to 1976 there were only 11 geographic circuits and specialized nationwide circuit in the following pages and tables nominations to court of appeals judgeships are referred to as circuit court nominations and the courts are referred to as circuit courts the primary purpose in compiling these statistics was to provide companion report to crs report rl31635 judicial nomination statistics us district and circuit courts 19772003 by denis steven rutkus and mitchel sollenberger although this report focuses on an earlier time period 19451976 it also takes comparative look from presidency to presidency and from congress to congress at the number of district and circuit court nominations submitted to the senate the number and percentage receiving committee and senate action and the average time taken to hold hearings conduct committee votes and conduct senate votes on the nominations the primary focal points for data collection were the dates and actions taken on nominations not individuals nominated in instances where an individual was nominated more than once to particular judgeship each nomination was counted and entered into the calculations for nomination totals confirmation percentages and other statistics tables presenting the average number of days taken to act on nominations from nomination date to committee hearing committee vote or confirmation vote do not measure the overall time that particular individual was 6 table 1 was built on the research and data collection of crs intern oluwabusayo folarin and the website of the federal judicial center washington dc crs4 in nominee status over the course of two or more nominations rather they measure separately the times in days that elapsed for each of the nominations involved resubmitted nominations it should be recognized that data solely concerned with nominations as opposed to individuals nominated can arguably result in misleading calculations if individuals are nominated to the same judgeship more than once either during the same congress or during successive congresses substantial number of resubmitted nominations it may be argued may create an exaggerated statistical sense of how many individuals were nominated and how many nominees or what percentage of nominees failed to gain confirmation conversely resubmitted nominations may serve to skew downward calculations of the average time taken on nominations in the appointment process resubmissions of nominations within congress will cause for time averaging purposes the overall time in which each individual in question was in nominee status to be divided by two or more time segments rather than by just one likewise time averages are lowered by taking separate measurements of nomination made in one congress and the resubmitted nomination in the next congress rather than by measuring the overall time that the nominee in question was in nominee status during the time period of this study 19451976 however resubmissions of judicial nominations were rare selecting federal judges the tables below provide judicial nomination and confirmation data that cover time period 19451976 that is also examined in 1997 book by sheldon goldman professor of political science at the university of massachusetts at amherst in his book picking federal judges7 goldman describes and analyzes the selection process looking at presidential decision making from franklin d roosevelt to ronald reagan 19331989 principle purpose of goldmans book is to understand the character of presidents confirmed judicial nominees and how those nominees were received and processed by the senate hence this report and picking federal judges are similar in covering most of the same presidents truman to ford and also in showing in varying ways the outcome of each presidents successful judicial selections unlike this report however picking federal judges presents specific descriptive information ie race sex education occupation political party and religion concerning the overall makeup and character of the judicial nominees confirmed during each presidency fdr to reagan for its part this report provides more detailed information concerning the actual steps the presidents judicial selections truman to ford went through in the senate the nominations and steps are measured in variety of ways for instance this report counts hearings and committee votes as well as senate votes and other final actions on every district and circuit court nomination president submits and determines timelapse averages not only between nomination and senate confirmation but also between nomination and hearing and nomination and committee vote 7 sheldon goldman picking federal judges new haven ct yale university press 1997 crs5 overview of the statistical tables table 1 identifies the annual number of fulltime district and circuit court judgeships authorized by law and the number and percentage of these judgeships that were vacant at specified time each year also the notes to table 1 indicate when legislation was enacted or when other developments occurred that changed the number of judgeships authorized by law tables 2 and 3 provide presidencybypresidency breakdown of judicial nomination and confirmation statistics for the19451976 period table 2 presents the number of district and circuit court nominations submitted by each president and the number and percentage of these nominations confirmed by the senate the table reveals that over the course of six successive presidencies the confirmation percentage for district and circuit court nominations combined never went below 75 table 2 also shows that presidents johnson and nixon were the only two presidents to have confirmation percentage of 90 or better for both district and circuit court nominations during their presidencies table 3 breaks down each presidents district and circuit court nomination totals by the type of final action taken on them with every nomination categorized according to one of four possible types of final action 1 confirmation by the senate 2 withdrawal by the president 3 senate return of the nomination to the president upon senate adjournment or recess of more than 30 days or 4 senate rejection by vote disapproving nomination the table shows that the great majority of nominations during the 19451976 period were either confirmed or returned that there was an average of two withdrawals per presidency and that the senate voted its disapproval of nomination four times per presidency table 4 presents by congress the number of district and circuit court nominations received by the senate and the number and percent of those nominations confirmed table 4 indicates that during six congresses the 81st 83rd 87th 89th 91st and 92nd significantly more nominations were received by the senate than during other congresses studied in five of these six congresses statute creating new judgeships had been enacted the precise number of judgeships created by each statute is given in source notes to table 1 table 4 also shows for the 19451976 period that only the 80th congress had confirmation percentage below 70 for either district or circuit nominations combined table 5 breaks down for each congress the total number of district and circuit court nominations by the final action taken on them final action as in table 3 covers one of four mutually exclusive outcomes confirmation by the senate withdrawal by the president senate return of the nomination to the president upon senate adjournment or recess of more than 30 days and senate rejection by vote disapproving nomination the table shows that during congresses coinciding with the presidencies of harry s truman and john f kennedy 81st and 87th congresses respectively the senate returned substantially more judicial nominations 27 during the 81st congress and 19 during the 87th congress than during any other congress in the 19451976 period crs6 tables 6 and 7 provide statistics for committee action as well as for senate or other final action in the judicial appointment process table 6 shows for each congress how many district court and circuit court nominations were referred to the senate judiciary committee received committee hearing were voted on by the committee and were voted on by the senate table 7 presents for each congress the average number of days between the presidents submission of judicial nominations to the senate and the dates on which the nominations received hearing committee vote or confirmation vote the table shows among other things that the 84th 85th and 86th congresses were the only congresses in the time period of this study during which an average of 58 days or more elapsed between nomination dates and confirmation votes on district and circuit court nominations combined table 8 presents senate judiciary committee votes on lower court nominations other than those approving motions to report favorably specifically this table lists every vote by the committee during the 19451976 period on motions made to report circuit or district court nomination adversely or without recommendation as well as motions to report favorably that were defeated arranged chronologically by the date each nomination was received in the senate the table lists for each nomination the motion and vote of the judiciary committee and the final outcome in the senate table 8 shows that of the six nominations not receiving favorable committee vote the judiciary committee reported four of the nominations to the senate adversely had tie vote to report favorably on one nomination and voted to table the other crs7 table 1 us district and circuit court judgeships number authorized number of courts by year 19451976 district courtsa circuit courts district and circuit

congress this carryover of actions on particular nominees with hearing held in one congress and votes by the judiciary committee andor the senate in the next congress explains why in some of the congresses the number of nominations receiving hearing is smaller than the number of nominations voted on by committee and by the senate includes nominations to the territorial district courts in the
