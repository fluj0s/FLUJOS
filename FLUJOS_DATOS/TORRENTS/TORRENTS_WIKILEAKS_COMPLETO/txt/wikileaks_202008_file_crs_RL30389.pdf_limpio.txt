former russian premier sergey stepashin initial policy discus sions in march 1999 focused on expanding physical buffer zone already being constructed around chechnya1 in july 1999 plans shifted to occupying chechnyas northern lowlands after the dagestan incursion and the bombings in russian cities general air and ground operations to occupy all of chechnya were embraced2 russian premier

this allegation was denounced by col gen manilov as smear campaign against russias armed forces implications for russia and chechnya increasing transborder chechen brigandage and kidnaping in the late 1990s and the chechen incursion into dagestan have contributed to changes in russians views of chechnya perhaps making it easier for many to suspect chechen terrorists of being responsible for the apartment house bombings while during the 19941996 conflict most russians suppor ted an end to the conflict during the recent conflict many or most have appeared to have less sympathy for chechnya23 it has been easier for russian officials to influence pub lic opinion on chechnya now than in 1994 1996 because chechnyas communications f acilities were destro yed early and most russian and foreign reporters have been banned from the region until recently russian media have largely echoed official dogma that precision bombing is sparing civilians and eliminating terrorists and that russian
