value that america places on the contributions of those who serve their communities in potentially dangerous circumstances 1 the program was created by congress out of concern that the hazards

death benefit pursuant to the hometown heroes act bja reported that it encountered series of problems in implementing the provisions of the hometown heroes act in january 2004 bja amended the psob regulations to implement the hometown heroes act19 bja chose to overhaul the psob regulations because they had not been significantly amended in 30 years and because the psob act had been amended 18 times since 1976 which resulted in overlapping statutory and regulatory structures20 after the draft regulations were posted in the federal register for comment period congress enacted additional amendments to the psob act which required additional modifications to the psob regulations and new comment period21 the final psob regulations went into effect on september 11 2006 the psob office could not review claims for death benefits submitted pursuant to the hometown heroes act until the psob regulations were finalized which resulted in backlog of claims22 the psob office is working to reduce the backlog of claims to help reduce the backlog bja hired additional staff to review psob claims contracted with additional private forensic pathologists identified additional hearing officers for appeals see below and created an online system for submitting claims23 the psob office is working toward goal of processing claims within 90 days of receiving all necessary information from agencies and survivors24 the psob office has changed its policy to address the concerns of the public safety community about the way that hometown heroes act claims are settled the director of bja has directed the psob office not to require claimants to submit medical history records unless something in the claim affirmatively suggests that something other than the line of duty caused the fatal heart attack or stroke or that it was more likely than not that the heart attack or stroke was imminent 25 in cases where the psob office requests medical records the psob office has been instructed

instructed the psob office with regard to the ap plication of the term nonroutine activity an activity is longer considered to be routine because it is described by the public safety agency as being routine or ordinary28 when the psob office determines whether an activity is routine the offices determination is informed less by the frequency with which the activity is performed than by its stressful or strenuous character29 the director chose to clarify the definition of nonroutine activity because of concerns that the psob office was too widely defining which activities were considered routine

in march of 2008 the department of justice doj office of the inspector general oig issued report on its assessment of among other things the timeliness of ojps processing of claims under the hometown heroes act 30 the oig found that as of november 29 2007 ojp had completed only half of the claims it had received since the hometown heroes act was passed one of the reasons cited by the oig for the back log of claims was the 33 months it took ojp to issue new regulations to implement the act during which time ojp developed backlog of 201 claims31 the oig found that the processing of hometown heroes act claims was slow even after the regulations were in place the delays in processing the claims were in part according to the oig the result of most claims being submitted without the required documentation the office of general counsels legal review of each claim was time consuming and decisions on some claims were delayed because ojp could not obtain needed pathology reviews starting in the fall of 2007 ojp implemented new policies and procedures that were designed to expedite the claims review process including providing more guidance to claimants and changing internal procedures to speed the claims review process the oig found evidence that the policies and procedures put in place by ojp increased its ability to quickly review claim and make determination in fy2007 ojp issued determinations on 72 hometown heroes act claims but in the first two months of fy2008 it issued determinations on 40 claims 32 by the end of the oig review ojp had reduced the claims backlog from 201

mandatory program and the disability and education benefits are discretionary programs as such congress appropriates such sums as are necessary each fiscal year to fund the psob death benefit program while appropriating separate amounts for both the disability and education benefits programs table 1 outlines the appropriations and obligations for all three psob benefit programs for fy 2003fy2007 the amount obligated indicates the amount of benefits awarded each fiscal year for each psob program in some cases claim might be submitted in one fiscal year but the actual award is made in another hence the difference between each fiscal years appropriation and obligations benefits are paid with funds appropriated for the fiscal year in which the office r was disabled or killed in the line of duty not the fiscal year in which the claim was approve d for example if an officer was disabled in fy2005 but the claim was not approved until fy2007 the officers claim would be paid with funds appropriated in fy2005 between fy2007 and fy2008 the appropriation for the psob death benefit increased 1203 and obligations for death benefits increased 1648 according to ojp it requested an additional 55 million dollars in budget authority to cover an unintended increase in psob death benefits claims 59 according to ojp the influx in psob death benefits claims can be attributed to
