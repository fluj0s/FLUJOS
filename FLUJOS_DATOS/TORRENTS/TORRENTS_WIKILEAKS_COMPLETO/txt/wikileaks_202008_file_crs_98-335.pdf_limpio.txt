bill either by unanimous consent or by motion bill is not considered as read for second time for amendment until the chair directs the clerk to read section one under regular order bill is read for amendment by section by unanimous consent however bill could be considered as read and open for amendment by title or at any point in either case the chair may then recognize any member to offer an amendment g20g142g140g152g144g151g146g157g146g152g151g561g138g151g141g561g6g142g139g138g157g142g561 in recognizing members to offer amendments or to speak the chair generally alternates between parties and gives preference to more senior members when member offers an amendment the committee clerk traditionally reads the amendment and staff distribute copies of it the reading may be dispensed

rules immediately if it is reserved the proponent of the amendment is recognized for five minutes in support of the amendment in either case the only time the point of order can be raised or postponed is prior to the proponent speaking on behalf of his or her amendment most committees consider amendments under the fiveminute rule however unlike in the committee of the whole members do not need to strike the last word to gain recognition members merely need to seek recognition to speak on an amendment member may gain additional time to speak beyond five minutes by obtaining unanimous consent

traditionally prepared and agreed to in advance by all committee members as third option the chair can offer or recognize another member to offer an amendment in the nature of substitute essentially fulltext alternative to the pending measure such an amendment can only be offered at the beginning or end of the process and would then be open to amendment at any point the previous question can be moved on such an amendment following debate on it cutting off all further debate and amendments to the measure being marked up amendments must be read in full unless reading is dispensed with by unanimous consent amendments can be withdrawn as long as action such as vote has been taken on them unanimous consent is not required general principles and prohibitions governing amendments on the floor also generally apply in committee such as amendments are only permitted in two degrees and amendments must be germane

the entire bill has been considered as read any member can move the previous question this motion can only be made when all sections have been read member can also move to close or end debate on pending amendment or to limit further debate on pending amendment or section at specified time unlike the previous question closing debate does not preclude offering or deciding on further amendments it just means that all subsequent amendments would be decided without debate g24g152g157g146g151g144g561g152g151g561g3g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g156g561 there are three methods of voting in
