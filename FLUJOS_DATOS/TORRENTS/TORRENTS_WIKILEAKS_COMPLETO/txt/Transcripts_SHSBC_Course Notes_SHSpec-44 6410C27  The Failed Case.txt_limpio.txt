6410c27 shspec44 the failed case the book of case remedies handles the failed case look up the symptoms and handle as directed but there is one case that will always be failed case the reason lies not with the auditor scientology or the tech in 1954 lrh researched people who had turned against dianetics and scientology to find the common denominator he found about twentyone people who had been in dianetics and scientology but had worked against it and caused lot of trouble seventeen of the twentyone had criminal records also they had had auditing but had gotten case change there might have been twentyone for twentyone but lrh got tired of looking after seventeen recently lrh found out the other factor in the totally failed case the totally failed case commits more overts between sessions in pt than can be picked up in session he is the continuous pt overts case he doesnt asis things well he takes long time to get at anything he takes responsibility for anything he is hard to get in comm with etc in freudian terms he is the detached case dissociative reaction schizoid personality he admits to fantastic crimes but doesnt really consider he did them he is really saying society forced to commit or my hand stole the watch etc he says i picked up the pocket book but means my hand picked up the pocket book such case cant asis the overt because there is lie in his statement of it it is incomplete he says my hand stole the watch but the correct statement is i saw the watch and stole it with my hand he has put an alteris on the line he didnt do it it happened then there is the guy who is putting up social front and never admits anything he has done because he doesnt want to look bad to the auditor this is partly matter of getting in good comm line you can get real overts off the case by asking for horrendously exaggerated overts like have you murdered any little children lately it is trick for another gradient you can ask what are you willing to talk to about you can audit all the sexual overts off the case that you like without restimulating gpms because sex is not in the gpms or endwords as such though it forms locks on gpm endwords and rootwords sex is humanoid activity and the gpm words dont necessarily refer to humanoid activities but the real failed case commits so many overts in pt you dont have time in session to get them all off the failed case is continually committing real pt overts he is so irresponsible that the overts dont react on the meter because they are just not potentially real to him the source of small reads in r6 is running the pc where he isnt which means leaving bpc where he is if he is getting reads on any list you are using to correct this situation either the items on the lists are unreal because hes got reality on gpms being totally uneducated or hes got it all suppressed if you are running prepcheck on pc and he runs out of answers on button eg suppress dont push him on that button just because you are getting ta on it you will just restimulate the rest of the buttons ta action in prepcheck is on the process ie the whole prepcheck not on the button you happen to be running at the moment if the prepcheck is not flat when you reach the end of the buttons go through it again i know of auditing action where pc who has been getting proper ta action in the session who says i dont have any more answers to it has ever had any further answers to it there are indicators in the physical appearance and meter behavior of the pc who is running ow that there are more answers than he is willing to give only in this case do you press the question home this is not applicable to ptps withheld ptps wont hurt the pc they will only be withheld if they are connected to an overt and you will get that on ow buttons so watch out for overrun the slowest rate of change in pc is at the start of the case the case that is winning accelerates in rate of change as you audit it up the line cognitions of given magnitude come faster comm lag decreases so you have to be careful not to overrun the pc the failed case however doesnt change at all you can check rate of change of case by checking to see how many hours it takes for person to have fundamental cog of some kind at first perhaps it takes 25 hours later perhaps it only takes an hour then you get the person who audits almost by inspection the increased rate of cognition goes along with decrease in the comm lag another thing you will notice is the pcs physical posture and mannerisms if there is change in these over time if the pc keeps returning to posture or mannerism then he is not experiencing rate of change of progress another bad indicator in this respect is when nonoptimum condition persists when you see that you know that the case needs remedying the other bad indicators would be there too as an auditing supervisor you should expect to see some change within few days one way to spot what overts the failed case is committing between sessions is to listen for what he complains of in others the way you would handle the failed case would be to extend your zone of influence to include everywhere the case goes between sessions for long enough to prevent the continuous overts long enough to pull the pc out of it this would be very thoroughgoing solution and change but it is about all you could do you do what you can there is fast process to undercut the case either the furthest south process you could use to benefit the case would be justifications but you still have to get comm line established first commoner than the continuous pt overt case is the person who continually committed overts in the past and has this in restimulation the case that has lots of past overts but isnt doing them in pt is easier to handle the proper approach to this case is 1 get in comm with the pc 2 get more and more overts on gentle gradient if the case keeps getting off the same overt it has become problem as far as the mechanics of it go problem is postulatecounterpostulate therefore it floats in time this is problem about the overt it wasnt an overt in his view it was justified so in this situation you can use 1 what have you done 2 how have you justified it or 3 how wasnt that an overt this is not repetitive process ask what have you done that was harmful act and really get an answer that both of you agree was real overt this is not repetitive question it is one question that might take 25 hours of arguing back and forth about what is an overt etc chitterchat to get answered when youve got it then ask how was that not an overt and keep going on that one for as long as it takes to really get that answered you want to get what he really thought was unharmful about it why he really had to do it at the end of this process he will really cog dont run these two questions as repetitive process it can take long time to get them answered you are asking the questions right into the guts of aberration you are not going up on it on some gradient hoping some accident will occur you are going right down the center of the road after something that answered that question an unchanging condition comes from postulatecounterpostulate so an overt which created or sought to solve an obsessive problem hangs in time and becomes both an overt act and ptp most overts are committed as solutions this gives you another inroad to the case that keeps committing pt overts handle the overt as ptp that the pc is trying to solve you could find out what ptp are you trying to solve with overts or what have you done recently that was pretty antisocial then what problem were you trying to solve by doing that it would be an oddball problem the trouble with such case is that you are likely only to get bunch of motivators repetitive questions dont work if the question you ask the pc or his answer to it isnt real to him the fact that the pc is out of comm with you makes finding the ptp that the pcs overt is intended to solve uncertain of result however on ordinary cases it works very well to find what ptp the guy is trying to solve with his overts and doing so blows lots of overts into view that the pc might never otherwise have suspected not all overts are efforts to solve problems some are accidental some are out of misunderstoods getting the justifications off unlocks the problem aspect takes lot of locks off etc the pc will cognite on the problem and the effect can sometimes be magical none of the above will work with truly failed case type although it may sometimes nudge such case the only thing you can do with the failed case is to restrain him somehow from committing overts long enough to get him audited long enough so that he will quit committing the continuous pt overts
