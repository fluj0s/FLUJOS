inventor who does not file for foreign patents to request delay in publication until three months after the first patent and trademark office action on the application 4 both bills tablish the pto as government corporation but hr 400 provides that the pto is subject to the pol icy direction of the commerce department and the bill creates new under secretary of commerce for intellectual property

their patent applications before the patent issues the kaptur amendment als deleted from hr 400 an entire title which would have changed the paten t reexamination procedures the senate ju diciary committee reported s 507 with substitute amendment the hatchleahy amendment s 507 embodies different exemption from the 18 month publication rule than the exemption contained in the kaptur amendment any inventor who forgoes foreign patenting may at the time of filing the application request delay in publication until the patent issues the hatchleahy amendment retained those patent reexamination

scope of the 1996 ban on enforcement of medical methods patents by exempting those patents for which an application wa s pending when the ban was enacted on september 30 1996 hr 400 appears to contain an inadvertent technical error both the kaptu r8 amendment generally exempting small entities from preissuance publication adopted n april 23 1997 and the floor managers amendment allowing small entities to dela publication until three months after the second pto action adopted on april 17 1997 are contained in the bill the intention apparently was for the kaptur amendment to replac the floor managers amendment regarding early publication of applications from smal l entities but the kaptur amendment did not expressly strike the relevant provisions of th continuedthis report summarizes and compares s 507 and hr 400 provide s background information on the major patent reform issues and briefly present s arguments that have been advanced for and against particular patent refor m proposals overview s 507 and hr 400 contain several titles that are nearly identical or at leas t similar in content but there are also major differences because of amendment s made to hr 400 during its consideration by the house of representatives bot h bills propose reorganization of the patent and trademark office pto as government corporation early publication of certain patent applications and other patent law reforms the major differences between the two bills now are 1s 507 has title dealing with the issue of invention promotion services regulation but hr 400 does 2 hr 400 has title dealing with patent reexamination reform but s 507 does 3both bills generally require publication of patent applications 18 month s after filing but hr 400 generally exempts small businesses independent inventor s and universities from preissuance publication and s 50 78httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97591crs4 continued8 floor manag ers amendment the language of both amendments relating to an exceptio n for small entities from the 18 month publication rule is in the bill as it passed the house in addition to the basic point that the kaptur amendment generally exempts preissuanc publication of small entity applications and the managers amendment allows publication three months after the second pto action and therefore before issuance ordinarily ther are other apparent differences between the two provisions the kaptur amendment applie s to univers ities expressly but the managers amendment did not refer to universitie s expressly under the managers amendment the request to delay publication must be made at the time of filing and the director of the pto can review the eligibility of the smal l entity at 15 months after filing whereas under the kaptur amendment nonpublicatio n before issuance is autom atic in discussing the early publication provisions of hr 400 this report will assume that the inconsistencies would be corrected during housesenat conference on the bill if the kaptur amendment is retained by the conference committee this report assum the kaptur amendment is intended to supersede the three months after second pto action provision of the managers amendment based upon the fiscal 1998 proposed pto budget of 630 million the policy offic e9 could have up to 126 million budgetmerely gives any inventor who does not file in foreign country th privilege of delaying publication until three months after the first paten t and trademark office pto action and 4hr 400 creates an under secret ary for intellectual property policy in the department of commerce and subjects the new pto corporation to th policy direction of the department of commerce although s 507 doe s not create new policy office the pto corporation would be under the policy direction of the secretary of commerce also s 507 establishe s the trademark office as separate administrative unit but hr 400 does not create separate units even though hr 400 provides for appointment of two commissioners one for patents and one for trademarks thus title i of both bills deals with pto corporation status but hr 40 0 creates an intellectual prope rty policy office in the department of commerce which is not included in s 50 7 and which is funded by up to 2 percent of the fees collected by the pto corporation 9 title ii of both bills contains provisions concerning early publication of patent applications 18 months after filing the application hr 400 generally exempts small business entities independent inventors and universities from publication befor patent issuance s 507 gives any inventor the option of delaying publication unti l three months after the first pto action both bills contain essentially the same patent term restoration provisions extensions up to 10 years would be available in the case of appeals and unusua l administr ative delays in the case of delays related to interferences or governmen t secrecy orde rs the patent could be extended for the period of the delay without any cap in hr 400 these provisions appear as part of title ii in s 507 however the patent term restoration provisions appear in title iii httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97591crs5 both bills contain closely similar provisions concerning prior domesti c commercial user rights they appear in title iv of s 507 and title iii of hr 400 there is one main difference hr 400 expands the scope of the right to includ prior domestic research users title iv of hr 400 concerning regulation of invention promotion services has counterpart in s 507 title v of s 507 on patent reexamination reform has comparable provision in the housepassed version of hr 400 title vi of s 507 contains the following miscellaneous patent provisions that are also found in title v of hr 400 provision governing the priority date fo r provisional united states applications provision governing the priority date fo r international applications for plant breeders patents provision eliminating th existing prohibition against patenting tuber propogated plants and extendin g protecti on for the sale of parts of asexually produced plants and provisio n permitting electronic filing with the pto hr 400 adds two sections coverin g divisional applications and publication of pto procurement contracts not found i n s 507 s 507 adds three different miscellaneous provisions not found in hr 400 the pto must develop computer network for rural states to access paten t information gao must report concerning the risks involved in depositing materia l in suppor t of biotechnology patents and the scope of the ban on enforcement f medical methods patents is narrowed by exempting those patents for which n application was pending when the ban was enacted ie by

of reorganization of the pto as government corporation napa has recommended corporatio n status for the pto in reports issued in 1985 1989 and 1995 both s 507 and hr 400 establish the pto as government corporation and agency of the united states with businesslike authority to conduct its operation s relating to issuance of patents and registration of trademarks the pto corporation would be subject to c ongressional oversight expenditures and borrowing under s 507 would be subject to the appropriations acts hr 400 has eliminated th borrowing authority the fee structure would be set by the congress with som administrative authority to adjust fees for inflation and set fees for special services the management of the pto corporation would be vested in director wh would be appointed by

rewritten or rejects th application as filed several contacts between the examiner and the patent applicant ar common before the patent ultimately issues these contacts may consume months or year s in some cases also administrative and judicial appeals may be taken if the pto reject s the claims which could consume additional months or years there are additional conditions that will affect the ability of the pto to publish the17 application the director of the pto must give notice to the patent applicant who has 90 days to demonstrate that the st atutory conditions for publication have not been satisfied for publicat ion to take place the application must have been filed after enactment must t have been published previously by the pto not be under appellate review by the board of patent

preissuance publication of patent applications 14 under existing united state s patent law 35 usc 122 patent application must remain confidential until the patent issues virtually all foreign countrie s require publication of pending patent applications after fixed period of time usually 18 months after filing as part of the effort to harmonize national paten t laws and develop international standards the patent and trademark office s advisory commission on patent reform in march 1992 recommended that unite d states law be amended to require publication of patent applications 18 months after filing title ii of both bills would amend 35 usc 122 to require public disclosure15 of patent applications generally 18 months after the earliest filing date for which benefit is sought subject to certain exceptions the exceptions common to both bills are applications longer pending 18 months after filing and applications subject to government secrecy order s 507 also allows any inventor who foregoes foreign patenting to request delay in publication until 3 months after the first pto action on the application 16 hr 400 as passed by the house also exempts applications undergoing national security review and under the kaptur amendment generally exempt s applications filed by small business entities independent inventors and universities from publ ication before issuance of the patent the small entities exemption does not apply i to an application pending more than five years which is not bein g diligently pursued and ii to an application for which continuing application has17 been filed more than 6 months after the original filing unless the applicant ca n adequately demonstrate reason fo r the continuing application other than an attempt to delay publication the director of

the submarine problem senator hatch presumably means the practice known as submarine patenting deliberate delays by the applicant in prosecuting the paten t applicati on until the claimed technology is independently developed by competitors fo r further discussion see footnote 31 infra sec 211 of hr 400 given the exemption of independent inventors generall y20 from preissuan ce publication it is not clear whether the reporting requirement was retained inadvertently following adoption of the kaptur amendment exempting independen t inventors or whether it is intended that the report will contain information about thos applica tions of independent inventors that are published before issuance because f abusive delays in patent prosecutionto publish the data in the foreign patent application of an otherwise exempt entit after the data is published abroad if the data is not available in english throug h commercial services the small entities exemption applies in the context of 20yearsfromfiling patent term deliberate delays in patent prosecution count against the patent term18 under this system senator hatch noted this point in discussing the patent ter m provisions of s 507 he said by adopting gatt and changing the manner i n which we calculate the patent term to twenty years from filing we eliminated th submarine problem under the current rule if an applicant delays his ow n application it simply shortens the time he will have after the actual granting of the patent thus we have eliminated this unscrupulous inefficient practice b removing its benefits19 some may argue that preissuance publication rules are required even under term computed from fi ling because it may be difficult to establish whether the delays are the fault of the applicant or of the pto provisional rights another provision of title ii common to both bills grants provisional royalty rights from publication to patent issuance assuming that th patent is granted and provided that the user of the invention had actual knowledge of an english language version of the published application new preissuance opposition both bills provide that the publicatio n requirements shall not operate to create any new opportunities for preissuanc opposition to the patent application the director of the pto may issue regulations to ensure this outcome differences other than publication rules two other provisi ons of hr 400 are omitted from s 507 one provision requires pto report by april 1 2001 and annually thereafter regarding the impact of early publication on independen t

years from filing which was considered and rejected by the hous in the form of an amendment by representative rohrabacher but has not been introduced in the senate the argument also refers to the fact that the director of the pt makes the initial determin ations about the period of any extension based upon findings about the reasonable diligence of the applicant in prosecuting the patent application thi s authority would arguably be controlled however by the statutory standards governin g delays also pto term extension decisions are appealableissue regulations providing for limited

places the provisions regarding patent term restoration in separate title title iii of s 507 rather than include them in t itle ii as hr 400 does pros and c ons of preissuance publication supporters of early publication have contended that these disclosure provisions further the constitutional incentiv to disseminate information regarding new technologies more rapidly they asser t that the term extension provisions guarantee that patent applicants will not patent term due to delays that are not their fault and that the provisional right to royalty protects patentholders whose applications are published before issuance22 one argument against early publication has presumably been affected by house adoption of the kaptur amendment generally exempting small entities from pre issuance publication however since t he small entities exemption does not appear in the senate bill opponents of early publication will likely revisit the issue in th senate they have argued that the 18 month provision violates the original inten t of our founding fathers to grant an applicant patent in exchange for full disclosure of the inven tors idea and prematurely discloses american patent applications to competitors and the public worldwide early publi cation opponents also assert that23 the extensions of the patent term which are in the power of the commissioner t grant are substitute
