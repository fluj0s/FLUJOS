updated july 17 2001 voting on ntr for china again in 2001 and past congressional decisions kerry dumbaugh specialist in asian affairs foreign affairs defense and trade division summary since 1990 congress has faced an annual contentious decision on whether and under what conditions to renew normal trade relations ntr status with china for another year this annual exercise occurred because under us law chinas ntr status is temporary and the president has to recommend its renewal each year by june 3 in 2000 the 106th congress considered and passed hr 4444 pl 106286 which would eliminate the annual ntr renewal process and grant permanent ntr to china but this act only grants permanent ntr to china once it joins the world trade organization since this has not yet happened president bush on june 1 2001 was compelled to recommend another temporary extension of chinas ntr status for one year in order for it to continue uninterrupted the ntr renewal is subject to enactment of joint resolution of disapproval by congress such joint resolution hjres 50 was introduced on june 5 2001 by representative dana rohrabacher the ways and means trade subcommittee reported the resolution adversely on july 12 2001 and the house rejected the resolution on july 18 2001 by vote of 259169 background congressional actions 19892000 since 1989 the us policy debate over chinas mostfavorednation mfn status renamed normal trade relations or ntr under us law in 1998 has undergone several transformations the issue was essentially irrelevant in the 1980s when annual extension of mfn to china was nearly automatic in 1989 the year of the tiananmen square crackdown resolution was even introduced that would have disapproved or put further conditions on chinas mfn status eligibility but by 1990 congress and the bush administration were clashing repeatedly over the direction of posttiananmen china policy administration officials often blamed congress for being obstructionist and partisan while members of congress often criticized the president for ignoring congressi onal initiatives and being too accommodating toward beijing much of this debate was carried out through the annual process of renewing chinas mfn status the mfn debate reached zenith in the 102nd congress with the house passing joint resolutions disapproving mfn for china in both 1991 and 1992 the senate has neverhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20691crs2 1 in the 104th congress the house passed hr 2058 the china policy act of 1995 and hres 461 legislation concerning congressional hearings on china neither restricted chinas trade status 2 see crs report rl30350 china and the 105th congress policy issues and legislation 1997 1998 on july 22 1998 the 105th congress also passed legislation pl 105206 which replaced the term mostfavorednation in certain us statutes with the term normal trade relations or ntr this is now how this trade status is referred to in the united states although the rest of the international community still refers to this status as mfnpassed relevant joint resolution of disapproval the primary focus of the debate during these years however was not whether to deny mfn status for china altogether but whether to place new human rights conditions on chinas mfn eligibility in both sessions the house and senate jointly passed legislation that would have done the latter both times president bush vetoed the legislation and while the house voted in both cases to override the senate did not have the votes to do so in either instance in 1993 newly elected president bill clinton announced he would link chinas mfn status to human rights progress beginning in 1994 although the president reversed himself in 1994 his 1993 decision appears to have been pivotal catalyst in the declining importance of mfn status as tool with which to influence china policy since 1993 neither the house nor the senate has passed legislation to deny or further restrict chinas mfn trade status instead members have turned to legislative alternatives most of which have focused on more specific directions for us policy and more targeted sanctions on chinas activities1 these alternatives have included legislation concerning prison conditions in china and prison labor expor ts coercive abortion practices religious freedom chinas missile proliferation activities radio free asia broadcasting chinas participation in multilateral institutions allegations of chinese espionage against the united states and the activities of chinas military and intelligence services the 105th congress was particularly active considering package of legislation in those areas2 house versus senate actions throughout the past decade the house was the more active body in considering legislation affecting chinas mfnntr status the house voted on joint resolutions disapproving chinas mfnntr status ten times in the last ten years every year since 1990 and three times voted in favor of disapproving chinas mfn status in 1990 1991 and 1992 the house also was the more active body on alternative measures relating in some way to chinas trade status voting in favor of six such measures as opposed to two for the senate over the past decade the senate on the other hand has never taken recorded vote on joint resolution of disapproval for chinas mfnntr status in fact the senate considered joint resolutions of disapproval only once in the past ten years on july 18 1991 by unanimous consent the senate elected to postpone consideration of both the house and senate joint resolutions on that subject but the senate is on record twice with what may be seen as symbolic test votes of senate sentiment on chinas mfnntr status in recorded vote in 1997 the senate rejected nonbinding amendment to foreign operations appropriations bill which stated that chinas mfn status should be revok ed and in recorded vote in 1999 the senate rejected motion to discharge the senate finance committee from consideration of joint resolution of disapproval see the table that followshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20691crs3 table 1 congressional consideration of mfn for china 19891999

leverage to bring about change in china while at the same time sacrificing the interests of us exporters workers and consumers house ways and means committee report to hr 4444 hrept 106632china and pntr congressional action several proposals were considered by the 106th congress pertinent to chinas future trade status on march 8 2000 president clinton submitted to congress proposal to terminate the applicat ion of title iv of the trade act of 1974 to china upon chinas accession to the world trade organization wto in effect the proposal granted permanent ntr status to china rather than subjecting that status to annual renewal giving china the same trade status the united states gives to all but handful of other countries without any annual review process or restrictions applying subsequently the chairmen of the relevant house and senate committees representative bill archer of the house ways and means committee and senator william roth of the senate finance committee introduced legislation encompassing the presidents request hr 4444 and s 2277 respectively since current us law continued to apply absent congressional enactment of permanent ntr pntr chinas ntr status was scheduled to expire on july 3 2000 for this reason president clinton on june 2 2000 had to recommend another temporary extension of chinas ntr status for one year in response to the presidents recommendation representative dana rohrabacher introduced joint resolution disapproving the oneyear extension hjres 103 the house rejected it on july 18 2000 making senate consideration moot house consideration hr 4444 archer as introduced on may 15 2000 hr 4444 was simple restatement of the presidents march 8 2000 proposal to extend pntr to china upon its accession to the wto since then however the bill has been substantially expanded and amended to include other provisions in markup on may 17 2000 the ways and means committee adopted an amendment to the bill to include detailed import surge protections giving the president authority to increase duties on selected chinese products if their importation increased to such an extent as to threaten market disruption to us producers this antisurge language was originally part of comprehensive legislative proposal crafted by representatives doug bereuter and sander levin that was designed to enhance the pntr bills prospects the bereuterlevin proposal socalled parallel legislation was first announced on may 9 2000 and further refined in subsequent days to address continuing concerns of house leaders in its final version bereuter levin proposed establishing more comprehensive chinapntr framework for chinas wto accession that would address human rights and other issues of concern to us policymak ers in markup the house ways and means committee adop ted an amendment to hr 4444 containing only the antisurge language of the bereuterlevin proposal the committee then reported the amended hr 4444 favorably by the substantial margin of 344 hrept 1066323 on may 23 2000 the full house amended hr 4444 further by adding the rest of the bereuterlevin language that change was made possible under special procedure by the house rules committee in which adoption of the rule hres 510 automaticallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20691crs5 4 similar bill hr 4829 was introduced july 13 2000 by representative ben gilmanamended hr 4444 with the language of the bereuterlevin proposal the full house adopted the rule by vote of 294136 as further amended by the house then hr 4444 establishes congressional executive commission on china to monitor human rights labor standards religious freedom and ruleoflaw progress in china requires continual review of and reporting on chinas compliance with its wto obligations establishes task force on prohibiting prison labor imports urges that taiwans accession to wto be considered immediately after chinas and authorizes 99 million in fy2001 for additional news broadcasts into china the house passed the amended hr 4444 on may 24 2000 by vote of 237197 senate consideration hr 4444s 2277 roth as with the house bill the senate pntr bill introduced on march 23 2000 s 2277 was identical to the presidents march 8 2000 proposal to extend pntr to china upon wto accession the senate finance committee marked up the senate bill on may 17 2000 the same day the house ways and means committee considered its version and favorably reported clean bill by vote of 191 srept 106305 amendments were considered in the weeks following that however senate consideration became more problematic first with time running short in the 106th congress senate leaders elected to focus on the housepassed bill hr 4444 since senate passage of the house bill without amendment would avoid the delay and further controversy of conference committee after invoking cloture on july 27 2000 by vote of 8612 the senate resumed consideration of hr 4444 when it recon vened after the august recess on september 7 the senate voted 925 to proceed to consideration of the bill although the administration and the bills proponents had advocated straightforward passage of clean hr 4444 number of senators sponsored amendments to the bill on range of human rights and other issues on september 7 2000 the senate rejected 3 such amendments hollings amendment relating to the terms of chinas wto accession rejected 1381 byrd amendment regarding export of clean energy technology to china rejected 3165 and wellstone amendment on religious freedom in china rejected 28 69 the senate also rejected all additional amendments the bills supporters were most concerned about possible consideration of s 2645 the china nonproliferation actintroduced on may 25 2000 by senators fred thompson and robert torricelli4 as introduced the thompsontorricelli bill would have established annual presidential review of chinas nuclear nonprolifera tion record and would have required the president to take action including suspension of us exports to suspect chinese companies should he determine that nuclearrelated transfers have occurred administration officials negotiated with the bills sponsors in an effort to make changes in the legislation in part by expanding the countries covered under the bill and the bills sponsors accommodated many of these concerns on september 13 2000 however the senate voted 6532 to table thompson amendment to hr 4444 relating to nonproliferation this cleared the way for final passage of hr 4444 on september 19 2000 by vote of 8315 the president signed the bill into law the same day it was presented to him on october 10 2000 pl 106286httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20691crs6 action in the 107th congress in the aftermath of the collision on april 1 2001 of chinese jet fighter with us navy surveillance plane over the south china sea the 107th congress introduced legislation congress relating to chinas ntr status hr 1467 introduced on april 4 2001 by representative duncan hunter would change us law to prohibit the extension of normal trade relations to china at any time in the future hr 1497 also introduced on april 4 2001 by representative john murtha would revoke the pntr language enacted last year in pl 106286 leaving current law on annual extensions in place on june 1 2001 president bush was compelled to recommend renewal of chinas ntr status again this year because the prc has not yet joined the wto in response to that presidential action on june 5 2001 representative dana rohrabacher introduced hjres 50 joint resolution disapproving the presidents recommendation the house ways and means committee reported the measure adversely on july 12 2001 hrept 107145 and the full house rejected the measure on july 18 2001 by vote of 269159 implications proponents of pntr for the prc claimed that the measure was necessary to help rationalize the bilateral trade relationship and insulat it to degree from other contentious non traderelated issues the removal of the annual trade certification would also bring us trade laws into conformity with wto agreements if us trade treatment of china remained subject to the annual certification the united states likely would have to invoke the wtos nonapplication clause article xiii to avoid being found in violation of wto rules in that case wto agreements technically would not apply between the two countries finally chinas actual admission to the wto is not dependent on its trade treatment by the united states opponents of granting pntr to china argued that the measure remove d an important source of us leverage with china and an important source of congressional leverage with the white house at time when china seemed to have increased its human rights abuses its aggressiveness toward taiwan and its hostility to the united states china should not be rewarded for such activities by having this important us leverage removed these same arguments have been used in support of the ntrpntrrelated legislation introduced in the 107th congress in larger sense the eventual elimination of the annual ntr renewal for china is not likely to mean that controversies in uschina relations or disagreements among us policymakers will vanish on the contrary controversies and policy battles have increased on other issues even while the debate over chinas trade status over the past decade has faded in importance this suggests that those who are suspicious of beijings intentions or who argue for more cautious us approach toward the prc are likely to continue efforts to move congress and the administration to more specific more targeted legislative measures as policy tools those who opposed unconditional pntr for china will undoubtedly continue to place high priority on policy measures that would assure taiwans security protest religious persec ution improve labor rights help tibet and enforce prc compliance with trade agreements this being the case the us policy agenda on china is likely to remain fractionalized and complex more likely to be characterized by series of separate and unrelated policy measures rather than an overarching cohesive policy framework
