chapter i overview 1 background an integrated air defense system iads is co mprised of sensors weapons command control communications computers and intelligence systems and personnel in combination they provide defense against missiles and aircraft for an operational area integrating the services air defense systems enhances the employment of each services capabiliti and enhances the level of defense provided to friendly forces b number of factors drive the requirement for robust iads capability these include the proliferation of enemy missile systems with the capab ility to deliver weapons of mass destruction which may create the necessity for us forces to operate nd fight in more compressed battlespace with reduced warning and reaction time in todays battlespace the jfc must take full advantage of increasingly capable sensors weapons and c2 systems to counter enemy capabilities c during recent joint operations the lack of conn ectivity interoperable systems and common tactics techniques and procedures ttps forced th segregation of the battlespace into servicespecific exclusive operational areas as result individual service air defense systems were suboptimized and the iads could not function to its full capability 2 threat the threat is comprised of two elements airc raft manned and unmanne d and theater missiles tms including theater ballistic missiles tbms intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms cruise missiles cms and airtosurface missiles asms all air and missile threats must be neutralized or destroyed as far away as practical from friendly forces b theater air and missile threats vary by region and in technological sophistication technology transfers and weapons proliferation complicate our ab ility to assess all potential threats with certainty the number of countries with tm capability is likely to increase improved technology and increases in the number of enemy deployed tm systems pose incr eased risks to united states us forces many countries also possess and continually upgrade modern co mbat aircraft the proliferation of cms tbms asms and unmanned aerial vehicles uavs complicat the tasks of providing force protection and attaining air superiority plans should anticipate the effects of electronic warfare combat losses and communications degradation on system operations 3 principles of an integr ated air defense system centralized planning and direction centralized planning and direction is essential for controlling and coordina ting the efforts of the forces it main tains unity of effort and optimizes the contributions of all forces b decentralized execution decentralized execution permits timely decisive action by tactical commanders without compromising the ability of operationallevel commanders to control operations decentralized execution is essential because one comma nder can control the detailed actions of large number of units or individuals c planned responses planned responses support prom pt decisive tactical action by exploiting prior testing and development of optimal net setup service doctrines force operations and courses of action i2 d effective and efficient communications effi cient communications support timely data and information exchange and optimize net effectiven ess and maintains operational tempo by avoiding unnecessary communications layered defense layered defenses provide multip opportunities to engage attacking aircraft and missiles ideally at the maximum range from friendly forces f 360degree coverage 360degree coverage guards against unpredictable targets popup targets and multithreatmultiaxis attacks g early detection discrimination classificati on and identification early detection discrimination classification and identification supp ort prompt warning of attacks and timely cueing they also enable prompt informed decision support for engaging timesensitive targets 4 conclusion competing demands for air and missile defense reso urces require detailed planning so that every air defense asset is employed to the full extent of its capability developing an iads enables more effective and efficient use of those resources ii1 chapter ii iads integration 1 command relationships combatant commands the unified command pl an establishes combatant commands initial iads planning should begin during the peacetim deliberate planning process at the combatant command baseline iads plans must include component systems manning and training requirements the combatant commander may assign responsibility for iads command control communications computers and intelligence c4i systems planning requirements to subordinate jfcs b joint force commander 1 primary responsibilities of the jfc as they apply to counterair include the following develop and maintain system to unify the employment of subordinate forces in carrying out assigned counterair missions b develop and produce joint operation plans for counterair and airspace control or delegate authority to subordinate commanders c establish appropriate command relations hips for the component commanders d define and assign areas of operation aos for land and naval force commanders establish plans policies programs prior ities and overall requirements for intelligence activities f assign tasks functions and responsibilities to and direct coordination among the subordinate commands to ensure unity of effort in accomplishing joint counterair missions g establish coordinate and disseminate rules of engagement roe to all subordinate commanders 2 jfc staff the jfcs staff assists the jfc in the decisionmaking and execution process c joint force air component commander jfacc the jfacc is given the authority necessary to accomplish the missions and tasks assigned by the jfc the jfacc typically exercises tactical control tacon over air capabilitiesforces made ava ilable for tasking the jfc may also establish supporting and supported relationships between the jfacc nd other components to facilitate operations the jfacc conducts joint air operations in accordance with the jfcs intent and concept of the operation when the jfc designates jfacc the jfacc normally assumes the area air defense commander aadc and airspace control authority aca responsibilities since air defense and airspace control are an integral part of joint air operations as the designated commander for joint air operations the responsibility for plan ning coordinating nd developing airspace control procedures and operating an airspace control system also rests with the jfacc when the situation dictates the jfc may designate separate aadc andor aca in those joint operations where separate commanders are required and designated close coordination is essential for unity of effort prevention of fratricide and deconfliction of joint air operations jp 330 d area air defense commander aadc the jfc normally designates an aadc with the authority to plan coordinate and integrate overall joint force defensive counterair dca operations the jfc will also define the support relationship between the aadc and supporting commanders with the support of service or functional component commanders the aadc develops integrates and distributes jfcapproved joint area air defense plan components will provide representatives as appropriate to the aadcs headquarters to provide specific weapon systems expertise as well as broader mission expertise with the support of service or functional component commanders the ii2 aadc develops integrates and distributes jfcapprove d joint air defense plan critical feature of joint integrated plan is reliable consiste nt and common operational picture ie fused and correlated air ground and maritime picture available in all supporting c2 facilities this plan should include io strategies for counterair the plan should also contain deta iled weapons control and engagement procedures that are integral to all joint counterair operations the plan should be closely integrated with the airspace control plan acp and the aadc establishes weapons control procedures and measures for all dca weapon systems and forces however this does not restrict commanders authority to use all necessary means and take all ppropriate actions to protect their forces from hostile act or demonstrated hostile intent primary responsibilities of the aadc include the following 1 develop integrate and distribute jfc approved joint area air defense plan 2 develop and execute detailed plan to dissemina timely air and missile warning and cueing information to components forces allies coaliti on partners and civil authorities as appropriate 3 develop and implement identifica tion and engagement procedures that are appropriate to the air and missile threats 4 ensure timely and accurate track reporting among participating units to provide consistent common operational picture regional air defense commander radcsector air defense commander sadc the aadc may elect to divide the joa into regions andor sectors depending on the size of the area the magnitude of the operation and the complexity of the forces command and control structure if the joa is divided into regionssectors the jf c will designate commanders for these areas f airspace control authority aca the jf c normally designates an aca who has overall responsibility for establishing and operating the airs pace control system the aca also develops policies and procedures for airspace control that are incorporated into an acp and promulgated throughout the theater key responsibility of the ac is to provide the flexib ility needed within the airspace control system to meet contingency situations that necessitate rapid employment of forces the aca coordinates through the acp the use of airspa ce including integration with the host nation and deconfliction of user requirements the acp is impl emented through the airspace control order aco all forces affecting joint air operations are subject to the aco g component commanders the term component comma nder may refer to service functional or subordinate commanders component commanders w ill advise the jfc on the employment of forces and the direction and control of those forces each component commander plans and executes portion of the total air effort interacts with the other co mponents and as directed by the jfc conducts active defense in accordance with wea pon control procedures and measures established by the aadc subject to the authority of the jfc each com ponent commander within joint force 1 coordinates and prioritizes their operations nd needs with the jfc and other component commanders 2 employs air defense weapon systems in accordan ce with the rules of engagement roe and the area air defense plan aadp 3 coordinates and deconflicts the employment of assigned and attached forces with other subordinate commands coordination for combat airspace control may be facilitated by through collocating key airspace control facilities air fense and fire support coordination agencies 4 provides airspace control in designated areas in accordance with the acp is prepared to assume airspace control in other areas when combat or other factors degrade the acs 5 forwards requests for airspace control measures acms in accordance with the acp ii3 6 develops detailed airspace control

necessary facilities and personnel for airs pace control functions in assigned areas and identifies these facilities and personnel for inclusion in the acp h c4i manager the jtf c4i manager is respons ible to plan oversee and maintain the c4i infrastructure to support operations this is bot h peacetime and contingency requirement and must account for force flow close coordination with other combatant command c4i managers is essential to ensure continuity of communications and information sharing as forces flow between theaters the c4i manager provides the critical voice and data c

requirements for additional planning and mission execution when requ esting augmentees the staffs must specify exact qualifications and experience levels of personnel desired augmentees are integral parts of the staffs to which they are assigned ii4 3 air defense artillery fire control officer adafco the adafco is special lno and acts as single army point of contact between land based air and missile defense amd fire direction centers and the controlling authority eg tactical air operations center taoc or control and reporting center crc the adafco coordinates and monitors the information exchange between the controlling authority and the information coordination center the adafco understands and can explain army weapons capabilities and employment parameters to the controlling authority the adafco executes engagement operations battle manage ment and friendly protect functions for ground based air defense forces 2 iads planning and execution general basic planning for an iads is derive d from jfc objectives guidance and intent the sophistication of the threat the scope of defended asset s the volume of airspace in which air superiority is required and location of iads assets determine specific design requirement for forces planning requires representatives from the various component co mmanders planning staffs to provide expertise on component assets and capabilities iads information nd systems exchange requirements are included in the aadp planning the iads begins with mission anal ysis including critical areas such as roe threat friendly theater air and missile fense resources and the jfcs critical asset list cal further considerations that are vital to the success of an ia ds are aircraft employment c2 integration tanker support airborne c2 warfareisr availability ch ain of command air tasking order ato production cycle and civil air traffic flow based on the outcome of mission analysis position air and missile defense assets to maximize the detection tracking identification decision battle management and engagement of hostile aircraft and missiles b command and control the integration of air nd missile defense systems presents challenge for the aadc and iads planners for example some army air defense artillery ada units will defend assets on the defended asset list dal while others support land component maneuver forces for units tasked against the dal the chain of command proceeds from the aadc however the chain of command for ada units in support of maneuver fo rces stems from the maneuver force commander the army air and missile defense command aam dc commands and employs the echelons above corps eac ada brigades in support of the aadc and coordinates the integration of corps ada brigades that support the land component maneuver for ces one way of facilitating unity of effort for land based missile defense systems is through the adafco located at taoc or crc for army ada and through the marine liaison officer marlo nor mally located at the jaoc for the marine corps air defense units coordination between components is critical and must be cl early articulated in the aadp to include engagement priorities and communi cations channels mobile iads units must receive timely updates to the ato aco and speci instructions spins in addition to dynamic updates to avoid fratricide c the radcsadc when the joa is divided into re gions andor sectors needs awareness of the location and movement of all the mobile iads as sets to avoid fratricide and to promote effective airspace control the adafco must know locations and scheme of maneuver for ada units in order to ensure effective employment of missile defense sy stems by the radcsadc navy air defense units adu may be capable of providing dal coverage while simultaneously providing fleet defense if adus are dual tasked any changes in their ability to meet the dal taski ng should be identified to the naval and amphibious liaison element nale through the radcsadc d area air defense plan aadp the jfc estab lishes objectives and guidance for employment in the theater operations plan oplan or cept of operations conops the oplan or conops serves as framework for planning the aadp is based on the jfcs operational concept and allocation decisions and establishes air and missile identifica tion id procedures the aadp is developed to effectively integrate the capabilities of all services see appendix c for an example of an aadp in preparing the aadp the aadc will consider the entir range of enemy air threats likely courses of ii5 action and the capabilities and limitations of frie ndly air defense systems the aadc normally develops additional pr oducts during the planning process these include inputs into operational tasking data links optasklink which is the guidance fo r establishing the link architecture and inputs into the tactical operational data tacopdat which is used to establish air defense and antiair warfare responsibilities in tactical area other products re quiring coordination are the ato spins and aco intelligence intelligence includes at minimum the enemy order of battle eob the friendly order of battle fob and intelligence preparation of the battlespace ipb ipb is continuing process employed to reduce uncertainties concerning the emy environment and terrain the primary intelligence organization providing support to the joint force is the supported combatant commands joint intelligence center jic the jic integr ates the intelligence support capabilities of all services and combat units within central activity aadc intelligence planners will use the global command and control system gccs resident intelligence support systems and other systems to perform ipb in support of amd planning these systems will host maintain and provide gateway to various intelligencerelated databases eg the eob duri ng ipb the database is analyzed in detail to determine the impact of the enemy environment and terrain on operations in conjunction with the component commanders the operations directorate of joint staff j3 shall compile and distribute the fob f critical asset listdefended asset list the cal is prioritized list of critical assets identified by phase of the operation it is developed by the j5 with component input coordinated through the j3 and approved by the jfc or the combatant commande r the cal is the critical component in the aadcs positioning of active air defense forces th aadc uses the cal eob and ipb in planning the arrangement of forces surveillance and adws and in establishing weapons control status wcs aircraft and missile id procedures the dal is prioritized list of those assets from the cal which available resources will defend it is included in the oplan and aadp the dal is subject to change as operations progress g theater roe considerations roe is critical part of the iads planning and employment process planners should continuously evaluate the impact of roe on accomplishing the iads mission and ensure that the aadp is consistent with current theater roe all forces supporting the air defense mission must comply with current roe supplemental roe is normally requested in order to support the iads mission clearly delineate self defense criteria in the aadp and spins down to the specific platform eg patriot to ensure all friendly forces have thorough understanding of self defense roe flight profiles and routes eg minimum risk routes low level transit routes and standard army flight routes are intricately linked to self defense criteria properly annotate them in the acp and aco to minimize potential for fratricide h surveillance planningexecution considerations 1 detection the types of sensors and their pl acement determine the detection capability of the iads the threat threat axis terrain weather timedistance analysis defended assets desired engagement zone and surveillance requirements will affect sensor placement various predictive sensor coverage planning tools exist eg improvedmanyonmany imom joint defensive planner jdp falcon view etc to assist planners sensor plans mu st also consider number of other factors such as accessibility connectivity force protection mu tual interference and host nation support 2 tracking the surveillance plan will directly contribute to the ability of the iads to consistently and efficiently track airborne object s the three most commonly accepted plans include mutual support preferred method trackreport by exception and track production areas or combination each has advantages depending on the mix of platforms and their degree of interoperability regardless of the surveillance plan adopted surveillance and data link planners must consider the following factors to minimize the effects of gaps in interoperability ii6 track deconfliction the assumption that all c2 participants will always see the same tracks with the same identity nd in the same place is not valid and leads to misunderstanding and mistakes robust voice communication among c2 agencies is critical to resolving track discrepancies platform sensor differences aggravate preexisting proble ms of miscorrelation and dual tracking this can cause the following c2 surveillance tracks not updatingtracking aircraft c2 surveillance tracks that appear to be tracking aircraft but are not c2 surveillance tracks that swap or j ump from one aircraft to another identification friend or foe iff modes and codes swapped among tracks dual tracks dualing is the occurrence of mu ltiple tracks on one target it results in an air picture with more tracks than actual aircraft this occurs frequently within the iads failure of some surveillance systems to correlate contacts with preci participant location identifier ppli tracks can also cause dual tracking b correlation problems correlation problems in clude varying size of correlation windows auto correlation system differences or lack thereof radarmeasured altitude diff erences between systems iff conflicts by systems sensor registrationgridlock problems and lack of familiarization of other service system capabilities and operations track corre lation problems can create id conflicts which are dangerous and can result in loss of situational awar eness all combat systems introduce certain amount of ambiguity into the link and though tdl message standards are common to all services the implementation of those standards is inconsistent and selective combat system software baselines and id doctrine can also introduce uncerta inty into shared data it is incumbent on the combat system and tdl operator to ensure tracks are corr ectly identified every opportunity within tactical timelines should be taken to resolve all track and id ambiguities prior to engagement by the firing unit details of tracking shortfalls are contained in joint combat identifi cation evaluation team jciet evaluation reports see the jciet website at httpsjcieteglinafmil i combat identification cid cid is the process of attaining an accurate characterization of detected objects in the battlespace to the extent that high confidence timely application of tactical military options and weapons resources can occur depending on the situation and the operational decisions that must be made this characterization may be limited to friend enemy or neutral other situations may require other characterizati ons including but not limited to class tbm cm and uav type nationality and mission configuration cid characterizations when applied with the combatant commanders roe enable engagement deci sions and the subsequent use or prohibition of use of lethal and nonlethal weaponry to accomp lish military objectives cid is used for force posturing command and control situation awareness and shootnoshoot employment decisions see the cid capstone requirements document the use of positive id measures visual observation andor electronic id systems is the preferred method of operation in the absence of positive id procedural id which employs previously established and promulgate d airspace control measures is used generally some combination of positive and procedural id will be used however the risk of fratricide may make the positive id of hostile requirement for meeting th defined cid threshold for attaining an accurate characterization in theater roe technological cha llenges also make this currently the biggest limiting factor in the kill chain within tactical time lines all attempts to acquire positive cid should be exhausted before engagi ng suspected targets 1 cid matrix development versus tdl track idclassification implementation track idclassification shared over tdl may not pport the cid process planners must consider participating force tdl system implementation of track idclassification in deciding how to portray particular track in c2 systems the jico cell planners will provide list of tdlsupported track idclassification to the aadc in support of developing the cid plan ii7 the cid matrix must take into consideration the limitations inherent in the employed systems that will implement the cid procedures once the track symbology set is determined the use of voice prowords for these symbols must be aligned pay particular attention to the bandit codeword versus the systems hostile track symbol see appendix b for more information b build the cid matrix to the lowest comm on denominator ie what everyone can classifytransmitreceiveforward in order to support the shooter or the risk of fratricide exists c figure ii1 provides notional cid matrix for tracks figure ii1 sample combat identification matrix 2 id criteria id criteria are used to

automation does not replace the judgment of operators in tactical situation details of id considerations are contained in jciet evaluation reports see the jciet website at httpsjcieteglinafmil j decide battle management the aadc has cer tain systems and authorities to control the battle these include air defense warning conditions weapons control status id authority commit authority and engagement authority the jfc may divide the operational area into air defense regions and air defense sectors as appropriate each region and sector will have respective radcs and sadcs for example the sadc may be subordinate to radc who in turn is subordinate to the aadc the aadc may decentralize the battle by delegating some or all aadc authorities to the radcsadcs the following are two tools used in air defense battle management which ar issued concurrently 1 air defense warning condition adwc the adwc is degree of air raid probability based on the threat assessment the aadc establishes the baseline adw for the joint force which may be different for an air breathing threat and missile threat subordinate air defense commanders may issue higher but not lower adw for their region or sector adws are disseminated though c2 channels to all air and missile defense elements and fire units adwc white an attack by hostile aircraft or missile is improbable b adwc yellow an attack by hostile aircraft or missile is probable c adwc red an attack by hostile aircraft or missile is imminent or in progress 2 weapons control status wcs includes free ght holdsafe they describe the relative degree of control of air defense fires the aadc est ablishes the wcs for the joint force which may be different for an air breathing threat and missile th reat this authority originates with the aadc and can be delegated to any subordinate commander di fferent weapons control statuses may be applied simultaneously to different weapons sy stems andor volumes of airspace weapons holdsafe fire only in self defense or in response to formal order b weapons tight fire only on targets positiv ely identified as hostile in accordance with current roe c weapons free fire at targets not identifie d as friendly in accordance with current roe 3 id authority the aadc will establish the id policy and will promulgate it via the spins andor an optasklink supplement execution of th id policy is normally delegated to the tactical level however take care that the tactical commander is capable of performing the id function in real time units can reliably share three ids across the iads friend hostile and unknown units can also share neutral id however there are inconsistencies in how neutral is interpreted and displayed by some systems see appendix b proper and consistent ex ecution of the id policy is extremely important in order to minimize fratricide note that the tdl hostile id and symbol does not necessarily constitute authority to engage therefore as previously stat ed potential tdl ambiguities should be resolved within tactical timelines before allowing weapons employment to avoid fratricide proper application of roe in effect must be taken in conjunction with id and wcs free tight or holdsafe to constitute authority to engage 4 commit authority commit authority describes the air defense control echelon that may dedicate an asset to prepare to enga ge an entity eg position dca fight er to intercept or direct an ada unit to track and target commit authority does not imply engagement authority further permission is ii10 required to engage an entity that has been co mmitted upon unless the unit committing the resource also holds engagement authority commit and engagement authorities are typically split during the transition phase of major campaign or during containment nd show of force operations in order to avoid accidental escalation of conflict 5 engagement authority the jfc is vested with authority to prosecute engagements within the theaterjoa consistent with roe currently in effect for air defense engagements within the iads the authority is normally delegated to the aadc who ma further delegate the engagement authority to tactical levels keep the degree of delegation consistent with the roe the dal and the inherent right of selfdefense k engagement early warning of ho stile air and missile threats is vital for layered defense air defense assets are layered to provide point and area defense although defensive operations are reactive in nature conduct them as far from the friendly for ces or operational area as feasible to counter enemy air and missile threats the engagement process must continue throughout the approach to entry into and departure from the friendly operational area weapons system placement is closely tied to the dal combination of fighter engagement zones fez missile engagement zones mez and joint engagement zone jez will be established to maxi mize engagement efficiency among all air defense platforms integrated operations in jez require robust and reliable communications see jp 352 doctrine for joint airspace control in the combat zone and fm 3522mcrp 3 25fnttp 3 562afttpi 3217 multiservice tactics techniques and procedures for the theater airground system tags for more information on engagement zones figure ii2 shows graphical representation of engagement zones figure ii2 engagement zones l tactical warning tactical warning is the act of disseminating warning information of threatening or hostile act to personnel within the area of risk base this warning on an evaluation of information from all available sources though the aadc has overall responsibility for providing jez ii11 tactical warning the responsibilit for providing warning to assigned forces lies with all commanders all personnel must respond to tactical warni ng information iaw their assigned responsibilities m planning applications air defense planning t ools include joint defensive planner jdp command control battle management and commun ications system c2bmc theater battle management core system tbmcs area air defense command system aadcs air and missile defense workstation system amdws gccs and the patriot tactical planner 3 communications architecture effective employment of the iads relies on effective voice network and data communications iads communications requirements are subset of the overall jtf communications requirements and will compete with other mission areas for limited bandw idth and frequency allo cations use simplicity and redundancy to ensure the capacity for dynamic ba ndwidth management and graceful degradation due to differing communications equipment media capability and cryptographic capabilities at the units that constitute the iads there are significant challe nges to interoperability and integration followon forces flowing into theater must understand the existin g jtf communications architecture to ensure they bring the correct capabilities to integrate into the numer ous iads voice and data nets normally the jfc operational order opord annex k and the aadp annex k lay the foundation for communications architecture 4 conclusion an iads is not formal system in itself but the sum of component air defense systems for each of these systems to operate within an integrated whole it is imperative that everyone working within the system understand the various components capabilities limitations and how to best utilize them within the iads coordinated planning between the aadc and component commanders planning staffs is required while planning is important for establishing an efficient defense architecture it is critical that all weapons system operators be thoroughly familiar with aircraft and missile flight profiles and characteristics and ongoing friendly air operations through the ato aco and spins to develop the situational awareness that will avoid fratricide chap ters iiivi provide an overview of

weapon systems will detect the threat while in the active radar surveillance m ode when in the passive mode they may be cued by external systems in the case of maneuver air defense weapon systems the threat is normally detected visually or is cued by surveillance radar or passed from tamd unit 2 acquisition ada systems must obtain data defining the position of the enemy tbm or aircraft the data must be sufficiently accurate to provide targeting information to the weapon platforms early detection of tbms is critical to classification and engagement by tamd systems enemy air elements are acquired to determine the threat to defended assets 3 classification and id for tbmd ada units use classification in lieu of id this enables ada units to classify targets as airtosurface missile asm

level the enemy air and missile threat the six functions of marine aviation are aaw assault support offensive air support air reconnaissance electronic warfare and control of aircraft and missiles this chapter will focus on how the marine corps conducts active air defense nd the relevant aspects of control of aircraft and missiles air defense combines active and passive asures to protect our forces against attack from enemy aircraft and missiles 2 mission marine airground task force magtf air defe nse assets are employed based on the commanders guidance for supporting the ground scheme of maneuver the planning and employment will also be based on an intelligence estimate of th threat and magtf defended assets 3 organization the marine corps employs its forces as task organized magtf the three basic magtfs for deployment largest to smallest are the marine expeditionary force mef marine expeditionary brigade meb and marine expeditionary unit meu the composition and size of the magtf may vary but the organizational structure will always be single command element ground combat element an aviation combat element ace and combat service support element b the magtf commander normally delegates the au thority for air operations to the ace commander the ace commander exercises authority through the marine air command and control system maccs the maccs provides the ace commander with the means for effective command coordination and control of all magtf air opera tions and the effective functioning of the magtf iads c with all magtf operations the maccs task organizes its resources based on mission analysis and various planning factors although the maccs is comprised of personnel and agencies from all three elements of the magtf the ace pe rforms the

magtf aviation and aviati on support operations note the ai rspace control functions that it performs are analogous to the navy tactical air control center and the air force air and space operations center 2 the tacc consists of three mutually suppor ting crossfunctional operational sections supported by centralized intelligence organization the tacc includes the following operational sections current operations executes the daily ato and assesses its effectiveness and reports this to future operations current operations is or ganized by sections divided into cells to promote the rapid distribution of relevant information necessary to make sound decisions the cells within current operations which are most relevant for air defense include airspace control interface coordinationtrack data and air defense the airspace control cell is responsible for all airspace issues it will monitor changes to the acpacospins informing the rest of current operations of those changes as they occur additionally the airspace control cell will coordinate with external agencies for any immediatecurrent ato changes to the airspace that the ace requires the interface coordinationtrack data cell is responsible for ensuring an accurate situational display data link c onnectivity and track data coordi nation for the maccs the interface coordinationtrack data cell includes the interface coordination officer ico who may be assigned the rico or sico function the air defense cell is responsible for c oordinating air defense within the magtf ao this cell will monitor supervise and direct the control of aircraft and missiles for air defense by iv3 subordinate maccs agencies it will also coordinate air defense operations within the maccs and with external agencies b future operations

surface to include overland subsurface and in the air the goal is battlespace dominance in ll three dimensions this includes providing an air defense umbrella for friendly assets while si multaneously conducting ffensive operations 3 organization the unique nature of maritime operations shapes the organization of navy assets and affects how these forces fit into the overall military structure vast distances wide dispersion of forces with associated c2 challenges and the complexities of conducting warfare in threedimensional battlespace characterize maritime operations chain of command the operational chain of command flows from the unified or specified commander through the naval component commander to the numbered fleet commanders subordinate to the numbered fleet commander commands are organized by operational tasks task force task group and task unit to conduct the naval warfare tasks mentioned bove these commands are the basic operating units of naval warfare b officer in

doctrine is predicated on the concept that individual warfare commanders are trained and equipped to recognize and effectively counter rapidly developing threats especially in multithreat environment with respect to their assigned warfare task wide range of options are available to the cwc in delegating command authority to the subor dinate warfare commanders these options range from full delegation of authority to delegation at all depending on the threat and tactical situation regardless of the authority delegated the cwc always retains the option of control by negation control by negation is c2 philosophy in which subordinate commander has the freedom of action to direct and execute those operations necessary to accomplish assi gned and implied missions unless overridden by the superior commander command considerations it is important to note that individual combatants typically conduct simultaneous multiwarfare missions for instance cruiser while assigned duties as adc may also be actively engaged in tomahawk landattack missile tlam strike operations while simultaneously conducting antisubmarine warfare operati ons because of the c2 complex ities created as result

defense planning afloat cvcvn lhalhd nd amphibious command ship lcc have significant planning capabilities to include very robust intelligence and cryptographic collection capabilities the cvcvn and lhalhd are equipped with tbmcs and host of other tools for collaborative planning these platforms provide liaison officers to the aadc and can host lnos from other services b the cvcvn and lcc have capability to perfo rm air command and control functions as the complexity and scale of the operation expands these func tions will most likely be transferred to more robust command organization such as an aoc however the cvcvn cgs and ddgs can continue to provide considerable support as radcsadc and as an interface control officer ricosico c planning considerations v6 1 cvw planning is typically accomplished on 72hour timeline that coincides with the ato production cycle aircraft operations are usually conducted in cyclic ma nner with launches and recoveries typically on 115 75minute or 130 90 minute schedule typical 130 cycle consists of 1520 sorties exclusive of those aircraft whose endurance allows them to fly double cycles shorter cycles limit the number of aircraft that can be launche d and recovered longer cycles allow for larger launches but increase requirements for airborne tanking the principal constraint in sustained carrier flight operations is flight deck personnel manning units can sustain 1416 hour fly days with careful management with single cvcvn 24hour carrier operations are not possible such operations will require at least two cvcvns 2 fighter aircraft remaining airborne for more th an single cycle require inflight refueling units can accomplish this either organically using limited air wing assets such as the s3b or fa18 ef or inorganically utilizing drogueconfigured jointcoalition tanker assets ie kc10kc130kc 135vc10 d planning considerations for surface ship stati oning adu platforms may be used in area point or selfdefense roles aegis

chapter vi air force air defense 1 introduction the air force theater air control system tacs is constructed on the tenet of centralized control and decentralized execution it is responsible for offensive defensive and support of air and space operations in the theater and is configured to m eet the needs of the specific theater of operation 2 mission air defense is significant part of the greater air force mission in theater the mission of theater air defense is to gain and maintain air superiority over designated friendly territory and protect designated friendly assets air superiority allows offensive ai r land and seabased operations to proceed without prohibitive interference by the enemy air and missile systems elements of air defense include planning and execution of surveillance iden tification command and control weapons employment and integration with joint and combined air defense capabilities 3 organization the usaf organization for planning and executing ai r defense is fairly simple although embedded within the organization responsible for all air and space operations the aoc serves as the senior element of the tacs and translates guidance and direc tives into actionable tasking the atoaco etc subordinate elements such as the crc the e3 and th air defense sectors for air defense within the conus alaska and hawaii function as the tacs c2 execution nodes 4 command and control the commander air force forces comaffor exer cises centralized control through the aoc and decentralized execution through the subordinate elements of the tacs when the commander air force forces comaffor is designated jfacc the aoc becomes the core of the jaoc the jfacc normally assumes responsibility for airspace control and air defense unless separate aca and aadc are designated air force air and space operations center the aoc is led by an aoc director and has five divisions with subordinate core teams and numer ous specialty and support t eams and liaison elements figure vi1 depicts the approved jaoc organization that is used when the comaffor is designated jfacc 1 the aoc director is focused on planning coordinating allocating tasking and monitoring execution and sustaining and assessing air power operations in the aorjoa based on commanders guidance it is the directors responsibility to sure the aoc functions necessary to complete air and space planning and execution are conducted in timely and efficient manner 2 defensive specialists in the strategy and plans divisions in coordination with the isr division and liaison elements and other components produce the planning and guidance documents related to air defense and provide input to airspace control communications sensor and command and control architectures which are common to defensive and offensive operations 3 the defensive team within the combat opera tions division cod monitors and directs the execution of the defensive portions of the ato and performs air and missile defense duties including alerts and warnings administration iaw guidance vi2 4 the comaffor may designate alternate command elements stationed at ground facilities or onboard airborne platforms to assume part or all of cod duties figure vi1 jaoc organization b control and reporting center the crc is c2 asset that supports the comaffor requirement for tactical level command and control commonly referred to as air battle management it is the air forces most forward link in the joint battle management command and control family of c2 systems it is capable of effective integration vertically with operational level c2 systems and horizontally with other tactical c2 elements see fi gure vi2 the crc is charged with decentralized execution of the air defense and airspace control func tions within its operational area the crc may be employed alone or in combination with other elemen ts of the tacs c2 architecture the crc may be assigned responsibility as sector air defense commander sadc and is normally designated sector icu the crc is capable of conducting airspace control weapons control surveillance and aircraft identification when directed by the jaoc the crc may be used as the conduit with service components and multinational forces to exchange airs pace management and air defense data from c2 vi3 systems via tactical data links through the u of tdls the crc is capable of

those changes with the appropriate components and control agencies b the comaffor may delegate c2 authority to ground or airborne c2 platform mission commanders it is essential however to notify the cod section of all redirected missions 8 integration missile defense systems present an integration challenge for the aoc for example some army ada units may be tasked to defend entities on the dal while others are tasked to support land component maneuver forces for units tasked agai nst the dal the chain of command proceeds from the comaffor through the sado in the aoc to the crc or awacs however the chain of command for ada units in support of maneuver forces stems from the maneuver force commander b the best way of achieving unity of effort for nd based missile defense systems is through the adafco see chapter ii for description the s ado coordinates with maneuver units through the bcd aamdc representative if present see figure vi3 because coordination between components is critical clearly articulate it in the aadp to include engagement priorities and communications channels the sado needs awareness of the cation and movement of the maneuver ada units to avoid fratricide and to promote effective airspace control the aadc must establish procedures for routing fixedwing aircraft around active air defense sites in addition the aadp spins and aco must specify procedures for operating near and around active air defense sites note the coordination conduit for marine corps ada units is the marine liaison officer marlo c the adafco needs awareness of the

training levels and air defe nse order of battle ob when required to operate as part of mnf understa nding types and numbers of participating nations air defense systems and capabilities is important operations may or may not include integration with host nation air defense systems atc and c2 architecture b interoperability always consider integrating us and foreign nation weapon systems in order to optimize defense design several countries own nd operate us designed weapons systems such as patriot and hawk air defense systems however just as us systems must upgrade so must foreign government systems based on foreign military sales case agreements us forces going into multinational theater may find incompatibilities with like systems therefore planning and conducting interoperability training with foreign governments becomes even more critical c disclosure of critical air defense information when operating as part of mnf us forces rely on classified sophisticated intelligence and opera tions databases although sharing this information is critical to successful conduct of the mission much of this information is not usually releasable to foreign governments for air defense this critical information includes accessibilit to the different data links the us forces commander must carefully co nsider national disclosure policy guidance along with intent and concept of the operation when termining whether to request release of additional source information to specific countries in some instances during the execution of combat operations the commander may have to make determination to release previously nondisclosed information if release of the information serves to protect the interests or safety of us forces d cid the mark xii iffsif system is used by us forces modes 14 when conducting multinational operations the mnf will usually only be equipped with some of these modes us forces must work closely with the mnf to establish co mbination of procedural and

achievable a2 3 air defense considerations ground roe ground roe when operating in foreign country can differ significantly if the hn is willing or insists on providing some type of ground security or force protection when this is the case typical arrangement is for the hn to provide overall base or facility security and for us forces to provide local or perimeter security for each of their units in any case language barriers can prove to be hindrance establish standard operating procedures s ops that closely coordinate security and force protection measures b air roe usually us forces will provide air fense protection for their defended assets using separate dal this is the preferred method of pr oviding air defense as it reduces conflicts that arise from differences in roe among multinational partners in cases where us forces and hn forces are providing mutual protection to defended asset it must be clear who is controlling engagements where differences in roe for either abt or tbm exists it is important to establish detailed procedural control measures for friendly airspace users to reduce the possib ility of fratricide one technique is to prepare an sop of mutually
