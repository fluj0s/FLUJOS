the house on july 27 and the senate on september 1 the conference recommended 8450b the conference committee added 666m to the presidents request even with the additional funds the total for fy1999 is

appropriations money for fy1999 in the omnibus consolidation bill hr 4328 hrept 105825 in october 1998 due to monsoons in korea and hurricanes georges bonnie military construction projects secured an additional 209 million in funding background content of military construction appropriations and defense authorization bills the department of defense manages the worlds largest dedicated infrastructure covering over 40000 square miles of land and physical plant worth over 500 billion the annual military construction appropriations bill provides most of the funding to maintain and upgrade this infrastructure the bill funds construction projects and real property maintenance of the active army navy marine corps air force and their reserve components defensewide construction us contributions to the nato security investment program formerly called the nato infrastructure program and military family housing operations and construction the bill also provides funding for the base realignment and closure brac account which finances most base realignment and closure costs including construction of new facilities for transferred personnel and functions and environmental cleanup at closing sites the military construction appropriations bill is one of several annual pieces of legislation that provide funding for national defense other major legislation includes 1 the defense appropriations bill that provides funds for all military activities of the department of defense except for military construction 2 the national defense crs2 authorization bill that authorizes appropriations for national defense1 and 3 the energy and water development appropriations bill that provides funding for atomic energy defense activities of the department of energy three other appropriations vahudindependent agencies commercejusticestate and transportation also include small amounts for national defense in addition the energy and water development appropriations bill provides funds for civil projects carried out by the us army corps of engineers the annual defense authorization bill authorizes all the activities in the defense appropriations measures described above therefore major debates over defense policy and funding issues including military construction may also occur in action on the authorization bill since issues in the defense authorization and appropriations are so interwoven this report highlights salient parts of the authorization bill along with the military construction appropriations process military construction appropriations are the major but not the sole source of funds for facility investments by the military services and defense agencies the defense appropriations bill provides some funds for real property maintenance in operation and maintenance accounts in addition funds for construction and maintenance of morale welfare and recreation mwr facilities are partially provided through proceeds from commissaries recreation user fees and other income most funds appropriated by congress each year must be obligated in that fiscal year military construction appropriations are an exception2 these funds are generally made available for obligation for five fiscal years consideration of the military construction budget starts when the presidents budget is delivered to the congress each year for fy1999 the president requested 78 billion for military construction 12 less than the 89 billion appropriated for fy1998 1 see appropriations for fy1999 defense by stephen daggett crs report 98205 for details on the defense authorization and appropriation process 2 department of defense accounts vary in how long the funds are available for obligation military personnel and operations maintenance accounts are available for one year research and development funds are available for two years procurement funds with the exception of shipbuilding are available for three years crs3 status table 1 shows the key

conference agreement the military construction appropriations bill became public law 105237 on september 20 1998 the conference report hrept 105 647 for hr 4059 was passed by the house by vote of 417 1 on july 27 and the senate on september 1 by vote of 873 the conference recommended 8450b the conference committee added 666m to the presidents request even with the additional funds the fy1999 total is 759m less than what was enacted for fy1998 this is an additional 216m to the house bill and reduction of 31m from the senate bill the conference agreement included full funding of the requested chemical demilitarization program however the conference included general reduction of 505m of unobligated prior year funds against the entire program because of delays in equipment and environmental construction permits the dod family housing improvement fund was reduced to 2m from 242m in the house bill and 7m in the senate bill the large reduction in the house bill reflects full funding of construction projects in traditional family housing accounts rather than the family housing improvement fund transfer authority to the fund is provided for qualified projects from regular family housing accounts the conference committee noted that 90 of resources expended for the house revitalization support office hrso for fy199698 was for consultant support therefore the conferees reduced support for family housing improvement fund to 2m based on available balances and excessive allocation for consultative services crs4 the conferees also noted the delay in execution of family housing projects for possible privatization efforts the conference expects from dod revised scaled back reasonable plan for the privatization effort by october 1 1998 and an integrated family housing strategy by december 1 1998 the homeowners assistance fund had funds appropriated by the conference instead the conference adopted section 127 which allows the transfer of funds from the base realignment and closure account into the homeowners assistance fund house and senate actions based on the interim 302 b allocations see budget agreement section below the military construction appropriations subcommittees finished their work the senate appropriations committee sac approved their version of the military construction bill s 2160 with report srept 105213 on june 11 sac approved 8484 billion the house appropriations committee finished their bill hr 4059 with report hrept 105578 on june 16 hac approved 8235 billion the house passed hr 4059 on june 2 with the hacapproved total the senate passed their bill on june 25 with the sacapproved total of the 82 billion appropriated in the house fy1999 military construction appropriations bill hr 4059 43 is for family housing 37 for general military construction projects and 21 is to meet the obligations of the base realignment and closure brac in the 85 billion appropriated in the senate s 2160 42 is for family housing 37 for general military construction projects and 20 is to meet brac obligations the military construction subcommittees had similar themes in their reports both subcommittees rejected administration proposals for advanced appropriations for army military construction citing the difficulty to project future costs and that the requested advance appropriations projects were not identified in dod justification documents acquisition of either the leased building or additional land for us southern command headquarters relocated from panama to miami florida and devolution of chemical demilitarization construction from office of the secretary of defense to the army because of the importance of this activity to overall national security both committees like their authorization counterparts lamented general underfunding by the dod of military construction especially for decreasing maintenance backlogs and increasing quality of life projects the house appropriations committee decided to put all requested privatization projects from the family housing construction account into the family housing improvement fund increasing the budget request of 7 million to 242 million this allocation will enforce the use of privatization authorities mechanisms for these projects budget agreement usually the budget resolution sets the stage for the appropriations process however the work on this years agreement is not completed crs5 yet the house and senate are still in conference deliberations for the fy1999 budget resolution while they wait for the completed budget agreements the appropriations committees are beginning their work both committees have released tentative 302 b allocations to their subcommittees the senate appropriations committee has allocated 8484 billion in budget authority for military construction which is an additional 700 million an increase of 89 than the presidents request of 78 billion the house appropriations committee gave 8235 billion an increase of 400 million or 5 to the military construction appropriations subcommittee for fy1999 authorization process on may 21 the house approved 82 billion for military construction in its fy 1999 defense authorization bill hr 3616 which is 450 million more than the presidents request the house national security committee reported that 40 183 million of the increase is dedicated to quality of life enhancements the committee highlighted additions to family housing troop housing child development centers and fitness centers for more detailed information on the fy1999 house authorization bill see the press releases and committee reports and bill sections on the house national security home page at httpwwwhousegovnsc on may 7 the senate armed services committee sasc approved 500 million more than the administrations fy1999 budget in s 2057 the sasc designated 164 million of the additional money for unaccompanied personnel quarters child development centers dining facilities education centers and military family housing the remaining 336 million is for highpriority projects submitted by the military services that were not funded in the presidents request the senate passed s 2057 on june 25 it added 200 million of quality of life military construction projects to the sasc bill by amendment the senate also made it harder for dod to close military bases passing the inhofe amendment the amendment makes the dod seek congressional approval for closing bases if 225 jobs are at stake instead of current laws 300 jobs limit also the inhofe amendment contained sense of the senate statement that congress will not consider another round of base closures until the latest round is completed the hnsc and sasc came to some similar decisions about the fy1999 presidents military construction budget request in their respective reports both the hnsc hrept 105532 and the sasc srept 105189 noted the low budget request compared to prior years 15 less than the fy1998 enacted amount both defense authorizing committees rejected the administrations proposal for two more base closure rounds and for acquiring leased building or land in miami florida for us southern command headquarters both committees rejected the administrations proposal to move funding for chemical demilitarization construction from the office of secretary of defense osd to the army because of the national importance of this issue the crs6 committees believe that authority should stay within osd each committee noted delays in dods obligation of money for chemical demilitarization projects often because of construction and environmental permit problems the senate cut 50 million from the program because of the backlog of unobligated funds the senate authorizers noted the trend for the dod to fund military construction projects with prior year savings instead of including full funding for the military construction budget the trend started in the fy1997 and continued through to the fy1999 proposal the sasc denied the use of prior year savings and expects the dod to fully fund military construction requests in future budgets the defense authorization conference report hrept 105736 passed the house on september 24 and the senate on october 1 the fy1999 authorization bill became pl 105261 on october 17 1998 key policy issues recent history and context the funding pattern for military construction budgets in recent years the congress has added significant amounts to annual administrations military construction budget requests congress added 479 million in fy1996 850 million in fy1997 and 800 million in fy1998 to the military construction accounts three themes explain the pattern of reoccurring congressional additions first some members of the military construction subcommittees believe that military construction has been chronically underfunded military construction proponents including facility advocates in the military services argue that military facilities have been systematically underfunded for many years even some say in the midst of the defense buildup of the 1980s in arguing that military construction has been chronically underfunded dod facility managers state that they have not met their goal of budgeting 3 of the plant replacement value of dod facilities for annual construction and maintenance called real property maintenance at the pentagon although this 3 goal is below the average for public facilities nationwide actual dod funding has typically run at 1 to 2 of plant replacement value for example the air force testified on march 11 1998 to the house national security subcommittee for military installations and facilities that the air force could manage to budget only 1 for real property maintenance thus facility proponents welcome congressional additions3 second other members of congress as senator bond commented during the floor debate on fy1996 military construction appropriations believe that the pentagon counts on congress to add money to guard and reserve programs in 3 for discussion of this and related issues see crs report 91669 military construction current controversies and longterm issues by martin cohen and stephen daggett crs7 recent years congress has added as much as 4018 million fy1995 for national guard and reserve construction projects see table 5 third often congress has different priorities from the administration congressional military construction subcommittees authorization as well as appropriations subcommittees have often taken issue with administration military construction priorities in the 1990s for example the committees frequently reduced amounts requested for construction overseas on the grounds that troop levels abroad should be reduced and that allied burdensharing contributions should increase and reallocated the funds to domestic projects in addition congressional committees have added unrequested funds for quality of life improvements such as day care centers and barracks renovation the congressional defense committees have argued that the military services have tended to neglect these areas in favor of warfighting investments funding and longterm planning for military construction inadequate along with concern about the level of funding members of congress have also complained that poor pentagon planning make it difficult for the congress to insure that added military construction projects meet pressing priorities the military construction budget request is created within the department of defenses planning programming and budgeting system ppbs4 the ppbs process is used to prepare dods internal longterm financial plan the longterm plan extends over sixyear period and is known as the future years defense plan fydp in the 1990s congressional defense committees repeatedly criticized the pentagons longterm planning for military construction in the fy1998 hearings the chairman of the house subcommittee on military construction representative ron packard chastised the department of defense for repeatedly failing to submit honest budgets reflecting real service priorities he complained that the military construction request traditionally leaves out necessary projects especially for the national guard and reserve which the services expect congress to add mr packard wanted the subcommittee to get out of the business of adding money for projects that the administration had not requested but yet apparently needs he also wanted dod and the services to use the future years defense plan fydp rigorously to set priorities for their construction projects and to integrate guard and reserve needs in testimony on the fy1998 request to the military construction subcommittee of the house appropriations committee thendod comptroller john hamre admitted that dod needs to undertake good detailed planning for the military construction budget and has not done this in the past hamre also conceded that the dod has not evaluated the accuracy of the military construction fydps and that he saw need for that assessment its report on the fy1998 military construction appropriations bill hrept 105150 the house appropriations committee called for dod to prepare future 4 for discussion of the formulation of the defense budget proposal by the dod see crs report 93317 defense budget primer by keith berner and stephen daggett crs8 years defense plan fydp for military construction at the project level of detail including guard and reserve requirements the fy1999 military construction hearings reviewed service efforts to integrate guard and reserve needs into the budget request the services especially the army testified that they have produced integrated military construction plans with guard and reserve input alma moore principal deputy secretary of the army for installations logistics and environment testified at house military construction subcommittee that this years military construction budget was built on the armys one team one fight concept we made conscientious effort to balance our resources among all components the active army the national guard and the army reserve the debate over added projects and the mccain criteria since the congress has added significant amounts to military construction budgets over the last 10 years congressional debate has centered on how to prioritize additional projects in 1994 the senate debate on the military construction appropriations bill heavily focused the amount of congressional additions to the request despite constraints on overall defense spending senator mccain in particular objected to the provision of substantial amounts for projects that the administration had not requested he argued that such projects largely represent pork barrel spending and come at the expense of higher priority defense programs in senate floor consideration of the military construction bill that year the managers accepted mccain amendment that called for criteria to be applied to additional projects his amendment included provision that any added project should be on the military lists of critical yet unbudgeted projects the mccain amendment was not incorporated into the final conference version of the bill however and the conference agreement provided over 900 million for unrequested construction projects the national defense authorization act for fy1995 pl 103337 however incorporated senator mccains criteria as sense of the senate provision providing that the unrequested projects should be 1 essential to the dods national security mission 2 not inconsistent with planned base closures 3 in the services future years defense plans see above 4 executable in the year they are authorized and appropriated and 5 offset by reductions in other defense accounts through advice from the secretary of defense the purpose of these criteria is to help congress rate the relative importance of different projects though sense of the senate provision does not have the force of law the mccain criteria have been cited repeatedly in senate authorization and appropriations debates for fy1996 and fy1997 the criteria were also cited in the house fy1997 debates by members of the porkbusters coalition in practice debates have focused on justifying projects according to the first four criteria while ignoring the offset requirement crs9 in debate on the fy1998 military construction appropriations conference report senator mccain continued to challenge congressional add ons he noted that the congress added 129 projects totaling 800 million the national guard and reserve received 220 million of the additional congressional money senator mccain listed the extra projects in the congressional record in letter to the president and on his web page at the following address httpwwwsenategovmccainmilconftxt since the 104th congress the house military construction authorizing and appropriations committees have used criteria in collaboration with the pentagon to add projects to the military construction budget each added project needs to pass criteria like the mccain criteria is the project essential to the dod mission consistent with brac plans in the future years defense plan and executable in the coming fiscal year if the project can meet those criteria the military construction authorizing and appropriations committees may add the project the fy1998 line item veto debate over whether congressionally added projects are pork or important to the dod mission contributed to the presidents first use of his line item veto authority5 in october 1997 the line item veto was used on the military construction appropriations law pl 10545 to eliminate 38 projects in 24 states totaling 287 million according to the line item veto law6 the 287 million in savings would go directly to deficit reduction and not back to the department of defense the white house cited three criteria in explaining why the president vetoed these projects these criteria are similar to the mccain criteria and the house committees criteria for adding projects 1 the projects were not in the department of defenses future years defense plan fydp 2 design work for the projects was not completed and therefore the project could not be executed in the coming fiscal year 3 the projects would provide substantial contribution to improving the quality of life of us troops according to the clinton administration the vetoed projects needed to meet all three criteria to be put on the veto list the administrations criteria however did not square with the data on particular projects that the military officers provided in testimony to the senate appropriations committee in october 1997 first the data showed that 33 of the 38 projects were in the pentagons fydp second some of the projects did have design work in progress and so it appeared that the information that the president received on design work was inaccurate many of the projects appeared to be executable in fy1998 finally the committee questioned the white houses judgement of the quality of life merit of the 38 projects 5 see the line item veto act procedural issues by louis fisher and virginia mcmurtry crs report 96973 for details on the line item veto process 6 in the 1998 the supreme court found the line item veto law to be an unconstitutional cession of congressional powers to the executive branch crs10 it appeared that most of the vetoed 38 projects did not meet two out of three administration criteria for inclusion on the veto list based on this assessment the house and senate passed disapproval bill hr 2631 in october 1997 to overturn the veto7 the president vetoed the disapproval bill in november 1997 despite the white houses admission that erroneous data were used to cancel some projects the office of management and budget omb refused to confirm which projects or how many were vetoed by mistake the canceled projects were restored by veto override of hr 2631 in february 1998 by the house and senate the veto override restored funding for the 38 canceled projects the debate on the military construction line item veto highlights the issues that arise with adding projects to the military construction budget which projects are urgent according to which criteria and if projects are important why doesnt the administration request them prospects for congressional additions to the fy1999 military construction budget the budget enforcement act of 1997 pl 10533 set caps on budget authority and outlays for fy1998fy20028 the presidents fy1999 budget proposal for national defense equals the cap of 2706 billion unless congress revises the budget agreement there would appear to be room for congress to add funding to the defense budget this will be the first time in three years that congress has not been able to add money to the defense budget the congress added budget authority of about 7 billion in fy1996 112 billion in fy1997 and 29 billion in fy1998 to the defense budget with those increases to the defense budget military construction accounts received congressional additions of 479 million in fy1996 850 million in fy1997 and 800 million in fy1998 despite these budget agreement constraints the defense authorizing committees and the military construction appropriators added military construction money to the presidents request the house national security committee added 450 million and the senate armed services committee added 500 million in their deliberations over the fy1999 defense authorization bills the conference for the fy1999 military construction appropriations bill recommended 8450b which is an additional 666m to the presidents request ongoing issues importance of housing to the quality of life for servicemembers quality of life issues are considered to be important to recruitment and retention of servicemembers review of the military construction budget brings up quality of life issues for family housing barracks and child care facilities in congressional debates 7 for more details on line item vetoes in the fy1998 military construction appropriations bill see appropriations for fy1998 military construction by mary t tyszkiewicz crs report 97210 8 for more details see the appropriations process and the congressional budget act by james v saturno crs report 97947 crs11 the department of defense has found that about twothirds of military housing both family quarters and barracks are substandard because of size safety or condition9 in 1995 thendefense secretary perry established an external advisory committee and an inhouse executive committee to look at quality of life issues for the men and women in uniform two major housing initiatives for family housing and barracks renewal emanated from perrys quality of life committees first private sector financing and methods for family housing were proposed and implemented in the fy1996 defense authorization act pl 104106 second new barracks standard was set called 1 1 this standard provides each servicemember at sergeant or below an individual room plus shared bathroom with an adjoining room10 congress has been concerned however about the pace of both programs privatization of military family housing to alleviate the family housing problem the congress gave the pentagon new authorities see above to obtain private sector financing and expertise for family housing the pentagon estimates that with these authorities defense dollars can be leveraged to more quickly build three times the amount of housing units financed the traditional way the authorities are guarantees both loan and rental conveyance or lease of existing property and facilities differential lease payments investments both limited partnerships and stockbond ownership and direct loans these new authorities can be used individually or in combination in various projects11 on february 26 1998 john goodman deputy under secretary of defense industrial affairs and installations testified to the military installations and facilities subcommittee of house national security committee about the use of these authorities over the past two years he listed the following accomplishments two navy projects in corpus christi tx and everett wa were awarded producing 589 units these units are already occupied and were primarily privately financed two projects army at ft carson co and air force at lackland afb in tx should be awarded this spring the ft carson project will revitalize 1824 existing units and build 840 new ones the lackland afb project will supply 400 units request for proposal rfp has been released for marine corps logistics base in georgia for 155 units 9 maze rick the new

with up to 29 potential projects under consideration because these are new authorities however startup issues have delayed large scale pursuit of privatization the department of defenses housing revitalization support office hrso is coordinating the implementation of the new authorities for each of the services12 hrso is staffed with 16 fulltime housing and real estate experts from each of the services and the office of secretary of defense along with consultant support it has taken some time for dod to learn how to work in the commercial real estate market the office of management and budget had to determine rules to account for government obligations with each of the authorities and the rules were not devised until june 1997 also the pentagon needed to translate loan and loan guarantee concepts into actual documents that the private financial community would trust for investment grade financing representative joel hefley chairman of the military installations and facilities subcommittee of the house national security committee pointed out in march 10 1998 hearing that the military housing privatizations authorities expire on september 30 2000 unless extended by congress or made permanent law mr hefley stated that my inclination at this time would be to extend the authorities once the fiveyear period expires but in order to justify an extension congress will have to see significantly better execution the senate is interested in how the use of housing privatization initiatives could affect future base realignment and closure brac rounds this concern came up in march 3 1998 senate appropriations subcommittee on military construction hearing on the fy1999 military construction budget senator stevens expressed concern that many of the housing privatization initiatives contain various mechanisms that shift financial risk and liability to the government especially with respect to brac actions senator stevens commented that housing projects with these guarantees could be an advantage to base in future brac rounds and this is something the committee should monitor the fy1998 senate appropriations committee report on military construction continued similar themes barracks improvements to improve the conditions of barracks the department of defense is enforcing new standards according to dod official john goodmans february 26 1998 testimony to the house national security committee on the fy1999 military construction budget the pentagon directed that gang latrine barracks be eliminated by fy2008 the air force will meet that goal in fy1999 with the marine corps following in fy2005 and army navy in fy2008 implementation of the 1 1 standard see above for barracks housing will not be completed until well into the next century john goodman testified that the standard will be met in fy2020 by the army in fy2013 by the navy and in fy2019 12 each service has their own program name for housing privatization army capital venture initiative cvi navy publicprivate venture ppv and air force housing privatization program crs13 by the air force the marine corps plans to build to an interim 20 two marines in one room sharing bath standard by fy2035 these timetables were noted in the fy1998 house appropriations committee report hrept 105150 which stated that it will take 143 billion and 20 years to reach the 1 1 standard base realignment and closure brac concerns legislation for more brac rounds would start in the authorizing defense committees of the house and senate also if passed budget authority for future brac rounds would reside in military construction appropriations accounts however this years administration request for two more brac rounds in fy2001 and fy2005 has been received by the congress with skepticism13 during the fy1998 review of the defense budget both the house and senate rejected legislation to approve more military base closures instead the congress passed section 2824 of the fy1998 national defense authorization act pl 10556 which required the pentagon to report the costs and savings from previously approved domestic military base closures the required report entitled the report of the department of defense on base realignment and closure was released by the pentagon in april 1998 the report makes the case that the dod has 23 excess base capacity two new brac rounds will save about 3 billion per year after fully implemented actual brac costs reflect budget estimates the brac process overstates costs for environmental restoration and previous brac rounds in 1988 1991 1993 and 1995 are saving billions14 both defense authorizing committees rejected the administrations proposal for two more base closure rounds in may 1998 environmental issues the senate continues to raise concerns about the cost of environmental cleanup and its effects on military functions and readiness the chairman of the senate appropriations subcommittee on military construction senator burns mentioned environmental issues during his subcommittee hearing on march 3 1998 senator burns noted that 45 of the armys fy1999 brac funding 489m is for studies cleanup and restoration of brac facilities and that these costs are growing concern to him senator burns said that the subcommittee will look at where the cleanup money is going how it is being spent and to what degree military construction facilities are cleaned when they are turned over to the private sector 13 for recent history on congressional brac debates see crs report 97674 military base closures time for another round by david lockwood 14 department of defense the report of the department of defense on base realignment and closure april 1997 pp iiivi the report also includes appendices with history of prior rounds and the dod legislative proposal for new brac authorities also see the defenselink web site for the report and related sites at the following address httpwwwdefenselinkmilother_infobrachtml crs14 use of advanced procurement for army military construction this year the congress will consider the armys proposal to use advanced procurement procedures for military construction this will be an exception to current practices for defense funding when congress appropriates money for defense programs it generally pays all the costs up front in one fiscal year this practice is known as full funding it was mandated by congress in the 1950s to give full visibility to the cost of weapons procured therefore all the money estimated at the time to complete the entire project such as production of 21 trident missiles overhaul of an aircraft carrier or construction of an ammunition depot is approved as single package by the congress often the procurement of these weapons systems can span many years as an exception to this practice congress sometimes provides funding for advance procurement of longleadtime weapons components such as nuclear power plants for navy warships15 the fy1999 army military construction request proposes to use advanced procurement for some of its projects acting assistant secretary of the army installations logistics and environment alma moore stated at the house national security committee hearing on february 26 1998 that with advance appropriations the contract will not define the work to be performed by the contractor but only limit the work by the amount appropriated in given year advance appropriations of 555050000 are requested for the us disciplinary barracks 13000000 the roi namur power plant 36000000 the fort hood railhead facility 15000000 the cadet physical development center 73000000 and four chemical demilitarization projects umatilla pine bluff aberdeen and newport at 418050000 to get these large military construction projects started the office of management and budget allowed the army to propose advanced procurement funding to the congress by approving advanced procurement the congress limits its discretion on future military construction budgets since it is committing future funding the army has been the executive agent of the department of defense chemical demilitarization chem demil the pentagon decided in response to its defense reform initiative that the army now has total responsibility for chemical demilitarization therefore total of 125 million was transferred from the dod 15 according to the department of defense advance procurement is authority provided in an appropriations act to obligate and disburse during fiscal year before that in which the related end item is procured the funds are added to the budget authority for the fiscal year and deducted from the budget authority of the succeeding year used in major acquisition programs for advance procurement of components whose longleadtime requires purchase early in order to reduce the overall procurement leadtime of the major end item advance procurement of long lead components is an exception to the dod full funding policy financial management regulation volume 2a p 12 crs15 military construction budget to the fy1999 army military construction budget for six chem demil military construction projects the house national security committee and the senate armed services committee rejected the transfer of chem demil from the office of secretary of defense osd to the army in their fy1999 defense authorization bills both committees felt that chem demil is of national importance and therefore needs to be in osd each committee also cut funding from the chem demil program because of large amount of unobligated funds already in the accounts the military construction appropriators did the same major funding trends the administration proposed significant reductions in military construction spending for fy1999 compared to the enacted fy1998 amount the presidents fy1999 proposal of 78 billion is 12 reduction from the fy1998 89 billion level approved by congress the military construction conference committee
