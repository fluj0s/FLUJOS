atmospheric changes and loss of biological diversity second easilyimplemented uniform control methods using feasible technologies or other direct regulatory approaches are already in place for many pollution and resource management problems in the united states additional progress with socalled command and control policies can be expensive and disruptive and thus counter productive to overall economic well being this type of dilemma is common where environmental deterioration results from diﬀuse and complex causes inherent in technicallyadvanced highconsumption industrial societies such as the us solutions to these types of environmental problems are complicated by the diﬀuse beneﬁts which obscures the net gains of additional controls that have concentrated and highly visible costs given this double bind many policy analysts and academics have for years advocated more costeﬀective and ﬂexible approaches relying on market forces to further some environmental management objectives although marketbased theory and practical environmental policy are still far apart the incremental approach to environmental policymaking since the late seventies has resulted in some markettype innovations within traditional regulatory frameworks at all levels of government the most prominent examples are the environmental protection agencys epa air emissions trading program and the recently

of the 1990 clean air act am endments authorizes the first nationwide system for trading the regional location and method of pollution control this markettypemechanism if successfully implemented could reduce the cost of compliance of meeting newlimits on sulfur dioxide emissions the main precursor of acid rain successful passage of the sulfur dioxide trading mechanism has invigorated efforts to add similar mechanisms to the regulatory regimes for other environmental management areaslimitations of current regulatory approach complexity of remaining and emerging environmental problems and the attack on the federal budget deficit make greater use ofincentivetype approaches to environmental management an attractive option in some cases while existing regulatory systems have made measurable reductions in common air and water pollutants most observers agree that they have been less successful against complexproblems caused by toxics and by transformed or transported pollutants as supplements to established regulatory systems marketbased options often offer cost saving potentials enhancedflexibility and increased effectiveness options include trading of permitted discharges or othertypes of resource constraints or over control credits among sources pollution taxes fees and charges deposits and refunds nd liability assignment nd information disclo sure particularly in situations where total pollution loadings or other resource management objectives rather than ambient health standards are the issue greater consideration of regulatory financial burdens may be warranted more importantly many environmental problems are too intertwined witheveryday economic activities to be managed eff ectively through highly cen tralized regulatory systems proposals by the clinton administration for marketbased environmental protection build on the earlier efforts of congress and the bush administration the 103rd congress isconsidering marketbased approaches in reauthorization for the clean water act some incongress also propose markettype mechanisms fo r dealing with the potential threats of global warming for encouraging the recycling of solid waste and for improving management of somenatural resources as attractive as these mechanisms may be in concept their implementation occurs within well established regulatory context involving all three levels of government international treatyobligations agency capabilities and the private sector it is the implementation concerns thatwill largely shape the debate in congress and help determin which innovations ultimately become public policy for example the political consensus for taxing pollution rests more onraising revenue than on any attempt to charge for the external costs of pollution similarly emissionreduction credit or allowance trading systems may offer politically attractive ways to share thefinancial burdens of policy changes while also reducing compliance

ensure adequate regulatory and technical controls on individual sour ces of air water and land pollution in order to protect public health and ecological values the cost of these controls while significant insome cases had been small enough in the context of the overall economy that through the late1980s viable consensus emerged for specific refinements or shifts in the various laws andimplementing regulations governing environment and natural resources management this statusquo began to change in 1989 with the push for clean air act amendments by the bushadministration the need to project low national costs and marketoriented administrationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs2 policy led to the enactment in 1990 clean air ac t amendments caaa of the first nationwide system for trading the locati on and method for controlling po llutant sulfur dioxide implementation as the primary concern in regulatory innovation some argue that the sulfur dioxide trading mechanism marks new era in environmental management its successful implementation however faces significant challenges at the statelevel and in the private sector other current and proposed markettype innovations face similarimplementation issues since implementation is often the litmus test in assessing the mer its of public policy innovations this report focuses primarily on th potentials and institu tional challenges facing marketbased mechanisms for environmental management within the federal system the outlook the federal budget situation and the nature of emerging envir onmental problems are becoming the factors that focus attention on more active use of incentive approaches forenvironmental protection expanding the use of fees to finance environmental protection programs and greater reliance on trading to shift pollution reduction towards lower cost controlpoints is already done within epa and state nvironmental protection programs experience to date suggests number of directions fo r the use of these mechanisms including large direct taxes on pollution while likely to be effective in the longer term raise concerns about us international cost competitiven ess the admini strative capability to implement such techniques and the political difficulties of applying them in atargeted way more modest role for environmental taxes is one in which they serve multiple purposes such as the proposed btu tax or the recentlypassed gasoline tax the use of taxes in these circumstances may serve several objectives not necessarily relatedto environmental protection but may po ssibly modify behavior sufficiently to produce some reduction in pollution such taxes may raise general or dedicatedrevenue send signal on level of consumption possibly be used to offset otherrevenue sources or serve as way of capturing windfall gains when other regulationsdrive up prices credit or permit trading is emerging as an acceptable means for easing transitions in certain situations where strict location of compliance is not concern such systemscan be used to ease the financial burden and opposition to strict local standards for uniformly distributed environmental problems such as severe ozone nonattainmentas is the goal in the angeles basin to lessen economic disruption by allowingregulated entities to find some other related way to meet standard or marketconstraint as with acid rain control and to create transitional efficiencies when asubstance or activity is being phased out or substantially reduced in scope as with cfcshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs3 1 us library of congress

subject1 this version looks explicitly at issu of implementation for both ex isting and proposed marketbased mechanisms as such the report is divided into several overlapping sections written to theinterests of various readers focus of each major section is 1 findings presents an integration of major points in the report 2 context for marketbased approaches presents the range of actual and proposed mechanisms their relation to current regulatory systems and their general strengthsand weaknesses 3 institutional considerations in implemen tation discusses how each of the generic marketbased approaches works its range of applicability and the challenges toimplementation within the public sector authorities and capabilities 4 current us approaches assesses us experience with actual marketbased approaches todate focusing on lessons and outcomes relative to expectations 5 proposals for new approaches assesses some of the major options that are currently under debate either in congress or in various policy communities findings growing interest and experience with the passage of the trading system for sulfur dioxide the interest in marketbased refinements among environmental advocacy groups and within congress has increased for at least three reasons httpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs4 the country is facing new round of ma jor pollution control programs programs dealing with possible co2 reductions urban ozone reductions recycling and waste reduction requirements nonpoint source water pollution reduction as well as alreadyenacted efforts to deal with phase out of cfcs and acid rain control these initiativescould increase total direct costs of pollution abatement from the historical 2 of thegross national product where it has remained for nearly 15 years facing thesepotential cost increases more efficient control mechanisms begin to look moreattractive in addition solutions to some of these problems such as co 2 stratospheric ozone depletion and acid rain may be more amenable to cost andefficiency considerations since total regional national or even international pollutionloadings are involved rather than local ambient concentrations these circumstancesseem to loosen potential solutions from strict consideration of uniform restraintsallowing consideration of differences in incremental benefits and costs amongdiffering circumstances to shape how pollution reduction is accomplished while still protecting human health existing regulatory approaches appear in adequate or simply inappropriate for managing some of the diffuse and more complex pollution problems that areincreasingly apparent from toxics and pesticides to global concerns aboutstratospheric ozone depletion and climate change by levying charges or taxes onpollution polluting activities or products or by providing other market incentives one may be able to augment existing regulatory and enforcement mechanismswithout resorting to more burdensome and costly methods because of the federal budget deficit it is difficult for congress to authorize and appropriate monies for new programs to address emerging environmental problems some marketbased approaches serve both as potential revenue sources as well asincentives to modify polluting activities options incentive or marketbased options give the regulated community financial reason to reduce pollution or change other behavior usua lly without directives as how such changes should be made although proposals vary most proponents see incentive approaches assupplemental to or refining existing environmenta l regulatory structures rather than replacing them major options include taxes or charges levied on either po lluting outputs polluting inputs or polluting products at sufficiently high level to make it financially desirable to reduce or eveneliminate pollution fees levied on pollution discharge permits or other activities and intended generally to finance regulatory programs tradeable discharge permits or pollution allowances various arrangements where permits or allowances for fixed amount of pollution can be shifted among pollutionsources through the buying and selling of pollution allowa nces that concentrate abatement at the points of lowest costhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs5 2 carlin alan the united states experience with economic incentives to control

zoning cross compliance and subsidies and tax concessions potentials versus the pragmatic case studies of potential savings from possible incentivebased systems usually tradeable discharge permits often generate estimates in the tens of billions of dollars such results areusually predicated on unconstrained shifting of pollution reduction requirements to the lowestincrementalcost points of abatement as such these studies ignore existing regulations based on broader policy concerns and the fact that i ndustries have already spent considerable amounts on abatement estimates of savings from epa s air emissions trading program suggest industry savings of several billions of dollars since the beginning of the program in the midseventiesthe epa estimates that the so 2 allowance trading may save 07 to 10 billion per year over the course of the program depending on state public utility regulation and the participation ofutilities 2 besides direct cost saving potentials there are at least two more subtle but equally important considerations firs t proponents argue that incentivebased systems provide financial motivation for long run innovati ons that may go beyond traditiona l regulatory approaches in solving environmental problems second ev if incentive systems do not produce greater reductions in pollution or improvements in res ource management than traditional approaches they offer the advantage of flexibility in timing the decisions and methods for meeting environmental goals not an insignificant factor in managing private sector activities cases in point the epas air emissions and so2 allowance trading program are the most prominent examples of marketbased mechanisms but veral other programs or plans use incentivetype approaches f r t h s o2 allowance trading program under the acid rain control provisions of the 1990 caaa it is too soon to tell whether in itial expectations on cost savings will be realized phase i which begins in 1995 requires an intermediate level of reductionin emissions which ma ny utilitie s may be able to meet thr ough internal changes the exchange of allowances in market context seems more likely for phase iiallowances which cover emissions of so 2 after the year 2000 and require more stringent reductions from more sources full realization of the potentials of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs6 program will depend in pa rt on state public utility commissi ons policies support from state legislatures and judicial interpretation of state laws the 1990 caaa also contain veral provisions that will be implemented in later years such as fees of 5000 per ton of excess emissions of volatile organic compounds an oxygenated gasoline credit program and low emission vehiclecredit program for air emissions trading under various epa mechanisms netting bubbling offsets and banking the results have been mixed due in part to uncertainties and thereluctance by regulators and industry to apply these techniques the most activemarkets are in southern california where stringent pollution limitations on newindustry had been in force prior to the 1990 caaa and there had been strong industrial growth much of this activity however had been credits generated from plant closings shut down credits with the passage of the 1990 clean air actamendments trading activity in southern california and other areas may befacilitated by the acts comprehensive permit program and increasing sanctions fornoncompliance by industry lead phasedown in gasoline was implemented by epa using lead rights trading program among refiners who d differing technical capabilities to remove lead the program was generally viewed as successful in reducing the overall industry costs ofcomplying with stricter lead standards some argue that wer costs for marginal suppliers resulted in lower gasoline prices and thus lower overall industry profitswhile benefitting consumers in colorado two local governments have established programs for accommodating future economic growth by allowing water pollution sources with high treatmentcosts to buy comparable or greater abatement from lowercost sources usually diffuse nonpoint polluters the program is beginning to be used and is being studiedas possibility for areas with similar water pollution problems wisconsin has established statewide di scharge permit trading program whose sole application to date is on the fox river in order to help achieve regional water qualitystandards that had not been met even after dischargers had installed requiredpollution control equipment it appears that limitations on what constitutes tradeablerights lengthy approval processes and other re strictions are the reasons that there has been virtually trading within this program north carolina has set an overall limit on nitrogen and phosphorus effluent for one basin with charges for pollution sources to meet short term goals in the longterm lower discharge limits will probably be im posed through control of nonpoint sources dischargers can offset their effluents with credits issued by program that controlsagricultural runoff with the most effective management practices most states as well as the federal government use various forms of permit fees or taxes to help finance regulatory programs or in the case of the federal superfund to pay for cleanup of past problems such fees are seldom large enough to create anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs7 economic incentive for abatement though some argue that permit fees for air emissions in some areas may be high enough to have some incentive effect underlying incentive approaches is the role of better information both the federal government and various states have made disclosure of pollution information anexplicit requirement for certain types of environmental releases for example the1986 superfund amendments require that manufacturing companies report annuallyon releases of specified hazardous chemicals new jersey and california also haveenacted strict disclosure requirements for hazardous substances concerns and limitations while incentivebased approaches may be appealing as refinement to current regulatory systems their application in specific situations raises important concerns total pollution control costs could be greater for industry in some cases than traditional command and control systems even though abatement expenditures maybe reduced through incentive approaches this is especially the case where pollutiontaxes or auctions of pollution permits would be involved in this case industry must both either pay for all of its pollution or pay for partial cleanup and permits andortaxes on the rest on the other hand where tradeable permits are grandfathered asthey were with the so 2 allowance trading program questions of equitable allocations based on differences in past control have to be addressed to large extent theworking out of an allocation of permits to existing and new sources may involvecomplexities and politics as challenging as some aspects of command and controlsystems government revenue from an incentive approach say from pollution taxes or auctioned permits would not be recycled to polluters under most proposals forexample earlier proposals for btu tax par tly justified on environmental and energy security grounds would have gone for deficit reduction as does the increase in thegasoline tax that was part of the final budget package there are also number ofproposals for substantial tax increases on va rious pollution sources or other problems such as autorelated congestion with some of the revenue going to reduce incometaxes however some advocate earmarking revenues for environmental programsor to subsidize abatement for vulnerable industry segments this approach seems tobe popular in europe incentive systems because they allow greater latitude in how and where reductions occur may increase the need for detailed monitoring and enforcement either atgovernment or industry ultim ately consumer expense complexity of both sources and pollutants in the toxics and hazardous waste area probably confines incentive approaches to areas such as longrun technical change recycling and restraint on quantity used for example deposit and refund systems for some types of toxics have appeal information disclosure along with shifting ofthe burden of proof may be an effec tive strategy for motivating nonregulatory compliance taxing polluting inputs may also provide incentives for developmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs8 of safer new products or subs titution towards less harmful alternatives as well as raising product price which reduces the amount demanded in situations where environmental deterioration is severe the relative advantages of incentive approaches may be small in th circumstances every feasible means of technical control may be needed to achieve environmental standards if majorlifestyle changes are to be avoided to use marketbased approaches assumes that markets will not have major imperfections too few buyers and sellers hoarding lack of adequate informationand uncertainty about security of investments in overcontrol are all concerns thatsurround trading proposals other potential problems include conflicting objectives between governmental bodies eg environmental program officials goa ls to reduce emissions versus state public utility commissions goals on service reliability and cost and geographic inequitieswhere different jurisdictions might impose different approaches with different costsand potential interstate conflict in some cases there may be an inherent conflict between equitable protection of individual health and the goal of greater latitude in reducing pollutantshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs9 3 some even advocate using pollution taxes as revenue source to shift tax burdens away from the income tax while also creating incentives to reduce pollution see for example 1oates wallace taxing pollution an idea whose time has come resources spring 1988 resources for the future washington dc pp 57 and 2 repetto robert et green fees how tax shift can work for the environment and the economy world resources institute washington dc november 1992 the context for marketbased approaches as noted in the introduction the growing em phasis on marketbased approaches seems to be driven by three trends rising costs from traditional regulatory approaches the growing complexity of diffuse sources of environmental deterioration including nonsustainable pressures on many renewable resources and the perceived urgency to reduce the federal deficit thus increasing the attractiveness of environmental taxes and fees as revenue source 3 whether these forces will accelerate changes in federal environmental protection and resource management policy is unclear but the thrust of the administrations early proposals istoward marketbased techniques in many cases marketbased mechanisms can potentially ease the transition to more sustainable but controversial environmental and resource managementstandards in any assessment of current marketbased pproaches or proposals for change the policy and regulatory setting within which techniques are or may be implemented is the necessarystarting point this section develops that context as background for later discussions of specificmarketbased mechanisms the section covers the current regulatory system and its perceived strengths and weaknesses the pressures for change current examples of marketbased appr oaches and proposals for new approaches the advantages of greater reliance on marketbased options the concerns about marketbased approacheshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs10 the current system its strengths and weaknesses today federal state and local efforts to control environmental deterioration involve complex mix of requirements that taken together are frequently termed commandandcontrol approach typical components of this regulatory structure that was developed mostlyin the 1970s include 1 health or ecologybased standards that are not supposed to be violated2 technologybased or performancebased standards for discharges to the environment and 3permit approval and enforcement procedures for facilities liability assignment and fines canalso be important features for example the clean water act establishes technologybased standards for discharges to water provides for water quality standards to ensure that remaining discharges adequatelyprotect water uses and provides for permits and enforcement the clean air act establishestechnologybased or performancebased standards for emissions from new sources establishes federal ambient air quality standards which states must develop plans to meet and createselaborate permitting processes that can result in differential requirements depending on whetherthe source is new or old and whether it is located or would be built in an area complying withor violating air quality standards various pr ovisions of the 1990 clean air act amendments discussed at several points later in this report modify the command and control nature of theclean air act by adding new or expanded marketbased policies the acid rain control titlewhich authorizes the establishment of trading system for new limitations on sulfur dioxideemissions is the most comprehensive attempt todate at marketbased solution to nationalenvironmental problem in cont rast the air toxics title of the 1990 clean air act amendments is probably one of the most command and control provisions in environmental law calling fortechnology standards on almost 200 different toxic chemicals for toxic materials there are some regulatory variations for hazardous wastes the solid waste disposal act creates manifest system for tracking wastes from cradle to an approvedgrave for toxic substances generally the toxi c substances control act establishes procedures by which epa can require firms to test chemicals and depending on the results epa can imposevarious restrictions on use handling disposal etc and for pesticides the federal insecticidefungicide and rodenticide act provides for federal registration of individual pesticides withlabels specifying permitted uses and restrictions strengths the current system of regulations has provided administrators with some assurance that technically and economically feasible actions are being taken to abate specific pollutants andprovides basis for enforcement in cases of noncompliance regulation in each of the mediaair water and land disposal attempts to assure that variety of standards will be met in somecases ie water and new stationary air pollution sources generally uniform technology isrequired on national basis in other cases ie existing plants for air pollution sources stateor local requirements must lead to compliance with national environmental quality standards setby the federal government this mix of technology requirements performance standards and ambient standards provides regulators with reasonable degree of predictability in how much pollution levels willbe reduced the regulatory system has also generally protected the competitive positions ofcompeting facilities by requiri ng uniform abatemen t technology across the country for

industrial class regardless of fac ility age in water for existing plants emitting air pollution requirement s are related to imperatives imposed by ambient conditions placing strictest controls on new plants has been based on the assumption that it is cheaper for new sources to incorporate pollution control and that econom ic growth will result in the eventual replacement of older dirtier facilities slower grow th and structural change in manufacturing and electric power sectors since th midseventies has tended to work against these initial assumptions this approach has also increased the incentive to keep old facilitiesin operation longer further weakening the in tended environmental benefits of new source controls current regulatory policies however have scored notable successes water bodies have much less organic pollution compared to thirty years ago urban air quality in terms of leadsulfur dioxide and particulate matter is much improved today over the late sixties 4 weaknesses in spite of notable progress on some fronts the system enacted during the seventies has been unable to achieve several mandatory standards and deadlines established in the authorizinglegislation nonattainment of ozone and carbon monoxide ambient ai r quality standards in dozens of urban areas is good example and led to substantial new requirements in the clean airact amendments of 1990 similarly many wa ter bodies still do not pproach their mandated quality objectives proponents of change argue that in such cases ambient standards and deadlines should be tailored to differences in regional conditions regardless of the merits of that argument critics contend that more flexible marketbased approaches could help achievestatutory goals in more timely and less costly way there are also many emerging problems where traditional command and control approaches may not be practical at an accep table cost examples include nonpoint source pollution of surface and ground water solid waste disposal and pesticide and toxics buildup inland water and air management of so combustion byproducts and other industrial chemicals affecting global climate change may be the ultimate environmental challenge forwhich treatment technologies would be infeasible regardless of the scale of investment anddeployment system based on demand restraint such as taxes or quantity restraints creditsmay be more effective and practical for many current environmental management problems thanextending detailed command and control systems pressures for greater use of incentives

regulatory system for conventional pollutants at least it had done an acceptable job of meeting the concerns of equity administrative manageab ility public sector co st and forceability whether the nineties see dramatic increase in the use of marketbased approaches is matter of speculation there are however growi ng forces that may make some types of market based techniques more attractive in the context of broader international national state and localpolicy needs interrelated policy needs that seem to be promoting convergence of interestsaround greater use of marketbased alternatives include cost finance and management effectiveness ie the need to deal with growing control costs fiscal pressures and overuse of some resources and environmentalinfrastructure indirect mechanisms for comp lex environmental problems ie the need to find some common ground between strong competing interests in dealing with theintractability of many environmental problems progress on many environmentaland natural resource problems will require fundamental equitable and long term system and technical changes which may only be possible through indirect changesin the incentives facing businesses and consumers and international obligations ie the prominent role the us plays as both an example of solutions and as significant contribut or to some global environmental threats placing the us in potentially difficult positions in international treaty and politicalnegotiations all three needs point in the direction of great er use of marketbased policies because such policies tend to be less intrusive economically than reliance on direct regulation cost finance and management effectiveness given the double bind facing environmental management the growing complexity of many environmental problems and rising control costs the costeffectiveness with whichprograms can be implemented will help determine how much environmental protection can behad for given level of public

environmental management is belowcost pricing policies for some publiclyowned resources while change in these policies has bothenvironmental and fiscal implications this re port focuses only on the direct use of markettype mechanisms rather than long standing public sect or policies which use resource pricing to foster economic development or maintain community stability in rural areas 11 us congressional budget office environmental charges august 1987 12us congressional budget office the growth of federal user charges washington dc august 1993 two revenue options are possible one is the fees currently used by states and federal agencies to fund environmental programs ie f ee for service the other is the explicit use of taxes on pollutants or polluting activities this latter option is discussed in the next chapter theconcern here is the legal status of fees and taxes in terms of their potential use 10 fees federal and state agencies assess variety of fees associated with pollution discharge permits harmful inputs or with some waste volumes such fees are largely designed to raise revenue to cover environmental regulation research or other related activities such asrestoration these fees are usually set at vels that do not create incentives for polluters to modify their operations in other words the fees are significantly less than the cost of any actionsthe business or consumer can take to avoid paying the assessment 1986 partial survey of states by the congressional budget office found that for air water and hazardous waste permits only seven stat did not use some form of environmental fee in their regulatory programs 11 states use wide variety of permitfee structures including uniform fees fees that vary by size of output of the polluting facility fees that vary by the typeof facility fees that vary by the type of permit fees that vary by the volume of pollutionemissions fees that vary by the toxicity of the discharge or the type of pollutant and fees that vary with the destination of discharge at the federal level certain types of fees may be set by an administrative agency to cover regulatory or program costs 12 the legislative authority for agency fees comes from one of several sources 1 specific provisions in an au thorizing statute 2 authorization provided in appropriations legislation and 3 fee collecti on authority derived from the independent offices appropriation act of 1951 in the latter case fees cannot in reality be ta x eg they must be proportional to value or service obtained from th groups subject to the fees also receipts go to the general fund unless congress specifies ot herwise in authorizations or appropriations language these and other restrictions in the 1951 act are intended to preserve the exclusive power of congress to levy taxes and to overs ee and limit agency growth not authorized by congress taxes an alternative to fees is taxation of polluting activities or substances using taxation as opposed to fees allows greater flexibility in selecting bases and rates and in using the tax to raise large amounts of revenue taxes if high enough will also pot entially aff ect polluting behavior httpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs15 13 in contrast to the limited number of conventional pollutants more than 60000 chemical products and 1200 active pesticide ingredients used in over 35000 formulations give rise topotential human and ecological hazardsthere are two other important contrasts between environmental taxes and program fees first the only restrictions on environmentally oriented taxes are constitutional considerations ofdue process and equal protection however the constitutional requirement that federal taxes beuniform throughout the united states may have implications for some types of incentivebasedapproaches another distinction noted by cbo is the basing of taxes on market values sales income or assets whereas fees are based on non market actions such as licenses permits and government services management effectiveness in some cases rates of use of certain rene wable natural resources may exceed the long term carrying capacity of the resource base under curre nt authorities instituti onal arrangements and behavior of vested interests in other cases an environmental objective may be very costly toreach through acrosstheboard requirements on all actors under these general circumstances trading of the location or method of compliance often allows the private sector to respond more quickly at less cost to the economy as whole themechanism involves public intervention to establish total constraint on total pollution resourceuse or on other characteristics regulated entities are then allowed to trade the location andmethod of compliance to their own economic advantage indirect mechanisms for comp lex environmental problems increasingly the environmental degradation ffecting air water and land are the result of pervasive activities for wh ich traditional end of the pipe t echnologies or co mmand and control regulations may be neither affordable nor practical toxic substances co2 pesticides and nonpoint source water pollution are examples typica lly cited these types of degradation are often linked with growing material standards of living growing population and the technology of everyday agricultural industrial transpor tation and consumer products and processes although conventional pollutants are also associated with economic and population growth their emissions levels can still be further redu ced with reasonably av ailable technologies the seeming intractability of dealing with toxics and pesticide pollution problems arises from the sheer number of substances their volumes and diffusion and the resources and timedemands for evaluating the safety of each one 13 evaluation difficulties arise for several reasons these substances may be biologically active at extremely low concentrations some of them maymagnify in the food chain they may cause diverse subtle and delayed effects in the form ofcancer or neurological and gene damage and they may have the potential for accumulationcycling in the food chain and transformation to more harmful substances in the environment congress has passed several major acts directed at toxic substances and pesticides requirements of these acts include testing and

approaches in spite of progress in dealing with toxics and pesticides however the sheer volume and complexity of these substances present epa with an enormous information and management burden and are considered possible causes in the major delays in meeting various statutory goals in total theepa estimates that there are over 650000 genera tors of hazardous wastes figure which does not include the pesticides used on over two million fa rms annual disposal of toxic wastes in all media may be as much as one billion tons 14 the fact that so many businesses and indivi duals use and dispose of hazardous and toxic substances suggests that future progress in dea ling with this problem may require greater use of flexible and decentralized approaches in this context proponents argue that supplementalmarketoriented approaches such as taxes or deposits and refunds may be worth considering these would provide incentives to reduce the volumes of hazardous pr oducts to encourage recycling and proper dispos or ultimately to sign less harmful products nonpoint source contamination of surface nd groundwater presents similar problems diffuse urban and rural sources of organics diment toxic chemicals pesticides and other contaminants contribute an estimated fifty percent of remaining surface water pollution loadingsand the dispersed land disposal of wastes and use of agrichemicals pos problems of groundwater contamination as well education on best management practices can help reduce these problemsbut the practicality of technical controls is limited and extending strict regulatory approacheswould present enormous enfor cement costs and problems of political acceptability often the polluting activity or substance is small part of operational cost but yields large financial returnscases in point include nitrogen fertilizers and many pesticides used in agriculture liberalapplication of these substances may seem wasteful and is ultimately harmful to the environmentbut to use them more precisely seldom makes sense financially to individuals and businessesat current prices and with current technology wiser use in an environmental sense may requiretoo much management labor and information again in this context proponents of newdirections often propose f ees or taxes on these substances to help modify individual business and consumer behavior perhaps the most complex environmental challenge is the role combustion byproducts and other manmade substances may be playing in global climate modification although this topicis fraught with major uncertainties proponents of accelerating government actions typically callfor range of incentiveoriented approaches in cluding both taxes and trading of the location of controls international obligations the united

greenhouse gas buildup and stratosphericozone depletion and growing depletion of ocean and terrestrial wildlife resources shared among nations part of this growing international imperative is an increasing emphasis on the concept of sustainable development though illdefined it symbolizes the longer term norms proponents of change seek in technology ins titutions and economic systems in order

regulation these concepts are now actively debated by many in thepolicy arena for example table 2 presents some of the types of recent proposals including those based mainly on two projects sponsored

for further studies and debate16 generic and specific examples of the various mechanisms in table 2 are discussed in subsequent sections as the table suggests many of the proposals for greater use of marketbased mechanisms focus on tradeable overcontrol or overperformance on some form of management objective theother recurring theme is the more direct use of taxes on polluti ng activities or products such as the btu tax initially incl uded in the administrati ons plan for reducing th federal budget deficit advantages potential cost savings and innovation proponents of decentralized or marketbased policies cite the potential cost savings and efficiency of these alternatives the general argument is that systems of environmentalregulation which allow flexible responses or abatement trading among sources with differingreduction costs save money pr oponents see such alternatives as both supplement to traditional regulatory approaches and as costeff ective way of attacking emerging problems although proponents talk about market or incentive approaches to environmental protection this does not imply markets in the form of daily price quotes and frequent exchangesof products or property rath er proposed approaches would act to increase the flexibility of meeting environmental or resource management objectives usually limitations on total pollution over some broader geographic area through greater latitude in when where and how adjustments in technology fuel materials or rates of resource use are implemented the hoped for objective is less costly manage ment of environmental quality and natural resources than can be done by trying to extend tr aditional regulatory methods in essence these types of mechanisms help to focus decision making by making the cost of environmentalmanagement more explicit to both businesses and c onsumers this in turn creates reasons to be innovative to make the cost of compliance as low as possible thus rationing the absorptivecapacity of the environment similar to the way markets serve to ration any scarce good or servicethrough the price mechanism for the major marketbased tools taxes and tradeable overcontrol of pollution or other standards cost savings to soci ety may result for two related reas ons first flexibility in method location degree of abatement and contracting arrangements within the regulated community canlead to less resources expended to meet environmental management objectives control isconcentrated at the most costeffective locations as result of selfinterested trading among theregulated community assuming that local environmental standards are met second with bothtaxes and tradeable overcontrol continuing motivation exists to innovate to avoid the taxes orcreate overcontrol that can be sold if this type of incentive remains constant and predictablepart of the business or consumer environment and there are few if any restraints on howhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs24 compliance is achieved then proponents argue longer term cost savings are likely through innovation and substitution compared to the stereotypical command and control system while total cost to society for meeting environmental standards can be less in theory under some marketbased options total industry compliance costs can be much higher since regulatedentities must not only pay to use the waste disposal capacity of the environment through purchased permits or pollution taxes but also pay for any abatement they undertake to avoidtaxes or the need to buy overcontrol from somebody else while expenditures on taxes orovercontrol are considered transfers within so ciety not affecting the real resource cost of compliance they raise the dire

washington dc pp 4243 21 hahn and hester loc cit p 63studies of cost saving potentials several earlier studies have looked at this theoretical potential for less costly abatement approaches through marketbased approaches mainly permit trading171819 in almost all cases these estimates are achieved from simulation models in which current regulations and pastabatement expenditures are not considered as such these types of studies will overstate whatmight actually be saved from the use of permit trading starting from conditions and regulationsas they currently exist for example an ear lier survey of several regionspecific case studies suggests that the cost of attain ing air quality standard s might have been reduced in the range of fifty percent between 1981 and 1990 if leastcost control had been achieved throughunconstrained emissions trading 20 this would have amounted to tens of billions in savings hester and hahn on the other hand suggest that savings from the current air emissions tradingprogram have been few billion 21 in looking at theoretical or simulation type studies the extent to which regulatory constraints on local environmental quality have been excluded from the analysis must also beconsidered when evaluating potential savings from emissions trading that is if dirty highcostfacilities would not be allowed to violate local quality standards even if total regional pollutioncould be reduced more cheaply through some form of trade then theo retical savings will be diminished in addition the regulatory approaches may promote values other than costeffectiveness such as equity and energy policy considerations among others this potential for ma jor cost savings underlyi ng most of the modelling studies is due to the often large differences in pollution control costs among sources these potential cost variationsamong similar sources are the result of differences in scale age technology cost and ease of substituting inputs management practices and location among ot her factors for example studies show that average cost effectiveness across control measures for volatile organiccompounds vocs may range from about 500 pe r ton for

example series of water pollution controlstudies suggested potential saving with leastcost approaches of 20 to 70 percent compared to equalproportional treatment of pollution sources 23 even though major cost variations may hold promise for more costeffective pollution control realizing the savings may not always be practical using extensions of the current system for example most large low cost sources of pollution abatement are already making pollution reductions under current regulations many of the remaining sources with low incrementalreduction costs may be small indi vidual contributors such small activities probably cannot bear the cost of expensive control technology but could reduce emissions through changes inmanagement practices or other operational adjustments applying marketbased approaches tothese types of problems however may invol ve approaches that are not likely to be administratively practical such as taxing inputs or complex polluting byproducts the latterimplies very high degree of monitoring or self reporting both of which have drawbacks another consideration is the stringency of control necessary to achieve environmental standards in an area with significant violations of environmental standards eg air in losangeles virtually every significant pollutio n source of ozone precursors and of carbon monoxide may require maximum feasible reductions if ambient standards are to be approachedunder these circumstances marketbased approaches may reduce inefficiencies in timing andlocation of controls facilitating the implementation of strict standards and reducing indirectcosts but not appreciably affect total costs 24 stimulus for innovation incentivebased approaches may promote lowe r cost abatement where existing sources of environmental degradation are required to make major changes however more subtle butequally relevant point is the stimulus that market signals can provide for longterm innovationsthat might change entire pollution generating products and activ ities incentive systems also offer important flexibility in timing important to private sector investment decisionmaking while it has not been demonstrated that current regulatory systems inhibit innovation and technical advance in environmental protection proponents argue that incentive systems reducethe risk that such inhibition will occur for example most current environmental regulation isdirected to the removal or transformation of pollutants from industrial municipal and mobilesources or to the control of harmful products tering the

may later prove to be inadequate or misguided where avoidance of regul atory burdens takes positive form it may be through adjusting production processes changing product lines or inputs or taking other pollution reducing activities proponents of incentive systems ar gue that cost signa ls should be more explicitly focused on the polluting substance or activity if we want to do better job of longrun environmentalmanagement they argue that there may be any number of ways of reducing the level ofpollutants ultimately reach ing environmental media having the incentives and flexib ility to be able to choose how and where to make changes can reduce the need for costly removaltechnologies for example if the impacts on employment in vulnerable segments of the highsulfur coal industry were ignored an unrestrai ned incentivebased system would likely lead to large scale shifting to low sulfur coal this would be marketbased outcome since using lowsulfur coal is generally much less expensive option than installing scrubbers 26 in passing the acid rain portion of the 1990 clean air act am endments however congress chose to design the sulfur dioxide allowance trading system in way that gives some incentives to use scrubbersthat may give some protection to high sulfur coal miners while still creating the most potentiallycomprehensive marketbased approach to date challenges to implementation the preceding alludes to some of the institutional challenges in implementing marketbased systems general concerns include political acceptability geographical equity and practicab ility in particular affected parties may be very re luctant to accept incentive approaches there are moreover several specific and interrelated policy concerns that accompany proposals forincentiveoriented policies specific problems include lack of certainty in attaining environmental goals third party and local environmental compliance measuremen t and monitoring costs boundary inequities institutional capability and authority market imperfections compliance versus abatement costscomplexity in pollution sources and crossmedia effects httpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs30 the various incentive approaches discussed in the next chapter are subject in varying degrees to these specific policy problems also the current command and control systemconfronts many of the same concerns uncertainty in meeting environmental goals raising the cost of polluting activities or produc ts through charges or taxes can be expected to lead to reduced pollution levels over some difficult to predict time period this will happenso long as the costs of reduction for some busin esses or consumers are less than the charges associated with the polluting activity however in complex economy it is difficult to predictaccurately how much reduction will occur how fast it will occur and what combination of short and long run alternatives the private sector may use to make reductions thus if regulators were to add incentiveoriented modifications to current regulatory systems the resulting pace of improvement toward environmental goals or standards might ormight not be considered acceptable proponents believe that charge adjustments could fine tunethese systems based on initial response howe ver frequent changes to adjust the incentive structure would doubtless l ead to criticisms similar to those made of the current system where numerous changes make private sector respons more difficult and inefficient further complication arises if incentive fees also serv to finance the regulatory program if successful in reducing the polluting activity the financing base would be reduced tradeable permits may offer regulators an incentive option with less uncertainty than taxes or fees since permits are for fixed amount of pollution or other compliance goal enforcing compliance with the permit terms should in total meet specified standards uncertainty would also affect the private sectors respons if permit conditions and amounts were not firm or were subject to future change trading and markets would be retardedsimilarly lengthy processes hearings intervention points and possibilities of lawsuits typicallyretard or eliminate potentials for costsaving exchanges third party effects and local environmental compliance any marketbased approach that would result in the shifting of pollution location or in the potential introduction of unpredic tability in regional environm ental conditions would require explicit safeguards that is for example if wa ste water discharges were transferred between two different locations as part of permit trading safeguards would be needed to protect the interestsof persons living along or using the water affected if various types of interregional emissionstrading are allowed safeguards would be needed to assure that applicable local environmentalstandards continued to be met hence even marketbased system requires regulatoryframework in order to function and thus is supplemental to such command and controlrequirements moral opposition to loca l changes in pollution closely related to the above some environm ental groups have opposed market approaches on the grounds that any potentially damaging emi ssions should be eliminated thus there shouldnt be right to pollute which can be bought or sold they argue that if it is possible toreduce emissions at given source the source should not be allowed to buy emission rights fromsome other source located in different area since the local area would continue to bearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs31 avoidable pollution on the other hand regulations give one the right to pollute also by meeting the given standard measurement and monitoring major technical and cost challenge for greater reliance on incentives is monitoring of compliance particularly for the cases of tradeable permits and less so for taxes on effluents oremissions by focusing on performance rather than on what hardware company has installedenforcement difficulties increase systems of monitoring are both necessary and likely to be more complex and expensive than for performance or technologybased approach with the latter regulators knowapproximately what abatement levels are being achieved and where to actually measurepollution levels from specific sources in order to impose charges requires regular monitoring orselfreporting with periodi c verification for ai r emissions for example most sources do not have continuous emissions monitoring nor are all potentially controlled pollutants monitoredsuch monitoring is only required on new sources and coal burning utilities for sulfur dioxidecontrol purposes for existing sources comp liance is generally determined by ambient concentrations as measured by ground monitors individual stack monitors would be imperative to comprehensively monitor compliance with an emissions tax or for systems of potentiallywidelytraded emissions for the so 2 allowance trading system under the clean air act amendments continuous emissions monitoring is requirement on the other hand taxes on inputs such as carbon content of coal do not require any extensive monitoring or administrative systems complexity of nonconventional pollutants the complexity of nonconventional pollutants ie toxics pesticides etc as well as the complexity of their sources likely renders tax or charge systems for other than revenue purposes an extreme challenge in most situations since authorities would have to set charges for andmonitor vast number of pollutants and sources taxing substances on the input side presents fewer problems particularly since companies would normally have transaction data on whichto base charges for example proposals for reauthorization of the clean water act include charges on certain types of toxic chemicals ba sed on rating of their degree of toxicity institutional capability and authority as stated above the federal government has the potential legal authority to use taxes as policy tool for influencing privatesector beha vior some environmental statutes specifically the recently amended clean air act and less so the clean water act also contain varyingdegrees of encouragement or limitations on use of markettype approaches beyond the legal question federal state nd local governments w ould likely require dditional resources experience and capabilities to structure manage and enforce certain types of marketbasedapproaches specifically capabilities would be needed to structure and facilitate markettype transactions while avoiding the chilling effect of excessive regulations oversight and third partyintervention monitoring systems inter jurisdictional coordination enforcement authority andcapability technical analytic sta ffs among other resources would be important in supporting less centralized marketoriented management systems httpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs32 market imperfections the potential for trading overcontrol of pollution or credits to facilitate environmental management requires well organized markets for trading if buyers and sellers are fewinformation is limited property rights are not welldefined transaction rules are cumbersome andtimeconsuming if the public can intervene at multiple points in the decision process or fewlarge organizations can manipulate availability and price of permits then the potential for tradingis unlikely to be realized or to improve environmental management thus for pollution or credit trading program s information and exchange mechanisms public or private would need to evolve quickly to help bring interested parties together inmany situations responsible agencies would ve to have the capab ility to mon itor market development and to deal with possible problems of market dominance by very largeorganizations or other rious noncompe titive actions regional definiti ons and boundaries difficult problem for many of the incentive options is inequities at jurisdictional boundaries though this problem also holds for many current environmental regulations forexample if input taxes on polluting substances were used strong incentives exist for avoidingthe cost by doing business in neighboring jurisdictions not using similar programs differencesin administrative and legal requirements across jurisdictional lines may also reduce the appealand potentials of some of these approaches compliance versus abatement costs one of the major concerns with some of thes approaches is the cost burden on companies systems that involve government auctioning of tradeable permits or payment of effluent chargesparticularly raise this problem while auction of permits or pollution taxes theoretically achieve the least cost allocation of pollution abatement expenditures companies would also pay for the market costs of permitsor pay pollution charges on unabated pollution this money is paid to the government and isconsidered transfer within society from social or economic perspective however forcompanies the combination of spending on pollution abatement as well as permits or effluenttaxes is usually more costly than meeting the requirements for uniform treatmentunderstandably options having this re sult are vigorously opposed by industry crossmedia effects raising the cost of one means of waste disposal or disposal of one particular pollutant can often result in diversion of pollutants to other untaxed or uncontrolled environmental media aswith current regulatory systems anything less th an comprehensive approach particularly with toxic or hazardous substances invites diversion to other media or even illegal dumpinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs33 institutional considerations in implementation the beginning of marketbased approaches to environmental protection in the united states is accompanied by growing number of proposals fo r greater use of these types of policy tools such options are now solidly on the environmental agenda even though they f ace significant institutional and practical obstacles to early or easy application the challenge to adoption of such techniques is the extent to which these mechanisms can be at odds with other importantimperatives authorities jurisdictions and practical implementation and management needs the role for market approaches in regulatory context the extent to which marketbased mechanisms might ultimately become major feature of environmental management policy is subject to wide range of debate such mechanisms do however offer pragmatic vehicle for accomplishing several things effectively either as asupplement to prescriptive regulatory systems or as freestanding systems these systems offer at least the following general features which can allow for incremental refinements in existingenvironment and resource management systems regulatory efficiencies introduction of flexib ility in meeting some fac ility emission standards or regional ambient quality standards resulting in lower direct compliancecosts or lower indirect costs due to less cumbersome compliance process phase out or phase down mechanisms introduction of flexib ility and cost savings in meeting national or regional pollution constraint where trading of emissionsources does not create local violation of healthbased standards way for internaliz ing external costs signalling societal desire for reduction in the overall consumption of environmentally damaging substances or activities byraising their costs to the user in situations where other forms of environmental controlare impractical too costly less effective or counter to other values such as individual freedoms taxing cigarettes or alcohol are cases in point at personal level part ofthe motivation for gasoline tax seems to fall in this category not unrelated to these features is the potential for revenue to pay for environmental protection efforts or to serve other fiscal needs the possibilities for less costly or more effective envi ronmental management from adopting these types of innovati ons are widely argued and illustra ted in academic and other policy literature what is less often examined are the issues for implementation within both thelegislative process and th institutional constraints of the fede ral system this section looks at general implementation issues for three generic approaches and their variations it also brieflyreviews other market conditioning mechanisms such as information requirements liabilityassignment best management practices and pricing polices the approaches include1 taxing pollution polluting ac tivities or polluting inputshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs34 27for example see us general accounting office environmental protection implications of using polluti on taxes for supplement regulation gaorced9313 washington dc 19932 allowing businesses to trade set amount of pollution or other constraint on business activity fixed amount of sulfur dioxide emissions recycled paper content innewsprint etc among themselves in order to achieve gains from trade and thusachieve lower compliance costs 3 using depositrefund mechanism to create incentives to recycle or properly dispose of containers and some hazardous substa nces or contaminated equipment 4 changing how individuals and businesses approach market transactions that may affect the environment by increasing available information by internalizing risksthrough liability ssignment by pricing policies nd by means such as contracts or other types of agreements taxing pollution the concept of taxing pollution is simple the political and management reality of pure pollution taxes however is far from simple indeed the pragmatic side of pollution taxessuggests only limited circumstances where convergent interests policy needs and institutional capability may make some variation of this approach part of environmental management 27 as discussed below it is the variations on the theme that may hold more policy interest than theconceptual case proposed by some the general case pollution damages important human values health aesthetics materials or the functioning of ecosystems indirectly necessary for human welf are thus not all of the costs both monetary and nonmonetary of polluting activities are reflect ed in the prices of the respective goods or service this means that damages to other values could be reduced or avoided if less of the goodor service were produced the production or c onsumption involved more benign technology or defensive efforts were made to counter the pollution in these circumstances economists recommend tax on the pollution from the activity or product which causes damages to other values so that price signals the full social cost to the userprivate cost of production plus monetary value of external damages the level of the tax is setso that enough ec onomic units producers or consumer s modify their various behavior consumption fuel choice technology chemical use or design etc to just balance theincremental value of the reduction in external damages from pollution with the incremental costsof reduction in this scheme those who find it cheaper to reduce pollution than pay taxes do sothey pay taxes on any remaining pollution their activity causes those who find it moreexpensive to make changes than pay the tax do so and thus continue polluting in theory tax set at the proper level will result in reduction in pollution where costs of reduction are balanced with the benefits of such reductions that is where incremental costs of reduction and incremental benefits of reduction are just equal such an arrangement implies agreat deal of information on polluting activities the damages such activities may cause and howhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs35 individuals value those damages such information would be used by public authorities to structure and administer pollution taxes implementing pollution taxes while some countries have used variations of pollution taxe s to help manage water quality for some river systems pollution tax conceived as method of balancing incremental controlcosts with incremental social benefits has been attempted to date there are good reasons for this and include the following considerations credibility of information estimates of monetary benefits necessary to justify tax levels cannot be developed in practical and systematically defendable way economists have methods for estimatingwillingness to pay to reduce pollu tion but such methods are xperimental at best and not operational in terms of governmental obligations for protecting public health and otherenvironmental values thus there is pub licly acceptable way to measure the monetary benefits of most forms of pollution reduction that would allow defenda ble methods for setting tax instead where taxes have been proposed as an alternative to direct regulation it has beenmore along the lines of how high should tax be to induce incremental expenditures byindustries in order to achieve desired reduction in pollution with the tax limited applicability the type of pollutants for which optimal taxes are usually proposed tend to be those that do not have long term or irreversible human or environmental consequences the standard case is organic forms of water pollution which can be assimilated and broken down by normal bacterial processes the more complex pollution problems however relate to certain toxics and pesticides which are long lasting bioaccumulate and cycle in the environment these pollutants have diffuse and often hard to understand conseque nces which often show up first in aquatic and related ecosystems using optimal taxes to manage the myriad compounds that are potentiallydamaging presupposes imme nse analytical monito ring and enforcement capability wh ich is not currently the case use of tax revenues the disposition of revenues from taxes on pollution raises several difficult practical issues if pollution is taxed in some way pollutants inputs activity to bring about its overall reductionthree questions arise first who receives the revenue second what happens as revenue from the tax declines as pollution declines ie what happens to the revenue base third how aretaxes adjusted for inflation to keep the economic incentive constant in real terms while thesequestions can be easily answered in concept an swers within the federal system pose significant problems interests affected by taxes typically like to see benefits from such taxes for examplethe highway gasoline tax going for highway c onstruction answers also affect the macroeconomic impacts of such taxes data availability taxing pollution assumes the availability of comprehensive and precise monitoring systems which do not currently exist and would be expensive to install maintain and verify unless selfreporting is used or more readily measurable tities such as inputs for ex ample high sulfur coalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs36 rather than sulfur emissions are taxed taxes would require expensive monitoring in order to ensure accurate reporting other ways of using taxes accepting the practical difficulties of using taxes to precisely manage environmental quality on location specificbasis there are other roles that taxes charges or fees can play fees already serve as basis for partial or complete financing of some environmental protection programs fees are levied on regulated entities to recover some or all of the costs ofadministering federal state or local environmen tal protection programs the level of fees must reflect the cost of administrative services performed meaning that fees seldom will provide anystrong incentive for reducing pollution beyond the regulatory requirements between the financing of environmental pr otection programs with fees and the precise taxing of pollution to achieve an essentially unknowable optimal reduction probably lies morepragmatic role for taxes in implementing already determined social goals this role evolves fromusing taxes to implement policy for which consensus on achieving specific reduction targethas been obtained for example the acid rain control program could have had tax imposed thatachieved 10 million ton reduction in so 2 but permit program was chosen instead the use of taxes in these circumstances may have several purposes not necessarily related to environmental protection but possibly modifying behavior sufficiently to produce somereduction in polluting activity such taxes may raise general or dedicated revenue send signalon level of consumption possibly be used to offset other revenue sources or serve otherpurposes such as capture of windfall gains wher other environmental regulations are driving up product prices the tax on chlorofluorocarbons cfcs and pr oposals for an increase in the federal gasoline tax are primary examples of how taxes are or could be pplied as part of broader policy packages in the case of cfcs the tax adds incentive to find substitutes and speed phaseoutbut most observers see its imposition as much as way to capture some of the price runup due to phaseout and to raise revenue proposals for large increases in the gasoline tax are packagedwith any number of motivations including defic it reduction increased energy security through reduced consumption of oil and long run incentives to increase equipment efficiency as general premium to signal the social costs of auto use including air pollution congestion and accidentsand as an incentive to shift toward alternative fuels among others tax on carbon dioxide or more precisely tax on carbon content of fuel has also been proposed as one possible response to forthcoming treaty commitments by the united states onglobal climate change the level of such tax would not be set based on an unknowable valueof marginal damages from future climate change rather target for reduction would need tobe related to incremental costs of reduction and the tax set at the incremental reduction cost alarge amount of revenue would be raised which opens the possib ility of offsetting other taxes or spending areas so as to minimize the immediate economic impact the clinton administrationand the rio declarati on at the 1992 earth summit have comm itted the country to stabilization of greenhouse gases at 1990 levels by the year 2000 carbon equivalent tax could be set at the marginal cost of achieving that policy goal other possibilities for energybased taxes relatedto climate change include tax on btu content of fuel which shifts the initial costs away fromfuels such as coal and may spread the distributional consequenceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs37 in contrast to precise pollution tax based on balancing regional environmental benefits and control costs broad based tax serving multiple objectives is likely to have widespread andhighly visible equity or distributional consequences to the extent that such taxes haveenvironmental purposes the objective is to affect levels of consumption and possibly long run technology or product design and function in mo st cases making consumption more expensive will disproportionately burden wer income individuals oppos ition to generalized gasoline tax is partially along these lines as with all taxes some relief to lower income individuals canbe realized through refundable credits or means tests though the administrative burden increases proposed gasoline taxes fall into this category impacts from carbon tax would be moreconcentrated initially on coal producing regions rail transporta tion and coal using u tilities in terms of income and employment loss the tax would also quickly be reflected in the rates ofcoalconsuming electricity utilities currently about sixty percent of total electric generation trading of pollution reduction or other resource management constraints another way to potentially reduce the costs of achieving environmental standards or other resource management constraints is to allow regulated sources to trade the location and natureof compliance among themselves this is already done to some degree through epas airemissions trading program and is central featur of the acid rain control provisions of the 1990 clean air act amendments this type of mechanism is usually applicable only where the pollutant mixes uniformly and is damaging over broad geographical area unde r those circumstances the point of control is less important than is putting limit on the total amount of pollution as long as local healthbased standards are met where in the region pollution is reduced is not important to overallregional environmental quality the general case as with taxes the economic logic of tradeable over control of pollution or other compliance obligations like recycled material content within binding limit on total emissionsis compelling if reductions can be concentrated at those sources with the lowest costs the totaleconomic cost will be less than if sources with differing costs are required to achieve equal reductions this least cost outcome is possible if each source is required to control damagingactivity at the specified rate of reduction but then allowed to sell over control to or buy overcontrol from other enterprises for those with low incremental costs of reduction it pays toover control and sell the excess reduction to enterprises that have high incremental costs whothen are allowed to continue emitting pollutants the end result is control at the required totallevel of reduction if site specific shifts in the source of damaging activity is not an issue thistype of mechanism can be costeffective way to meet variety of environmental and naturalresource management goals httpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs38 28for an

implementing so2 allowance trading implicati ons of transaction costs and taxes report 93313 enr by larry b parker and donald w keifer washington 1993 implementing tradeable pollution or other compliance requirements implementing any tradeable pollution system requires consideration of several important institutional needs these include protecting private transactions for there to be market for pollution or other compliance over control there has to be security of underlying pr ivate obligations this leads to two very strong necessary conditions for development of trading system first over control is essentially an investment and as suchmust be viewed as property that belongs to the investing enterprise if there is to be anyreasonable incentive for trading government recognition and protection of that property is essential for markets to develop second government can facilitate market development by minimizing the transactions costs of trading the less encumbered with oversight and potentialvetoes by government authorities or other parties the more likel that trading and cost saving potentials will be realized 28 meeting public purposes on the other side of the coin there also has to be acc ountability for th public purpose being served thus most openmarket trading systems would have to be monitored andregulated possibly more than traditional technology or performancebased command and controlsystems 29 this level of information is necessary in order to verify that over control has occurred and can be sold to other emission sources or third parties for example brokers or middlemenadvances in technology may make this feature ss costly over time and there are surrogate ways for estimating how much control is achieved nonetheless operation of trading systemnecessarily must be information intensive if authorities are to meet statutorily mandated goals while voluntary reporting of reductions and trades is possible it may invite bogus transactions and program failure any volunt ary reporting system would require consistent random auditing or monitoring to verify reported tr ansactions such sy stem might also invite lawsuits from environmental groups challenging lack of progress or performance by responsible state or local implementing agencieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs39 30 for discussion of experience pro and with the allowance trading system to date see us senate committee on environment and public works three years later report card on the 1990 clean air act amendments washington dc november 15 1993 31see for example parker larry b et clean air act allowance trading continuedachieving equity implementing trading system on top of existing command and control systems raises challenges as to how much cred it each entity should receive for pa st efforts inequities arise quickly where differing degrees of control have been previously achieved giving each source percentage of its remaining emissions is inhe rently unfair to those who have already invested in control or who have very modern facilities with low emissions by design the fairest systemprobably involves distributing emission rights in pr oportion to precontrol emissions levels this covers the situation where sources have made equi pment or fuel changes and are cleaner than the new requirements because it gives th em over control to sell it s till leaves an ine quity when new lowpollution technology has been bu ilt into an industrial system for variety of reasons the source has precontrol baseline and is cleaner than the new standards require sources insuch situations could be forced to buy emissions rights to expand operations when they arealready cleaner than any other source thus implementing emission trading systems requires political decisions and regulatory machinery not unlike current programs t itle iv of the 1990 clean air act amendments establishing the sulfur dioxide allowance trading system for coalburning electric utilitiesillustrates this concern passage required co mplex allocation systems to accommodate concerns over regional cost burdens and equity as well as operational flexibility

the so 2 allowance trading mechanism will ultimately show30 taxing profits if contracting parties agree to an exchange of over control or over compliance income is generated by the seller and costs are incurred by the buyer how these buying and selling transactions are treated for tax purposes by the irs will have an important bearing on thestrength of the incentive to invest in over control and on the incentive to buy over control asopposed to controlling to the requi red standard if net income generated by selling over control is taxed at the marginal corporate rate then the amount of over cont rol forthcoming will be reduced in total since marginal investments in over control must stand rate of return test againstother corporate investments how over control is achieved may also have bearing on whethera depreciable asset or an expensable cost is being offered to other parties if the over controlbought by purchasing enterprise is treated as service regardless of the method by which it isgenerated differential incentive is created on the other hand if over control is treated as adepreciable capital expense purchased for its useful or physical life allowed rates of depreciation

creating regional bubbles current air emissions trading mechanisms operate within tightly drawn rules which limit how and where trades of uniformly mixing air pollutants can take place while the so2 allowance trading system is designed to be national in scope whether it moves much beyondbilateral trades under state pub lic utility commission s upervision remains to be seen because over control involves private investment decisions that essentially create property rights andbecause the obligation of local and state governments to avoid third party effects caused bychanging the location of specific pollution sources most pollution trading seems likely to be tiedclosely in location if this is the direction of tradeable pollution control it is logical extensionof the bubble approach now used for individual plants creating crosstrading cross trades involve buying environmental controls in an activity different from the pollution source in order to creat the right of the buying entity to avoid its own more costly control expenditures32 examples include reforestation as co2 offsets or buying up old cars to reduce urban air pollution rather than controlling stationary sources although only limitednumber of crosstrades have been authorized or attempted to date they are frequent option in proposals ranging from carbon dioxide control to solid waste recycling factors which willprobably determine which options have potential for implementation include unimportance of the specific location of reduction within control region ease of verification of compliance both for public sector purposes and for purposes of private contractual arrangements large enough cost differentials to offset additional monitoring nd contractual costs for control outside of the buying entity andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs41 33 for general discussion of these issues see parker larry implementing acid rain legislation crs issue brief 91035 c ongressional research service us library of congress updated regularly lack of other more costeffective options to meet pollution standards for regulated sources achieving costsharing tradeable permits can serve to share the cost burden where pollution generation occurs in one area with environmental damages occurring in geographically different area the sulfurdioxide allowance trading mechanism under the amendments gives regions that would benefitfrom reduced acid rain mainly the northeast long run reasons to buy allowances from coalburning electric utilities in th midwest through such financia l exchanges the costs of over control in the midwest ultimately may be reduced and the costs of compliance in the northeastraised helping to spread the financial burden more evenly between the regions however in thenear term there has been activity along these lines circumstances for implementing such broad scale cost sharing may be unique to problems such as acid rain but that example does point to several general conditions necessary forsuccessful programs these include significant oneway contribution of total pollution in the receiving region from the other region based on prevailing weather or hydrol ogic conditions pollutants or other attributes that are not an immediate threat to human health emission sources that already operate under permit or could readily be put under permit systems for the pollutant relatively similar levels of economic activity between the regions but with differences in the cost structure for controlling pollution eg large economies ofscale with low incremental abatement costs for industry in the generating region andmore diffuse high incremental cost sources in the receiving region cap on total damaging activity between the two regions that is significantly below current or expected levels due to growth despite the early hopes for the allowance trading program th initial phase has seen only handful of trades mainly am ong midwest u tilities the first auction of allowances resulted in purchases of all allowances offered by the epa but few takers for allowances offered byutilities 33 thus the ideal circumstances listed above for broad scale interregional permit trading raise some important questions in the operational world of most large scale industrial sectors creating transitional or phaseout efficiencies trading of permits for industries which must eliminate substance can ease the transition and costs trading of timing or location of compliance is appropriate where elements within theindustry have widely differing phaseout costs the oftencited example is the phasedown of lead in gasoline accomplished through tradeable lead credit program between refiners refinershttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs42 who had very high phaseout costs were able to buy credits from refiners who were able to accelerate the phaseout at low cost this type of trading could serve under circumstancessimilar to the refinery sector given the following conditions the potential for or history of coopera tion and coordination of some operations within the industry long lead time so that planning for phaseout can be coordinated with other planning needs substantial differences in production costs and size between firms or plantshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs43 34 for example see macauley molly k et using economic incentives to regulate toxic substances resources for the future washington dc 1992depositrefund beyond refundable deposits on beverage containers many have proposed using this mechanism for certain diffuse pollution sources wh ere return for proper disposal or recycling is environmentally important but hard to achieve through traditi onal regulatory means this type of mechanism is applicable wher the item of concern is durable or can be contained and has some salvage or reuse value alternately some are proposing that strongincentives be created for recycling or proper dis posal of certain types of hazardous materials by requiring refundable deposits 34 the general case the success in reducing litter th rough depositrefunds for bevera ge containers in several states demonstrates the effectiveness for this m echanism to solve certain types of environmental problems unlike tradeable permits this mechanism is straight forward in concept and initialimplementation for three reasons first the goals and the method are easily understood by the public if the deposit is large enough relative to the purchase price of the product the user or others have strong incentives to return containers second once enacted implementing adepositrefund system is largely up to the priv ate sector while business practices must be altered and some manufacturing employment may be lost recycling and other transactions jobs are created under these types of programs third the types of products where this is applicable are typically not adulterated or contaminated by use nor are the containers of high enough value to induce counterfeiting or large scal fraud in order to capture refunds thus for standard recyclable products such as beverage containers the statebystate implementation that has occurred by most reports has not caused major dislocations in containermanufacturing or disruptions in retail distri bution and has therefore been credited with measurable improvements in litter problems and increased levels of recycling implementing deposit refund systems extending depositrefund systems to materials other than beverage containers as some propose raises several practical challenges the severity of these challenges pose depends on the type of product or material under considera tion and in particular the engineering and material requirements for either recycling or di sposing of reclaimed materials though each area has its own unique concerns several implementing issues hold to varying degrees for all of the various candidates for deposit and refunds these includehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs44 durability the durability or containability of the item or material the lower the additional effort expenses and labor or personal time to store co llect handle transport and reprocess or dispose of the material the more attractive this mechanism becomes beverage containers would be atone end of continuum with some hazardous chem icals at the other in between are problem items such as batteries tires and pesticide containers to name current examples costcompetitive recycling the existence of or strong potential for costcompetitive recycli ng the greater the existing infrastructure for using or reprocessing the product or material the more thefundamental economics will drive implementati on deposit refund coupled with marketable recycling quotas could provide double incentives in some situations as would depositrefund coupled with product tax on new materials existing information systems the existence of welldeveloped information management and tracking systems to which depositrefund information needs can be easily added the more fully developed productinformation is the less disruptive additional record keeping is likely to be making that part ofimplementation less costly economies of scale the existence of economies of scale in treatme nt and disposal of hazardous materials the greater the costeconomies that can be captured through centralized treatment the more likelya marketbased depositrefund approach would be attractive compared to other more restrictivecontrol programs ease of verification the capability to distinguish on costeffective basis qualif ying returns from counterfeits in order to avoid exploitation of the system this is particularly necessary where hardtoanalyzehazardous waste would be involved or where imports from other jurisdictions or countries could be used to capture refund monies strength of monetary and nonmonetary incentives the inconvenience issues in depositrefund systems can be greater issue for users than the need to pay deposits while depositrefund systems may appear as costeffective way toachieve some types of environmental management objectives time costs and inconvenience forthose affected must also be considered in any comprehensive appraisal the acceptance andsuccess of any systems that rely on voluntary compliance will likely depend on three factors the size of the deposit relative to the value of the product the larger the deposit the greater the likely rate of redemption by eith er initial purchasers or secondary markets that collect and return for income purposes the size of expenses incurred in storing and returning containers httpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs45 the degree of inconvenience and time incurred including disruption of normal routines time needed to collect clean handle and transport containers intrusion onstorage and space management needs of homes and businesses and administrativeand record keeping changes that may be at odds with existing practices ways of using depositrefund number of proposals for using depositrefund suggest the potentials for this mechanism and also illustrate the challenges to effective implementation applications discussed in severalrecent studies include lead acid batteries lubricating oil industrial solvents and pesticidecontainers among others the major motivation behind depositrefund proposals for these typesof products is local environmental management problems that current disposal practices may pose in particular significant contributions to nonpoint source water pollution and solid wastemanagement because the types of activities c ontributing to these envi ronmental problems are diffuse and numerous the reach of traditional regulatory t ools is often limited or unduly burdensome leading some to advocate marketbas ed approaches such as depositrefund the few operational examples of these types of mech anisms and several proposed options allow some general observations about circumstances for possi ble application of these tools these examples are discussed in detail later in the report and general cases are discussed here high volume nonhazardous materials with recycling potential beyond beverage containers there may be other household containers which consumers could conveniently bring back to retail outlet and which might have the potential for depositrefund approach since most nonbeverage containers are not associated with littering problems use of this approach would be away to accelerate the rate of recycling for potentially valuable materials in practice use of thistool would probably only be practical at state or national level as supplement to reducedemands on landfill or other disposal capacity highly toxic low volume materials with high treatment costs many of the proposals for extending depositref und deal with categories of chemicals that pose special disposal problems such chemicals may be treated most efficiently in largesophisticated disposal systems requiring economies of scale in order to be costeffective short of mandating use of such facilities by regulated industries less in trusive way of increasing the control on special types of toxic chemicals could be to require large deposits at the point of salethese deposits would be refunded upon return of certifiable spent chemicals or their byproducts to regional disposal facility such chemicals would have to be used in reasonably closedindustrial processes or be readily managed for final containerization and return to disposalfacility verification of purchas would be necessary to avoid problems of counterfeit returns contaminated products or equipm ent with high disposal costs similar to the above products such as used lead acid batteries other electrical equipment and contaminated containers are being or coul d be included in depositrefund systems these products often pose landfill and other disposal problems and are hard to regulate because theproducts are so widely used in contrast to counterfe iting issues for contai nerized toxics key issue for this type is the incentive for theft if the deposit is too high relative to the product pricethis potential raises the need for accurate documentation which in turn increases theinconvenience cost to participants also challenging are the product handling concerns whereconsumers may be disinclined to transport used equipment very far necessitating numeroushttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs46 pickup points fi nal disposal of such cont aminated products implies treatment capability as with the above example widely used substances with acceptable onsite disposal methods used motor oil is the main example in this category this type of approach could be used for highvolume substances that are used in equipm ent but not consumed in the process that are potentially harmful to the environment and that are prone to widespread improper disposal to land water or air chlorofluorocarbons used in cooling equipment would be an example while deposit refund could be one tool for bringing improper cfc disposal under control phaseout and product taxation are the methods congress s chosen for dealing with this area major challenges for this use of depositrefund both for used motor oil and any other proposed substances exist both at the user end and in the ultimate market for reuse and recycling at the user end unless the deposit is large the inconvenience of collection storage and transport to receiving station may work against significant compliance as with other depositrefundsubstances final use depends on the physical recyc ling potential market conditions for such materials in particular price relative to virgin materials and the degree of contamination of thematerials which may render them useless or require an extensive infrastructure for processing other market strengthening actions beyond proposed marketbased mechanisms such as those above federal and state governments have strengthened in formation and liability requireme nts for certain products and disposal activities in order to improve environmental management also education on bestmanagement practices can be costeffective way of improving resource management specific examples of these more traditiona l methods for guiding profitoriented economic activity towards more broadly desirable outcomes are described at various points later in thereport some general issues of implementation are identified briefly below information traditional role played by government is the provision of information to in order to inform and ideally improve consumer and busin ess decisionmaking provision of variety of economic statistics is an obvious example century of support to farm management throughfederal extension services is another by giving consumers businesses and organized interest groups more accurate information about products or activities that affect the envi ronment or human health both the private sector and the political process ideally can make better informed decisi ons this type of government activity is typically undertaken on the premise that some kinds of broadly beneficial informationis public good which profitoriented enterprises do not provide because full costs cannot berecovered or because it may be counter to their commercial interests in the environmental area government is involved in both education as well as mandatory disclosure of various types of use disposal or resourcestatus information accompanying either products processes chemicals or sometimes asset sales both the federal and stategovernments have passed laws broadening industry information disclosure requirements forexample section 313 of title iii of the

efficacy of such requirements and the impacts they may have on business and consumer decisions factors that may affect the usefulness of additional publicly available information can include the complexity of the subject particularly where significant scientific uncertainty exists making risk or hazard characteriza tions difficult and timeconsuming for users to interpret the potential for abuse of such information for political purposes causing damage to product or business reputations and the credibility of the information sourcefactors that may affect business and consumer decisions can include the cost of producing reliable information on health or environmental risks from products or substances the risk to business from disclosure of trade or competitivelysensitive information the increased awareness of communities to potential risks and adverse environmental effects which may increase the effect of mo ral suasion or public pressure on business decisionmaking on the latter point according to some in industry mandatory information disclosure provisions may be more powerful force for inducing changes in some industry practices thanany of the current trading or tax mechanisms this perception is reinforced by recent study suggesting that the sara title iii disclosure requirements are strong force for industries to improve their management of hazardous chemicals 3536 liability assignment the establishment of liability rules acts as an explicit incentive to businesses or individuals to modify their operations or behavior in order to avoid paying judgements to partieswho may be damaged as result of failures to meet standards or other regulations this tool hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs48 been used extensively for disposers of h azardous chemicals under th financial responsibility provisions of both superfund and the resource cons ervation and recovery act at the state level an example is connecticuts 1982 potable drinking water law which follows the principleof strict liability for groundwater c ontamination while this tool has been used aggressively in recent years it typically does not require the innovation and institution building that the mechanisms describe d above do as such liability assignments impose contingent costs on businesses in order to induce behavioral changes toavoid such costs liability assignment can thus serve as an alternative to more directintervention the implementation issues in liability assignment are complex and the subject of extensive analysis in the legal and economic professions general issues in implementation may include how favorable the conditions are for commercial insurance market to develop in order for regulated businesses to balance ri sk minimization with affordable financial protection in the event of an accident in particular thin markets with limited riskexperience may limit the availability of commercial insurance which would createespecially difficult compliance problems for smaller businesses which cannot selfinsure how much the liab ility exposure is to financial risks beyond financially feasible preventive and insurance capabilities how targeted the lia bility assignment is to aspects of business which will produce improvements in environmental management how detectable violations of standards are that would trigger enforcement and liability obligations best management practices one other marketconditioning tool is best management practices used most often in conjunction with farm programs these are ttempts to educate users on operational practices that minimize wastage and that promote broade r land use or environmental benefits some environmental management issues particular ly in the area of nonpoint source water pollution related to fertilizers toxics and pesticides stem in part from relatively low input costs compared to the value added by their use u nder circumstances where labor is expensive and such inputs are cheap there is little incentive to manage the use of such substances preciselythis is particularly the case if such changes increase labor costs and competitors do not followsuit ideally education on best management practices can produce operational savings that morethan offset additional costs or inconvenience of such changes without that incentiveoperational changes that reduce the use of environm entally harmful substances or that alter other operational practices are not likely to be accepted voluntarilyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs49 current us approaches experience with market based programs to this point reflects efforts to fit practical approaches to evolving environmental and natura l resource management problems most current environmental protection policy as reflected in the main federal laws is based foremost onprotection of public health on use of existing administrative structures and facility permittingprocesses on predictability in implementation and on reasonable consistency of effort forsimilar classes of regulated entities there are any number of ways to classify the various current markettype approaches however the publicsector management perspective described previously offers frameworkthat bears on what has ultim ately been authori zed by congress and implemented by the responsible agencies current marketbased programs are grouped here by the following policy objectives achieving regionallocal regulatory efficiency meeting national pollution reduction or phaseout requirements through trading and internalizing social costs through nonregulatory means achieving regionallocal regulatory efficiency examples in this category include various refinements to the implementing regulations under the clean air and clean water acts these refinements serve to ease the burden onindustry by increasing the flexibility of comp liance the environmenta l protection agencys air emissions trading program is the most often citedexample in the us in the water areaprograms for the fox river in wisconsin and dillon reservoir in colorado have beenestablished emissions trading program within the commandandcontrol structure of the clean air act caa epa has attempted over the years to introduce some flexibility to the implementation process before passage of the1990 amendments epa developed four marketbased schemes to assist polluters in meeting therequirements of the caa at less cost these are referred to as offsets bubbles banking andnetting offsets the offset policy resulted from the pending failure of many regions to achieve the national ambient air qua lity standards naaqs by 1977 in 1976 epa faced with the prospect of pl acing construction ban on new sources in nonattainment areas proposed to allow new sources to be located in nonattainmentarea if the new sources installed best available control technology bact and obtained offsets from other facilities in the area so that the areas aggregate emissionsof the offending pollutant declined in effect the policy reduces pollution at existingsources by making the owners of prospective new facilities pay for the reduction httpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs50 placing the cost burden on new clean facilities rather than on existing sources which are polluting is one criticism of the offset policy by making new facilities moreexpensive modernization and technological advancement is impeded in thismanner the offset policy does not reverse the regulatory systems bias against newsources as manifested in the new source performance standards nsps bubbling in 1979 epa proposed bubble sche bubbling permits facility with multiple emission sources to sum those sources and treat them as singlesource hence the owners are free to achieve necessary reductions at anycombination of the f acilitys emission sources as l ong as the aggregate reduction is achieved the bubble is generally applicable only to existing sources and nointerpollutant bubbling is allowed proposals to expand bubbles for examplebetween plants or between new and ol d sources are highly controversial banking in 1979 epa promulgated regulations to bring the offset policy in conformity with the 1977 amendments third emissions trading scheme bankingwas included in the regulations banking permits an emission source to save orbank any emission reductions that were in excess of its regulatory requirementthese banked reductions called emission reduction credits can be used by thefacility at later date or sold in permitting the buying nd selling of emission reduction credits banking facilitates the use of the first two trading schemesoffsetsand bubbles previous to the 1977 amendments epa attempts to introduce banking were declared illegal confiscation of emission reduction credits not used immediately wasconsidered more rapid means of achieving the national ambient air qualitystandards naaqs the specific guidance given areas by the 1977 amendments was declared compatible with banking banking is important because it provides mechanism for polluters to effectively use the offset and bubbling schemes discussed above also banking provides someincentive to overcontrol that is to control emissions more than the minimum legalrequirement opponents of banking feel that in nonattainment area maximumreductions should be mandated until compliance is achieved therefore there should be excess reductions to bank netting most analyses of trading schemes indicate that netting has resulted in the greatest cost saving to industry netti ng began in 1974 and permits an existing source to undergo major modification without invoking the nsps requirement ifthe facilitys aggregate emissions do not increase since under nsps new or major modified sources must meet stringent requirements nettings ability to reduce apotentially significant control cost can result in significant savings to facilitysowner httpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs51 37for example for

development and implementation of trading schemes in the us have had rocky road for variety of reasons37 the clean air act is focused on protecting human health with an adequate margin of safety and achieving this goal as rapidly as possible the acts primaryconcession to economics is only requiring nsps uniformly for new sources and not requiringsuch stringent controls on existing sources in attainment areas in some highly polluted areas these health standards require very substantial pollutant reductions which coupled with th tight deadlines leav little room for flexib ility and therefore involve the greatest cost it could be argued that in nonatta inment areas if additional reductions can be found at source to offset emissions at another source then the first source should be required to meet that lower emission level and offset granted the urgency of the problemrequires maximum reductions indeed the courts used variations on this argument to prevent bubbling and netting in nonattainment areas previous to the 1977 amendments summary of emission trading activity is shown in table 3 as indicated netting has provided the bulk of estimated cost savings resulting from the various trading schemes this isnot surprising because by netting facility is avoiding nspsg enerally the most expensive control methodcompared with obtaining reduc tions from existing sources which could use means other than nsps to achieve reductions offset experience in southern california southern california is often cited as having the most well developed emissions trading market under the offsets program as noted by dwyer however only small number of firms completed trades with each other annually and such trades have been only small part ofstationary source control programs 38 the

credits actually increased because many firms did not know they were eligible to receive creditscredits representing almost 2000 tons of air emissions have been traded since implementing the1990 amendments to the scaqmd program 40 as discussed later in the report the increasing sanctions for noncompliance in the 1990 clean air act amendments and its comprehensive permit program appear to have increased the attractiveness of the emissions market to industry41 experience with the offset program as dwyer observes provides valuable insights for efforts to establish more effective emissionstrading market in southern california he notes that the efforts to mix command and controlregulations with emissions trading in the offs et program reduced supply and demand increased transactions costs and increased uncertainty about the security of the property right to overcompliance 42 other examples of attempts at regulatory fficiency gains through trading are presented briefly in the summary discussion and tables below based on an earlier report by hahn andhester 43 direct discharge permit trading as described in table 4 this trading system for paper mills and other dischargers in wisconsin has been effect since 1981 it initia lly appeared to hold pr omise for reducing waste treatment costs of paper mills and municipal wastewater treatment plants for meeting river waterquality standards however control costs proved to be lower than expected and with oneexception trades have taken place 44 restrictions on trading the time required to get state approval and

nonpoint sources hasoccurred which was not expected as part of the program the tarpamlico river nutrient strategy north carolina the newest example of trading system for water quality control purposes is being undertaken in the tarpamlico river basin of north carolina nutrient management strategyis being pursued in this region to address accelerated eutr ophication problems the goal of the strategy is to implement the concept of nutrient trading to accomplish an overall reduction in phosphorus and nitrogen by allowing certain point source dischargers to contribute costsharing funds to reduce loadings fromagricultural runoff in september 1989 the north carolina environmental management commission classified the tarpamlico as nutrientsensitive water nsw based on assessments of low

nutrient reduction goal of 206000 kilograms per year from point sources discharging into the river basinto allow for anticipated increased flows to wastewater treatment plants in the basin by 1995meeting this reduction goal would have required those point sources to reduce nutrient dischargesbelow 1986 levels and incur significant capital and operating expenses in the process

state the environmental defense fund and local environmental group entered into pointnonpoint source trading agreement with coalition of one private and 13 municipal dischargers the tarpamlico basin association under the terms of the agreement point source dischargers that are members of the association are jointly respons ible for meeting steadily decreasing total nutrient limit over fiveyear period rather than having individual nutrient permit limitsenforced association members may achieve this overall nutrient limit by reducing their own effluent levels by trading individual discharge levels among themselves or by paying fixed cost 56per kilogram to fund that implements nonpoint source controls through the states agriculturalcostshare program the fixed cost amount is based on the average nonpoint source control cost in the tarpamlico area and includes safety factor of 31 forcropland control measures and 21 for confined animal operations 46 safety factor is incorporated at least until act ual reductions from nonpoint source controls are better quantified the major responsibility for implementing the strategy is assigned to the association through three broad requirements it must provide funding approximately 400000 fo r the development of nutrient model for the river to better define the relationship between nutrient loading and

waste disposal by several dozen paper mills where required abatement technology had not brought the river up to regionalquality goals history 1972 water pollution control act authorized epa to set standards for water quality with states establishing permit systems for individual discharges 1981 wisconsin established program to allow point sources of wastes which cause biological oxygen demand on the fox river to trade discharge rights mechanism state discharge permits which established the initial llocation of discharge rights set limits for the entire plant rather than individual sources within the plant trading is allowed only if the facility buying the rights is new is expanding production or cannot meet the discharge limits in its permit even with use of the required abatement technology acquiring firm must demonstrate to the state that the additional discharge is needed traded rights must be effective for minimum of one year and cannot be effective for more than the remaining term of the sellers discharge permit which is five years for trades to be approved permits for both parties must be modified which can take minimum of 175 days when permits are renewed there is guarantee that discharge rights which were sold will be reassigned to permit holder trades for which the sole justification is cost savings are prohibited results only one trade has taken place between paper m ill which shut down its treatme nt operation and traded the discharge permit to municipal wastewater treatment facility which then began taking the mills waste water while there has been some inte rest in trades between mills additional exchanges have occurred conditions affecting the program difference between life of traded permits maximum of five years and the normal life of capital investments in treatment facilities reduces incentives for trading minimum of one year on trades also limits seasonal flexibility further reducing incentives for potential exchanges lengthy

abatement and thus achieve greater reduction in phosphorus to the reservoir by allowing point sourceseg municipal treatment plants to trade discharges among themselves or also pay forreduction of nonpoint sources to allow the area to avoid treatment capacity constraints on local economic growth history dillon reservoir was becoming eutrophic overenriched in the early eighties due to discharges from sewage treatment plants and from nonpoint sources septic systems and urban runoff even if point sources could be reduced to zero phosphorus from nonpoint sources would still result in eutrophication the reservoir is both major source of water supply for denver and is also important to summit county as part of its recreationbased economy in 1984 coalition of governments and private interest s adopted plan requiring that advanced treatment techniques be applied to point sources and that nonpoint sources new after 1984 be required to use controls to minimize phosphorus waste loads the plan included provisions which allow trading of rights to discharge phosphorus among various sources generally cost of reductions for nonpoint sources are lower than for point sources for example the incremental cost for removing one pound of phosphorus at wastewater treatment plant in summit c ounty is estimated to be 860 compared to 119 for nonpoint sources trading mechanisms point sources are allowed to acquire discharge rights in excess of the amounts allowed under the plan rights can be acquired from point sources or from nonpoint sources existing before 1984 trading ratios are 1 to 1 for point sources and 2 to 1 for point sources acquiring rights from nonpoint sources to provide margin of safety in light of uncertainty about nonpoint sources controls to implement the trade between point and nonpoint s ources point sources agree to pay for and install phosphorus reductions at nonpoint sources acquiring property right by the credit they get for phosphorusreduction results one trade to date involving developer paying for sewering of some septic systems waste load allocations set in the 1984 plan have growth margins for point sources thought to be sufficient through 1990 after which trading for reductions from n onpoint sources w ill be the only way to accommodate future municipal waste loads cost savings are uncertain but trading will allow continued economic growth conditions affecting the program few apparent restrictions on trading though transaction costs are not yet known long term concern is proper maintenance of measures involved in trades especially nonpoint source controlshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs58 47ibid p 3 48personal communication john c hall kirkland cody april 27 1993 provide funding 133 million over five years fo r implementation of

to expand prior to 1995 provide 150000 to the state for the division of soil and water conservation to administer implementation of the bmps the state will enter into contracts withfarmers to carry out designated bmps in addition dischargers in the association were required to perform engineering evaluations at their plants to determine operational or minor capital improvements that couldmeet desired nutrient levels ironically this initial step led the association members to staybelow the states nutrient limits every year since the agreement was signed by means of makingrelatively inexpensive operational changes instead of additional capital investments thusbecause the point sources dischargers have been able to reduce their own pollution dischargesat relatively low cost they have not yet had need to formally trade for nonpoint source credits 47 however as facility growth occurs the need for trading is likely to become more important andfunding has been contributed for the agricultural bmps in anticipation of that happening as an incentive for all point source dischargers to join the association the 1989 agreement provides that if the association fails to meet any of its requirements then all existing dischargers with design flows greater than 100000 gallons per day will be requi red to meet st ringent effluent limitations in developing the program thus far numbe r of issues have arisen including state resource constraints and the initial lack of information the asso ciation agreed to fund nutrient model for the river basin largely because none had previously existed and b ecause the state lacked expert resources to produce model th at would identify nonpoint sources quantify their impact and determine the relative effectiveness of controls48 generic implementation issues faced in this case included how to establish the price for the trading system ie the trading ratio of nonpoint source controls that point source dischargermust undertake in order

large refiners and onethird of small refiners created and banked rights during 1985 roughly equal proportions of small refiners bought and sold lead rights suggesting that not all small refiners had

have been duponts followthrough on its recent announcement that it would stop producing all cfcs year ahead of the required january 1 1996 deadline since du ponts production represents half of

quantities up to its allowance were ordered from it internalizing social costs throughnonregulatory means some indirect marketbased approaches offer ways to lessen intrusive and costly regulations while meeting environmental manage ment objectives in practice however such techniques have been tried sparingly to date or applied for reasons other than environmental protection cfc tax the tax on cfcs is the only current example of taxation of pollutant at sufficient levels to cause apparent change in behavior while observers suggest that the tax has had an effect oncfc phaseout pace most see the tax more as way to capture windfall revenue in situationof tightening supply 59 after severalyearlong debate on whether an auction system or fee or tax would be preferable tax was first placed on

cfcs became subject to both production quota decreasing over time and tax increasing over time the mandated phased decreases in production volumes for products whose markets have been growing at up to 10 per year has led to increased cfc prices cfcs cost about 60 cents per pound before the phasedown began they now cost about 2 per pound prior to applicationof tax the tax began in 1990 at 137 per pound mu ltiplied by the ozone depleting factor odf which for cfcs is either 10 or close to it it is now 335 per pound scheduled to risehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs67 61taxes in some applications

preregulation prices61 by the end of 1991 cfc production was down to 60 of 1986 levels by the end of 1992 it was down to under 50 of 1986 levels looking back on this history from the vantage pointof 1993 this rapid phasedown of production is remarkable given the perception in 1987 that the best that could be done was 50 by 1999 clearly both government and industry have beenaggressive in forcing change in number of cfcdependent industrial sectors which thoughtuntil the ozone depletion concern arose that they had found nd were using cheap safe high performance products the role of the cfc tax in causing this major change to happen appears to have been more important in some industrial sectors than others its impact has been greatest where the cfc costis itself the major cost factor with decreasing impact where capital cost of the cfcusingequipment or of the manufactur ing facilities where cfcusing equipment is produced is large other factors are cost and availability of effective substitutes cost of design changes needed toconvert to the substitutes when the needed design changes are know n and the cost complexity and development time when the knowledge needed for design changes must be developed for example when cfcs cost 60 cents pe r pound most substitute foamblowing agents were more costly the rising costs of cfcs has made these substitutes competitive processingequipment changes needed are relatively minor in some electronics and other cleaningoperations waterbased solvents can be made effective enough at costs below those of cfcsmethyl chloroform or carbon tetr achloride including the tax th ere appears to be little doubt that the tax has accelerated the adoption of substitutes in many of these applications and is positive factor in looking forward to the likelihood that the produc tion phaseout by 1996 will not cause major sectoral dislocations where cfcusing equipment is being serviced the combination of impending regulations technician training programs and increasing cf c cost has led to rapid penetration of cfc capturing equipment examples are auto and building air conditioning service operations cfcsare still used but eventually perhaps half to two thirds of the volumes needed will be generatedthrough recovery reclaiming and recycling the tax has provided cost basis for the creationof some reclaiming operations sooner than w ould the price rises through production phasedown alone however the regulatory program is the pr imary driving force as evidenced by the rising cost of service not only are the makeup refrigerants more expensive but the recoveryequipment must also be paid for where cfcusing equipment is being produced refrigerators and air conditioners for example producers are required to redesign the equipment and develop new lubricants to be compatible with the substitute refrigerants the process of developing the refrigerants andtesting out the design changes is critical in these applications the tax is not as important as thecfc production phaseout schedule in accelerating the development schedule another delayingfactor here however is the pressure against hcfcs whose limited future lifespans limit theirentry into some equipment lin while other substitutes fu tures are clouded by among other considerations uncertainties in the epa process of granting approval it is not certain that forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs68 62 south coast air quality management district form c summary of emissions and determination of fees for plant premises for calendar year 1987 angeles californiarefrigerators and room air conditioners in particular there will be smooth transition to alternatives when the phaseout deadline passes where cfcusing equipment is currently in use the cfc price including tax is not high enough to force retrofit to noncfc products following any individual need for service callthere appears to be minimal impact from the tax examples are chillers in grocery storesbuilding air conditioners auto air conditioners and refrigerators in these uses the cfc pricewould have to be great deal higher than it now is to force economicsbased decisions to retrofit more critical driving force in favor of retrofit is the cost of finding slow leaks and the growing unwillingness of service companies to t op off rather than find the leak some companies with multiple pieces of equipment and on replacement schedules as part of their preventive maintenance pm program s are replacing cfcusing equipment when its scheduled life has expired with noncfcusing equipment currently mostly using hcfc22 and banking the salvaged cfcs this is not ta xdriven however but p rudencedriven since the pm schedules have long time horizons which incorporate postphaseout years when supplies of cfcs needed for servicing may well not be available at any price private citizens commercial building operators and small businesses however do not appear to be thinking in such long time frames for them the current cfc price even thoughperhaps 10 times as high as it was five years ago is not high enough in itself or as signal ofthings to come to cause action the tendency of these groups to resist retrofit today in favor ofthe hope that there will be pe nalty tomorrow is causing some obs ervers to predict state of nearchaos in late 1995 and the first several years after the phasedown is complete the tax oncfcs would have to be significantly higher today than it is to affect this posture according tothose actively involved in trying to accelerate retrofit higher tax on the other hand mightlead to increases in prices fo r substitutes and thus an economic drag rather than an increase in driving force for retrofit in sum the cfc tax has clearly accelerated the rate at which cf c uses are being substituted for and the rate at which cfcs are being recovered for reuse the tax has also achieved one otherpurpose it has increased us treasury revenues cumulative

environmental protection energy conservation and farm profitability interactivepublic and farmer education and applied studies on best appropriate technology for chemical use efficiency and reduction the original form of the legislation would also have imposed 1tax on pesticides sales as revenue source for res earch in the end the legislation increased the registration fee for pesticides and dealer licensing fees with the revenues going also to theagricultural management account it has been suggested that the resistance to the tax reflecteda fear that it would place iowas farmers at competitiv disadvantage implyi ng that this policy should be considered at the national level 80 in late 1993 an expert panel examining opport unities to manage farm ing systems so as to protect soil

itiatives to comprehensiv ely address soil and water problems the report urged exploration of taxes on agricultural chemicals fuel heavy tractors moldboard plowsirrigation water and ot her inputs that can be related to soil and water quality degradation from agricultural production practices 82 relatively low taxes on nutrient and pesticide inputs would substantially augment current programs says the report one percent 128 million of the annual 1990 expenditures of 128 billion on pestic ides and fertilizers for example is more than 65 percent of the total 1992 expenditures on costsharing under the agriculturalconservation program nd more than 18 times the total 1992 expenditures on the water quality incentive program 83 federal agricultural support programs the level and distribution of use of agrichemicals is strongly influenced by national agricultural policies and programs84 f r example price support programs can discourage multiyear cr op rotations that would diminish the use of pesticides because of requirements to maintain base acreages in supported crops like corn that require intensive agrichemical use and by keeping support prices high on such crops as corn higher rates

been observed that in the us given current cropping and agrichemical use patterns about 40 of the revenues of any general agrichemical tax would be paid by corn farmersleading one analyst to conclude since the corn belt suffers from widespread ground watercontamination and since corn farmers also receive large portion of government supportpayments tax on agrichemicals may help solve several problems at once fleming p 129farmers adopting environmentally desirable practices provisions in the 1990 farm bill reaffirmed the general structure and direction of compliance while adding number of newprograms that could provide related environmental benefits especially improved water quality current compliance requirements do not specify practices designed to protect groundwater but some are suggesting movement in that dir ection and new conservation planning requirements could strongly reinforce this movement another option which may be discussed in future farmbill debates is removing or reducing price s upports which would tend to remove or diminish one incentive for farmers to maintain high agrichemical use 85 the concept behind this and related proposals would be to change agricultural economics in ways that encourage farmers to choose in response to price signals or income expectationsmanagement practices for agrichemicals thatare more efficient and result in less intensive agrichemical use however if subsidies arereduced incentives to be in compliance will also decline suggesting the need of alternativetools 86 wetlands mitigation banking wetlands provide significant benefits to society in the form of fish and wildlife habitat water quality protection and water flow regulation however the nation continues to losewetlands at an estimated rate of 290000 acres pe r year while portion of these losses results from natural forces the largest share results from mans activities protection of wetlands from development impacts has been implemented through regulation at the federal and state levels compensatory mitigation has been required of developers whoseprojects cause unavoidable adverse impacts developers have complained about both the costsassociated with compen satory mitigation and about costly delays resulting from regulatory and permit programs wetlands mitigation banking is relatively new natural resource managementconcept which provides for the advanced compensation of unavoidable wetland losses due todevelopmental activities through mo re costefficient and potentia lly more publicly beneficial means mitigation banks are established by formal agreement between jurisdictional resource agencies and mitigation bank sponsor genera lly private landowner or public agency the sponsor creates restores or enhances wetlands or wetland functions and in return receives credits for the habitat enhancement or other public benefits which are determined to result from thatwork these credits may be drawn upon hence debiting the account in order to fulfill wetland mitigation requirements for development impacts at other locations generally within the samehydrologic unit or habitat area the credits may be used by the sponsor or sold to other permit applicants in general banks fit into two cate gories dedicated banks whose principal objectiveshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs76 87 reppert richard institute for water

them high marks because of the degree of efficiency and predictability they bring to the permit review processothers including some federal and state res ource agencies and conservation groups contend that wetlands restoration and creation efforts have not been uniformly successful thus callinginto serious question the basis for providing credits from the bank these and otherimplementation issues

reducing exposure8990 first for list of chemicals known to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity businesses must explicitly warn people if the business is knowingly not keepi ng exposure below defined minimumrisk level businesses may exceed the level but they must tell the publicthey are doing this and give the chemical dose this provision provides two incentives one toconsumers to examine what it is they are buyi ng compared to another product the second to businesses to participate actively in the rapid definition of what the minimumrisk level for thechemical should be this latter incentive is in direct contrast to current regulatory systems wherethose regulated have incentive to fight definition of safe levels as long as possible in thecalifornia case businesses want to be able to market their pr oducts against competitors they therefore have every incentive to have the minimumrisk level determined quickly and to staybelow it in order to avoid the warning label th is reversal of the burden of proof has powerful effects instead of regulators having to prove th at manufacturer is above the line of safety now the manufacturer has to prove that it is below the safe level second for the same list of chemicals businesses are prohibited from discharging any of them to drinking water while this is regulatory mandate the law does not require proof thata drinking water source has been irretrievably damaged or that somebody has developed canceras result of discharges the provision shifts regulation to prevention before contamination canoccur three enforcement of the provisions is in creased by allowing citizen and public defender suits with plaintiffs receiving percentage share of any fines that are levied for violations this provides strong incentives for producers to self police their operations ra ther than waiting for regulatory enforcement under mo re traditional systems httpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs78 91 see for example schmidt joseph w jr new

submit negativedeclaration or hazardous substances cleanup plan to the new jersey department ofenvironmental protection as precondition for the closure transfer or sale of the property failure of the

significant effects on the real estate and banking industries as well as the industrial operations that generate hazardous wasteextensive literature on the problems include uncertainties over coverage disagreement over whattriggers ecra and the time the regulatory and approval process takes 91 although this state act remains controversial one of its main effects has been to shift the initial cost and burden of proof for environmenta l audits from the buyer to the seller thus an incentive has been created for i ndustrial facilities to liminate improper practices in the disposal of hazardous wastes in order to ease fu ture sale or transfer of assets liability assignment toxics implementation of both superfund and the res ource conservation and recovery act relies in part upon financial respons ibility requirement under which disposers of hazardous chemicals have to demonstrate that they can handle the costs of corrective action treatment storage anddisposal facilities must also s

subsequent amendments under these laws regulation and enforcement have focused on the 6000 treatment storage anddisposal facilities fo r hazardous waste while substantial progress has been made as result of this program other aspects of solid waste disposal eg i ndustrial nonhazardous waste facilities have been neglected even in the hazardous wa ste program it has become clear that there are limits to what can be accomplished by focusing on the disposal end of the process at somepoint attention needs to be placed on the waste generators but here one immediately encounters practical difficulty the number of actors whose behavior one seeks to change is extremely larg hazardous waste is generated by approximately 650000 tities including gas stations dry cleaners school s photo developing labs and others and small amounts of hazardous waste in products such as paint batteries pesticides and cleaning solvents are gene rated by near ly 100 million entities including households office buildings commercial establishments and institutions there is conceivable enforcement mechanism that can address the large number of entities generating solid and hazardous waste thus some attention continues to be focused onapproaches that provide incentives to reduce waste generation or to manage wastes in moreacceptable ways such as depositrefund systems in addition to beverage containers deposits and refunds have been applied to auto batteries and to pesticide containers in maine 92 beverage containers most new proposals for depositrefund systems are based on the experience of ten states with regard to beverage container deposits states with refund systems for beverage containersgenerally referred to as bottle bills report that 7297 of deposit containers are returned forrecycling even though consumers are not required to return the containers the ec onomic incentive 5 or 10cent refund per container is sufficient to produce the desired behaviorcomparable data are

battery when selling new one or to collect deposit from the customer some have proposed national sy stem that would include deposits at both the manufacturing and retail stages with redemption cen ters for consumers to reclaim their deposits redemption centers would reclaim deposits fro m manufacturers to close the financial loop95 one possible issue in depositrefund program is the unintended incentive the deposit may have for theft some speculate that too large deposit may make it worth while to steal batteriesfor redemption this could be countered by requi ring proof of purchase but such record keeping raises the inconvenience level thus reducing the incentive to return batteries along similar linesinconvenience in the ava ilability and proximity of return points for used batteries would limit program effectiveness unless the deposit were fficiently high in the above proposal unless the redemption centers were coordinated and linked to the existing autoparts retail system itwould seem that consumer inconvenience could work against program effectiveness actual experience suggests however that these problems can largely be solved ten dollar returnvalue is only for buying replacement battery so there is incentive to steal retailers takethe old batteries in trade solving the convenience problem pesticide containers since 1985 maine has required deposits on limited and

ground raising important questions about implementation achieving regionallocal regulatory efficiency marketable permit programs in the angeles area californias south coast air quality management district scaqmd has been leader in developing and implementing innovative re gulatory strategies often including economic incentives since 1976 the district has been operating an emissions trading system for offsetting new modified or relocated sources of air pollu tion as part of the new source review program scaqmd recently adopted regulations to implemen t an emissions trading program as means of achieving further emission reductions from stationary sources background in october 1990 scaqmd began development of new marketable permits program calledthe regional clean air incentives market reclaim after three years of debate publichearings and rule revisions the reclaim program was adopted in october 1993 the rulesgoverning the reclaim program became effective january 1 1994 the program will require stationary air pollution sources to meet specified reduction in current emissions levels any reductions beyond the required leve l will result in the generation of marketable credits the marketable permits program is intended to help the south coast airbasin meet its air quality goals while allowing industry flexib ility in accomplis hing reductions reducing compliance costs and stimulating technological pollution control i nnovations the reclaim program requires the same overall emissions reductions that the traditional commandandcontrol approach could achieve through the state air quality mana gement plan aqmp air pollution sources can meet required reductions through the method of their choice includingpurchasing traded emissions installing polluti on control equipment or changing production processes or products to prevent pollution the emissions trading pr ogram will apply to 390 facilities that are majo r sources of nitrogen oxides x emissions in addition 41 of these facilities will make up second market for sulfur oxides sox emissions although there ar currently 24000 permitted fac ilities in the district the number of partic ipants in reclaim is limited to 390 by excluding sources emitting less than 4 tons per year of nox or sox the districts initial proposal also included market for emissions of reactive organic compounds roc the proposal to include rochttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs82 in the reclaim program was opposed by business nd industry leaders after the program was approved in october 1993 scaqmd staff began new efforts to expand the reclaim programto include roc emissions the initial emissions allocation for all facilities is determined based on historical actual emissions data including peak years of facility use after determining baseline emission ratesthe program requires annual emission reductions scaqmd is expecting an 83 percent annualreduction in x emissions and 68 percent annual reduction in sox emissions by 2010 when the reclaim program ends each facility will be issued facilitywide permit detailing allemission sources at the facility establishing emissions limits and specifying annual reduction rates credits will be issued on an annual basis to fac ilities for each pound of x or sox emissions below the level required for that year credit trading w ill be allowed without any prior approval from scaqmd as long as trades comp ly with certain geographical and seasonal constraints increased compliance monitoring will be required to ensure that emissionsreductions are being achieved and that trades are being made properly the success of the reclaim program depe nds on meeting emissions reduction targets in the district backstop provisions are necessary to ensure that the program achieves the necessaryreduction goals and that there is backsliding the reclaim program provides that facilitiesexceeding their annual emissions allocation will be required to make additional compensating reductions during the following year monetary penalties may also be applied to facilitiesexceeding their emissions cap implementation issues although emissions credit trading programs receive considerable atten tion in the literature regarding marketbased environmental incentives most of the discussion is theoretical therehas been limited experience in the united states actually implementing trading programs on thescale of the reclaim pr ogram the acid rain allowance trad ing program under title iv of the clean air act amendments of 1990 should provide implementation experience to draw onhowever few trades have been completed thus far as the reclaim program becomesoperational there are several issues regarding its implementation that should be considered compliance and enforcement increased compliance flexibility for the regulated community translates into an added enforcem ent burden for scaqmd to ensure the success of the reclaim program scaqmd must be able to verify that the regulated community ismeeting its required emissions limits or purch asing the required number of credits scaqmd must also confirm that credits have been properly generated and traded scaqmd initially proposed using sophisti cated emissions monitori ng equipment to assist in properly enforcing the program for example continuous emissions monitoring systemscems would have been used to calculate emissions of x and sox cems automatically record emissions data the data would have been electronically transmitted directly to centraldistrict computer system that would examine the data to determine facility compliancewith emissions limits and reduction rates although daily monitoring might be appropriate andcosteffective for large facilities alterna tive monitoring methods were developed for smaller facilities the monitoring requirements are now correlated with the levels of emissions at afacilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs83 to ensure that individual facilities meet their emissions caps scaqmd is relying on backstop provisions in addition to stringent monitoring pe nalties for exceeding an emissions cap will be linked to the price of reclaim trading credits this removes any incentive toviolate the emissions cap rather than purchase credits to ensure that the basin as whole is meeting its air quality goals scaqmd will institute an automated tracking system reports will show actual emissions on quarterly basis and willallow the generation of geographical emission reports the system will also track credit tradesso that scaqmd can determine whether facilitie s hold the necessary number of credits for compliance compliance and enforcement issues will become more complex if roc emissions are added to the reclaim program roc is emitted from variety of sources and products including paints coatings adhesives solvents dyes nd inks roc sources also include combustion sources such as boilers heaters internal com bustion engines kilns furnaces ovens and dryers the roc emissions from the use of product cannot be calculated unless the product labelclearly certifies the roc content if all products containing roc were properly labeled eachsource would still have to monitor the amount of each roccontaining product used and the effectiveness of any roc control equipment used in conjunction with the product scaqmd initially proposed that all products be labeled w ith bar codes that indicate the products roc content each time the product is used the bar code would be scanned and roccontent information would be electronically record ed companies would keep daily logs of roc usage roc emissions would be reported to the district on at least monthly basis more often for large sources the district considered an automated tracking system similar to the type ofaccounting system credit card companies use each source would be issued district creditcard to be used for information reporting total emissions would be tracked electronically inthe same way credit card companies track total spending balances after each purchase isrecorded the district must ensure that the method of reporting emissions is adequate and that accurate information is provided in timely manner if compliance determinations cannot be madequickly the district risks being unable to identify improper edits before they are traded and usedby another company to demonstrate compliance administrative costs and transaction costs adequate enforcement will be one of the keys to reclaims success however it must be balanced with administrative costs although theuse of cems and automated rog tracking would help ensure compliance they would alsoimpose significant costs on reclaim participants it may be difficult for reclaim to meetboth its program goals of reducing compliance costs below compliance costs of traditionalregulation and reducing emissions to level below that achieved through commandandcontrolregulation administrative costs would need to be minimized so that they do not discourageeligible facilities from participating in the market one of the largest administrative costs for the district could be the added personnel necessary for additional compliance and enforcement activities there is also an administrative costassociated with recording trades and verifying that proper transactions have occurred in addition to the districts cost of administering the program participants will incur private transaction costs associated with trading transaction costs will result from the need to locatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs84 96 much current debate concerns the potential extent and timing of climate change many argue that controls are premature pending further sc ientific research and development as noted this paper does not evaluate the extent or magnitude of the problem but rather focuses on optionsfor addressing it research and development and public education campaigns while not directly controlling emissions will inevita bly be essential components of developing and implementing any policies directed at controlling climate change 97 sec 607 title iv pl 101549trading partners the district had developed computer bulletin board that is available to the public for thepurpose of listing offers to buy or sell credits in addition two firms have announced their intention to hold private auction of reclaim credits which they hope willjumpstart the credit trad ing market the auction sponsors w ill use computer system to match buyers and sellers and to identify market clearing prices these measures s hould help limit transaction costs impacts the consequences of the reclaim progr am may be evaluated not only in terms of air quality improvements but on the socioeconomic impacts as well some are concerned thatfacility shutdowns will increase under reclaim dding to job loss in ca lifornia and damaging the states economy some businesses may have additional incentive to m ove away from the angeles area because of potential profits from the sale of emission credits earned by shuttingdown plants to ensure retention of businesses in the area the district is allowing shutdowncredits to be generated only by the 390 fac ilities in the reclaim market nonreclaim facilities will not receive credits for shutdowns meeting pollution reduction or phaseout requirements through trading tradeable permits for carbon dioxide control approaches to implementing co2 control program include 1 regulatory schemes involving efficiency standards and other mandated requirements along with financial incentivesor subsidies 2 consumption taxes carbon btu or gasoline on the various sources of co 2 and 3 emission reduction programs based on market incentives such as trading and banking of co2 credits96 these approaches are not mutually exclusive but can be used in tandem to complement each other the following discusses trading and banking background the clean air act amendments of 1990 establish allowancetrading programs to control so2 emissions and to phase out chlorofluorocarbons cfcs97 which deplete stratospheric ozone and also are greenhouse gases the two programs differ in that the so2 program provides for trading of emission allowances while the cfc program provides for the trading of production allowances of the ozonedepleting chemicals thus the cfc program creates market for the right to produce certain quantities of the controlled substances rather than for the right to emithttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs85 98 for example see daniel j dudek short discussion of greenhouse gas trading prepared for the keystone global warming dialogue policy evaluation working group august1990specified quantities of the substance paralleling the so 2 control program most proposals for co2 control focus on the actual pollutant as the basis of trading not the production rights in the emission trading approach98 potential emitters of pollutant are provided permits or allowances for specified activitythe pr oduction of hazardous product or an emission of pollutantwith each permit worth unit of production or pollution eg ton of co2 each affected facilities would be granted annual pollution perm its corresponding to its allowed level of emissions as set by legislati on or regulation emissions above the vel for which facility held permits would be permitted however facilities c ould choose to redu ce their emissions below permitted levels and ll the resulting excess permits received from those pollution reductions to others facilities w ould be encouraged to trade these permits among themselves or with others in order to find less costly wa ys of meeting the overall reduction in emissions by over controlling and selling excess perm its facilities with ec onomies of scale or generally low control costs can reduce their total costs of compliance those facilities that haveincremental control costs that are less than the price at which they could sell permits have anincentive to overcontrol proceed s from selling the excess permits m ean that the f acilitys total cost of overcontrol could be less than if it just controlled to the mandated level ideally theexcess allowances will be sold to u tilities with incrementa l control costs bove the allowances price by purchasing allowances for their emissions in excess of the standard these facilities canmeet any requirement more cheaply than if they controlled to the required level the desiredoutcome is lower total national cost for meeting the limitation than if all sources just met thestandards regardless of their differences in incremental costs if the market works efficiently pollution reductions will be achieved costeffectively current experience with the so 2allowance market is as yet insufficient to give much guidance on how well co2 permit market might work implementation issues the major economic advantage for tradeable permit program is the flexibility that the system would provide to emitters in complying with reduction goals in controlling greenhouse gases this flexibility could include options beyond reducing em issions such as increasing co2 sinks by planting forest s for example or permitting tradeoffs with controls on other greenhouse gases like methane for exampl utility could choose to capture nd burn coalbed or landfill methane which would have the effect of offsetting its emissions of co2 hence the program could provide broad range of alternatives to emitters in complying with the goals of theprogram like tax system the trading system would encourage development of costeffective control measures as trading would provide flexibility to em itters in determining what specific control to use in meeting mandated targets further characteristic of this approach is that by focusing on the quantity side of the price quantity equation it effectively limits total emissionsa characteristic that made it useful inaddressing acid deposition and that makes it attractive for greenhouse gases the option ofsimply paying the price of pollution as in tax is subject to prohibitively stiff penalties thushttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs86 99 for general discussion of emission permits versus carbon taxes in the face of uncertainty see oates wallace and paul r portney economic incentives for controlling greenhouse gases resources for the future resources spring 1991 pp 1316 100 daniel j dudek and leblanc alice offsetting new co2 emissions rational first greenhouse policy step contemporary policy issues vol 8 29 july 1990the quantity of reductions achieve d is much more certain than under tax scheme this would provide some assurance to interested parties that specific amount of co2 would be reduced or specific trend in emissions obtained for those confident that achieving specific level of co2 reductions will yield very significant benefitsenough so that even the potentially very high end of the marginal cost curve does not bother themthen regulatory system or tradeable permitprogram may appear most appropriate 99 co2 emissions would be reduced to specific level and in the case of tradeable permit program the costs involved would be handled efficientlybut not controlled at specific cost level also the program could be phasedin over time beginning with new source offset program and later expanding to existing sources if necessary 100 thus the program could begin with offset provision requiring new sources to get permits from existing sources in order to operate and expanded over time to increase reduction targets on existing sources howeverthere is also the possibility that ceiling on emissions could become floor as directeconomic incentive would exist to reduce emissions below the mandated ceiling impacts implementing even the most elementary of th is type of program raises several practical issues first the more sources involved th more complex and burdensome trading scheme becomes trading system would need the most sophisticated monitoring system of theapproaches outlined here besides determining basis for the initial allocation of creditsmonitoring systems would be needed for determining compliance and for overseeing trades forsmall diffuse sources this could be challenge for example 12 of all co 2 emissions comes from the residentialcommercial sector space heatingcooling water heating and appliances and33 from the transportation sources trucks automobiles airplanes etc designing tradeablepermit program to cover these sour ces 45 of total would be challenge if an international scope is desired the monitoring question is multiplied again second when utilities are th sources affected the tradi ng scheme may pose unresolved issues concerning the jurisdicti on of state public u tility commissions questions arise about how investments in pollution equipment verses investments in permits might be treated suchquestions are currently being asked with respect to the so 2 program with consistent answer yet third the initial allocation of permitsallowancescredits poses critical equity issues one option is to simply auction off initial allocations which could adversely affect economicallydisadvantaged participants another option is to distribute them free which requires thedevelopment of some allocation formula for example according to existing emissions orproduction yet another option is to allocate them according to complementary regulatoryscheme this initial allocation could be very complicated depending in part on the numbers ofemitters and gases included in the program i ndeed it may be more cr itical than under taxhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs87 101 the solid waste disposal act swda is frequently referred to as the resource conservation and recovery act rcra the law which substantially amended the swda in1976scheme as the permit program will generate revenue to government for potential redistribution to heavily affected areas or industries liquidity of the trading system could require government intervention in terms of auctions or as source of last resort the necessity and degree of such intervention could affect the efficiency of the system in summary the development of system where current andor future co 2 emissions allowances or permits or credits could be trad ed would introduce some of the advantages of an economic incentive program while retaining some of the certainty of regulatory system likewise implementation of tradeable permit program would be easier than many regulatory programs but more difficult than tax scheme as is discussed later recycling credits in the solid waste area solid and hazardous waste programs offer clear example of the three factors stimulating reconsideration of marketbased approaches firs t the united states is in the midst of new round of regulatory fforts that could increase dramatically the cost of traditional approaches to waste management as costs increase the need to consider more efficient waste managementmechanisms grows second existing regulat ory programs appear illconceive d to manage many of the new regulatory targets such as gas stations dry cleaners households and other small quantity waste generators whose numbers make traditiona l enforcement approaches impracticable third because of the federal budget defic it it appears unlikely that there will be increased funding for existing or new control programs spending for solid and hazardous waste programs grew more rapidly than othe r components of epas budget in the 1980s but there are still substantial backlogs of permitting and enforcement cases and little attention is being given tosome potentially major problems thus marketbased approaches have drawn interest for theirability to serve as revenue sources background during the 102nd congress more than 100 bills we re introduced to revise and reauthorize the primary federal solid and hazardous waste law the solid waste disposal act swda101 many similar bills have been re introduced in the 103rd congress these bills contain numerous examples of economic incentives for solid waste management they mostly create incentivesfor reducing the amount of waste placed in landfills collecting r ecyclable materials reusing recovered materials in manufacturing new products or purchasing products that contain recycled materials many of the sponsors of these bills be lieve that recycling is better for the environment than landfilling waste because r ecycling may preserve natural resources and conserve limited landfill space some believe that landfills are unsaf because they have th potential to leak and contaminate nearby ground water although communities and privat waste disposal companieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs88 can continue to construct new landfill capacity it is costly to meet federal and state requirements for new landfills and politically difficult to site new landfills there are more than 5000 curbside recycli ng programs currently in place nationwide up from about 1 000 in 1988 the dramatic increase in collection has lead to an oversupply of recyclable materials without corresponding increase in the demand for collected recyclablesmunicipalities and other recyclers have had difficulty identifying markets for the reuse of therecyclable materials collected many of the proposed incentive approaches aim to jump start themarkets for collected recyclab materials by equalizing suppl and demand bills introduced in congress attempt to stimulate demand where broadbased recycling markets have not thrivedeg scrap tires used oil newspapers etc series of bills aimed at improving markets for used leadacid batteries scrap tires and old newspapers was introduced in the 103rd congress the bills impose requirements on producers and importers of these products requiri ng them to recycle an amount of their product proportional to the amount of that product they produce or import the recycling percentage would be determined by epa epa would also create recycling credit system under whichrecyclers could receive credits for recycling nd producers or importers could purchase recycling credits to comply with the recycling percenta ge requirement the number of credits received depends on the method by which recovered materials are managed one method of reuse orrecycling could receive more credit than anot her to create greater incentive for using one recycling method over another for example tire producer or importer could comply with the recycling requirement by incorporating used tir rubber in the new tire manufacturing process retreading old tires or purchasing recycling credits incorporating old tires into asphalt pavement or retreading old tire casings generates twice as many credits as burning whole tire and four times as many credits as shredding tire for disposal the bills covering leadacid batteries and old newspaper contain slight variation on the credit system for scrap tires rather than setti ng an overall recycling rate as proposed for scrap tires the bills set minimum recycled content for new leadacid batteries and newsprint forexample producer or importe r of leadacid batteries could comply with the recycling requirement only by recycling old lead in the production of new batteries or by producing new batteries with reclaimed lead purchased from secondary lead smelter the third compliance option would be to purchase recycling credits from another leadacid battery producer who exceeded the minimum content requirement the main difference is that the minimum content approach encourages recycling of old newspaper back into newsprint with recycled content and the use of lead from old leadacid batteries for producing new leadacid batteries this approach does not encourage the use ofrecovered materials for anything other than the original product it would discourage alternativeuses such as exporting recovered newspapers for recycling abroad implementation issues the main assumption fundamental to the various bills is that existing markets for batteries newspaper and tires are either nonexistent or imperfect therefore requiring those responsible for producing or importing these goods to also recycle them enhances and stab ilizes existing markets or creates markets that do not currently ex ist one drawback is that in areas where these markets do indeed exist and are working these bills could interfere with the existing market byimposing an artificial market recycling activity would center around the federally specifiedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs89 recycling percentage or minimum recycled content and natural market forces that could otherwise increase recycling above that level could be suppressed in some of these industries where consumer be havior is an important part of the recycling system the effectiveness of these bills may be limited for example in the used batteryrecycling industry many manufactur ers are already using 100 percen t recycled lead in producing new batteries however even if all manufact urers used 100 percent recycled lead many used batteries would not enter the used battery collection system various proposals encourageincreased collection by mandating that retailers accept used batteries however b ecause the behavior of individual consumers is so important to the collection of batteries such proposals may not be highly effective unless collectors provi incentives to consumers for returning used batteries whether credit trading market will work depends on the ease of identifying potential market participants for items covered by these bills the number of recyclers is fairly limitedtherefore the number of credit ge nerators would also be small nonetheless brokers may be needed to facilitate trades administrative costs could be very high if credit trading market didnot develop on its own and epa had to promote trading transaction costs also need to be low high transaction costs would limit trading because it might raise the cost of purchasing credits close to the cost of compliance with the recyclingrequirement or minimum recycled content requirement the more information epa makesavailable on who has credits and who may need to purchase credits the lower transaction costs will be producers and importers must also be fair ly certain that credits will be available and that they will be available at lower price than it would cost to meet recycling requirements on theirown longterm contracts w ould help reduce uncertainty of credit price and availability credit trading system would be difficult to enforce because epa would need to be able to verify the number of credits recycling firm generates as well as whether the producer orimporter has purchased the proper number of credits epa could accomplish this throughinspections and audits of company records impacts all domestic producers and impor ters of any of the products covered by these mechanisms would be affected by the legislation major consumers such as automobile manufacturers and newspaper publishers would also be affected by the legislation the cost of producing orimporting the covered products w ould rise because of the dditional costs of purchasing recycling credits or meeting the required recycling percentages this could cause someconsumer price increases dependi ng on how large component of total product cost the recycled material was collectors of recyclable materials would see increased demand for thesecommodities and possibly increased prices pa id for them depending on supply and demand balances recyclers would also benefit by selli ng recycling credits to producers and importers these proposals could provide benefits to some industries while damaging others which industries would be affected would depend on manuf acturers choices for recycling methods for example if manufacturers find that it is cheaper and easier to recycle all used tires by making them available to the rubberized asphalt industry the tire retreading industry might sufferbecause its access to retreadable tires would be diminished alternatively if manufacturersprovided most of their scrap tires to tire burning plants both the retreading industry and thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs90 102 although this section focuses on carbon taxes much of the discussion is relevant to other tax proposalsasphalt rubber industry would be harmed this problem could be diminished by properly weighing credits given for each use by providing an incentive for the use of batteries with recycled content secondary lead smelters could gain from the implementation of this bill while virgin lead manufacturers wouldsuffer the virgin newsprint industry would so lose market share to recycled newsprint manufacturers although the trend for newsprint as well as most other manufacturers is to incorporate recycled materials into their operations these types of proposals could have an impact on existing state and local programs many states already require the management of used batteries tires and newspapers for examplealmost three quarters of the states have scrap tire laws or regulations or are considering such legislation some state and local governments may have already entered into contracts withprivate recycling operations that require the community to supply specified amount ofrecovered materials for example some local governments have contracts with rubberizedasphalt firms for the building of highways using scrap tires that require the local government toprovide specified amount of used tires if ma nufacturers must recycle tires on their own the number of tires available at municipal solid waste facilities may decline and become insufficientto support rubberized asphalt road construction projects internalizing social costs through nonregulatorymeans carbon taxes 102 background in the view of many economists carbon tax would be the most efficient approach to controlling co2 emissions pollution tax attempts to maximize net social welfare from polluting activities economists observe that pollution imposes costs on society that are not incorporated in the price of the goods or servi ces responsible for the pollution these are called external costs an ideal pollution tax internalizes these external costs by making thebeneficiary of the polluting activity pay price that accounts for the socially borne costs whenthe tax is set at the level at which the marginal costs of more controls would just equal themarginal benefits society gains by further reductions societys net welfare is maximizedpolluters finding it costeffective to reduce their emissions to avoid paying the tax would addpollution controls or take other actions to the point where further controls would cost more thanthe tax or than the benefits society would gain in the case of global warming the pollutants being taxed and the level of the tax would be based on their respective contributions to globalclimate change and on an assessment of the future damages from climate change implementation issues in practice attaining socially optimal level of control from an carbon tax may not be achievable setting the tax at the level that maximizes net social welfare would requirehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs91 103 see blodgett john health benefits of air pollution control discussion crs report 89161 enr february 1989 104 cline william r global warming the economic stakes washington dc institute for international economics may 1992 105 for example see nordhaus william d to slow or not to sl ow the economics of the greenhouse effect the economic journal 101 6 1991 pp 92037calculating external costs such as of global warming this is extremely difficult if not intractable because of uncertainties about effects the problem of monetizing impacts and other scientific and methodological problems103 for example cline has estimated the annual damage from doubling of co2 equivalent from 61 billion 1990 do llars to as high as 117 billion or possibly more104 others suggest the damage could be lower than this range105 because of this uncertainty second appro ach to setting the carbon tax has been suggested where policy decision is made to achieve stabilization or reduction in co2 by certain year for example stabilization of emissions at their 1990 levels by the year 2000 and then toestimate the tax level necessary to achieve that objective economic theory indicates that apollution tax is an efficient vehicle to minimize control costs for given level of reductionsregardless of whether the level achieves the ideal net social welfare in this sense pollutiontax is efficient because it decreases the compliance costs of individual firms by allowing themthe flexibility to ma ke the best use of information and t echnology relevant to their circumstances individual firms can determine whether it is in their interest to pay the tax or to invest inemissionabating alternatives since the tax must be paid on remaining emissions firms havea continuing incentive to innovate and find cheaper ways of reducing emissions however the tax is set it creates an incentive to reduce emissions by raising the cost of polluting hence the purpose of the tax would not be to raise revenue per although it wouldbut to induce reductions at the lowest costs achievable presumably the policy goal would beto set carbon tax at level to achieve specific level of co 2 emissions by specific dategiven the assumptions and uncertainties of predicting how particular tax level would affect activitiesemitting co 2 impacts besides being economically efficient carbon tax provides some protection against the uncertainty of carbon reduction co sts at the cost of some certainty about the quantity of pollution reduced proposed co2 reduction mechanisms present large uncertainties in terms of the perceived reductions needed and the potential costs of achieving those reductions in sensepreference for carbon tax or another system depe nds to some degree on how one views the risks and uncertainty regarding the necessity of achieving specific reduction levels versus the risks anduncertainty regarding costs if one is more uncertain about the benefits of specific level ofreductionparticularly with the potential downside risk of substantial control costs to theeconomythen carbon tax may appear most appropria in this approach the level of the tax effectively caps the marginal c ontrol costs that affected activ ities would have to pay under the reduction scheme but the precise level of co 2 reduction achieved is less certainsubject to the boundaries and uncertainties of model projections basically car bon tax resolves the pricehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs92 106 of course this is guarantee that once carbon tax level were set that it would not be adjusted in the future as desired reduction levels are achieved or not achieved 107 however substantial data needs would be required if one endeavors to measure net social costs and benefits for example to validate the achievement of maximized net social welfareversus quantity debate in favor of having more cost control over having absolute certainty of reductions106 an additional strength of tax mechanisms is that they are selfexecuting in many ways solving some of the implementation problems raised by regulatory systems for example if thetax were imposed on fuel inputs g coal oil and natural gas little additional data collection would be necessary to impose the tax cumbersome or expensive monitoring systems suchas stack monitoring would be necessary to determine emission levels and potential taxliability 107 other transaction costs such as tracking credits under tradeable permit program would be unnecessary once set up legal challenges and the delays resulting from legalproceedings might lessen this would be particularly true if farther down the line it were decidedthat increased reductions in co 2 were necessary with carbon tax system focus would be on changing the tax rate compared with tradeable credit program where concern about legal rights and takings or disruption of any credit mark et or corporate compliance planning could be involved like tradeable permit system carbon tax system could also stimulate developmentof wide range of costeffective control meas ures as specific reductions would be determined by the balance between control costs and the tax rather than limited by specific reductionsmandated under regulatory system however in some ways tax system merely changes the forum rather than the substance of implementation issues b ecause paying carbon tax becomes an alternative to controlling emissions the debate over the amount of reductions necessarily becomes debate over the taxlevel imposed those wanting large reductions quickly would want high tax imposed over ashort period of time those more concerned with the potential economic burden of carbon tax would want low tax imposed at later time with possible exceptions for various eventscarbon taxes would remain basically an implementation strategy policy determinations such astax levels would require politicalregulatory decisions climate change is also global problem making at least some international cooperation on strategies desirable current european efforts to begin addressing co 2 emissions focus on carbon tax or hybrid carbon taxenergy tax the european community ec had proposed 3 per barrel of oil equivalent tax beginning in 1993 rising to 10 per barrel by 2000 fiftypercent of the tax would be imposed on ergy production including nuclear power except renewables fifty percent of the tax would be based on carbon emissions this choice of hybrid tax reflects concern within the ec that energy efficiency be promoted as an explicit goal andconcern within the environmental commun ity about promoting nuclear power alt hough any us carbon tax would not necessarily be identical to an ec levyeven if the reduction goalswere comparableusing the same general approach would make discussions of comparabilityor reciprocity easier final consideration is that carbon levy w ould raise money for example the proposed ec tax is estimated to raise about 63 billion annually by the year 2000 what governments choose to do with that money would have some influence on the macroeconomic effects of co

thanrelated areas such as air pollution control two basic options are the focus of much of theattention effluent charges which put price on each unit of discharge and tradable permits ofthe sort already endorsed in diverse regions such as the tarpamlico river basin of north carolinaand the dillon reservoir in colorado see discussions in previous section of this report effluent fees or charges

toxicity of wastewater background economists argue for effluent fees as way to internalize external social costs and well designed fee or charge system should incorpor ate evaluation of potential benefits avoided damages in structure that accurately accounts fo r all sources of those damages in the 103rd congress legislation has been introduced that would impose effluent fees on industrial wastewater discharges in orde r to generate revenue for wate r quality programs hr 2199 and hr 2255111 the legislation proposes to raise 2 billion annually by asse ssing charge on specified group of chemicals 300 toxic and thr ee conventional pollutants released to surface water by industrial direct dischargers and indirect dischargers companies that discharge wastesto municipal sewers for treatment by the local sewerage utility throughout the united states the legislation has dual objectives specified revenue goal for water quality programs raisedthrough polluter pays fee system under the proposal the pollutants are grouped in five categories consisting of base group and four other groups that reflect increasing toxic ity to aquatic life and human health fee rate is established for each of the five categories that would be applied to actual loadings ordischarges of the individual chemicals toxicity characteristics developed by epa inconnection with standard setting under the clean water act yield toxic weighting factor foreach pollutant and hence means of ranking and grouping the chemicals according to theirrelative toxicities implementation issues two key issues associated with the proposals are identifying which chemicals would be subject to effluent fees and determining the rate or rates applicable to discharges of those chemicals discharge fee can be applied most easily to discharges from point sources sincethe discharges can be accurately measured or cal culated measurement or calculation based on actual or estimated discharges is essential also important is basing the proposal on ascomprehensive list of chemicals as possible so that all pollutants with potential for causingenvironmental harm are made subject to the same manner of incentives to reduce damages the chemical list in the legislation includes three conventional pollutants total suspended solids biological oxygen demand and oil and greas because discharges of these substances can impair water quality and because th ey provide reference point for relative toxicity of the other chemicals they include metals and tal compounds organic chemicals nonmetallic inorganics pesticides and acids bases and salts the toxic pollutants include chemicals fromseveral lists pollutants included in tri reporting requirements and known to be discharged tosurface waters chemicals regulated as priority pollutants under the clean water act andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs95 chemicals of more recent concern because of their potential to accumulate in living organisms and become more concentrated as they move up the food chain thr ough bio accumulation or biomagnification which are not currently covered by either tri or clean water act regulationsthis substantially addresses the issue of data set that is both comprehensive and current fundamental to the proposal is the concept that the rate of fee or charge should be tied to the environmental harm or threat of harm cause d by the discharge of the pollutants thus the toxicity of the substance is important as basis for determining the fee under the legislationtoxic weighting factors are used to rank each chemical and place it in group for purposes of determining the applicable effluent fee epa uses toxic weighting factors in the process of evaluating technological options under the indus trial point source regulatory program the analysis reflects the fact that some pollutants are more toxic than others and removal of pollutantsby one technology may be more or less effectiv than another technol ogy based on its ability to remove the more toxic chemicals weighting factor for pollutant parameter is calculated inrelation to selected standard pollutant eg copper epa has developed toxic weighting factors for 126 priority pollutants and approximately 250 pesticides but toxic weighting factors have been developed for number of chemicalslisted in the legislation thus in the proposal those chemicals were assigned proxy factor for those chemicals this results in somewhat arbitrary assignment or ranking actual toxicweighting factors if available could easily be lower or higher use of epas toxic weighting factors is an imperfect strategy for ranking the toxicity of chemicals since it does not cover all chemicals of potential interest or concern other rankingsystems might take into account range of parameters such as toxic effects acute and chronictoxicity wildlife and human health toxicity nvironmental fate persistence and exposure data detection in water and sediments inclusion of multiple parameters has the potential tostrengthen the results of chemical ranking but sufficient data in this broad array of categories andfor all pollutants of concern do not currently exist effluent fee rates under the legislation are based on the categories of chemicals their relative toxicity to one another and the amount of total revenue to be collected rate of 06cents per pound of pollutant discharge is set for chemicals in the base category group 1 whichconsists primarily of conventional pollutants and othe rs with very low toxicity each of the other categories fee rates is then established in relation to the base rate in order to reflect relativetoxicity the rate of fee for chemicals discharged in group 5 consisting of chemicals with thehighest toxicity would be fee of 6339 per pound discharged impacts the objective of the proposed industrial wastewat er effluent fee is revenue generation but if quantity and toxicitybased discharge fee program were implemented polluters residualsmanagement practices would be expected to cha nge because the fees would increase the cost to polluters of using surface waters as waste dis posal medium the changes in polluters behavior would depend on the magnitude of the fee and discharge abatement costs thus far little or noempirical study has been done on what levels of fees would result in reduced dischargeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs96 112 morton brian j ian burns jenny dempsey kristy mathews tayler bingham effluent charges and water quality preliminary assessment draft report prepared by

programs revenues for national cl ean water investment corporation report prepared for the house committee on merchant marine and fisheries subcommittee on fisheries andwildlife conservation and the environment july 1992 pp 1415faced with discharge fee the polluter has five possible adaptations 112 first the polluter can treat its wastewater to reduce the quantity and toxicity of discharges many would probablychoose this response in particular by installi ng additional control equipment second the polluter can alter production pro cesses substitution of less toxic chemical inputs or processes involving reduced wast ewater discharges which in turn can reduce the quantity and toxicity of discharges this response amounts to greater us of pollution prevention as waste minimization technique third the polluter can follow some combination of these actions fourth the polluter can simply pay the fee or charge postponing change in residuals management until the fee increases or abatement costs decrease sufficiently the revenue goalsestimated for the proposal 2 billion per year assu in fact that this will be the response of most industrial sources since the proposed fee rate for most chemicals is low enough that payingthe fee would generally have minor impact on indi vidual firms or most industry categories with the exception of the chemicals and allied products industries which acc ounted for 63 percent of tri discharges in 1990 and would pay about twoth irds of fees paid by all industries under the proposal impacts on most industries would not be significant 113 finally the polluter could reduce production or close downto the extent that revenueraising is key objective of an effluent fee rather than purely as an economic incentive to dischargers it is necessary to build into the fee system means formaking adjustments over time for example to maintain predictable revenue stream wherethat is the goal the design of the system should provide for periodic changes in the fee ratesto account for effects of inflation similarly the fee system needs to rec ognize and adjust for uncertainties in its initial design one major uncertainty could result if the fees in fact have theeffect of altering polluters actions that is if imposition of fees led to reduction in use of thechemicals and revenues were to decline while it is difficult to estimate the extent to whichchemical use would be altered the potential for reduced revenue should be considered input fees fertilizer pesticide and animal feed tax background policy interest in taxing inputs to agricultural runoff also is reflected in the same legislative proposals hr 2199hr 2255 the legislation recognizes that surface and ground waters are potentially vulnerable to contamination by various types of runoff from agricultural lands andactivities when pesticides and fertilizers are applied to crops rangeland forests urbanlandscapes and other lands they may be transported by wind rainfall runoff and infiltrationchemicals dissolved in runoff water are carried to nearby surface water or may enterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs97 groundwater through di rect infiltration as well as through sinkholes or abandoned wells another significant source of surface and gr oundwater pollution is animal waste runoff estimated to account for over onethird of all agricultural nonpoint source pollution and causingimpairments of water bodies in 32 states implementation issues this legislation would impose taxes on th ree sources of this nonpoint source pollution runoff pesticide active ingredients the nutrient content of fertilizer chemicals and processedanimal feed in order to generate revenues to support water quality programs the concept underlying the legislation is to generate revenues that would be dedicated to supporting waterpollution control programs authorized by the clean water act including projects to controlnonpoint sources of pollution it embodies the polluter pays principle of charging the polluter in some proportion to his contribution to th problem of environmental contamination or degradation those who use the most fertilizers pesticides or animal feed would pay the bulkof the cost there are about 750 actual active ingredients us ed in pesticides which would be covered by the legislative proposal and would be taxed at rate of 2427 cents per pound of activeingredient in the pesticide these active ingredients are formulated into more than 20000individual products two plant chemicals that constitute th nutrient content of fertilizers nitrogen and phosphorus are of c oncern environmentally and would be subject to the tax proposal fertilizer chem icals would be taxed at rate of 0845 cents per pound of nitrogen or phosphorus finally processed animal feed w ould be taxed at rate of 268 per ton impacts as true economic incentives the pesticide fertilizer and animal feed taxes proposed in the legislation are rather blunt instruments the principal purpose of the taxes is revenue generationand the individual tax rates were set at levels necessary to generate specified revenue goals 500million from the tax on pesticide active ingredients and 250 milli on each from the fertilizer and animal feed taxes based on production volume data used in the analysis with the definedrevenue goal of the legislation plus the relative inelasticity of demand for the three types ofproducts it is quite likely that these tax rates are set at levels that are too low to affect usesignificantly consequently any chemical use reductions due to the taxes would be an indirectresult of the legislation to be more precise economic incentive tools the tax rates might incorporate factors to reflect the degree of human health or environmental harm from the pesticide fertilizer or animalwaste runoff such as calculating something like toxicity weighting factor in the case offertilizers such calculation would need to reflect range of potential environmental damagesincluding both toxicity for example public health concerns of nitrates in groundwater and over enrichment of surface waters likewise in the case of animal feed tax rate set reflect theenvironmental and health effects of livestock wastes should account for both the pathogens and nutrients in the waste for pesticides analytic approaches to ranking the active

proposal s is uncertain there is of course strong opposition to imposing new taxes even for speci fied dedicated purposes such as pollution control programs in addition particular c oncern of those who woul d pay the bulk of these taxes the agricultural community is that under the legislation as much as 85 percent of therevenues would go to controlling nonagricu ltural sources of water pollution capital improvements to publicly owned sewage treatment works user taxes water use tax background the same legislation hr 2199hr 2255 also proposes water use tax as form of wastewater discharger fee under the legisl ative proposal commercial and industrial water use would be taxed at rate of 195 cents per thous and gallons of water used the objective of the tax is revenue generation estimated by bill sponsors to be 1 billi on per year based on 1990 water usage by those sectors with revenues to be dedicated to water pollution control programs particularly capital investments in wastewater treatment construction implementation issues the concept underlying this tax is that users of wastewater services contribute to water pollution and users benefit from the services of wastewater treatment either directly if they are connected to public sewerage facilities or indirectly if they discharge to waterways orseptage systems the tax charges the user for the privilege of discharging to waterways orgroundwater 114 water use is the basis of this tax since the quantity of water released or discharged is function of water consumed in general water use is measured even where wateris selfsupplied while the quantity of water discharged may or may not be measured particularly for discharges through public sewerage systems impacts the long run price elasticity of demand the measure of sensitivity to price changes for water has been estimated at between 05 and 08 for industrial users115 that is 10 percent increase in price would lead to drop in industr ial demand of 8 percent or

deliver water to irrigated agriculture and the disc harges or return flow from irrigation represent economic and environmental costs to society which could be better internalized through moreaccurate

mitig ation option under section 404 two bills intr oduced in the 103rd congress to amend section 404 of the clean water act address mitigation banking hr 1330 includes provision di recting that mitigation banki ng programs be established in each state under the bill these programs would provide for crediti ng contributions to the mitigation bank in land cash or inkind contributions so that persons unabl to sponsor specific mitigation projects can contribute to the bank the programs also would be required to ensurecompletion and maintenance of mitigation projects for at least 25year period and would limitactivities on wetlands that are part of mitigation bank to uses that are consistent withmaintaining or gaining significant wetlands values and functions s 1304 authorizes the us of mitigation banks within the context of appropriate safeguards in part this proposal is intended to set certain boundaries on ongoing mitigation bankingpractices to improve their operation while protecting wetlands values under this legislation thecorps and epa would issue rules governing establishment use maintenance and oversight ofmitigation banks among the requirements m itigation banks would need to ensure that consistent and scientificallysound methods are used to determine credits and debits at the site of proposed permits and sites of mitigation banks in addition fees char ged

potential remediation of project failure and other relevant factors implementation issues the proponents of mitigation banks have been thusiastic about the potential for their use in allowing development projects to proceed without costly regulatory delays and to minimizeplanning and design costs by pooling what would otherwise be several smaller mitigationundertakings in both respects

uncertainty exists surrounding the measurement of functional values none of the traditional wetlands management techniques are totally proven and all possess limitations which sometimes detract from their utility in wetlandsmitigation banking wetlands creation is regarded in scientific circles as still somewhatexperimental technique while wetlands restoration and enhancement exist as the suresttechniques for the purposes of mitigation banking the slow rate at which many wetlands actuallyreturn to the natural state or to an enhanced condition and begin to amass bankable credits hasalso been problem in several cases 119 the use of preservation as means to compensate wetlands losses is particularly contentious point am ong those who argue the pros and cons of wetlands mitigation preservation of existing wetlands areas for compensation pur poses becomes valid consideration only when it can be shown that the wetlands in the pres ervation area would be lost in the absence of preservation otherwise wetlands would not be replaced and in fact net reduction in wetlands would result further wetlands restoration or creation costs vary significantly they range fromas low as several hundred dollars per acre for restoring wetlands in the prairie pothole region ofthe central united states to tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars per acre for some coastal wetlands at the high end in particular sponsorship of m itigation banks will hinge on the perceived certainty of credit accrual impacts the administrations august 1993 policy endorsement and legislative clarification could give guidance on the establishment and operati on of banks that some observers believe is lacking if appropriately bounded wetlands mitigation banking can benefit developers by allowing economic activity to proceed more efficiently while providing realistic mechanismfor permanently preserving areas that might othe rwise not be protected banking also increases the likelihood that mitigation can be incorporated into local or regional comprehensive planning objectives on the other hand the use of mitigati on banking introduces risk into the publics environmental benefits portfolio for example financial bankruptcy of sponsor could result in breaking of wetlands management contract and curtailment of associated benefits furtherestablishment of mitigation bank can be time consuming and costly and may even introduce administrative risks into the section 404 permit review process if permit application weredenied even after resources were invested in the mitigation banking in the long run good project planning may be neglected and banked credits may be resorted to instead of avoidanceand minimization of impacts assurance bonding to reduce agricu ltural nonpoint source pollution background one method of incorporating the social cost of water pollution into dischargers decision making is to require dischargers to purchase dated assurance bonds that reflect the full value ofpotential worstcase costs to remediate environmental damage resulting from their actionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs102 120 costanza robert and charles perrings flexible assurance bonding system for improved environmental management ecological economics v 2 1990 p 69where water quality degradation could be linked directly to one or small number of agribusinesses they could be required to post assurance bonds the bond would be repaid in fullpossibly with interest at the time of maturity if the bondholder demonstrates that the potentialdamage has not occurred it would be repaid in part if some level of damage less than thepotential baseline has occurred and would be forfeited if worstcase damages are incurred this marketbased approach is designed to resolve specific problem in environmental quality reducing potential dama ges under conditions of uncertainty in the context of agricultural nonpoint source polluti on assurance bonds can facilitate interna lization of costs in several ways first the farmer is responsible for c hoosing and implementing agricultural practices that reduce water quality damages pr oviding flexibility to courage innovation by the farmer second the farmer is responsible fo r demonstrating the water quality damages did not occur thus public monitoring and enforcem ent costs could be ss than under traditional approaches third interest from the bond pool coul d also generate add itional monies for water quality protection the most stri king feature of the approach is the incentive it offers both public and private entitie s to improve the data on the envir onmental costs of economic activity 120 implementation issues an assurance bonding requirement would be administered by an appropriate public agency state water quality regulatory agencies could act as th bonding agency several c onditions could give rise to th utility of an assurance bonding approach uncertainty over availability of control technologies and methods uncertainty ove r water quality benefits derived from control efforts and uncertainty over relative contributions from different sources several types ofactivities fulfill one or more of these criteria including nonpoint source di scharges of conventional and unconventional pollutants from agricultural silvicultural mining anddevelopment activities to determine the value of the assurance bonds the bonding agency would base its decision on existing scientific information reflecting the monetary value of either repairing andrehabilitating the worstcase environmental damage or providing an alternative to normalservices such as drinking water the bonds would be required to be purchased annually for acontinuous discharge and the value of the bond could change to reflect changes in potentialdamages repair costs or inflation the bonds would be held for specified period that reflectedthe anticipated lag time in the expression of potential damage impacts potential benefits of an assurance bonding approach include giving dischargers an incentive to minimize discharges and flexibility to determine the most efficient means and levels ofcontrol while giving nvironmental agencies fficient funds to clean up damage resulting from any dischargeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs103 121 us environmental protection agency assurance bonding for nonpoint source control potential market force mechanisms to help achieve clean water mar 6 1991 pp 35 122 26 cfr 48l2aiva number of potential drawbacks also exist121 first setting the value of the bond even with the benefit of scientific information would essentially be subjective decision dependenton numerous assumptions the bonding agency could be subjected to political pressures or legal challenge to its actions thus requiring extensive administrative expense and documentation scientific uncertainty that could be expect ed in many cases creates an additional problem because there must be legal justification for withholding all or part of the bond second because it is based on the cost of remediation or replacement the value of the assurance bond would not necessarily capture the social cost of permanent environmental damage basing the value of the bond on some m easure of the value of environmental damages poses numerous methodological problems third an additional cost of the assurance bond is the opportunity cost of the capital tied up in the bond this might be unaffordable for all but the largest farmers investment tax credits for recycling historically tax credits have been used in variety of areas to encourage certain types of investment federal state or local governments could offer investment tax credits for thepurchase of recycling equipment such cred its would encourage increased private capital investment in recycling firms would be more likely to make capital investments in recyclingbecause the tax credit would effectively reduce th cost of purchasing new recycling equipment background bill that would provide 25 percent investment tax credit for the purchase of recycling equipment was introduced in the first session of the 103rd congress the tax credit would allow businesses that purchase recycling equipment to deduct 25 percent of the cost from their total taxliability recycling equipment is defined in the internal revenue code of 1986 as any equipment used exclusively to sort and prepare solid waste for recycling or in the recycling of solid waste 122 the tax credit would also be available for equipment used in processing some virgin material as long as the virgin material is less than 10 percent of the total material processed by theequipment finally the credit would be allowed for equipment used in the conversion of solidwaste into fuel or energy implementation issues if firms took advantage of the tax credit and purchased more recycling equipment recycling capacity would increase causing an increase in the demand for recyclable materialseg old newspaper glass bottles aluminum and steel cans and plastic milk and soda bottlesthe impact of increased demand on prices would depend on whether current demand for recyclable materials exceeds supply for example currently more old newspaper is collectedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs104 123 the small pieces of broken glass used to make new glass is called glass cullet the most valuable cullet is sorted by color and contains few contaminants such as glass of another coloror ceramicsthan paper mills can process because mills do not have enough newspaper deinking machinery paper mills could use the tax credit to purchas enough deinking equipment to match the current old newspaper supply causing prices for old newspaper to rise alternatively the market forhigh quality glass cullet 123 is very strong high quality culle t can be substituted for other raw materials in the glass manufacturing process and recycled glass is produced in the same furnacesin which virgin glass is made recyclers could invest in sorting equipment to produce highquality cullet and increase the supply of cullet causing prices to fall any increase in the price of recyclable materi als could be offset by increased collection to keep pace with increased demand the tax credit could be repealed when enough investment hastaken place to equalize the demand and supply of recyclable materials and when relative pricesof virgin and recycled materials have stabilized allowing the tax credit for equipment used in converting solid waste to fuel or energy would likely cause increased capital investment for incineration plants although incinerationreduces the quantity of waste landf illed it also reduces the amount of recycling if the investment tax credit is used primarily for incineration equipment the legislation could reduce the amountof waste landfilled and recycled the types of equipment eligible for the tax credit would needto be carefully defined to meet the goals of the legislation tax credit is easy to administer because it is virtually selfimplementing however one drawback is that it could be costly in terms of lost tax revenue in addition the total cost of theprogram cannot be determined in advance but depends on how many businesses purchase new recycling equipment as with any tax incentiv enforcement would rely on periodic audits by internal revenue service personnel to ensure that the credit is only applied to equipment thatmeets the eligibility requirements impacts if prices for recyclable materials increased as result of recycling equipment tax credit municipalities would benefit because waste disposal and recycling services are typically provided by local governments m unicipalities often r recycling collec tion programs at financial loss because in some areas the cost of collecting used materials is higher than the revenues thatmunicipalities receive from the sale of the recyclables munici palities that curre ntly offer only waste disposal services to their residents might begin to provide recycling services if theproceeds from the sale of recyclable materials could be used to offset the costs of collection orto make the collection of recyclables profitable businesses likely to benefit from an investment tax credit are those that are already in the recycling industry and are able to expand by pur chasing new equipment or virgin producers who can change their method of production eg by adding deinking equipment the tax credit maynot provide enough of an incentive for many new businesses to enter the recycling industryespecially because startup businesses often show income losses in early years and would notbenefit from the tax credit because they would not have any tax liability the tax credit also would not provide any benefit to businesses for investments in recycling equipment prior to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs105 effective date of the credit this puts existing firms that have made recycling investments at disadvantage relative to new firms or existing firms that could use the tax credit to expand iffew new business take advantage of the tax credit its impact would be to subsidize investmentsthat would have been made even in the absence of the credit other tax credits for recycling in addition to investment tax credits which are meant to spur long term investment there are other types of tax credits that have different goals tax credits can be developed to favor thepurchase of certain raw materials over others governments that want to encourage the use ofrecycled products could provide tax credit applie d to the value of recycled products purchased background tax credit bill introduced in the 102nd c ongress would have amended the internal revenue code of 1986 to allow newspapers credit against income tax for using recyclednewsprint newspapers would have been allo wed 15 percent tax credit on the amount paid for recycled newsprint during 1991 and 1992 the cr edit would have dropped to 10 percent in 1993 and 1994 and 5 percent in 1995 and 1996 the cr edit would have been phasedout completely in 1997 implementation issues the rationale for this policy is that publishers are reluctant to use recycled newsprint because of perceived differences in price availability or quality compared to virgin newsprint tax credit for the purchase of recycled news print makes recycled newsprint less expensive relative to virgin newsprint encouraging ne wspaper publishers to purchase more recycled newsprint when large newspaper purchasers begin to purchase recycled newsprint they enhance the market for recycled newsprint by generating greater demand as long as millscontinue to increase capacity for deinking old newspaper the increased demand for oldnewspapers would lead to increased newspaper co llection and recycling if the supply expansion were sufficient it would further drive down prices for recycled newsprint relative to virginnewsprint eventually the price differential would reach an optimal level and the tax creditwould longer be necessary some paper mills have lower costs for produc ing recycled newsprint because they are located closer to the supply of old newspaper and do not incur high shipping costs to receive recyclable materials these mills are able to sell recycled newsprint at lower prices than millslocated farther from sources of old newspaper for example some canadian mills incur highercosts because they purchase old newspaper from the united states then produce recyclednewsprint and ship it back to the united states for use by newspaper publishers tax credit thatis fixed nationally does not account for geographical differences in prices therefore theeffectiveness of the tax credit may depend on underlying regional price differences that areunrelated to the change in tax policy administration of this type of tax credit requires strict recordkeeping by newspaper publishers and newsprint producer s and manufacturers because there is other way to track sales of recycled newsprint publishers woul d need to save newsprint order receipts and newsprint producers and manufacturer s would have to record sales transactions to newspapershttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs106 another aspect of implementing this tax cred it is ensuring that the paper purchased meets the eligibility re quirements the proposal requires that newsprint c ontain at leas t 40 percent recovered fiber in order to qualify for the tax credit because it is impossible to determine therecovered fiber content of paper by inspecting the finished product enforcement would dependon mill certification as to the recy cled content of its products and inspection of the mills records similar requirements already exist for certifying th recycled content of paper purchased by the federal government in addition the number of pa per mills in north amer ica is relatively small making such inspections feasible impacts this type of proposal would be beneficial in the short run to some participants in the recycling loop coll ectors could receive higher prices for old newspape r in addition mills that produce recycled paper could experience increased sales alternatively producers of virgin newsprint could experience decline in sales whether newspaper publishers would be better off depends on the current price difference between virgin and recycled newsprint and how pri ces change in the next five years the price of recycled newsprint is currently comparable to the price of virgin newsprint thereforenewspaper publishers would gain from the tax credit because the percentage of the tax creditdecreases before being phasedout completely the incentive will become less effective in lateryears currently 28 states require newspaper pub lishers to use recycled newsprint in these states publishers benefit from the tax credit regardless of the relative prices of virgin andrecycled newsprint however the tax credit has little incentive effect in these states it merelyrewards publishers for complying with state law virgin materials tax virgin materials taxes are used to raise the cost of producing or importing virgin materials these taxes aim to make recycled materials more competitive with virgin materials or even lesscostly than virgin materials thus reducing the use of the taxed virgin material background one bill introduced in the 102nd congress would have imposed 4 percent tax on the price of any paper product sold by manufacturer producer or importer that did not meet minimum recycled content standards the minimum recycled content standards would have become morestringent over time requiring manufacturers to incr ease their use of recycled fibers each year to avoid the tax implementation issues the tax would be paid by wholesalers and reta ilers when they purchase paper products that do not contain the specified amount of recovered material the increased cost of these materialswould be passed on to consumers thus reducing demand for nonrecycled paper productsproducers manufacturers and im porters would experience reduced sales of paper products with high virgin content and would be pressured to switch to production processes that incorporate higher percentages of recovered materials httpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs107 the virgin material tax on paper products is likely to cause some substitution away from paper products to glass or plastic alternatives while it would be difficult to substitute another product for printing and writing paper it is possible to substitute lternatives for paper packaging such as plastic milk containers instead of paper and plastic shrink wrap instead of cardboardboxes because plastics are typically lighter and less bulky than the paper products they replacethe tax could decrease the amount of waste disposed for products where substitution is unlikely consumers may seek to reduce the amount of th product used for example organizations might try to use electronic mail or use more doubl esided copying to reduce their use of printing and writing paper because the tax is based on paper sales pri ces some consumers w ill shift to less costly paper products where the total amount of the ta x imposed is lower this does not however change the amount of waste generated tax based on total paper weight or volume wouldprovide more effective incentive to reduce waste the tax could be difficult to administer becau of the large number of domestic producers and manufacturers of paper products each produ cer and manufacturer would need to be able to verify the recycled content of their products as well as the postmill deinked and post consumer waste contents in addition each pr oducer and manufacturer would have to track the amount of taxable products sold in the unite d states producers and manufacturers would probably be responsible for reporting such am ounts and paying the proper tax enforcement would rely on audits performed by internal revenue service personnel to determine if the properamount of products sold was reported in additi on it is difficult to veri fy recycled content of paper products based on an inspection of paper manufacturing site applying the virgin material tax to imported products increases administrative complexity foreign manufacturers would have to know the recy cled content of their paper products and the amounts exported to the united states inspections of foreign plants to verify recycled contentclaims could not be easily conducted applying the tax would be especially difficult for foreignnonpaper products that are shipped in paper packaging such as corrugated cardboard boxesalthough the importer would be importing the pr oduct contained in the box it would have to know the recycled content of the box itsel f or pay the tax on the price of the box impacts in general manufacturers of products using virgin materials are made worse off by this legislation and manuf acturers of products that substitute for virgin materials ar made better off where recycled paper products ar competitive with virg in counterparts th tax would increase the demand for recovered paper driving up the prices paid to collectors for used paper becausemunicipalities often provide community collection services for recovered material they wouldbenefit from higher prices paid municipalities are likely to expand recycling programs inresponse to higher prices unit pricing many local governments have in stituted policies that provide individual households with incentives for reducing waste generated and increasing recycling these policies ensure thatwaste disposal charges reflect the actual cost of disposal typically households are charged fixed fee for solid waste collection or an unknow n portion of general revenues are used to pay for waste disposal neither of these methods of paying for solid waste management allows wastehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs108 124 gale diana h seattle case study in system planning resource recovery december 1988 p 31 125 robert bracken north carolina county institutes sticker system biocycle february 1992 p 37generators to understand the impact of their behavior on waste management costs unit pricing is method of pricing waste disposal servi ces based on the amount of waste discarded background some municipalities sell speciallymarked garbage bags in local stores at price that includes the cost of waste disposal only garbage placed in these bags is picked up by themunicipality other communities sell stickers that must be placed on existing garbage cans or bags before waste is picked up seattle has unit pricing system that has been operating sincethe late 1970s where residents purchase subscriptions for certain level of service eg one two or three cans per week and pay higher fees for hi gher levels of service as result of recent increases in these rates the u tility reports that citizen s became aware of the cost of solid waste disposal for the first time as rates increased the utility reported that it was overwhelmed bycalls from customers wanting to reduce their subscription level 124 thus higher prices and rates that vary with the amount of waste generated appear to have reduced waste generation andincreased recycling seattle offi cials view these incentives as an integral part of reaching the citys ambitious goal of 60 recycling implementation issues unit pricing can provide str ong incentive for households to recycle some communities report that participation in recycling progr ams doubled after unit pricing system was implemented125 this effect may be stronger in co mmunities where recycl able materials are picked up at charge or at price substantially lower than the per bag fee unit pricing may also encourage households to reduce the amount of waste they generate by composting yard andfood waste by purchasing products with less p ackaging by purchasing nondisposable items or by using items more times before disposal unit pricing system could have some additional unexpected effects first it could lead to increased illegal disposal those trying to avoid paying disposal fees could illegally burn theirtrash dump it on others property or transport it to other communities where stickers are notrequired it is very difficult to identify and prosecute perpetrators of illegal disposal in additionvolumebased unit pricing may not reduce the tota l weight of garbage disposed if households merely compact their usual amount of trash and place it in fewer bags administrative complexity of unit pricing plan is highly variable depending on how the program is designed designing billing system that accounts for the num ber of bags disposed could be complex municipalities can avoid billing if they use local stores to sell bags orstickers municipalities would still need an accounting system for tracking the number of stickers or bags sold and the amount of money r eceived the inclusion of apartments in the unit pricing system would also add to administrative complexity because there is way to monitorhow much trash each individual apartment places in common dumpsterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs109 impacts individuals who recycle and minimize waste generation benefit from unitpricing scheme large families and households that generate rge quantitie s of waste are likely to pay higher waste disposal fees with unit pricing system th an they would with fixed waste disposal fee depositrefund for batteries and other hazardous substances requiring refundable deposits on the purchas of certain products would encourage consumers to return the products for refund of the deposit and proper disposal depositrefund systems are most appropriate for small consumer items that are often illegally discarded such asbatteries but variants of the system have also been sugg ested for small quantity hazardous wastes such as solvents in the latter case the purpose of the system would be to reverse theincentives for midnight dumping that are side eff ect of the increasing cost of legal disposal ease the task of monitoring and enforcement return valuable materials to manufacturers forrecycling provide incentives to recapture sses from production processes and encourage the substitution of less hazardous materials background the rcra reauthorization bill reported by the senate committee on environment and public works in the 102nd congress included provision that would require retail sellers of leadacid batteries to collect deposit of at least 10 on the sale of any new lead acid battery notaccompanied by the return of used lead acid battery similar provision is contained in s729the lead exposure reduction act re ported by the same committee in the 103rd c ongress consumers who have paid deposit may receive refund equal to the amount of the deposit paid when they return used lead acid battery of the same type as the battery purchased within 21days of sale the proposal would require that any retailer that sells lead acid batteries also acceptthem in return any unclaimed deposits become the property of the retailers implementation issues the most difficult aspect of implementing depositrefund syst em is ensuring that refunds are only given to those that have paid deposits regulations implementing such system couldrequire that retailers provide receipt for any posit paid and that the receipt be presented when battery is returned and refund is requested several problems would arise if the law did not require receipt proving that deposit was paid in order to receive refund first anyone possessing old lead acid batteries on the effectivedate of the law could bring them to any reta iler and demand refund more refunds would be requested than deposits paid causing financial loss for retailers there would also be anincentive to import used lead acid batteries from other countries if the 10 refund would covertransportation costs and allow the importer to receive profit lack of r eceipt requirement would also encourage battery theft because lead acid batteries are easily removed fromautomobiles thieves could steal the batteries and return them for 10 refund individual battery retailers could experience cashflow problems if there were

reduceimproper disposal 126 most of the proposals include deposit at the time of sale or return of equal amounts of used oil pr oof of purchase would be required for any refunds for returning used oil without buying new oil analysts point out two difficulties in using depositrefund in this context first counterfeit product stolen or otherwise could be intr oduced the second problem is the effect of fluctuating oil prices on the incentive for used oil recycling below certain oil price recyclers charge for pickup from service st ations so that there is little incentive to coll ect oil from doit yourselfers127 thus regulatory actions would still be needed to assure proper final disposal of used oil under conditions of fluctuati ng oil prices industrial solvents some have suggested that industry generates sufficient amounts of hazardous waste in small enough quantities to warrant consid eration for depositrefund system128 as proposed this system would deal with the approximately 15 of industrial hazardous wastes that are potentially containerizable and recyclable deposits paid todistributors would be recovered when the spent chemical was returned to designated recyclinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94213crs111 facilities if the material has recovery value an additional payment to users would be made by recyclers in addition to the problem of counterfeit product
