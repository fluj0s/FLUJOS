act of 1974 as amended bill purpose and permitted reserve uses the stated purpose of the bill is to reduce our nations dependency on foreign oil by investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency specifi cally section 301 of the bill would make the revenue in the reserve available to offset the cost of subsequent legislation that may be introduced 1 to accelerate the use of domestic renewable

secti on 307 of sconres 21 would create deficit neutral reserve fund that could be used fo r renewable energy ergy efficiency and responsible development of oil and natural gas in ddition section 332

and provisions for energy effi cient buildings products and power plantshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22571crs4 further section 338 would create defic itneutral reserve f und for manufacturing initiatives
