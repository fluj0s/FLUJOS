shsbc 66 moral codes what is withhold lecture given on 4 october 1961 my what quiet crowd today well little applause for her applause ill put that down on my bill suzie laughter msh unintelligible okay we have new student today carl wilson from riverside california stand up carl applause im glad your here this is the 4th of what audience voice 4th 4th of october i wasnt thinking so much about the day i wanted to make sure you had your adjustment on the mike because im bringing it little bit closer now if i can remember all this i mean that seriously by the way special briefing course saint hill if i can remember all this ill give you the whole rundown on overtwithhold and how it got that way and then you will be much smarter cookies i mean that if i can remember all the puttogether how it goes together because let tell you its complicated very very complicated told you some time ago this is very apropos to class ii auditor this is part of class ii auditor skills this should be known and known very well this should be understood and if youre ever going to make anything out of security check if youre ever going to get any advances with security check youll have to know this sort of thing it is not enough to be able to sit there and say well have you ever raped anybody well have you ever raped anybody good have you ever raped anybody good have you ever raped anybody good keeping tr 0 in of course that has very little to do with security checking security checking is not repetitive command you ask the question you get the answer and you get off the withhold but whats withhold what is withhold well yous just about to find out and its good thing too because im saving your bacon in the nick of time i come in here i find mary sue tearing your scalps off on the subject of it and what have you been up to of course she must have found somebody auditing on this basis well have you ever done anything to fellow staff member well yes i heard that joe went out with bessie oh now your first order of business as an auditor is to get an answer to the auditing command and will you tell how that is an answer to an auditing command what have you done i heard that he hasnt done anything how can it possibly be withhold id put another question have you ever ruined people maliciously by gossip clang clang clang yes correct they have do you know people will make up withholds just to get other people in trouble and youre going to sit there and let them do it and youre going to hear people saying things people that have heard things about people who heard things and they understood that something and they knew that soandso and you let them get this off as withhold well what auditing time are you wasting well youre wasting your own time and youre wasting the pcs time and basically you have demonstrated that you dont know what withhold is but that is excusable up to this moment one hour and half from now it begins to be crime see its not crime for the next hour and half but an hour and half from now the cat will be out of the bag only in this particular instance it is rather big cat about leopard size that is leaping out of rather big bag because this is one of these jackpots that we hit every once in while in scientology you know you pull the lever expecting to get out couple of quarters and florins shillings sixpences so forth cascade out on the floor for half an hour i mean thats the sort of thing which has just occurred here and those of you who havent been to vegas can ask those who have what i meant whats withhold whats an overt act its important to know these things mr doakes sits down in the auditing chair because you of course being pc dont pay much attention to auditing he sits there and he says to you he says well i have robbed banks uh murdered women uh strangled babies uh embezzled it yes i uh ruined marriages i did this and i did that and you dont get single knock on the needle oh you say this person is not security checkable aha but from this moment on youre going to see that there is such thing as nonsecurity checkable person because youre going to say that this pc you had is not capable of registering on the meter because obviously these are tremendous things theyre social transgressions against your code of sociality to point where god almighty he should be shot put in straitjacket given pill by medical doctor most horrible things happen to him why because look hes robbed banks and murdered women and so forth and you dont get single knock on the emeter you say well the man is conscienceless therefore he has withholds aha and thats right against your moral code he has withholds because they were not transgressions to him now your task in doing security check is to get off withholds but what is withhold what is withhold now you could say grandly it is what the preclear is withholding you could say as we have been saying about an overt act what is an overt act an overt act is what the thetan thinks is an overt act therefore if i do not think i have committed an overt act as i strangle this person or that you see then i have not committed an overt act you see those are not adequate replies and those are not adequate definitions and those are not adequate answers and they do not add up to useful workable definitions in the field of auditing i think you will agree with that you yourself have been puzzled about this how is it that one person gives you some kind of stuff and its not withhold and yet says well i i looked down the road you know its clang you know you got clang and you say what did you do what is that well i looked down the road and it cleared and you say well what kind of withhold could this be you know there must be more to it and of course you immediately exceed your function as an auditor which is to clear the meter if looking down the road cleared the meter that was withhold now what puzzles you is that youre fixed on moral code or lack of one which is yours circa now and you consider that the pc that you are security checking only has withholds if they are transgressions against the moral code which you consider moral code now and therefore you just make fantastic numbers of mistakes see what im talking about all right now lets take this criminal aha this criminal and weve got him on the meter you know and we say well have you ever you know what criminal should be security checked at have you ever robbed bank clang you see you would think boy thats going to go clang you know because we know hes robbed bank hes actually been in joliet and columbia university and other prisons obviously he has and you get not even twitch of the needle and he looks at you blandly and says yes i have robbed banks well you see what is astounding you at that point theres only one thing that is making you astonished is that he has said something that is transgression against what you think is his moral code you see and therefore you go on security checking him against your moral code and that isnt the code he lives by and he is not free of withholds he has tremendous numbers of withholds but only against the moral code he lives by did you ever hear the moral code of criminal thou must not squeal to the cops thou must not peach you could write up long one all about how after youve robbed the bank you must equally share except if somebody didnt help you rob the bank very much and then you should cut his throat not to kill cop could be against that moral code in some societies so that you ask the question from the bearing of your current moral code and you say have you ever killed policeman and theres fall youre checking on the wrong moral code youre checking pc who has different moral code the question should be have you ever had an opportunity to kill policeman and failed to do so clang see its against his moral code not to kill cop other criminals wouldnt speak to him do you follow this in prison youd have to security check along these lines have you ever failed to keep guard in the dark as to what was going on see have you ever cooperated with prison authorities have you ever told the truth to any official have you ever spoken to screw kindly because its against the moral code of the prisoners and they have their own moral code you can say all pcs have withholds but these withholds are not necessarily against your moral code so we add to it all pcs have had moral codes against which they have transgressed and when you locate the moral code against which they have transgressed you will then get off the withholds of the case and only then will you get off the withholds of the case only then withhold then is an unspoken unannounced transgression against moral code by which the person was bound now how many moral codes are there how many moral codes have there been id say circa right now there is probably different moral code for every group each one large or small in every city county country continent of earth theres probably five hundred of them for every language there is on this planet and there are fifty thousand languages on this planet ill give you moralcode question to zulu has anything ever been lying around loose that you didnt steal clang who didnt you tell that to i didnt tell my father i wouldnt dare he would beat because its moral for zulu to steal interesting isnt it so not stealing is his withhold and you think his stealing would be his withhold so you ask for stealing withhold and you dont get any response and you should have been asking for notstealing withhold therefore it is incumbent upon the auditor to have some idea of moral codes whats moral code well get into that in moment but how many more moral codes do you think there have been now look if circa right now there are possibly hundred or five hundred of them for every language on earth lets be moderate about it and there are fifty thousand languages on earth that gives you quite few right here in present time right all right lets go back on the track how many moral codes do you think there have been on the whole track in the last two hundred trillion years how many moral codes do you think there have been it is some unimaginable number you could start up in the corner of this wall and start writing after you put down one then just start writing zeros in tiny microscopic writing clear from that side of the wall clear to the other side of the wall go back to the beginning write it all the way across again and then when youve filled the whole wall down to the bottom then you put it twentyfirst power that would be quite number that would be quite number now that is an awful lot of moral codes so whats the anatomy of this what is moral code it is that series of agreements to which person has subscribed to guarantee the survival of group and that is what moral code is its that series of agreements to which person has subscribed to guarantee the survival of group thats what it is all right ill tell you an old short story this is the most vignette sort of thing there was couple of fellows and they heard there was buried treasure galleon had gone up on reef down in the south pacific or down in the caribbean and they heard this galleon had gone up on reef and that just before it sank they threw tremendous amount of gold into its bronze guns hoping they could come back for it later and put the tampions on the guns and the galleon sank and these great belled cannon were still down there filled with gold so couple of men got together and they picked up native boy and they as crew and they sailed away and they dived and dived and dived and dived for this old galleons cannon they had agreed 100 percent what they would do with the gold they had agreed completely what they would do with the gold they would split it equally and the shares would remain on board the ship until they were taken to certain point and at that point banker and trucks would come down to pick it up and it would be transported properly to switzerland and they had agreed utterly and completely they knew exactly what to do and they had agreed also not to squander it and not go getting drunk and not go doing this and not go doing that until it was all safely cared for and they were back in their own country theyd agreed what to do about the bills of their trip they had it all taped well they found couple of cannon but they reached their arms down the muzzles of the cannon and they couldnt find any tampion and they went ashore after many days their supplies were running out everything was going to hell and the supplies were running out and what were they going to do they hadnt found any gold well they had an agreement for everything except failure they had agreement as to what they were going to do if they failed so they began to wrangle about it after the fact and they got more and more wranglous and more and more wranglous and finally one of them picked up dirk and sank it in the other one and the other one simultaneously lopped off the other fellows arm with sword and they had an awful time because they didnt have any agreement at all what to do in case of failure and about that time as one of the fellows was dying he looked back at the boat and these guns that they had already hauled up on deck the backs had evidently fallen out of them being rolled around by the native boy and the native boy was throwing handfuls of gold into the sea but they had agreement on failure and youll find out that man has learned down the track in weird ways that where he has not agreed upon codes of conduct or what is proper in eventualities he has agreed where he has agreed he survives and where he has not agreed he doesnt survive and so people when they get together always draw up long large series of agreements on what is moral that is what will be contributive to survival and what is immoral what will be destructive of survival now moral by these definitions are those things which are considered to be at any given time survival characteristics survival action is moral action and those things are considered immoral which are considered contrasurvival but remember this is for any group in any special circumstance and here you have group of two men going out to find gold or whole nation being formed after the conquest of the land from some other race it doesnt matter what the size of the group is they enter into certain agreements now the longevity of the agreement doesnt have much to do with it it could be an agreement for day an agreement for month or an agreement for the next five hundred years theres constitution in the united states that is an agreement it was an agreement made by thirteen states as to how they would conduct their affairs wherever that constitution has been breached the country is now in trouble there mustnt be any income tax the first one said well they managed to muck that up and they managed to muck up another one and another point and another point and another point and each time they have busted up the agreement why theyre in trouble well why are they in trouble well thats because there arent any other agreements than the basic agreement you dont have modified agreements if the agreement didnt exist in the first place you cant keep patching it up and expect any great lasting success but what i have just said is to some degree matter of opinion because moral codes either leap fullarmed from the brass tablets of moses as he walks down from the rain and the mist saying thou shalt not sell pork to thy neighbor sell it to stranger if it is tainted you didnt know that was one of the commandments did you but ive mentioned it before that it happens to be there there are about 162 of the ten commandments and they contain all sorts of interesting bricabrac but that is just moral code now perhaps that was fine and everybody got along fine with these first 162 precepts or principles and so forth and then somebody came along with pitch and put big curve into the line and altered the agreements and redefined it all you see and after while nobody knew what was moral so it got to be confusion and then everybody tried to enforce what was moral and what wasnt moral but nobody could make up his mind and the confusion got greater and greater and then people departed from the group and dispersed and these people dispersing entered into other moral groups and new moral codes were formed which they then followed more or less and eventually those moral codes of course got diluted and messed up and time marched on and what did we then find all kinds of confusion would then enter in to what was moral and what wasnt moral and the next thing you know somebody would jump up and group would get together and they would agree on brandnew moral code you see and then that moral code would get all messed up somehow or another and people would offend against it somehow and then that group would disintegrate because of course its moral agreement disintegrates why it the group disintegrates and then that confusion is succeeded little later on the track by these various group members now members of other groups forming up new moral codes which go into disintegration you see so youve got cycle there and the cycle of action of civilizations is simply this cycle of action it is an agreement on optimum conduct disintegration of agreement and optimum conduct disbanding of the group formation of new group with the agreement on new agreement on optimum conduct disintegration of that agreement the dispersal of the group the formation of new group do you see the cycle now thats the cycle of civilization and thats the cycle of action the createsurvivedestroy in this particular instance is of course they create series of agreements and conducts of what is right and what is wrong they establish what is right and what is wrong what is moral what is immoral what is survival what is nonsurvival they establish this thing that is what is created and then this disintegrates by transgressions and these transgressions unspoken but nevertheless transgressions by each group member gradually mount up to disintegration and the person who transgresses the most quite commonly can be the person who is up there screaming the loudest that the others must follow the moral code you look at the various calvinist preachers and things of this character man those fellows had ball ten million withholds per preacher you see and they were screaming to the rooftops how everybody must follow the code of course you get disintegration after point like that you see how this thing goes so your survive of course is as long as the codes or agreements continue in action and then your destroy or your destructive confusion of course is what occurs when everybody has withholds when everybody is going the other way to token payment to the code but actually adherence to it everybody has withholds from everybody else concerning it the group of course disintegrates on the basis that when you have overts you have separation individuation so the group disintegrates and you go into new cycle now sometimes they stay disintegrated for year sometimes for hundreds of years there are countries on this planet right now whose moral codes have disintegrated who havent yet formed new one several mediterranean countries have done this right this minute they really dont have new moral code their old one is pretty doggone shot the white man with life liberty and equality as spread by tom jefferson and so forth now down in africa is experiencing the agony of having his moral codes as natives totally destroyed completely and everybody says isnt this wonderful isnt this marvelous look all were doing for these natives you see and the natives are getting sicker and sicker and falling apart and they cant handle themselves or anything else and everybody says isnt it wonderful what were doing look were giving them washing machines of course they dont have any electric power in their house but were giving them washing machines and look at the marvelous things were doing here well the marvelous thing theyre doing of course is disintegrating the moral code of the tribe or the tribal unit and bringing about total disintegration of the individuals concerned with it now there is your general hue there is the general state of affairs with regard to cycle of action of civilization do you see how that went you see how it goes all right you in scientology are involved right this minute in certain mores there is certain moral code of one kind or another actually it isnt completely formed yet it is still in state of formation but one of the reasons why you find it difficult to process another scientologist is not that his case is worse but because you when you flub transgress against the moral code of thou shalt be good auditor thats it and because you are subscribing to code of conduct that is survival therefore when you have overts against that code of conduct it is the code of conduct by which you are auditing and progressing in life so naturally these things then take paramount importance in security checks the last two pages of the form 3 all of form 6 when straightened out will do more for longterm scientologist than anything else why why hes been doing all these things in the name of helping people well yes you say well he has perfect right to go nattering around about well ron has changed his mind again you know you think he has perfect right to well i personally believe he has perfect right to dont you see im not upset by this in any way ive been shellacked by experts you know and i can stand up to lot more hurricane than somebody sitting back in corner nattering slightly about something or other oh well these bulletins arent in order you know and ron should have gotten these bulletins in order you know all right but it just so happens by the principles of the thing that the very fact that he is thinking them is transgression against something he apparently has agreed to all right the transgression is such that it holds his case up it is the current moral code then which is the most important to the case it is the code by which the person is now living which has dominance over all other codes so we get practicing scientologist and so on and the first thing that weve got to do with him is straighten out his transgressions against the group agreement thou shalt be good auditor thou shalt not flub thou shalt pronounce thy commands properly get the idea and thou shant get scientology in trouble you know this kind of thing whatever these codes add up to they are what they are dont you see they arent so much what i say they are they just are what they are theyre what youre forming up all right transgressions against those things then tend to make you feel like an outsider from the group of scientologists and to that degree you can receive benefit from scientology dont you see its very simple it is not that the action is monstrous it is the degree that the action removes the person from his group so that is the definition of transgression this has very little to do with our own moral code only that we just oddly enough are suddenly suddenly look and see what were doing you know i mean here we are were forming up new series of agreements theyre not all completely formed yet not by long ways but there they are theyre new series of agreements theyre way of life theres this is survival and that isnt survival the fact that these things resolve life and take dominance and command over so many other moral codes and can actually run out now and change all other moral codes of course makes this fantastically powerful code by which were operating im not now talking about the written code of scientologist i am talking about what you think scientologist should do and should not do what you think he should do and not do see not what i think he should do and not do that is basically the moral code which is being formed up here well its very strong one because it has dominance over all other moral codes you think it should be this way and it should be that way or it shouldnt be this way and it shouldnt be that way and it all is added up to you and adjudicated on what you consider survival and whats not considered survival and of course were in position where were dominant other over all other activities but lets not worry about that for moment that has very small bearing on this particular lecture what im talking about is what is moral code well moral code is series of agreements to which members of group have subscribed to promote their survival now that is moral code and their transgressions are the degree that they have separated themselves from free communication with the remainder of the group that is transgression the degree that person has separated himself from free communication with group and thats all transgression is now you say well transgression after all he murders member of the group thats certainly wilder transgression than this well i dont know he murders member of the group and so they burn him at the stake or something of the sort or assign him to being skewered with emeter cans in the public square something goes on it actually is not much of transgression that is sort of livingness and groups do get enturbulated one way or the other but get this one murdering member of the group and hiding his body and never mentioning it to the rest of the group oh oh oh oh oh now he is pretending to be part of the group while longer being part of the group and it is out of that sort of thing that you get the disintegration so he murdered member of the group and everybody found out about it and they all knew him they saw him do it and they skewered him with emeter cans in the middle of the square and told him go thou and never get audited again you dog and so he went out and picked up another body and one day an auditor runs into it in session and runs it out see but he actually has not been separated from the group the only person who can separate one from group is himself and the only mechanism he can do it by is withholding he withholds transgressions against the moral code of the group from the other members of the group and therefore he individuates from the group and the group therefore disintegrates this should be very simple this is very well taped now how does this all come about in the first place are there any other mechanisms back of this yes there is the mechanism of coaction the mechanism of coaction the last time you were dancing with somebody you were indulging in coaction they were moving and you were moving and so forth the last time you had fight with somebody you were in coaction yes you were in violent disagreement with their actions and they were in violent disagreement with your action but unfortunately underneath all this you were both fighting now ill give you an example of coaction of magnitude if you will forgive the slight excursion into maritime affairs ill tell you anecdotes about the phoenician navy pretty soon but right now i can only tell you anecdotes about current ones that you would be interested in ship is good until it has braved some tremendous danger or indulged in combat the crew is good and the ship just isnt integrated theres nothing to it you take these harbor launches that everybody goes home to the wife every night and they come aboard and so forth well they fall apart there is group there to amount to anything but ship in essence is fairly isolated group and therefore gives us good example and you recruit everybody up and youve got all the proper number of ratings and men and theyre all at their proper stations and theyre all in the proper slots and theyve all been trained for their duties and nothing works its so interesting nothing works there is more nightmarish nightmare than putting ship in commission with new crew for the first month or two or three months even you are in position where you dont know whether the guns are going to fall off or the keel is going to suddenly wind up down the stack you just dont know the supplies never seem to get aboard and the fuel never seems to flow freely to the engines or burners nothing seems to ever happen in the ship just nothing happens except sort of confusion some kind of weird confusion goes on and then one fine day this ship is out and it meets great storm and this storm is battering away at force 8 9 10 and huge raging seas are racing on every side of it and every man is braced and down in the engine room theyre trying to keep the screws turning over somehow or another and the water in the bilges are is sloshing all around and somebody forgot to close seacock and the next thing you know theyre all being punished for their omissions and somehow or another they hold the ship together somehow or another they hold the ship together and then the storm abates and for some peculiar reason we now have ship this is noticed fact i mean lot of people who have gone to sea and so forth could tell you this fact it is true of flight group it is true of military company you never really see any organization hang together at all until it has been bruised heavily and hard and then you will see an organization hang together the reason business organizations are so hard to hold together as groups and there are so many transgressions against their codes of operation is centered totally upon the fact that they never get mauled the boss gets mauled and the accountant gets mauled and somebody else gets mauled but nobody ever takes the whole building and mauls it there is mutual danger to amount to anything one could be created instead of the manager taking it all on his back every time somebody writes him nasty letter if he got the staff together and read it to them and they had chance to find out what was going on and discover what was under attack here or what wasnt under attack here you might get cohesed group and organization otherwise what is this they have experienced the necessity to survive and that is the whole summation of it group becomes group when it has experienced mutually the necessity to survive and that then makes very strong group ship going into action for the first time goes into it as disintegrated series of agreements it has moral code it has nothing why because nobody sees any necessity at all to survive and then they take rare shellacking theyve left seacock opened and they forgot to test out the ammunition hoist and lot of other things werent done on this ship and all those sins start to catch them out and they suddenly say weve got to survive around here and we had better put it into high gear and when they come out the other end theyre all friends oddly enough theyve gone through mutual experience of some magnitude and theyre friends and their friendship for one another expresses it in itself of knitted group which has its own mores youll find out that every ship which has been long together with itself under any kind of well just mediocre the most medi it isnt leadership that makes ship its lack of interference by leadership that makes ship and youll find out that these boys will have developed whole civilization of their own they have their own jokes youll be walking down the deck of strange ship that is lying in some harbor someplace and somebody will say all of sudden turn around and hell say hell look at another little boat in the water or something like that and hell say ten feet tall and everybody every member of the ships company that is near him will laugh like mad you see youre an outsider you dont know what he was talking about well something has happened on the ship or somebody got razzle dazzled into some peculiar way and it somehow or another centers around this joke ten feet tall and everybody knows this joke but the outsider doesnt well thats as much part of their civilization as all the ships members know that when you go down certain companionway and open certain watertight door youd better for sure get your fingers the hell out of the road because it inevitably slams back they all know that but youre stranger and you dont know that so you get your fingers caught but they have whole technology and its just group of men running one piece of machinery an oil rig running out in the middle of texas someplace or standing out on texas tower in the gulf something like this the crews attached to that thing after theyve gone through certain experiences and so forth cohese and become group and they have certain morals that are different it runs different place to place but theres certain pattern runs through it all and the basic thing is you mustnt injure the survival of fellow group member common denominator of transgression and thats also by the way the common denominator of the code in the first place you mustnt injure the survival of certain group member therefore manager has tendency to be far more isolated from group or the leader of group has tendency to be far more isolated from the group than group members why because he every now and then does injure the survival characteristics of group member matter if he does it reluctantly every now and then on every side of him he will find members of the group are absolutely insisting that member x be expelled member xs transgressions in the cumulative sense have gotten so antipathetic to other group members that they find that it is impossible to survive with member x around and who do they turn it over to well now the leader of the group is not particularly aware of the transgressions of member x because he doesnt live the same life as the rest of the group hes little bit isolated dont you see so he does an independent overt without motivator he dismisses the group member he says thou shalt be shot thou shalt be turned out to starve or something so he tends to get all manner of overts against group members and then he seldom tells anybody else in the group what exactly happened to member x because he thinks itd be too enturbulative he never posts it on the bulletin board or something like this for the seventh consecutive time member x was found eating crackers in somebody elses bed and therefore is longer amongst us by popular demand he never does anything like this you see he operates sort of on constant withhold and he can actually drive himself straight out of his own group its quite interesting ah you get this in the isolation of command and so forth now this is so true that man has at length accepted the idea of isolation of command as normal course of human events its not necessarily normal at all but you see there is one of your breakdowns now leadership is one of the frailties of group while at the same time being one of its greatest strengths so that you change the leadership of group you can change to marked degree some of the characteristics of the group but if you change the group over to leader who then violates or changes all the mores of the group ahh well weve got lots of trouble now weve got lots of trouble i have case in point there was very successful company you heard of nick carter and diamond dick and all the rest of these old pocketbooks in their day the comic books of the 1890s well those were all published by company known as street smith and it had become very very wealthy over long period of time and it had its mores boy did that place have mores it owned whole square block imagine it in the middle of new york city where square foot is worth about hundred thousand dollars and it owned whole huge squareblock building about four stories high that was the clammiest most fallenapart old building you ever heard of and it had printing presses in it and the building was so shaky that when these enormous presses started to roar the whole building shook you could hardly hold the inkwell on the desk you know up in the executive offices and so forth and they had they had just gone on for years they had unpublished manuscripts of henry they had all kinds of things i went into their vaults one day and there were the originals of ned buntline you know and annie oakley and all of this kind of stuff fantastic and there were certain codes by which you couldnt speak to people and could speak to people and certain precedences by which you went to lunch and did this and did that and there were promotion precedences in every place and it was very hidebound old outfit well after all it had been in existence for the better part of half century and all of sudden young mr smith inherited it on the basis of death dues you see and he had wife and his wife believed that it was nasty thing to publish things like that her friends wouldnt like it but they would like such things as fancy womens magazines and so mr smith americanized himself to the degree of saluting the wife and saying yes sir and at the time he took over at the time he took over there was sevenmilliondollar sinking fund in that company just the sinking fund there were strings attached to it there were nothing it just sat there and made money everything made money in all directions he took their highpower presses which could spit out more dime novels and magazines than any other highpower press in america and sold it to his nearest competitor and then they could spit out more magazines than street smith and when he got through he owned mademoiselle all on the cuff and the company was gone and the building was gone and everything was gone its things like that you see which give rise and credence and get loyalty devoted to such things as socialism communism things of this character because they recognize that the leader of group is the most capable of destroying the group the group might survive all sorts of storms and financial crises and crashes but all one well just one thing has to happen you see the leader of the group goes bad marries the wrong girl who decides that her friends wont speak to her quite well enough if she is connected with printing bloodandthunder magazines dont you see i dont know what happened to all of that but the staff dispersed all over the place and you would see these people afterwards and theyd be sitting around in sort of degraded fashion you know they were old street smith people they were never anything else they were not new popularpublications people you see they were old street smith people because it was one of the oldest publication groups in america now you can answer the question why is it that the old soldier is always degraded just hire an old soldier someday to mow the front lawn you usually will have had it they have very bad employment reputation old soldiers now im talking about old soldiers the sixteenyear man the twentyyear man the thirtyyear man and you say at once well the army must have done something horrible to this fellow to bring about total disintegration of his personality and therefore the army is very bad training and therefore the army is degrading and therefore the military is very bad and you can get whole nation believing the military is very bad because every product of the military which they see after the fellow has spent ten sixteen twenty thirty years in the military is the guy is walking around in fog you know hes walking around in daze of some kind or another or he takes to drink or hes unreliable and he wont do his job and they see this sort of thing so they say the military must be very bad theyre looking at another phenomenon it is the phenomenon of group member who is longer part of the group thats the phenomenon theyre looking at hes perfectly good soldier but he has group how can he go on being perfectly good soldier theres mores any mores that he has thou shalt not tell the sergeant you know thou shalt sneak in after hours when thou dost not have pass thou shalt raise hell with the mess sergeant thou shalt scrounge anything that isnt nailed down providing providing it doth not belong to thine own company tremendous mores various kinds you know thou shalt raise hell with second lieutenants but be respectful to captains all these kinds of things well this is the moral code by which he is living and of course hes living by moral code and he has group connected with it anymore he is degraded is he degraded actually because he had overts against the army and his moral code he is merely degraded because of this interesting phenomenon which you must pay some attention to if person is longer member of group he feels automatically that he must have had overts against it and was driven out of it through fault of his own this group has ceased to exist or he is longer member of it just the fact that he is longer member of the group makes him automatically flick believe that he must have had overts agaainst the group you see this is the reverse phenomenon now you run into this every once in while as matter of fact you run into it rather constantly because the punishment or the result exists people then believe the crime must have existed got the idea youll see every once in while some fellow whose wife has left him and he will then believe that he must have been mean to her or that he is not good family man maybe it had nothing to do with it whatsoever maybe there was typhoid epidemic in the area and she died but he gets this other sensation you know the other sensation is hes longer part of the group therefore he must have offended and youll find people nattering and chattering about this one notable example there was one girl i knew whose father died in an automobile accident exactly two thousand miles away and she sat around all the time trying to figure out how she killed her father how had she killed her father well was it because she didnt answer his telephone call when he put telephone call through to her was it because she didnt phone at the time of this was it because of this was it because of that was it because she had gone to this other city in the first place now if she hadnt gone to the other city and so forth well all of this nattering and that whole thing which the psychiatrist ooh this just drives the psychiatrist mad he worries about this more than anything else he sits up all night sometimes worrying about this one if he finds this in patient he sits there and the perspiration just drips all over his white somewhat smudged edged waistcoat the person thinks he killed his father and hell just do everything he can possibly do you see to try to convince this patient that he didnt kill his father and he doesnt know the mechanism connected with it and actually we didnt either until just now in the last few days here well his fathers gone so therefore he must have offended against group called sonfather or daughterfather see that is group daughterfather must have offended against it because hes longer member of the group and you might say this is the common denominator of peoples degraded feelings they are longer member of the group so you will very often be processing somebody who feels that he had tremendous overts this is not in the majority but youll feel this is somebody who had tremendous overts against group and you wont be able to find them and you wont even be able to you wont be able to locate them on the meter which is what i mean the group is gone its not any longer there and hes longer with the group so he figures it out you see that having suffered the final punishment for transgressing against the group that he must have transgressed against the group and whats worrying him is to try to figure out how he transgressed against the group rather than simply face the fact that hes longer member of the group you got the idea an awful lot of people finished up world war ii or the korean war feeling degraded because they were separated from their military units well they were separated from their military units well if theyd gone through lot of cosurvival motion see if theyd gone through lot of motion with other fellows in an effort to survive then it cohesed the group and of course how did they leave the group well they just left the group by being demobbed thats all naval terminology they were separated from service well that was some action of some character in some personnel division someplace and the fellow afterwards wonders if he shouldnt have been nicer to the squadron you know and he shouldnt have been nicer to the company or if he shouldnt have been better to those people and what did he do and hell sit around and grieve actually about the horrible things that he did do to these fellows well hes integrating the whole thing against the fact that because hes longer member of the group then he must have transgressed against the group you see in other words he does an identification of the punishment with the action see its only the action is necessary now what actions are actually necessary to cohese group coaction in the direction of survival if you have coaction in the direction of survival with two or more people you inevitably have mores its tiny and its not very explicit but its mores and it has to do with two people who went against many antisurvival forces they coacted against antipathetic forces so therefore they are group and now one of the people dies or departs and we have the other person then believing he must have transgressed against the other person and sure enough he does have transgressions and youll find out hes very very happy to find out and get off his withholds and transgressions against the other thing and it will blow at that time but its blowing for another reason the reason you think it is blowing is because youve gotten off these little petty twobit withholds you know he was very happy to have found he really did merit longer being member of the group you got the difference see he figures well it was justified they were right throwing out because look i did have some withholds see i did have some of these withheld transgressions so therefore obviously there it is see happy as clam you know so hes willing to be separated from the group up to that time its unknown its unexplained did he have transgressions against the group or didnt he have transgressions against the group and the only evidence he has hes longer member of the group so he must have transgressed against the group thats what the equation is if the fellow is longer member of the group then he must have had action against the group youll find out that the fellow who has dogfight over france with german pilot lets say and they go round and round and round and round and they have this hell of dogfight and so forth and they finally break it off and go home do you know theres always little bit of an oddity between the two of them so on you know they every once in while after war couple of pilots who have had aerial duels and so forth will meet and they meet like old pals man that is the group but you see just to that degree they formed group but what kind of group was it it was group of tremendous coaction contrasurvival but each one is trying so forcefully to survive that their action is in agreement its an agreedupon action dance of death in the sky theyre both firing at each other arent they theyre both flying airplanes arent they theyre both trying to survive arent they theyre both in the same sky arent they theyre both in the same time period arent they well they know they arent group each one knows the other is an enemy and they know this positively and violently that they are not group and so they can never explain why the dogfight hangs up of course there are withholds against their own groups in there if one didnt shoot the other one down its actually sort of transgression against his own group just to that degree but if he has dogfight fails to shoot the other one down and then goes home and never mentions it now hes actually got transgression against his own group you get the degree of complexity with which this mounts up well it mounts up on this basis this basis agreement what is agreement its two people making the same postulate stick two or more people making the same postulate stick thats what we mean by an agreement two or more people making the same postulate stick an agreement well now what if they go into mutual action and their mutual action is in the direction of survival oh theyve got the same agreements that theyre trying to make stick and now theyre going through similar actions by which theyre trying to make survival possible now what have they got now ah theyve got coaction and they have confusion of one with another they dont quite differentiate their own action so they misown other actions in their immediate vicinity fifteen men pulling on rope trying to pull seaplane out of the sea afterwards you say how much of each ones motion was responsible for the seaplane coming out of the sea exactly how many ergs of your motion was part of the recovery of the seaplane well you try to break it down like that he takes the easy course you see and he says well we did it we pulled it out of the sea he doesnt differentiate how much each one did pull it out of the sea he just says broadly we pulled it out of the sea in other words it was fifteen men contributing unequally some more some less to line and they would contribute unequally if they were just at different positions on the line because the lines get bent and twisted around things and people who are closer to bollards you see cant pull as well as people who are far from them you get the idea so its an incalculable mathematical problem how many ergs did each one contribute well they all solved the problem by saying we did it oh and theyre very happy about this we did it our motion now you take some fellow who has been running an engine for an awful long time hes pulling water or something up hill into reservoir you see and he runs this engine and he sees the pumps running the water going up the hill and so on and he runs the engine and he runs the engine and he runs the engine well why after while when you talk to him does he go kind of gurgle gurgle you see or like these engineers that i had and so on they start their motors they start their motors before they begin to talk they say wrawr wrawr wrawr and then they get to firing off and they give you the sentence its quite interesting i dont think anybody would believe that but ive got peter as witness hes talked to them over the phone its quite marvelous they start their motors and then they talk see the coaction in other words their action of running the motor is undifferentiated by them with the action of the motor so their action running the body and the motors action in running the pump these are mutual actions so you get coaction now you can go into this on havingness of motors and you can go into it on causes of things and you can go into it in other ways but you actually separate it best by just getting the fellow to get the idea of mutual action with the motor and all of sudden he up to that time hes been totally identified his action was the motors actions and the motors actions were his actions and so they had actions they had actions if the motor conked out and all of sudden its coil went bad why he goes home and has stomachache or something like this you know their mutual action is too tied in and that is the source of an overt now lets get around to what were talking about here that is an overt act or that is the source of overt acts you have mutual action with something else and you call it group member mores moral code anything you want to call it you see that but its mutual action and then you do something cruel to that with which you have mutual action and of course you experience the somatic and its just as easy as that it isnt any deeper than that that is an overt actmotivator sequence and that is its exact mechanics and thats all there is to it now you wonder why ive been talking about mores and groups and group action and survival and all that sort of thing well it just adds up to that fact after youve had tremendous amount of group coaction you then embark upon cruel action to what you have coaction with and youll get the somatic you must have had cruel impulse toward coaction before you can get the somatic you administer to somebody else you take somebody with whom we have coaction and one day for some reason or other best known to somebody else you accidentally break his arm you go around afterwards nursing your own why because your arm is his arm and thats how that crosses and thats what an overt actmotivator sequence is and those are all the mechanics there are to it there arent any fancier mechanics than that there isnt any mechanic such as well you should be punished because you have offended against another member of the group that is the group dramatizing the fact i just gave you religionists come along religionists come along and these religionists they tell you well do unto others as thou shalt turn thy other pig i dont think thats one of the commandments but its something like that they get this thing reversed in other words they are forcing into existence something that already exists see theyre saying well now you get mean you gyp your fellow group member and youre really going to suffer youll suffer in the long run oh great eighteen paternosters and three pieces of bread thats what its going to cost you or youll suffer from here on you see they get paid for it there actually is nothing there to be paid for person who makes an overt act against something with which he has mutual action of course is incapable of differentiating what is his action and what is the other action fifteen men on rope one of them trips and butts the other one in the back and then he has somatic in his own back you see because he didnt know whether the force was his or the force was theirs but he engaged in cruel action now all overtmotivator sequences become very pronounced when cruel actions are maliciously engaged upon while withholding one is really member of the group one is really coacting with the group but one engages on cruel action toward another member of the group and then tries to back out why does he try to withhold he tries to withhold for just this reason he tries to withhold because he doesnt want the effect of the coaction see he tries to individuate from the group when he does cruel act because he knows that if he does cruel act to something he has coaction with then of course hes going to get it in the neck so he tries to back out in other words he disowns the coaction because hes trying to get rid of the motivator he will inevitably get so he shoots fellow group member and having shot the fellow group member he then seeks to withhold the fact that he has shot fellow group member so as not to be liable to the somatics of coaction which experience has taught him will always occur and were just down to the basic fundamentals of nondifferentiation and identification that is all he identifies every group members action with his own action so therefore if he is mean to group member he of course is liable to get it so he tries to escape the penalty of what is woven straight into group action amongst all thetans and seeks to back out and this will ordinarily coax him into withholding too so withhold is part of backout now if you ask him to recognize his coaction with that group member prior to his overt act the overt act of course will blow thats the mechanics of it you see youve got to get the prior action now of course the more commotion and the more action and the more withholds and the more nonsense preceded his overt act the more the overt act is going to hang up and the more hes going to try to withhold it do you follow that plainly thats quite easy in other words he can only suffer from his overt because of former coaction he can only suffer from his overt because of former coaction and that coaction is the most aberrative when it is mutual survival mutual survival and of course that means disturbed confused area and it also you will spot earlier and earlier overts against fellow group members as youre doing this which is earlier and earlier efforts to back out well of course he is involved in mutual survival mutual action he is involved with other people with mutual survival and because he is involved with this mutual action every time he has tried to back out of mutual action he of course had sought to deny the mutuality of the action and he thinks he can get off the overtmotivator sequence inevitability by denying it you see if he just denies it enough then hes longer part of that scene so he individuates you see gradually out and you have to knock out his individuation totally before he can walk out that is what is the most peculiar phenomenon about it all you see the action he takes to escape punishment is the action which then settles in the punishment this is all very mechanical there is nothing much to it youll see this thing unfold youll see this thing unfold left and right it becomes very well you audit pc and you ask him for prior confusion well you could ask him for prior survival and youd get about the same answer youre asking him for former coaction and of course you will find every time you find former coaction it opens up the track little bit more so he finds former withhold and then you look earlier than that withhold and of course youve found former coaction again usually confusion because its survival action against odds battle of some kind or another with these two people facing the world or these ten people or this race you see and you find him backing out little bit more then you get little more coaction off the case by asking him what some earlier confusion was and of course he remembers another withhold another effort to individuate from the group and these uncover just to the degree that you uncover prior confusions or prior survivals its quite patent in other words youve got to get the comotion if you want to use that word the comotion which preceded the withhold that doesnt mean the overt act that preceded the withhold so much as it means the codisturbance which preceded his effort to individuate and of course youll get the withhold and the motivator just right now you get it right now you ask for the coaction and of course that blows the mutual action he was involved in with another group member and having blown that you then can release the other and it and then he longer withholds this fact about what he was trying to do to the group so hes longer trying to disintegrate from the group so he can move on the time track every time he has withhold he parks himself on the time track you see and he can keep parking himself and parking himself on the time track till the whole time track looks like just one big now and that one big now is the reactive mind and thats all there is to the reactive mind its the combined withholds which he has stacked up which have all become part of now but theyre efforts to individuate from groups well now he really never has succeeded in individuating from any group he has ever belonged to isnt that fascinating it doesnt matter whether he talked to shepherd back in the old days and they were talking there and all of sudden wolf came romping over operatically and the flock scattered and so the shepherd picked up cudgel and went after the wolf and he was just gentleman passing by the way but he picked up his sword and he went after the wolf too and they both got ahold of the wolf and they chased him over the hills and far away and made nothing out of the wolf and then they came back and gathered up the sheep and they shook each other by the hand and he went on his way all right he made group didnt he he made group and they had an agreement the mores of the group is protect sheep kill wolves that was their morals that is what they were supposed to do now all right he went along for few years and one day shepherd drove all the sheep through his rose garden and so he went out and put sword through the shepherd and he got it right in his chest and doctor doctor i have this horrible pain in my chest i just cant understand what this horrible pain in my chest is the doctor said well we we look we look upon that as advanced galloping consumption thats what that is and you take this horrible black potion here and itll get you over it and about eight nine thousand bottles of black potion later why they bury him he formed group with shepherd and then he killed shepherd wasnt even the same shepherd well whats he done hes done an identification of shepherds in the first place and then hes done an identification of motion with shepherd earlier you follow this so he gets an overt actmotivator sequence but nobody has ever left any groups the magicians well there have been magicians ever since theres been track but magicians from time to time have expressed this in saying they havent come close to this at all as matter of fact its not stable datum of magic but they say magician who starts in on one religion should not change his religion just because hes practicing magic thats one of the rules of the game in magic mustnt change your religion they know its bad luck they know people go to pieces on it well all they found out just to that degree is the fellow had subscribed to religious group of some kind or another and now if he goes and shifts his religion why hes going to get an overt motivator sequence of some kind or other he isnt going to be able to explain to anybody and there hes had it which is quite interesting this opens up an interesting door for scientology because if one has ever left any group he ever belonged to against which he had transgression or an overt why that means that all new groups being formed are formed by transgressors and then that follows then that if scientologists could get off of that particular mechanism they would form the first true group that has existed since the beginning of the universe isnt that interesting interesting vista suddenly opens up in that particular direction thats all rather beside the point at this particular moment were just talking about the mechanics of this thing but thats true that would happen now what is moral code moral code would be agreements series of agreements which had been cemented by mutual action aimed toward survival and transgression is an action against person or being or thing with which one has moral code or an understanding or coaction notice that were trotting out dianetics modern science of mental healths survival in caps notice its right back with us again because it is the action by which beings sought to survive that then brings about coaction on the part of those beings which brings about then the development of series of agreements which then brings about the possibility of transgression and the transgression withheld is an effort to act against the coaction of the group without suffering the consequences but the coaction followed by withhold then parks the person right there you see because thats not an action let call to your attention that withhold is noaction after the fact of action you break the cookie jar and then you dont tell your mother and youre processing this person and hes going along the track and there he is all of sudden and hes standing there in the kitchen hes not looking at anything hes not looking at anything have you noticed the number of pictures which pcs have where theyre not doing anything have you noticed this theyre not killing anybody theyre not breaking any bones theyre not robbing any cookie jars theyre not doing anything see there they were just innocently standing there just an innocent bystander theyll have picture suddenly of street and theres absolutely nothing happening on this street theyll have picture of kitchen theres nothing happening in the kitchen they will have picture of pot and theres nothing happening with regard to the pot at all well what are these things these are the points of withhold where person has withheld his transgression against the group and the transgression may lie minutes hours or days before the picture you just ask for the commotion which went on before that and hell give it to you and you find the withhold then the fact that he withheld it against the mores of the group and the picture will spring just like that very tight close mechanism theres nothing much to it at all so you look for the prior confusion the rule of the prior confusion comes out of this so if the person is parked anyplace he of course has withhold at the point he is parked but it is immediately preceded by coaction or comotion for sure and then an overt against that coaction and comotion and then the withhold so it follows down consecutively in terms of time 1200 coaction co motion as part of the group 100 overt against this group 200 parked see withhold against the group the effort to move out of the group im just giving you 1200 100 and 200 so you can see what i mean by consecutively in time so we have childhood coaction with family teenage overt against the family young adulthood complete upset with the family and awfully parked withhold wont talk to the rest of the family you get the idea see well now this goes as far as this one can withhold ones self and you mustnt overlook this in processing that fellow who thinks he should have been drafted and join the army and who didnt then join the army will be found to be in possession of withhold which is inarticulate unless you know this particular fact he is withholding body you dont just withhold thoughts you just dont withhold deeds you can withhold body you can also withhold stolen goods you can also withhold objects of various kinds or another which really arent stolen but theyre withheld but withholding self is the commonest one because wherever person has engaged in dogfight such as i spoke about few minutes ago he all the time was trying to bring about the death of the other person while withholding himself from death which makes disagreed unreality about the whole thing theres agreement there of any kind whatsoever if you ask somebody get the idea of withholding your body thank you get the idea of withholding your body thank you hell wind up in all kinds of dogfights and all kinds of activities of one kind or another where he was trying to do something its not good method of spotting overts but that would find hell of lot of overts youd find lot of overts you say get the idea of withholding your body thank you get the idea of withholding your body thank you and the guy would be parked right in whole series of overts they wouldnt necessarily resolve because that isnt where hes stuck hes stuck just little bit later in each particular case because if hes stuck at all because withholding your body from dogfight is moral action that is moral action its immoral to depart from your squadron but to do something which is against the survival of the squadron and withhold that is far more aberrative far more aberrative so the transgressions against the group well thats all this thing adds up to thats all there is to it thats all there is to an overt actmotivator sequence that is all there is to taking one apart and that is how everybody is stuck now ill give you ive given you class ii auditor skill which is simply locate the prior confusion now when you locate the prior confusion of course youre going to locate some prior co motion motion with and you will fall at once into an overt and then youll fall into the withhold and you keep saying prior confusion and youll just go bingbing see you can force the pcs attention into the prior confusion they come up to the overt and theyll hit the withhold zoomp boomp bang its just one two three because thats the way it goes because theyre held on the track by the prior confusion apparently held on the track by the prior confusion but only because they have withhold later so it takes all three steps to park somebody on the track it takes prior coaction then it takes an overt and then it takes withhold and when youve got those three things you get person stuck on the track and thats all there is to it and that makes up the reactive bank and that is the anatomy of the reactive bank first there is coaction then there are overts and then there are withholds and then that compositely gives us eventually total jam of time and that total jam of time totally buried becomes the reactive mind and that is the reactive mind and thats all there is to the anatomy of the reactive mind thats the lot now when you clear somebody you of course clear those identities which the person has more or less teamed up with and those identities and their nowimsupposedtos and their particular withholds and withholding these identities and helping the first helping the survival of the identity then overts with or against the identity and then withholds with or from the identity and that is the goals terminal that you are running and thats the anatomy of the goals terminal when you get right down to it when you run the prehav scale you run all the sides of this thing off every engram person has has these stucks that has this sequence in it this you will find every place this is the pattern which is stamped all over the universe now i would be less than kind if i didnt give you very broad general process that anybody could run rather easily but there is one which knocks this rather heavily there is one which is rather amusing there is rather amusing experimental process about this is you find something the person has identified with something and you simply tell him to think of mutual action with the one and then mutual action with the other and of course these two identifications will spring apart im giving you an idea you find out quite by accident or by being smart or something of the sort you find out that the pc has horses and beds totally identified so you say all right think of coaction or mutual action with horse good think of mutual action with bed thank you think of mutual action with horse good think of mutual action with bed thank you and all of sudden these two identifications will spring apart dont get bugged off into this because all of sudden fifteen or twenty other subjects will emerge out of that particular zone well dont get him to thinking about those too just keep him with horses and beds oh hell be thinking about horses women beds thats the first thing thatll appear on the thing well if you qed and aed with him youd say well think of horse think of woman think of bed think of mutual action with woman think of mutual action with bed thats been suggested to him dont you see by the stuff thats coming up well dont qanda with it because the next thing you know hed think in connection with beds laundresses for some reason or other you see if you qed and aed youd say think of mutual action with horse think of mutual action with woman think of mutual action with bed think of mutual action with laundresses see and this will keep on and you could get about seven or eight hundred of these things and seven or eight hundred pieces of the auditing command itd be seven hundred or eight hundred parts to the auditing command if you just kept this up so you better not do that you just better say think of mutual action with horse think of mutual action with bed and go on that way and he will just give you more stuff that is tearing off of the bank because of course youve found point of direct cross that is not very practical activity but its an interesting activity here is one however which is very practical and is abroad one command process and nothing else but and that process is tell group you are longer part of or any phrase phrasing thereof thank you audience thank you
