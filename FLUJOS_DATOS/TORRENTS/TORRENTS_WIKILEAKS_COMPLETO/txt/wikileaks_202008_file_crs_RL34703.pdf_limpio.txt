clause laws allow medical pr oviders to refuse to provide services to which they have religious or moral obj ections these laws are generally designed to reconcile the conflict between religi ous health care providers who provide care in accordance with their religious beliefs and the patients who want access to medical care that these religious pr oviders find objectionable1 although conscience clause laws have grown to encompass protections for entities that object to wide array of medical services and procedures such as providing contraceptives or terminating lifesupport the original focus of cons cience clause laws was on permitting health care providers to refuse to participate in abortion or sterilization procedures on religious or moral grounds historical background in 1973 congress passed the first consci ence clause law commonly referred to as the church amendment2 in response to the us supreme courts decision in roe v wade and us district court decision that enjoined catholic hospital from prohibiting physician from performing sterilization procedure at the facility3 during consideration of the church ame ndment senator frank church explained the need for the conscience clause stating it clears up any ambiguity in the present law by making it explicitly clear that it is not the intention of congress to mandate religious hospitals to perform operations that are contrary to deeply held religious beliefs4 the church amendment provides that indi viduals or entities that receive grants contracts loans or loan guarantees under the public h ealth service act phsa the community mental health centers act or the developmental disabilities services and facilities construction act may not be required to perform abortions or sterilization procedures or make facilities or personnel available for the performance of such procedures if such performance would be contrary to the individual orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34703crs2 5 42 usc 300a7b 6 42 usc 300a7c 7

the sp ecified statutes or under biomedical or behavioral research progra m administered by the department of health and human services hhs from engaging in employment discrimination against doctors or other medical personnel who ither perform abortions or sterilization procedures or who refuse to perform ch services on moral or religious grounds6 by 1978 five years after the courts decision in roe virtually all of the states had enacted conscience clause legislation in one form or another7 from 1978 to 1996 there was lull in conscience clause activity with one exception when congress enacted the civil rights restor ation act in 1988 it adopted the danforth amendment which mandates neutrality with respect to abortion8 specifically the amendment clarifies that title ix of the education amendments of 1972 which prohibits sex discriminati on in federally funded edu cation programs may not be construed to prohibit or require any individual or entity to provide or pay for abortionrelated services nor may it be construed to permit the imposition of penalty on any person who has sought or received abortionrelated services9 nearly decade after the danforth amendment congress passed additional conscience provisions in th omnibus consolidated re scissions and appropriations act of 199610 under the act which added sec tion 245 to the phsa the federal government and state and local governme nts are prohibited from discriminating against health care entities that refuse to undergo abortion training provide such training perform abortions or provide refe rrals for the relevant training or for abortions11 section 245 protects doctors medi cal students and health training programs from being denied federal financial assistance or license or certification that they would otherwise receive but for their refusal to provide abortion services or training12 one year after passing the 1996 omnibus legislation congress again revisited the abortion conscience clause issue when it approved the balanced budget act of 199713 concerned that managed care plans might seek to prevent doctors from informing patients about medical services not covered by their health plans congresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34703crs3 14 42 usc 1395w22j3a 42 usc 1396u2b3a 15 42 usc 1395w22j3b 42 usc 1396u2b3b 16 despite the new exemptions regarding the provision of counseling

medicare and medicai d programs to prohibit managed care plans from restricting the ability of health care professionals to discuss the full range of treatment options with their patients14 the legislation however simultaneously exempted managed care providers under th programs from the requirement to provide reimburse for or pr ovide coverage of counselin g or referral service if the managed care plan objects to the service on moral or religious grounds thus medicare and medicaid managed care plan cannot prevent providers from providing abortion counseling or referra l services but it can refuse to pay providers for providing such information although the pl an must notify new and existing enrollees of such policy if it does indeed have one15 the effect of the 1997 legislation was to extend the coverage of conscience clause laws beyond the individuals who pr ovide medical care to the companies that pay for such care under the medicare nd medicaid programs the law allows medicare and medicaidfunded health plans to refuse to provide counseling and referral for abortionrelated services earlier conscience clause laws permitted providers to opt out only of the actual provision of such services16 the 1997 legislation would appear to have broader impact than the 1973 church amendment both in terms of its effect on the entities that may refuse to provide abortion services and on the indivi duals who wish to access such services in similar vein recent abortion bills intr oduced in congress have proposed changes that would expand the scope of current cons cience clause laws this legislation is discussed in the next section recent legislation and it s effect on existing law the abortion nondiscrimination act anda has been introduced in every congress since the 107th congress17 in general anda would amend the nondiscrimination provision in the phsa to expand the definition of the term health care entity to include hospitals pr ovidersponsored organizations health maintenance organizations hmos health insurance plans or any other kind of health care facility organization or plan supporters of anda maintain that expa nding the definition of health care entity is necessary because some state legislatures and courts have weakened existing conscience clause protections whic h proponents view as critical to shielding religious hospitals and other medical providers that oppose abortion opponents contend however that anda would impose serious restrictions on womanshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34703crs4 18 reuters house

also for financial reasons such as the desire to save money by re ducing coverage18 although anda has not been considered by recent congresses conscience clause provisions with similar language were inserted in the fy2005 fy2006 and fy2008 appropriations measures for th departments of labor hhs and education19 these provisions are commonly re ferred to as the weldon amendment because they were added to the fy2005 appropriations measure following the adoption of an amendment offered by re presentative dave weldon the language used in the appropriations measures has remained the same since 2004 the provisions state none of the funds made available in this act may be made available to federal agency or program or to state or cal government if such agency program or government subjects any institutional or individual health care tity to discrimination on the basis that the health care entity does not provide pay for provide coverage of or refer for abortions20 the weldon amendment defines the term health care entity to include an individual physician or other health car professional hospital provider sponsored organization health maintenan ce organization health insurance plan or any other kind of health car facility organization or plan21 the weldon amendment prevents the fe deral government and state and local governments from enacting policies that require health care entities to provide or pay for certain abortionrelated services in addition the weldon amendment increases both the number and type of health care pr oviders and professiona ls who could refuse to provide abortion training or services w ithout reprisals for example prior law protected only individual docto rs or medical training pr ograms that did not provide abortions or abortion traini ng and appeared to appl primarily in the medical education setting or to doctors in their individual practices in contrast the appropriations provisions llow large health insurance companies and hmos to refuse to provide coverage or pay for abortions because an hmos refusal to provide abortionrelate d services would affect much larger number of patients than an individual doctors refusa l to provide

to us dept of health and hum services 3 sept 25 2008 available at httpwwwacluorgimages asset_upload_file467_36942pdf the expansion of the refusal statutes and the confusion caused by the proposed rule comes at the expense of the publics health particularly the health of lowincome womenthe potential of denying abor tionrelated services to significantly expanded number of individuals although the weldon amendment language is similar to the proposed anda it differs in two important respects fi rst anda would deny all federal funds to entities that engage in abortionrelate d discrimination the weldon amendment however denies only those funds ava ilable under the annual labor hhs and education appropriations measure second the passage of anda would result in permanent legislation while the weldon ame ndment language remains in effect for only the relevant fiscal years thus although the weldon amendment expands prior law it provides for smaller penalties and is temporary in nature proposed consci ence regulations on august 26 2008 hhs published proposed rule to implement the church amendment section 245 of the phsa nd the weldon amendmen t hhs indicates that new regulations are needed because the public and many health care providers are largely uninformed of the protections afforded to individuals and institutions under the federal conscience clause laws22 in addition the agency maintains that the development of health care environment that is intolerant of certain religious beliefs and cultural traditions may discourage individuals from diverse backgrounds from entering health care professions23 the proposed regulations identify require ments and prohibitions for recipients of hhs funds while these provisions are in many ways reiteration of the statutory requirements and prohibitions some argue that they would expand the reach of the conscience clause laws and possibly jeopard ize the health of individuals by making it more difficult to obtain health care services and information24 these concerns would appear to be highlighted by some of the new definitions proposed by hhs for relevant terms for example the definitions for the terms health servicehealth service program and assist in the performance seem to be broad enough to encompass variety of activities such breadth could result in increased opportunities to refuse par ticipation in the delivery of care or information the term health servicehealth servi ce program would be defined to include any plan or program that provides hea lth benefits whethe r directly

servicehealth service program it may be n ecessary for court to determine ultimately whether the definition encompasses the distri bution of contraceptives although michael leavitt the secretary of hhs has not discussed specifically the term health servicehealth service program he has been reported as stating that some medical providers may want to press the definition and argue that some contraceptives are tantamount to abortion see stephanie simon rules let health workers deny abortions regulations effect on c ontraception remains unclear wall st j aug 22 2008 at a3 29 conscience regulations at 50284 under the proposed regulations recipients and sub recipients of hhs funds would be required to certify that they will not discriminate on the basis of past involvement in or refusal to assist in the performance of an abortion or sterilization and will not require involvement in procedures that violate an individuals conscience as part of any health service prog ram in accord with all applicable sections of 45 cfr part 88insurance or otherwise which is f unded in whole or in part by hhs25 in the background section of the proposed rule hhs indicates that it would construe the term broadly building on this broad definition we propose that the term health service program should be understood to include an activity related in any way to providing medicine health care or any other service related to health or wellness including health insurance programs where federal funds are used to provide access to health coverage eg schip medicaid and medicare advantage similarly we propose that the term health service means any service so provided26 broad understanding of the rm could possibly lead to more individuals declining to provide health services or perform part of health service program under the proposed 45 cfr 884d1 any entity that carries out any part of any health service program funded in whole or in part under program administered by hhs could not require any individual to perform or assist in the performance of any part of the health service program if such service or activity would be contrary to his religi ous beliefs or mo ral convictions27 if the term health service is understood to include activities re lated in any way to providing medicine it seems possible that the distribution of oral contraceptives could be affected28 chain and independent pharmacies are in fact identified by hhs as entities thatwould be subject to the agencys proposed certification requirements 29 the term assist in the performan ce would be defined by the proposed regulations to mean to participate in any activity with reasonable connection to procedure health service or health servi ce program or research activity so long

ponentmainmaindocketdetaildhhs os20080011 additional concerns about the proposed regulations including the possible conflict between the regulations and the provision of family planning services under title x of the public health service act have been expressed in the commentsthe individual involved is part of th workforce of departmentfunded entity30 in the background section of the proposed rule hhs indicates that it proposes to interpret this term broadly as encompa ssing individuals who are members of the workforce of the departmentfunded entity performing the objectionable procedure31 employees who clean the instrument s used in particular procedure for example would be considered by hhs to assist in the performance of that procedure32 opponents of the proposed regulations ve criticized the possible breadth of the term assist in the performance some have argued that the definition could provide conscience protections to seemin gly tangential employees such as staff members tasked with schedu ling appointments and others involved with purchasing and inventorying supplies33 while the use of the word reasonable in the definition for assist in the performance would seem to suggest common sense approach to determining who would be covered within the defin ition the agencys stated intention to interpret the term broadly c ould in fact provide such employees with conscience protections the comment period for the proposed rule ended on september 25 2008 it appears that at least 2074 comments were r eceived by hhs prior to the end of the comment period34 the agency is expected to review the comments and make decision about whether to issue final rule
