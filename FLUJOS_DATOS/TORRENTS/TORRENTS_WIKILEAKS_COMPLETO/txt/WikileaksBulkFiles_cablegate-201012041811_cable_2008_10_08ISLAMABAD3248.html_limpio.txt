feierstein for reasons 14 bd 1 c summary the october 89 closed joint session of parliament convoked by president zardari to address the security situation has been widely praised as good first step in convincing pakistans elected leadership to take ownership of the fight against extremism this effort now should be extended to reach the general public director general of military operations ltgen pashas briefing to the group consisted largely of graphic video and other footage demonstrating what one parliamentarian called the inhumane and antiislamic nature of the militants pasha reportedly blamed india russia and the uae for supporting baloch and taliban militancy and defended pakistani sovereignty against incursions by us forces but reportedly he also spoke positively about what he termed the us use of drones noting the vast majority of those killed in drone attacks were foreign fighters or taliban 2 c the joint session has been extended by another four days beginning october 13 when information minister sherry rehman will present the gops strategy to fight extremism the session increasingly promises to be lively debate with the interior defense finance and foreign affairs ministers lined up to answer parliamentarians questions nsa durrani shared with charge october 10 draft of that presentation that follows classic counterinsurgency strategy it does say the gop has not given the us green light to do crossborder operations but uses that as launching pad to attack the presence of foreign militants and their violations of pakistani sovereignty it goes on to call on the tribes to eject the foreigners and support the government and offers them development assistance if they come around 3 c pakistan muslim leaguenawaz pmln leader nawaz sharif attended the briefing but left it to his opposition leader chaudhry nisar to criticize the government mostly on procedural terms so far by demanding that the civilian government explain their strategy and how it differs from that of the former musharraf government end summary 4 c president asif zardari convoked joint session of parliament on october 8 to be briefed by the military on the current security situation this was the third time in pakistans history that joint session of parliament was formed as committee of the whole to hear outside testimony the first was in 1974 to discuss religious riots the second was in 1988 to debate whether to sign the geneva peace accord on afghanistan chief of army staff general kayani attended but newly promoted ltgeneral pasha delivered the militarys brief as director general of military operations pasha moved over to become director of interservices intelligence on october 10 5 c lending sense of urgency to the proceedings on october 9 suicide bombers attacked an antiterrorism unit of islamabad police injuring dozen and set off roadside bomb in dir northwest frontier province nwfp killing 12 also on october 9 bearded man in burqa was arrested at islamabad airport on suspicion of terrorism across pakistan there have been numerous hoax bomb threats since the september 20 marriott bombing on october 10 over 60 the death toll is still rising members of an antitaliban jirga were killed in orakzai federally administered tribal areas fata and in bajaur fata the taliban beheaded four elders of the charmang tribe also on october 10 the taliban blew up the house of another awami national party leader in dir and kidnapped nazim mayor in swat nwfp earlier in the week explosions at several juice shops in lahore were blamed not on the taliban but on conservative groups reportedly seeking to discourage immoral behavior the bars were allegedly trysting places for unmarried couples these attacks followed the october 2 suicide bombing targeting awami national party leader asfundyar wali khan in wali bagh nwfp and the october 7 attack on pakistan muslim leaguenawaz parliamentarian in bhakkar punjab overall there have been 40 suicide bombings in pakistan so far in 2008 6 c the joint session was held in camera without press but parliamentarians have been providing bits and pieces of information about the briefing which was followed by question and answer session the original qa session islamabad 00003248 002 of 003 scheduled for 30 minutes lasted over four hours the parliament then convened in joint session on october 9 to continue questions it agreed to meet for another four days beginning october 13 when information minister sherry rehman will brief the group on the pakistan peoples party ppp strategy to tackle terrorism 7 c xxxxxxxxxxxx that pashas briefing consisted in large part of videos and photos of taliban and other terrorist organization activities that demonstrated the militants were both inhumane and unislamic at several points xxxxxxxxxxxx said female parliamentarians asked the army to stop showing disturbing footage including gory beheading members were told that india has established nine training camps along the afghan border where they are training members of the baloch liberation army according to xxxxxxxxxxxx pasha also claimed that india and the uae reportedly due to opposition to construction of the gwadar port were funding and arming the baloch pasha also claimed that the russian government was directly involved in fundingtrainingsupporting the insurgency 8 c xxxxxxxxxxxx said pasha briefed members on what he termed usg drone incursions and missile strikes according to xxxxxxxxxxxx pasha praised the us for its support through these methods and showed statistics to parliamentarians that demonstrated the vast majority of those killed in these attacks were either foreign fighters or taliban xxxxxxxxxxxx believed that the military had made goodfaith effort to portray usg activities as positive according to xxxxxxxxxxxx pasha barely mentioned the threat from local taliban leader baitullah mehsud 9 c other parliamentarians at dinner hosted october 10 by charge for scapb director hartley including pakistan peoples party ppp senators babar awan and enver baig pakistan muslim league assembly member donya aziz awami national party senator haji muhammed adeel fata parliamentarians shaukat ullah and munir khan orakzai and muttahdia quami movement mqm leader farouq sattar were less impressed by pashas brief they all said the brief was good beginning but characterized it as being largely descriptive and adding little information they did not already know they noted that pasha unsurprisingly defended pakistans sovereignty against us incursions they agreed that pasha had defended pakistans relationship with the us but did not share details from the briefing about foreign fighters killed in alleged us drone attacks 10 c both the fata parliamentarians and mqm said during the qa session they pointed out that not all terrorists were tribals and that the gop needed to address growing extremism in the punjab they noted that punjabis increasingly are moving to fight with militants in fata and that there is growing talibanization of karachi 11 c also attending the dinner was pakistan muslim leaguenawaz pmln information secretary ahsan iqbal iqbal echoed comments made publicly by pmln opposition leader chaudhry nisar both denigrated the briefing as being merely descriptive and called for the civilian government to explain its strategy to fight the militants nisar asked how the gops strategy differed from that of the former musharraf government nisar told the press it is noteworthy that suicide attack had taken place before the country became an ally of the us in the war on terror pmln leader ishak dar told the press that it was imperative that joint session of parliament be apprised of all agreements executed with the us interestingly nawaz sharif who attended the joint session did not comment on it publicly several newspaper editorials criticized the pmln leaders for jumping the gun on their criticism before the session was complete 12 c jamiat ulemaeislam leader fazlur rehman at news conference october 12 claimed his party had the vision to lead the country of the present crisis he blamed the entire military leadership not just former president musharraf and demanded they explain the agreedupon rules of engagement with usisaf coalition forces in afghanistan he reiterated his view that the us presence in afghanistan was the root cause of pakistans problems in the tribal areas and said foreign troops must leave afghanistan for the sake of islamabad 00003248 003 of 003 peace in the region he also said his party had serious reservations about the ongoing military operations in bajaur 13 c the jamaateislami ji party and the pukhtunkhwa milli awami party both of which oppose use of force in the tribal areas boycotted the session ji leader qazi hussain has this week been leading largely ignored train march to protest gop policies in the fata 14 c we expect sherry rehman will brief the now established gop strategy of 1 political engagement but not with terrorists 2 economic development and 3 use of force when necessary national security advisor durrani provided charge october 10 with draft of the gops presentation to the joint body which follows classic counterinsurgency strategy it does say the gop has not given the us green light to do crossborder operations but uses that as launching pad to attack the presence of foreign militants and their violations of pakistani sovereignty it goes on to call on the tribes to eject the foreigners and support the government and offers them development assistance if they come around 15 c comment the longpromised joint session is welcome first step in bringing pakistans elected leadership on board with the governments counterterrorism strategy the session is being extended to accommodate great deal of pentup opinion and emotion that has amassed over the past few years when the leadership kept parliament in the dark on security issues the government understandably wants to keep as much of that emotion contained in closeddoor session as possible and surprisingly little of the briefing content has been leaked to the press at some point however there needs to be public airing of views and concerns if the gop is going to increase public acknowledgment that this is pakistans war 16 c comment contd in other welcome developments at least one pakistani group perhaps bankrolled by the owner of the bombed marriott hotel in islamabad yeh hum naheen say to terrorism has been placing newspaper and tv ads in the urdu and english language press the groups aim is to collect the largest number of signatures ever on an antiterrorism petition we understand the information ministry is responsible for placing other antiterrorism ads in recent days on october 11 information minister malik spoke at an antiterrorism seminar organized in lahore again as part of longpromised outreach campaign by gop ministers
