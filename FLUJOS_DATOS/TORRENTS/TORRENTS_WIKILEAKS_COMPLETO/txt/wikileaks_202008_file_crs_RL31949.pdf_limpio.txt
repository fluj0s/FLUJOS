for macroeconomic feedback effects on revenue costs of tax changes has become increasingly important an analysis of these effects is now required before tax bill can come to the house floor the initial study of the presidents budget proposals for 2003 by the congressional budget office cbo revealed wide range of effectsfrom 30 decrease in revenues to 15 increase subsequent studies and studies by the joint committee on taxation and the treasury department also find varying results these differences reflect the types of effects included the models used and the behavioral responses there are three types of effects shortrun stimulus or keynesian effects which reduce costs crowding out effects of deficits which increase costs and supply side effects which could go in either direction there are four basic types of models neoclassical growth models shortrun models with unemployed resources and infinite horizon and life cycle intertemporal models only the second type includes keynesian effects all include supply side effects deficit effects can be included but eventually have to be resolved in certain intertemporal models or the models cannot be solved arguments have been made that keynesian effects not be considered these effects also apply to spending are not the objective of permanent tax policy and are dependent on how tax cuts are financed and the reaction of the federal reserve the two models cbo used with keynesian effects found opposing effects some also argue that the effects of deficits should not be considered because these effects as well apply to spending and eventually deficit issues must be resolved supply side effects in neoclassical growth models include labor supply response savings response and the ability to substitute labor and capital given reasonable savings elasticities savings effects are not very important in the short run the main issue is labor supply most evidence suggests however that labor supply response is small so that assuming response is probably reasonable it is even less likely that labor can respond in the short run where considerable institutional barriers exist intertemporal models are based on individual optimization over long period of time there are three reservations about these models first do they represent actual behavior of individuals second the outcomes are sensitive to many assumptions and the behavioral responses in many of these models including those used by cbo result in much larger savings and labor supply responses than are justified by empirical evidence finally intertemporal models with foresight cannot be solved without some presumption about how the budget deficit is dealt with and the choice can make great deal of difference in the outcome indeed it changes the direction of effects these models cannot address standalone tax cut the range of results in the congressional budget office study would be even larger if further sensitivity analysis for supply response were undertaken in particular such sensitivity analysis would probably cause larger additional costs rather than revenue offsets from feedback effects this report will not be updated

effects of tax changes on revenues has become increasingly important the joint committee on taxation jct has been engaged for some tim with study of how to include these effects and has been attempting to develop model for this purpose in early 2003 rule adopted by the house required macroeconomic analysis to be prepared or reason given for why it cannot be prepared before tax legislation can come to the floor and this rule has been retained by subsequent congresses also in 2003 the congressional budget office cbo presented its first dynamic analysis of the presidents budgetary proposals using variety of models and assumptions hereafter cbo study 1 these proposals provided for permanent tax cuts in individual rates and on income from capital range of effects both positive and negative although generally small was reported in these analyses with feedback effects on budgetary costs ranging from 15 increase in cost to 17 decrease in cost the cbo study examined both spending and tax changes and considered effects on the entire budget including effects of increased interest on the debt the cbo has subsequently produced studies of both the presidents budget and other proposals the most recent study was of the presidents fy2008 budget proposal 2 as with the 2003 study feedback effects were relatively small and ranged from positive to negative subsequently the jct prepared an analysis of the tax cut passed in the house on may 9 2003 hereafter jct study3 this tax cut was temporary in nature and many of the provisions directly affecting wage income had effects only in the first five years because they were accelerations of existing tax cuts the jct analysis focused only on revenue effects and not the entire budget average effects over the 10year period were reduction in revenue costs ranging from 26 to 234 however its study while estimating positive effects on real output in the first five years found negative effects in the second five years and these effects would be expected to continue to be negative the jct has continued its studies the most recent study was of income tax reform proposal that would broaden the base and lower the rate 4 this proposal was not tax cut but revenue neutral reform and resulted in output increases ranging from 01 to 12 for the first five years depending on the model used the treasury departments office of tax analysis prepared its first dynamic analysis in 2006 with study of the proposals by the presidents advisory panel on tax reform also revenue neutral tax change5 for the income tax reform the effects on output in the budget window ranged from 01 to 04 for the consumption tax proposal the effects ranged from 01 to 196 subsequent analysis examined the effects of the 20012004 tax cuts7 this

would be reduced by 7 in their base case and would range depending on responses in the models from less than 1 to 188 treasury also reported some shortrun effects in its midsession review9 the estimates of feedback effect depend on the kinds of effects included the nature of the model used and variety of assumptions regarding unde rlying behavioral responses this report explains these issues and discusses the empirical evidence on some of the crucial supplyside behavioral responses some of the more technical material and details are presented in appendices the first section explains the three basic sources of feedback effects that can be considered short run stimulus deficit crowdingout and supply side and how these three effects relate to the four basic types of models

shortrun stimulus or keynesian effects crowding out effects of deficits supply side effects the first twothe shortrun stimulus effect in an underemployed economy and the crowding out effects of deficitsapply to spending increases as well as tax cuts spending increases actually have more powerful effect than most tax cuts because some fraction of tax cut is not spent some have argued that the first effect or even the first two effects should not be included in dynamic revenue estimates the third type of effect is commonly called supply side effect because it refers to the effects of tax or other policies on the amount of labor supplied or the amount of savings which would affect the size of the capital stock this supply side effect is more closely associated with tax changes although it could apply to certain spending programs as well for example spending on infrastructure such as bridges or highways would affect productivity there are also four basic types of economic models all of these models can incorporate supply side effects but they vary in whether and how they incorporate the keynesian or deficit crowding out effects 10 basic neoclassical growth models also called solow

midsession review budget of the us government july 11 2006 10 this report does not address direct estimates of tax revenue response to specific tax changes since these responses cannot be generalized across different tax cuts httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31949g11g156g156g158g142g156g561g146g151g561g6g162g151g138g150g146g140g561g20g142g159g142g151g158g142g561g7g156g157g146g150g138g157g146g151g144g561

shortrun forecasting these models are also referred to as islm11 models and usually transition or are made to transition to neoclassical growth model infinite horizon intertemporal models also called ramsey models or referred to as barrotype models and life cycle intertemporal models also called overlapping generation or olg models only the second type of model can include shortrun stimulus effects because all of the other models are full employment models all of the models include supply side effects but they introduce them in different ways in the basic neoclassical growth model and the islmgrowth model the savings rate and the labor supply depend or can be made to depend on aftertax rates of return on savings and aftertax wage rates and the elasticities percentage change in quantity divided by percentage change in price used are derived directly from statistical estimates of these parameters referred to as reduced forms change in tax rates on labor or capital income induces changes in savings rates and labor supply that affect output in this period and the capital stock in the next period the change in the capital stock alters the return on capital and wage and induces another adjustment in the savings rate and labor supply this process continues over period of time until it approaches new equilibrium where the savings generated in the economy just equals the amount of net investment needed to grow the economy at stead state the effects are determined by three responses the savings elasticity the labor supply elasticity and the factor substitution elasticity the last reflects the ease with which labor and capital are substituted in the production process in the infinite horizon and life cycle models savings and depending on the model labor supply arise from an optimization of spending over timeover infinity in the infinite horizon model and over lifetime in the life cycle model the size of these effects depends on many different factors but some of the important ones are the willingness of individuals to substitute leisure for consumption within time period measured by the intratemporal substitution elasticity the willingness of consumers to substitute over time the intertemporal substitution elasticity and the factor substitution elasticity another very important feature of these models for the short run is the amount of available hours which directly affects the labor supply response that arises from the model all of the models can deal with deficit effects but the infinite horizon model and some versions of the life cycle model those with foresight cannot permit deficits to run indefinitely because deficits eventually cause the model to explode ie the cumulating deficit will grow without limit these types of models rely on future values to solve even the very short run and must be subject to government budget constraint which requires the budget deficit eventually to be addressed how the budget deficit is addressed can make great deal of difference to the outcome 11 islm refers to the two basic demand side equations in shortrun model that determine aggregate demand levels and interest rates an investmentsavings relationship where output is the sum of spending on consumption investment government expenditures and net exports and money demand equation where individuals trade off liquidity against interest rates in determining how much assets are held in money versus bonds

provisions the joint committee on taxation jct convened number of researchers in 1996 for study for fundamental tax reform with results published in 1997 hereafter referred to as the jct symposium models there represented two of the first type three of the second type one of the third type and three of the final type12 these studies focused largely on supply side effects because the groups modeled revenueneutral tax substitutions although the disruptions from changing tax collection sources caused some negative shortrun effects in models with unemployment the two recent studies presented in march and may of 2003 respectively also used variety of model types the cbo study analyzed the presidents budget proposals using all of these model types the jct study used the two m odels of the second type and one of the fourth type 13 more recently jct has used one model of each except the first type although the infinite horizon intertemporal model was substantially modified to include share of individuals who simply spend all of their income treasury initially used the first third and fourth type in its analysis of the tax reform proposals it has used the second third and fourth types in its analyses of the 20012004 tax cut different models have different strengths and weaknesses moreover because of the complexity of modeling within each type of model certain aspects may modeled in great detail and others simplified for example of the three life cycle models represented in the 1997 jct symposium one model used perfect foresight the assumption that consumers can project the effects of their behavior on future rates of return and wage rates but had single good and single representative income level another life cycle model had considerable detail with respect to different industry sectors different types of assets and different income levels of individuals but did not assume agents could predict and act on future prices third life cycle model had neither perfect foresight nor disaggregation but allowed for risk uncertainty and precautionary savings comparative studies have shown that these models are sensitive to variety of parameters and assumptions and numerous characteristics that can influence effects on behavior in life cycle models 14 there are issues surrounding the estimation and even the appropriateness of including these various effects which are discussed in turn 12 the results were presented in joint committee on taxation tax modeling project and 1997 symposium papers joint committee print jcs2197 us government printing office 1997 13 note that although the jct refers to its macroeconomic equilibrium growth model as neoclassical growth model it actually falls in the category of models with underemp loyment equilibrium which become similar to neoclassical growth models in the long run 14 these characteristics include presence of endogenous labor myopia vs perfect foresight regarding pretax rates of return and wage rates uncertainty the presence of bequests and the bequest determination arising from intergenerational altruism joyofgiving uncertain lif espan fixed size of bequest existing consumption tax treatment substitution elasticities interte mporal intratemporal and factor subs titution use of stonegeary utility function which requires minimum consumption in each time period inclusion of depreciation assumed size of potential work hours single vs multisector economy and open vs closed economy for the tax substitution experiment the presence and form of transition relief

economy keynesian effects where real output increases because of the employment of involuntarily unemployed labor the effect is relatively straightforward output rises by some multiple of the tax cut called the multiplier that arises from successive rounds of spending the original tax cut the spending of those who re ceive income from the individual round and so forth that increase results in feedback effect at least for the time the output is increased multipliers typically rise as the fiscal stimulus spreads through the economy but then fall as the economy returns to full employment if the multiplier is 1 for given year and the tax rate is 02 then there is 20 revenue feedback effect for that year arising from the stimulus the first issue is whether these stimulus effects should be included at all especially if the dynamic estimate is to be the official estimate for budget scoring purposes use not currently contemplated rather than for informational purposes principal reason for excluding these effects is that they also apply to spending incr eases and to consider shortrun effects for tax changes and not for spending changes would create misperception of the relative costs of these alternatives moreover if the purpose of the tax cut is as stimulus it is unclear what the value of calculating the feedback effect is the relevant public policy issue is not the cost after feedback but rather the desirable size and effectiveness of the initial tax cut on output an assessment that requires knowing the cost without feedback if the purpose is permanent tax cut however then any shortrun feedback effect is transitory and to include it in assessing the cost of tax cut can make the cost appear artificially small aside from these issues of whether to include the stimulus effect there are number of reasons that such an effect is difficult to assess ce the effect depends on how close the economy is to full employment several tax cuts considered separately would have larger summed up effect on output than combined tax indeed the feedback effect might be different at the time tax is proposed compared to the time it is actually enacted moreover tax cut bill may be considered to be financed by deficit in which case it would have stimulus effect by spending offset in which case it would probably have slightly contractionary effect or by an offsetting tax increase any analysis that includes stimulus effect is making an implicit judgment about whether the tax cut would be financed by borrowing another reservation about incorporating shortrun effects is that they depend on the actions taken by the federal reserve board in theory any fiscal stimulus could be offset by contractionary monetary policy or accommodated with expansionary policy although this effect is less likely under current monetary regimes the degree to and speed with which the monetary authorities act to offset or magnify the effects of tax cut will determine how large the effect will be which means that each analysis implicitly includes an assumption about the behavior of another government agent tax change might also induce behavioral changes by foreign governments that affect the impact the final problem is the accuracy with which the stimulus effect can be estimated the effect of tax cut on output depends crucially on several factors on which the economics community does not have consensus for example there is considerable disagreement about how much of an individual tax cut will be spent depending on how expectations about the future are presumed to be formed whether tax cut is permanent or temporary whether it is received by higher or lower

through withholding effects of an investment stimulus provided to firms are even more uncertain because of lack of empirical evidence on the responsiveness of business investment to tax subsidies the effects are also influenced by the degree to which interest rates rise as income expands and the subsequent crowding out of private investment the degree of openness of the economy is also crucial in flexible exchange rate environment with very mob ile capital fiscal stimulus has little power other than in the very short run because the associated rise in interest rates which induces an inflow of foreign capital will cause the price of the dollar to rise and reduce net exports in such model investment crowding out is greatly reduced but so is the output effect finally shift in aggregate demand will cause some increase in output and some increase in price level the relative shares depend or should depend on how close the economy is to full employment to the extent that prices rise feedback effects can become very confusing unless they are expressed in constant dollars 15 the estimated stimulus effect depends on which model is used study by economists at the federal reserve board holding nominal interest rates fixed which produces the largest multipliers via an accommodative fed stance found that multipliers while larger for spending change than tax cut varied substantially across four models considered the federal reserves own model an older federal reserve model and two commercial macroeconomic models dri and washington university macro model wumm 16 after two years multipliers for tax cuts ranged from 1 to 175 the overall effect on deficits which depends not only on output change but interest rate effects also varied substantiall the authors suggest that the multipliers in the federal reserves model tend to be smaller because they have forward looking expectations the multipliers would all of course be smaller if money supply were contracted or even held constant rather than expanded gregory mankiw for example reports the tax multiplier in major macroeconomic model data resources inc or dri predecessor of driwefa and in turn predecessor of global insight is 119 if the interest rate is held constant which would require monetary expansion 026 if the money supply is held constant the interest rate would rise but output could also rise and zero if the inflation rate is held constant the interest rate rises so much that output is fixed 17 as an illustration of the differences in the models the 2003 cbo study of the presidents proposal compared simulations on two commercial macro models macroeconomic advisors which is the current version of wumm and global insight model that resulted from merger of dri with another modeling firm feedback effects varied from positive to negative because of the offsetting effect of deficits discussed next and differed substantially across models ranging from an increase in cost of 9 in the first five years to decrease of 29 it is clear from the disaggregation reported by cbo that the effects on revenues were largely composed of shortrun keynesian effects in its initial study in 2003 the jct used its own model termed macroeconomic growth model or meg adapted from macroeconomic advisors and the global insight model to assess effects on real revenues and thus did not include the direct effects of higher interest costs arising from the deficit only the crowding out effects on capital income and 15 if effects are expressed in nominal dollars cut in taxes can appear to be less costly because the increase in price level increases the nominal level of receipts this price effect also increases any spending that is tied to inflation but since much spending is set in nominal terms this change will also cause the nominal deficit to fall basically by effectively reducing the real level of government spending 16 eileen mauskopf and david reifschneider dynamic scoring fiscal policy and the

varied significantly depending on the model and federal reserve action from 36 revenue offset for meg with an aggressive fed offset to 234 for meg with fed neutrality for global insight which has delayed fed offset the feedback was 118 for the house tax bill clearly the dominant effect was shortrun stimulus but that effect is partly due to the transitory nature of the tax cuts and the focus on the revenue side g6g142g143g146g140g146g157g561g7g143g143g142g140g157g156g561g138g151g141g561g5g155g152g160g141g146g151g144g561g17g158g157g561 while the shortrun stimulus effect acts to reduce the revenue cost of tax cut the effect of deficits causes tax cuts to cost more one cannot have shortrun stimulus without deficit but one can have deficit without shortrun stimulus for example if the monetary authorities offset the fiscal stimulus there are three types of deficit effects first the interest on debt issued to finance the tax cut increases spending costs directly for dynamic studies of budget effects such as those done in the cbo study these interest rate effects are already in cluded in initial budgetary costs deficits also crowd out investment and reduce the capital stoc k and thus reduce long run output and taxes on that outputeffects that show up as feedback increasing revenue costs deficits also add to budgetary costs because they raise interest rates and increase the cost of debt service some of the same reservations about including stimulus effects also apply to including deficit effects mainly that deficit effects occur with spending increases as well as tax cuts while the effect of deficit finance is probably more certain than the effects on shortrun stimulus there are some major uncertainties first if tax cut is saved rather than spent it does not have an effect on interest rates or crowding out nor does it have an effect on stimulating the economy however empirical elasticities suggest that even tax cuts that reduce marginal taxes on savings are unlikely to unleash enough savings to offset the deficit effect the effects of deficits on interest rates and crowding out of investment can be partially or even fully offset by inflows of capital which again reduce or eliminate the stimulus effect given flexible exchange rates if full offset occurred there might still be an additional cost to revenues because foreign owners of capital do not pay us individual income taxes in most cases and interest on debt which is more mobile is deductible by us firms the amount of income available to us citizens would decline however because more of the capital stock would be owned by foreigners one other problem with deficits is that while they can simply be allowed to occur in models that do not rely on long run variables to solve the deficit must be addressed in order to solve the infinite horizon model or the perfect foresight life cycle model deficits running indefinitely cause an explosive growth of the debt which eventually supplants all the capital stock leading to long run economy with output two issues arise how long might one wait to resolve the deficit issue and how should the deficit be corrected these issues are intertwined with the supply side effects in these intertemporal models and will be discussed in the subsequent section

g9g155g152g160g157g145g561g15g152g141g142g149g561 fundamental supply side effects occur largely through increased labor supply or increased saving although note that either can be positive or negative due to income and substitution effects an increase in the labor supply or the savings rate in response to tax cut would produce additional income and taxes that would reduce the cost of the tax cut however increased saving is unlikely to have much effect on federal revenue in the revenue estimating time frame while labor supply changes can be important the cbo study has relatively small income and substitution effects that average out to total elasticity of about 01 for an acrosstheboard wage change its neoclassical model yielded negative feedback effects because the labor supply elasticities were small while additions to the debt caused additional interest costs the jct study also had small effects with total elasticity of 005 in the base case and 0 in the low elasticity case the jct model is not pure neoclassical model even with an aggressive fed reaction case and the estimates reported are only for the effects on revenues however its feedback was relatively small 98 in the first five years and 36 in the next 10 years real output fell in the second five years presumably because of the temporary nature of the tax cuts affecting wages in the tax bill coupled with some budgetary crowding out simple example can be used to illustrate why labor supply is crucial to effects on output empirical evidence on savings elasticities suggests values that range from slightly negative to slightly positive but even taking the highest of these elasticities 04 10 increase in rate of return would lead to 4 increase in the savings rate if the capital stock is growing at say 3 in real terms savings would be only 3 of the capital stock thus 4 increase in the savings rate would lead to 012 003 x 4 increase in the capital stock assuming capital income accounts for one quarter of net income total income would increase by about 03 025 x 012 that is only 3100 of 1 percent this effect does not account for interaction with demand an elasticity of 04 for labor supply would lead to an output effect of 3 with 10 increase in the wage again without accounting for demand interaction an effect 100 times as large the savings effects will grow over time but will be small initially another way of thinking about this effect is to think of feedback effects again before considering effects of the production function interaction if an elasticity is 02 then roughly speaking the revenue feedback effect is on the order of 20 times the ratio of tax rate to after tax share see appendix for example if the tax rate is 03 reduction in wage tax will lead to an offset of about 9 20 x03103 that effect means that even small labor supply responses can potentially have significant feedback effects thus in order to get an accurate measure of the revenue response it is crucial to have good measure of labor supply response the factor substitution elasticity to which little attention has been paid in many models can also play an important role as it determines both the demand for labor which interacts with supply to produce final amount of labor also derived in appendix the first section of this part therefore addresses labor supply responses it is specifically addressed to whether adequate evidence on point elasticity exists to incorporate labor supply response into revenue estimate what such an estimate might be and whether range of effects might be considered the information is presented in the body of the paper in summary form but details are presented in appendix b the next sections discuss the factor substitution elasticity and elasticity of savings responses httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31949g11g156g156g158g142g156g561g146g151g561g6g162g151g138g150g146g140g561g20g142g159g142g151g158g142g561g7g156g157g146g150g138g157g146g151g144g561 g561

into income and substitution effects and by type of worker in the neoclassical growth models the labor supply elasticity in intertemporal models is derived from particular function and will be discussed subsequently the supply of labor can rise or fall with an increase in wages due to opposing income and substitution effects rise in wages causes an increase through the income effect of consumption of both goods and leisure which reduces labor supply this income effect can also arise from changes in average tax rates the rise in wages also causes leisure to become relatively more costly inducing substitution of consumption for leisure which causes the labor supply to rise this substitution effect is governed by marginal changes in wages which are affected by marginal tax rates thus evaluating labor supply response to tax changes involves knowing the relative sizes of the income and substitution effects as well are the net effect of wage changes on labor supply labor supply can also reflect changes in hours or changes in participation the latter has particularly been of interest in the case of womens labor supply since women because of marriage and children may not participate in the labor force this section begins with overview of the em pirical evidence followed by discussion of theoretical problems associated with that evidence and then by the implications of both for incorporating labor supply response in scoring of tax legislation the survey of econometric estimates indicates that both positive and negative labor supply responses to wage rate increases can be justified by the empirical evidence findings consistent with economic theory empirical estimates from the literature also likely overstate the elasticities appropriate to dynamic revenue estimating for several reasons g7g150g153g146g155g146g140g138g149g561g7g159g146g141g142g151g140g142g561 empirical evidence on labor supply can be classified into several types historical patterns cross section regressions experimental approaches n atural or otherwise and even survey data appendix b provides more detailed discussion of the evidence but the findings can be summed up as follows history suggests declining or more recently relatively unchanging number of hours worked per week despite dramatic changes in real wages findings consistent with very small and possibly negative elasticities participation rates are mixed participation of older and ounger men has declined participation of prime working age men has been constant and participation of women has increased but is now leveling out institutional and cultural factors may play an important role in these findings cross section evidence18 which is the most plentiful suggests small income and substitution effects with net negative but small labor supply response for men probably of around 01 for married women labor supply response is more 18 crosssection evidence compares the hours different individuals work in given time period and relates these hours to their wages cross section evidence can be contrasted to time series evidence which examines changes in average hours as related to changes in average real wages over time httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31949g11g156g156g158g142g156g561g146g151g561g6g162g151g138g150g146g140g561g20g142g159g142g151g158g142g561g7g156g157g146g150g138g157g146g151g144g561 g561

studies are fraught with numerous econometric problems more recent evidence suggests that married womens labor supply response has declined and is converging toward that of men experimental approaches were of two types actual experiments with lower income individuals tended to find small elasticities of mixed signs and natural experiments such as tax changes tended to find virtually effect in the latter case one study found elasticities of 06 to 1 for high income married women although this measure may have reflected only substitution effects and the effects were quite sensitive to controls other aggregate studies and studies of high income men found essentially response survey data asking individuals about their behavioral responses are often held to be unreliable but they have suggested small response by affluent men survey data on actual knowledge and work experience have suggested that individuals do not know their marginal tax rates and might not respond for that reason and that many individuals do not work their optimal hours which suggests institutional factors may restrict behavioral response

hours worked or participation to wage rates suggest small elasticities in most cases for example hours of work by men with significantly different hourly earnings actually tend to vary very little to understand more about the responses and to prepare for understanding labor supply in intertemporal models we consider how labor supply responses arise from more formal model of individual optimization it is important to understand several theoretical issues labor supply response is limited by the amount of hours in the day labor response is limited by the number of potential workers any labor supply response to wages presents an important dilemma for growth accounting and institutional factors play potentially important role in limiting labor supply response particularly in the short run g5g152g151g156g157g155g138g146g151g157g156g561g152g151g561g10g152g158g155g156g561 the labor supply elasticity is derived from the substitution between consumption and leisure that is reason to expect it might be small suppose that we make the assumption that leisure and goods consumed by individuals increase by the same percentage when income increases in way that does not affect the marginal wage technically this assumption means use of utility function for leisure and consumption that is constant returns to scale utility function and thus has an income elasticity of one also assume that the substitution elasticity between goods and consumption with respect to the marginal wage is constant see appendix b for derivation we keep the problem simplified by allowing savings behavior and designate w as the wage rate h as the hours available l as leisure c as consumption and r as the ratio of nonlabor income to labor income with nonlabor income we obtain mathematical expression for the labor supply elasticity of the form s1 lh

to find for s for many types of choices we would think of high substitution elasticities as those above one and low elasticities as those less than one the more disparate commodities are the more likely that there is not lot of substitution between them if for example one considers consumption of goods and leisure to be very different commodities one might not expect them to be easily substitutable the s term determines the effect of rise in wages on increasing work effort through the substitution effect while the 1 term determines the effect of rise in wages in reducing work effort through the income effect labor supply response can be positive negative or zero depending on the size of s small labor supply response could be the result of large or small offsetting income and substitution elasticities however as the formula indicates even if leisure and consumption have unitary substitution elasticity the effect of this substitution elasticity on labor supply is smaller and perhaps much smaller than the substitution elasticity itself because it is multiplied by the ratio of leisure to available hours this effect makes sense person who is working every available minute cannot add to labor supply because his labor supply is constrained by an exogenous amount of time as discussed in the appendix this ratio of available leisure that can be diverted to work could be quite small if one allows for other necessary uses of time the other point illustrated by this formula is that the labor supply elasticity is not constant even if the underlying income and substitution elasticities with respect to consumption and leisure are as work increases the elasticity falls this point is important because it suggests that one should not impose simple labor supply elasticity across any significant period of time but assuming rise in real wages should have an elasticity that falls over time becomes smaller absolute value if positive and work is increasing and larger absolute value if negative and work is decreasing moreover it suggests that elasticities are smaller for those working more hours reason mentioned by wilhelm and moffitt in their study finding little labor supply response by very high income men 19 the example of hours response discussed here is meant only to be illustrative as it is based on specific form of utility function that includes unitary income elasticities and constant substitution elasticities adding nonlabor income or requiri ng subsistence amount of consumption other things equal is likely to increase in the first case and decrease in the second case the likelihood of positive elasticity and the size of the substitution elasticity there are many other types of functional forms where elasticities vary across consumption bundles and income elasticities can differ for leisure and consumption however the constraints of labor supply exist and those constraints exert limits on elasticities regardless of functional form people working every available hour can work more g5g152g151g156g157g155g138g146g151g157g156g561g152g151g561g18g138g155g157g146g140g146g153g138g157g146g152g151g561 like the amount of

investment in future earnings over time has resulted in little attention to their participation response however for married women who may not participate in the work force participation response is the most important estimated labor supply response if the participation response rises for exogenous reasons eg change in tastes decline in marriage or fertility the elasticity should become smaller and at some point it should decline if it increases because of wage increases this point is addressed in the appendix elasticities particularly high elasticities tend to decline when participation rises indeed such growth has raised the question of whether womens labor supply elasticities may eventually converge to those of men 20 also discussed in the appendix are survey data which illustrate how close women have now come to male labor supply and how little room for response remains positive labor supply response given wage growth cannot continue for long without running out of available workers

70 years and in an uneven fashion and then largely stabilize except for world war ii for the next 60 years at around 40 hours per week of course there were laws adopted that tended to limit hours but why were they not changed over time moreover troubling problem for any long term model of the us economy is that positive or negative labor supply response is inconsistent with steady state growth growth economists typically model economies as converging to steady state with growth rates usually although not always exogenous some models simply fix labor supply however for those that allow endogenous labor supply along with technical progress that increases real wages such models technically would converge at corner solutions with people either virtually not working at all or working every available moment unless elasticities are zero thus steady state growth model is incompatible with an aggregate labor supply response and modelers who wish to incorporate technical progress must also impose some arbitrary rule such as constantly changing preferences that move with the growth rate if elasticities are very small either positive or negative the change over time might become so small that for practical purposes they can be ignored in growth models however even small elasticities can lead to significant changes over an extended period of time for example positive elasticity of 01 with current work week of 40 hours plus other constraints on time that result in leisure being half of available hours and assuming real wage growth of 0015 over time would result in projected hours of 43 in 50 years which would not seem unreasonable but it would also imply that individuals worked onl 34 hours week 100 years ago and 28 hours 200 years ago finding at odds with history if the elasticity were 03 the implication would be rise to 49 hours in 50 years with 23 hours 100 years ago and 11 hours 200 years ago projections that seem completely unreasonable 20 see heckman james j

worker indeed as noted earlier survey evidence indicates that large fraction of individuals are not working their preferred hours in the case of taxes economic theory strongly suggests observations should be bunched at kinks in the budget constraint but in fact they are not if anything they are bunched at what appears to be an institutional norm of around 40 hours week which is an aggregate work week span adopted as reasonable by implication due to the legislation on overtime in general one of the arguments for still allowing hours responses is that individuals do have some flexibility in choosing hours by choosing employers and jobs and some flexibility still remains however this type of flexibility is constrained by adjustment costs that present potential barrier to variation in

this section addresses the specific issue of rning to the empirical evidence on labor supply elasticities for purposes of dynamic scoring in addition to the inherent uncertainties of labor supply response other issues are the likelihood that female elasticities are lower as the female participation rate has increased the need to incorporate cross elasticities between husbands and wives in an aggregate elasticity and the expectation that shortrun responses will be much more constrained by adjustment costs and institutional factors overall the discussion suggests that one cannot necessarily expect positive labor supply response to tax cuts therefore the presumption of fixed labor supply for revenue estimating purposes is quite reasonable assumption

elasticity or elasticities to use in dynamic scoring for tax purposes is choosing one compatible with empirical evidence and economic theory not only do labor supply elasticity estimates vary considerably actually moving from positive to negative but they are also uncertain because of number of problems with measurement and specification these issues are discussed in number of the survey articles cited in the appendix even considering the relatively simple case of male labor supply there are difficulties in measuring nonlabor income usually from assets which is used to identify income effects as separate from substitution effects progressive tax rates create kinked budget constraints and complicate estimation although new computer techniques have simplified the mechanics of doing such estimates most studies do not adjust for costofliving differences that could affect real wages in different localities and with any econometric studies there are often measurement problems assumptions of uniformity in certain aspects of the preference function variations in the choice of other regressors and variations in functional form that can affect estimated coefficients in some ways it may be considered heroic assumption to posit that the tastes and preferences for work of high income individuals are the same as wer income individuals but even seemingly minor issues can have effects that could actually change the sign when elasticities are low in the first place for example one study found that the use of actual hours rather than desired hours in estimated labor supply equations biased the elasticity upward in this case by 01 ie positive labor elasticity is too large and negative one should be even more negative 21 21 shulamit kahn and kevin lang the effect of hours

to correct for sample selection bias individuals working may not be representative as well as estimate participation response involves including data for nonworking individuals where wage is observed requiring the inclusion of instrumental variables associated with wage many characteristics correlated with wages such as experience and schooling may not only directly affect wages but may also reflect tastes for working moreover the dynamics of families are not completely straightforward either do wives make their choices about working given husbands choices or does the couple make joint utilitymaximizing decision or do they engage in bargaining solution the estimation process and the measurement of income will vary substantially depending on what assumption is made recent survey of economists which included survey of the views of 65 labor economists on their best estimates of labor supply elasticities for prime age men and women is suggestive of the existing professional disagreement and lack of consensus about the sign of labor supply response for men and the magnitude for women 22 details are presented in appendix b g23g156g146g151g144g561g17g158g157g556g152g143g556g6g138g157g142g561g7g156g157g146g150g138g157g142g156g561 most estimates of labor supply are based on data from the sixties seventies or at best the eighties even more recent study published in 1998 pencavel used data from the early seventies to the mid nineties and thus tends to reflect on average the early eighties as discussed earlier elasticities are expected to change over time so there is always question of relying on existing estimates in particular the larger elasticities associated with female labor participation should be falling perhaps substantially particularly if one weights elasticities by current wage shares which reflect increased participation rates for women female labor participation increased from about 43 in 1970 to 52 in 1980 to 58 in 1990 moreover because the elderly population share was growing during this time for example the elderly share of the over 15 population grew by about 5 percentage points between 1980 and 2000 for women the participation rate among those able to work grew even more there is also some direct evidence of decline in supply response of course the perceptions of labor economists reported above may reflect acknowledgment of the higher participation rates g5g155g152g156g156g561g11g151g140g152g150g142g561g7g149g138g156g157g146g140g146g157g146g142g156g561 simple weighting of male and female elasticities by their respective wage shares is an incomplete measure since there are cross elasticities between husbands and wives which should be negative that is the income effect may not onl affect your own labor but also your spouses labor in models that treat women as the secondary earner such response would be confined to wives as shown in appendix b elasticities derived from weighting male and female wage elasticities would be reduced by between 005 to 010 if this effect were accounted for 22 victor r fuchs alan b krueger james m poterba

g20g158g151g561g17g151g142g156g561 there are several reasons why the shortrun response is likely to be smaller than the long run the effect measured in cross section studies and this is particularly true for changes that induce positive rather than negative labor response first consider hours large share of the currently employed labor force has direct control over hours surveys suggest that many individuals would like to work more or fewer hours than they now do economists recognize these constraints but generally presume that individuals do have hours choices by changing employers and jobs and perhaps even professions this presumption is reasonable in the long run which is the basis of most cross section studies but in the short run even over several years of the estimating horizon these adjustments cannot easily be made while selfemployed individuals or individuals whose pay is closely tied to performance may work more to earn higher wages or salaries some self employed individuals may still follow group norms such as standard hours of opening for retail businesses individuals wishing to expand labor hours through second job find this choice to be discrete and perhaps not yielding the same pay but even given these options it should be clear that the hours elasticity should be smaller perhaps much smaller in absolute value in the short run similar argument applies to participation response but applies asymmetrically with respect to expansion versus contraction entering the labor force requires at minimum some amount of job search and may also require some additional period of education and training child care arrangements must be made in many cases and re quire some period of search deciding to enter the labor force and being able to do so at desirable salary and with desirable working conditions is much more challenging process than an original decision made when young to stay in or leave the work force for an individual who has retired such reentry may be especially difficult and unlikely in part because of health and in part because very short time might remain to work in any case however exiting the labor force is relatively easy

in the long run workers tend to create their own capital but in the short run the capital stock is fixed or relatively fixed as result dynamic feedback effects can be quite sensitive to assumptions regarding the substitution between capit and labor in production which determines the degree to which the labor demand curve slopes despite the importance of this effect some modelers have paid little attention to the production function and whether the assumptions often including use of unitary factor substitution elasticity are appropriate consider first the total effect on labor used which is due to the interaction of labor supply and labor demand the formula for the percentage increase in the labor supply divided by the initial percentage increase in after tax wage due to tax change is esaes where is the labor supply elasticity s is the factor substitution elasticity and is the share of income received by capital see appendix to convert this value to output effects the percentage change must then be multiplied by the labor income share 1a thus if labor income is two thirds of the output share the percentage change in output will be two thirds of the percentage change in labor employed httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31949g11g156g156g158g142g156g561g146g151g561g6g162g151g138g150g146g140g561g20g142g159g142g151g158g142g561g7g156g157g146g150g138g157g146g151g144g561 g561

income and substitution effects and thus can be either positive or negative studies of direct savings elasticities are generally based on aggregate times series data but few have been done recently because of the growing interest in more sophisticated intertemporal models discussed in the next section most studies report results that are very small and can be negative in general an elasticity of 04 would be considered relatively high 25 certainly model that simply held the savings rate constant would reflect central tendency based on this evidence however even large elasticities would have little impact using the 04 elasticity in simulation that eliminated the income tax entirely and replaced it with consumption tax the capital stock increased by less than 2 after 10 years and output increased by only 04 g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 the analysis in this section is suggestive that the labor supply elasticity the main response that matters for neoclassical model in the short run is so small and so close to zero that serious question arises as to whether it is worth incorporating in dynamic scoring effort based on review of the cross section data the estimates are highly variable although the central tendencies are very small at the least elasticities derived from the body of econometric studies should be adjusted to take account of the following considerations when used for revenue estimating participation elasticities which are the main contributors to positive response to wage increases are largely outofdate and the dramatic rise in participation since these studies were made suggests lower elasticities the higher the initial elasticity the more it should have fallen today simple weighting of elasticities of men and women does not take into account cross elasticities for wives if this effect were averaged in it could easily transform small average positive response to small negative one the response in the short run is likely to be much smaller than the long run permanent response reflected in most econometric studies because of institutional constraints and adjustment costs given positive labor supply elasticity in the short run will have more modest effect after interaction with demand in the short run if the initial elasticity is large especially if the model uses the small demand elasticities that are probably more appropriate to the short run when capital and labor substitution is less likely 25 see jane g gravelle the economic effects of taxing capital income cambridge mit press 1994 pp 27 for brief summary of this work

these models are based on consumers choosing how much to work and save by optimizing over long period of time savings and labor response derive from fundamental parameters in the individuals utility function mathematical representation of the value received from consumption there are three important issues to consider when evaluating these models are these models realistic representations of individual behavior there are reasons to expect that they might not be many behavioral features of these models particularly when they occur over long period of time have not been tested empirically but certain relationships that can be derived from these models can be directly compared with econometric estimates are these responses consistent with empirical evidence can models that are so dependent on unspecified policies to deal with the government budget constraint be useful for dynamic revenue estimating

the formal structure of intertemporal models is consistent with economic theory depicting individuals making rational decisions over time and those theoretical aspects have made them popular in the classroom and the academic journals but whether the responses derived from these models constitute realistic depiction of ac tual behavior is question that has largely not been tested empirically that is because although certain types of empirical estimates are used to construct these models the results rely strongly on variety of other assumptions including the mathematical form of the utility function the motivation for bequests and assumptions that individuals are well informed and capable of making precise allocations over long period of time these models basically depict an individual as having to make choice given projection of potential lifetime wealth which includes the present value of future wage earnings and any assets on hand or expected to be inherited choosing how much consumption goods to purchase and how much leisure to enjoy that is how much to work the allocation of consumption and leisure over time depend on the after tax wage rates in different periods and the after tax rates of return as in the basic neoclassical model income and substitution effects offset each other one important difference from typical neoclassical models is that changes in rates of return can have dramatic effect on labor supply response as individuals shift leisure between the present and future in those models that treat labor supply as endogenous this effect is often the most powerful supply side response in the short run and yet one that would probably be greeted skeptically by many economists there are two basic forms of intertemporal models infinite horizon models which represent all of the individuals in the economy as single infinitely lived representative investor

different ages optimizing over their own remaining lifetimes as the economy moves through time new generations are born and older generations die infinite horizon models may seem bizarre but can theoretically be justified by intergenerational altruismthat individuals include in their own welfare the welfare of their children their grandchildren and indeed all future generations26 many economists have reservations about this assumption given evidence that many bequests do not appear to arise from altruistic motives and that many individuals leave little in the way of bequests or have children moreover the model cannot be applied to heterogenous classes of individuals eg in different permanent income classes or subjected to different tax regimes such as differing national or state or local taxes life cycle models may appear more realistic but even in these models individuals tend to be optimizing over long period of time 27 note that life cycle models can have perfect foresight about future prices which is required of infini horizon models or they can be myopic where individuals assume that current pretax wage and interest rates will continue are these models which assume an enormous amount of information and planning skills representative of actual behavior given for example that individuals often do not know their marginal or average tax rates even if one does imagine individuals actually making lifetime plans for savings and consuming that respond to changes in taxes and interest rates there are variety of institutional constraints these models presume that individuals are free to borrow and lend at the same interest rate and that individuals are liquidity constrained moreover although some models assume labor supply and leisure are fixed others treat labor as choice variable when modeling leisure and thus labor supply models presume that individuals can easily change hours of work or that individuals can periodically leave and enter the labor force on voluntary basis due to changes in interest rates as well as wages thus they do not account for the fact that wage rates and earnings may depend on past employment history practically speaking most people cannot easily plan lifetime working career with periodic deliberate periods of unemployment and many economists may doubt that the interest rate affects most workers employment decisions moreover although some of the behavioral responses in the model can be based on empirical estimates the functional form of the models force some particular relationships for example that consumption in periods far apart have the same intertemporal substitution effects as those close together and that these effects are based on expectations and planning while it is possible to estimate profiles of behavior over time the best type of data panel data still falls short of lifetime and the assumption must be made that these patterns reflect the execution of plans that were carried out in anticipation of lifetime prices and incomes 26 this type of model also called ramsey model underlies theory referred to as ricardian equivalence and also causes the model to be referred to as barrotype model after the economist who wrote about ricardian equivalence robert barro ricardian equivalence means that deficits neve r matter because individuals knowing that they will have to be repaid in the future will save enough to make up for the debt plus interest and leave those amounts to their children as bequests this theory precludes any stimulus effect or crowding out effect intertemporal models always converge to the same long run steady state equilibrium nd basically involve an infinite longrun savings elasticity 27 bequests in the life cycle model must be motivated by something other than intergenerational altruism one can assume bequests although such model is hard to calibrate to the economy fixed bequests bequests that are treated as or similarly to last period of consumption joy of giving or bequests that occur because individuals need hedge against living too long

include the labor supply elasticities estimated from cross section studies which are composed of offsetting income and substitution effects each of which tends to be quite small on average perhaps in the neighborhood of absolute values of 01 to 03 these labor supply elasticities depend on functional form the intratemporal substitution elasticity and the ratio of leisure to hours available these elasticities also include the factor substitution elasticity whose average value is often estimated to be less than 05 there have also been attempts to estimate some of the intertemporal responses as discussed in appendix c they include attempts to directly estimate the intertemporal substitution of consumption with respect to rates of return these estimates have produced range of returns but with most studies falling well under 05 modelers in the 1997 jct symposium used values of 025 03 range of 015 to 05 and 10 although the last measure has now been reduced by the modeler to 04 28 the cbo models used 05 and the jct 025 although these values are often estimated using short panels reflecting close together periods as applied to intertemporal models which measure the response to long periods apart even infinitely far apart they can produce very large savings responses another set of estimates is the intertemporal substi tution of labor supply with respect to changes in the wage rate over time which tend to be very small typically averaging about 02 and often not statistically significant this elasticity must be derived from the intratemporal elasticity the intertemporal elasticity and the leisure shares of hours available in general as discussed in further detail in appendix c the labor supply responses in current intertemporal models appear to be high and in the case of cbo much higher than in their neoclassical models in large part because the functional form drives models towards income elasticities for leisure with respect to wages to 1 which requires correspondingly high substitution elasticity to avoid large backward bending labor supply curves these elasticities drive both parametric labor supply elasticities responses to proportional change in wages in each period making income and substitution effects quite large as large as 06 in some models and the intertemporal labor supply elasticity most models probably set this latter elasticity far higher than suggested by the intertemporal substitution estimates because they have such high share of leisure in available hours not all models provide sufficient detail to calculate these derived elasticities but they appear to be about 076 in the auerbachkotlikoff model and about 11 in the cbo models see appendix c thus the cbo implicit intertemporal elasticities are over five times the size of most empirically timated elasticities estimated at around 02 as 28 jorgenson and yun investment op cit

with the econometric evidence on both intratemporal and intertemporal labor supply response the treasury initially began at 075 for one model and 05 for another but is now at 04 consumption also theoretically responds to changes in wages over time although those elasticities have not been estimated directly and tend to be small in most models because of the leisure share of income the intertemporal substitution of labor supply with respect to the interest rate is actually larger than the intertemporal substitution of consumption in many modelsabout 0375 in the auerbach kotlikoff model and about 075 in the cbo model the easiest way to cause these elasticities to reflect empirical evidence is to set the leisure share of hours quite low an approach taken by jct but this parameter is one that has attracted little attention in most cases the particular form of utility chosen to allocate consumption throughout the life cycle or throughout infinity also plays an important role in determining the behavioral response because it leads to equal substitution elasticities between time periods but since the price of future consumption is 11rt where t is the time period the elasticity of savings with respect to the interest rate can be very large because of the far apart periods see discussion in appendix c in 1997 three of the modelers who participated in the jct study presented paper that tested the sensitivity of tax change to various parameters based on revenue neutral tax changes substituting flat rate income tax with consumption tax and wage tax 29 both substitutions would eliminate the tax on new investment and increase the rate of return they found the first would have only negligible effect on the wage rate but the second would have significant effect in both cases there are aggregate income effects in the model although in life cycle model switch to consumption tax imposes higher taxes on the elderly and lower ones on the young and switch to wage tax does the opposite they used base case of standard infinite horizon and life cycle model reflecting the parameters of the then existing auerbach kotlikoff model the intertemporal substitution elasticity set at 025 the intratemporal elasticity set at 08 the factor substitution elasticity set at 10 and the ratio of leisure to hours available 06 because the intratemporal substitution elasticity is set at 08 and the income effect is 1 these effects imply an income elasticity of labor supply to proportional change in the wage of 06 substitution effect of 048 and an overall backward bending labor supply elasticity of 012 these are very high offsetting effects although the net elasticity is in the empirical range most of the effects in the model are driven by interest rate effects however some of the important findings of these explorations for the intertemporal models referring to the consumption tax substitution and looking at the first five years were results are sensitive to model type positive effects of switch to consumption tax in the life cycle model were larger in absolute size than those in the infinite horizon model for the consumption tax change but large part of that probably reflects the return of retirees into the work force due to the lump sum tax on old people that is imposed by shift from income to consumption effects are also

by about 50 in this myopic fixed labor model when uncertainty was introduced although capital expands faster than in th case of the neoclassical growth model when taxes on capital income are eliminated with little effect on the wage the predominant effect is the labor supply response the output results for the model with endogenous labor were about 3½ times the effects for models with fixed labor the savings response was enormous eliminating the tax on the return to capital in these simulations caused the rate of return to initially rise by about 25 although the effect was eventually smaller as the capital stock adjusted in myopic life cycle model individuals expect pretax wages and rates of return to persist with fixed labor where the rate of return can be treated as fixed and the 25 number holds savings increased by 127 in the first year implying an elasticity of about 5 this response is huge by any standards and would have been even greater if labor had been endogenous in the perfect foresight models the savings response in the first year was 60 larger in the infinite horizon model and 26 larger in the life cycle model when labor was made endogenous as individuals increase work to produce savings to finance future leisure by contrast the percentage increase in the neoclassical growth model was only 95 thus the savings rate was over 13 times as large as that in neoclassical model results are sensitive to elasticities in the infinite horizon model increasing the intertemporal substitution elasticity from the base of 025 to 05 increased the average output effect over the first five years by about 80 lowering it to 005 reduced the effect by 90 these effects were smaller 30 and 45 in the life cycle model because the wage tax rate changed very little sensitivity analysis to the intratemporal substitution elasticity is not as meaningful nevertheless because effective taxes on wages went up at least in the short run changing the intratemporal elasticity to 0 increased output by 13 reducing the factor substitution elasticity to 05 reduced the effect by about 20 even the introduction of depreciation reduced net output increases by 12 results are quite sensitive to available labor if the leisurehours ratio is set at 02 rather than 06 to conform them more closely to empirical estimates of labor supply the effect fell by 53 effects can be considerably reduced by about half when uncertainty is introduced the study also indicated significant differences in model type with shift to wage tax where taxes on wages went up significantly the life cycle model produced significant negative effects in the short and the long run while the infinite horizon model produced small initial negative responses and positive long run effects the shortrun effects were positive but smaller in the fixed labor models in the life cycle model reducing the intertemporal elasticity to 005 caused the negative effect to triple while increasing it to 05 turned negative output effect to positive one these results suggest great deal of variability can be expected in the results of intertemporal models depending on the model type and the elasticities

g5g152g151g156g157g155g138g146g151g157g561 intertemporal models with perfect foresight cannot be used to solve the shortrun effect of stand alone tax cut because the model relies on long run steady state solutions to be solved at all while life cycle models can assume individuals behave as if current rates of return and wages will persist and only taxes change these are often called myopic models these models tend to produce even more unrealistic savings responses because they do not account for the eventual fall in the pretax rate of return as the capital stock expands in response to reduction in taxes on capital income any model with expectations must rely on some other assumed policy policies that retain the income effect such as assuming that government spending w ill be cut will have smaller effect on labor supply and savings than policies that eliminate most or all of the income effect such as lumpsum tax changes yet different effect would derive from eventually raising marginal tax rates which would lead to temporary rather than permanent intertemporal shift the recent cbo study demonstrated the dramatic differences in the results of intertemporal models when different choices are made 31 for the infinite horizon model in the first five years choosing to cut government spending resulted in budgetary feedback effect of 3 ie the deficit was 3 less than expected while imposing lump sum tax resulted in feedback of 15 in the second five years these effects are 4 an increase in budgetary costs and 17 with life cycle model closed economy effects were 6 and 7 in the first five years 15 and 5 in the second five years the cbo study could have closed the budget balance by introducing future tax increase such change probably would have produced very small effects since it would have eliminated the power of interest rate changes to induce large shortrun labor supply responses to higher rates of return the jct study also used two methods spending increases and marginal rate increases its feedback effects were 3 for the first case and 26 for the second however the method of closing the deficit was not as important to its study because of the temporary nature of tax cuts g21g158g150g150g138g155g162g561g152g143g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 this section has outlined variety of problems associated with intertemporal models the interest in these types of models arose from the growing development of interest in rational expectations and in modeling the economy as agents concerned with forward looking behavior many economists doubt that such complex and sophisticated models can actually describe the behavior of most individuals the models produce behavioral responses that are quite large and are governed not only by estimated parameters that are uncertain in magnitude but also by functional 30 these features are also discussed in gravelle behavioral responses to consumption tax op cit 31 see congressional budget office an

results that are difficult to believe and that are not supported by the statistical literature they may propose elasticities that seem reasonable but may produce factor supply responses outside the range of empirically estimated results point stressed by charles ballard who was the discussant of the intertemporal models in the jct symposium ballard urged modelers to try to fit their models to empirical estimates he also pointed out that there is empirical evidence to support the notion that labor supply responds to the interest rate and that anyone who builds such response in model is shooting in the dark yet this particular behavioral response is one of the most important ones in affecting short term response in intertemporal tax models because it produces both labor supply and savings as mentioned in the introduction there are many other features of these models that can influence the results but certainly one of the most troublesome ones is that intertemporal models with foresight cannot be solved unless some assumption is made about addressing exploding deficit effects thus study of stand alone tax cut can be made using these models

these effects have been demonstrated in variety of studies that consider the same policy including the jct studies published in 1997 and the 1997 study by engen gravelle and smetters the jct comparisons had first year effects on output of replacing the income tax with consumption tax ranging from 23 to 78 reflecting both model differences and elasticity differences after four years the effects ranged from 125 to 145 eliminating the most nega tive and most positive studies resulted in smaller but still significant range of 18 to 58 in the first year and 08 and 42 after four years these differences reflected range of model types and range of elasticities used by the nine modelers series of comparisons was done by the congressional budget office for the presidents budgetary proposals in the initial 2003 study for the two models with unemployed resources one model led to reduction in revenue costs of about 30 that began at 27 and rose slightly over six years until it reached 33 the other model began with 16 reduction which declined and eventually led to 28 increase in cost for an average additional cost of 9 these models reflect all three effects shortrun stimulus deficit and supply side and part of the effect is that rise in inflation increases nominal revenues and improves the deficit because of an assumption that appropriations will not be affected by price levels ie real decline in government spending in the neoclassical model which incorporated labor supply elasticity averaging about 01 with 02 substitution effect and 01 income effect consistent with the cross section empirical evidence the feedback effects increased the revenue cost by 6 in the first five years and by 11 in the next five years the infinite horizon model led to reduced revenue cost by 3 or an increased cost by 4 if lower government spending is used to close the deficit gap higher lump sum taxes led to reduced revenue cost of 15 and 17 these latter numbers reflect the relatively large factor httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31949g11g156g156g158g142g156g561g146g151g561g6g162g151g138g150g146g140g561g20g142g159g142g151g158g142g561g7g156g157g146g150g138g157g146g151g144g561

income effects when the budget deficit is closed by lump sum taxes in addition to versions of the life cycle model with different ways of closing the deficit gap the cb0 study also considered closed and open economies for the lower government spending option that leaves income effects intact feedback would increase costs by 6 in the closed model and 10 in the open model in the first give years and by 15 and 5 in the second five years for the lump sum tax closure that eliminates some income effects costs are reduced by 7 in the closed and 6 in the open economy models in the first five years and by 5 to 8 in the second five years overall the study shows large range of effe cts if supply side responses are modest and multipliers are small or nonexistent the eroding effects of the budget deficit lead to an increase in revenue costs these supply side effects can be small when the elasticities themselves are modest as in the neoclassical model or substitution elasticities are small enough to be largely offset by income effects as in the life cycle models however when multipliers are large or when supply side effects are large because of large substitution elasticities that are not offset by income effects the revenue cost can be decreased substantially of course the cbo studies do not capture the full range of factor supply elasticities which can quite reasonably fall in the zero or negative range so that while the upper limit of feedback that reduces revenue may be reflected in its results the upper limit of feedback that increases revenue probably is not some sensitivity analysis including setting of the elasticities in cbos intertemporal model to correspond more closely to empirical evidence and to the assumptions used in its neoclassical growth model and allowing for alternative budget and macro assumptions regarding how the deficit is closed eg marginal tax rate increases and how the monetary authorities might respond would provide more complete picture of the range of effects that one might find in these models of course such analysis would likely increase an already broad range of effects that vary from reduction in costs of 30 to an increase in costs of 15 largely by expanding the latter the first jct study in 2003 while examining only revenue effects from temporary tax cut also showed wide range of effects from 26 revenue feedback to 234 one variable effects have persisted in later studies and in the treasurys studies the discussion of the various studies that provided sensitivity analysis in this section and in the previous section on intertemporal models points to two important caveats about dynamic revenue estimating it is very difficult to obtain good estimate because of uncertainty about behavioral responses and very difficult to study tax cut without making some sort of assumption about accompanying policies moreover if the analysis is restricted to supply side effects as some might suggest reasonable estimate of the results based on empirical evidence is likely to be negligible effect reflecting the very modest factor supply elasticities of uncertain sign

nevertheless instructive historically the average hours worked by those in the labor force has declined over time from 403 hours per week in 1947 to 342 in 2001 some industries have had virtually change manufacturing hours were 403 in 1947 and 407 in 2001 with very little fluctuation since both of these time periods were associated with rising real wages they are suggestive of an aggregate zero or negative response in hours however they may also have reflected differing hours of changing participants in the work force and may also reflect kink points that arise from institutional constraints on the work week in particular the overtime pay requirements for workweeks in excess of 40 hours in many jobs 32 participation rates have changed over time but not in ways that are especially meaningful with respect to wage effect male labor force participation rates for those 15 and over have been declining falling from 861 in january of 1948 to 741 in june of 2002 female participation has been increasing rising from 32 in january of 1948 to 597 in june of 2002 the decline in the former may reflect in part the aging of the population as well as some earlier retirement and extended schooling female participation rate increases were especially pronounced in the seventies and eighties as baby boomers entered the workforce but their increased participation may reflect efficiencies in household technology changes in social norms later marriage and declines in fertility this period was in fact not period of overall wage growth although cause and effect cannot be separated ie wage growth may have slowed because of new entrants over longer period of time however there is clear fall in labor hours indeed many of the labor disputes in the 19 th century and early 20th century involved movements for shorter work days and work weeks hours fell from 70 hours week in 1856 to 40 hours in 194033 during the 1930s legislation to mandate 30hour week was debated hours rose during world war ii but then fell after the war some of the further decline in the workweek may have come as result of more part time jobs in the retail and service industries reflecting the end of blue laws requiring sunday closing these observations about work weeks and pa rticipation suggest that there are powerful institutional factors that may constrain labor supply response in the short run in general the time series evidence on average workweek does not support positive labor supply response to higher wages while participation rates provide mixed message 32 for covered employment payment for overtime is time and half employers thus find it costly to have workers work in excess of 40 hours and they might also find that wo rkers productivity declines eventually at the same time they may be reluctant to employ part time workers because of fixed benefits costs eg health insurance these effects make the 40hour work week kink point that may likely be chosen by employers 33 see

cross section statistical studies indeed because wages vary across individuals labor supply has been fertile field for econometric studies and the advancement of econometric techniques these studies typically compare the labor supply of individuals with different wage rates in general the overall elasticities for male labor supply percentage change in hours worked divided by percentage change in the wage are relatively small and span zero indeed there is fair amount of reason to believe that the labor supply elasticity for men is negative higher wages result in lower work as the income effect dominates the substitution effect pencavel in his summary of empirical studies in 1986 reports wage elasticity for men that ranges from 006 to 029 34 he reports the central tendency as between 017 and 008 and the simple average as 012 in survey confined to limited number of articles that explicitly included taxes hausman reports similar results 35 the finding of small and possibly negative responses to wages is confirmed in some later studies36 an important issue for tax analysis is whether these small elasticities are the result of offsetting large or small income and substitution effects most studies have found them the result of small offsetting elasticities which suggests small supply side effects from changes in tax rate progressivity study by hausman found larger offsetting income and substitution effects that suggested more important role for tax policy that study has been subject to some criticism and more recent studies have tended to find small offsetting effects 37 the estimation of responses for women is much more complicated and has been the subject of more attention while large majority of men of primary working age participate in the labor market significant fraction of women at any age do not participate and that was particularly true in earlier years of the 20 th century concern that greatly preoccupied econometricians was that estimates of labor supply response based on women in the labor force would be biased because these women are not randomly selected they are selfselected this aspect of womens labor supply creates significant econometric problems which researchers have struggled to address in addition part of the response to wage changes can be not only in hours of those working but also in changes in the number of individuals who work 34 john pencavel labor supply of men in handbook of labor economics vol 1 edorley ashenfelter new york elsiever 1986 35 jerry hausman taxes and labor supply handbook of public

corrected for selection bias the range of elasticities is extremely large ranging from 090 to 14 and there are enormous variations even within studies based on methods used38 smaller range of effects was found in the smaller number of studies that included taxes 03 to 23039 critic of these studies argued that certain methodological choices tended to bias the estimates upward and concluded that the hours response was actually similar to that of men40 two additional studies since that time found elasticities of around 1 with 70 to 80 of the response participation response41 one of these studies also estimates the response of married women to changes in husbands wages which is negative finding that the hours response is as large ie proportional change in all wages would leave hours unchanged and that an increase in the husbands wage slightly reduces participation as well42 recent study that examined changes in womens labor supply response indicated that the elasticity of married womens labor supply had declined substantially in the past two decades from an estimated 08 or 09 in 1980 to 06 in 1990 and 04 in 200043 the study also found decline in response to the husbands wage from 03 to 004 in 1980 to 02 in 2000 g7g161g153g142g155g146g150g142g151g157g156g497g561g16g138g157g158g155g138g149g561g138g151g141g561g17g157g145g142g155g160g146g156g142g561 third type of measure uses data to compare the response of different individuals to particular change in the late 1960s and early 1970s series of experiments with negative income taxes where some households were given the benefit and some were not resulted in estimates of elasticities for men that also tended to be small and either positive or negative44 there was also some evidence of significant withdrawal from the workforce due to the income effect for married women and smaller but still significant effect for female household heads there were many problems with these studies however and th ey relate only to lower income individuals although they do accord with cross section data that suggest women are more responsive than men 45 another type of study that has received increasing attention is the natural experiment which examines labor supply response to tax changes by comparing how individuals with different tax rate changes changed their behavior most of these studies have not indicated any response of labor

income women to the 1986 tax reform act suggested an elasticity of 06 to 146 about half of the response was due to participation response less than is usually thought the case however these elasticities are not comparable to the ones cited above as noted by the author they are more likely to represent the compensated elasticities which reflect only substitution effects uncompensated estimates such as those discussed above which reflect both income and substitution effects would be smaller but it is difficult to know what adjustments to make natural experiments face their own problems and in particular could reflect trend and cycle effects for example women with higher educati ons increased their participation rates relative to less educated women towards the end of the 20 th century which most people agree could have reflected many other factors than wages the paper above tried to control for these effects by comparing women whose family income placed them in the 99 th percentile with those who are in the 90th or the 75th percentile surprisingly the elasticities were larger with the former comparison than the latter because of trend and cycle effects one might feel more sanguine about the results of natural experiments if the results held for tax increase as well as decrease the 1993 tax increase was an obvious choice as another study episode unfortunately studies of the labor supply effects of this change have not been made studies of social security retirement age changes and earnings tests have also suggested labor supply responses more early retirement and less work during retirement47 g21g158g155g159g142g162g156g561 economists have usually been hesitant to rely on survey data however number of years ago several surveys of affluent men were made which included questions about the effect of taxes on work effort again this evidence suggested small response for men 48 some related survey evidence is also interesting surveys of whether individuals actually know their average and marginal tax rates and surveys that indicate most individuals cannot choose their optimal hours there is some evidence that marginal tax rates are not reported with much accuracy49 in that case individuals may not respond particularly to changes in marginal tax rates changes in average tax rates may be more likely to elicit some effect or at least their consequences on wages become known since changes in average tax rates would be reflected in paychecks 46 see review and analysis in eissa tax reforms and labor supply tax policy and the economy

that they are not currently working their optimal hours some would prefer more hours and some less which suggests they are not easily free to make small changes in hours in their current positions50

small available hours however are not all that straightforward to measure if one just took 40 hour work week and seven day 24 hours day available hours the ratio would be about threefourths however all hours are not available for example there is the biological necessity for sleep if one allowed eight hours of sleep per night about 60 of available hours would be spent in leisure and thus unitary elasticity would fall to 06 elasticity but even that elasticity is too high there are certain minimum requirements for working that include at least some amount of travel to work often lunch period embedded in the work day as well as preparation time for personal hygiene shaving bathing etc if we allow say two hours per work day and add it to work we get ratio of 55 if three hours we get ratio

that in 1981 men worked 44 hours commuted for 35 hours slept for 579 hours and spent 103 hours on personal care51 if commuting is assigned to work these findings suggest ratio of about between 048 and 052 depending on whether personal care is added to work or excluded from available hours moreover there are many other uses of time th at are highly constrained by necessary household chores or other needs eating shopping paying bills or family responsibilities spending time with spouse and kids so that this ratio could be even smaller some individuals may also not to work on particular days for religious reasons and consider those constraints to be strict thus one would expect to find low labor supply elastici ties for hours not only because of netting of income and substitution but also because each of these effects is small these observations also make the initial findings of high offsetting income and substitution elasticities using kinked budget constraints to seem somewhat implausible the other point illustrated by this formula is that the labor supply elasticity is not constant even though the underlying income and substitution elasticities with respect to consumption and leisure are as work increases the elasticity falls this point is important because it suggests that one should not impose simple labor supply elasticity across any significant period of time but assuming rise in real wages should have an elasticity that falls over time becomes smaller absolute value if positive and work is increasing and larger absolute value if negative and work is decreasing and as mentioned earlier it suggests that elasticities are smaller for those working more hours reason mentioned by wilhelm and moffitt for the lack of labor supply response by very high income men 52 the example of hours response discussed in this section is meant only to be illustrative as it is based on specific form of utility function that includes unitary income elasticities and constant substitution elasticities adding non labor in come or requiring subsistence amount of consumption other things equal is likely to increase in the first case and decrease in the other case the likelihood of positive elasticity and the size of the substitution elasticity there are many other types of functional forms where elasticities vary across consumption bundles and income elasticities can differ for leisure and consumption however the constraints of labor supply exist and those constraints exert limits on elasticities regardless of functional form people working every available hour can work more

the effects of constraints on participation can be most easily seen in the case of the logit formula for the logit case high elasticities tend to decline when participation rates rise due to wage increases but low elasticities could rise the larger the initial elasticity the more quickly the elasticity is likely to fall over time participation responses are also constrained and the growing participation rate of women should lead to lower elasticities indeed the logit form of the participation response can be manipulated mathematically to illustrate what one might expect as participation

taking care of children about 2 are not interested in working and about 2 have other reasons for those over 65 85 do not work and 92 of those cite either retirement or disability as reason the prime working years of 20 to 64 are where the differences in the sexes emerge in those groups about 14 of men do not work while 27 of women do not most of that differential about 10 percentage points reflects differences in child care responsibilities or care of others in each case about 2 are looking for job or laid off almost 5 have chronic disability and about 1 have temporary disability about 2 are in school less than 5 of prime age males are not working for other reasons over half of these are retired except for minor retirement virtually all prime age men are either in the labor force can not be in have not succeeded in entering the labor force or are preparing to be in the labor force about 18 of women are not working for reasons other than these and over 10 are not working

retired the remainder fall into the other category the vast majority of women who indicate that they are caring for children or others are married the increase in the ratio of women working over time is partly due to less marriage and partly due to fewer children or more women with children working it may be difficult to expect significant increase in labor supply from participation response with these levels of participation if real wages were to grow at 2 year the real wage would increase by 10 in five years if there were an average elasticity of one over that time there would need to be an increase in female workers of over 8 of the population if drawn proportionally from all categories except the already retired half of mothers caring for children would have to reenter the work force there are two other types of participation responses that might be considered but both are ambiguous in their effects first wages may affect retirement decisions but there might again be income and substitution effects from higher or lower wages over lifetime most attention to retirement decisions has focused on the larger effects of pensions and social security in any case the fraction of the workforce over 65 and the fraction of the under65 workforce not participating because of retirement is very small 3 in the former case and 2 in the latter in 1996 the second issue is the choice between spending more time on schooling versus more time on work teenage workers are small but significant fraction of the workforce and young adults may also not be working because of schooling however the effect of higher wages may be to increase schooling as the returns increase higher wages also increase the part of the cost of schooling that is in the form of forgone earnings but not the direct costs thus one might expect higher wages to increase schooling and in fact schooling has increased over the years

for prime age men and women is suggestive of the existing professional lack of consensus about the sign of labor supply response for men and the magnitude for women 54 for men the mean was 010 little higher than the evidence that generally suggests backward bending labor supply the median was zero and the standard deviation was 027 hence standard confidence interval would fall well into the negative range the estimate was zero at the 25th percentile and 010 at the 75th percentile but as confidence interval this is narrow range compensated elasticities had mean of 022 and median of 018 with standard deviation of 018 008 at the 25th percentile and 028 at the 75th percentile for women the values were 045 mean and 030 median with larger standard deviation of 057 range that would fall into the negative the 25th and 75th percentiles were 010 and 070 54 victor r fuchs alan b krueger james m poterba economists views about parameters values and policies survey results in labor and

deviation the 25th and 75th percentiles were 020 and 080 the values for women were lower than much of the empirical evidence for married women which may reflect an adjustment for single women who would be expected to have lower elasticities an d perhaps the growth in participation rates over time that should move womens elasticities closer to those of men the large standard deviations are suggestive of great deal of uncertainty in the measurement of labor supply moreover significant fraction of respondents did not answer the question 15 for mens elasticities and one third for womens the inescapable conclusion is that if the sign of the elasticity matters we cannot say with confidence based on the informed judgement of labor economists that it is positive one should not make too much of this type of survey data labor economists specialize in particular areas outside of labor supply and many may not be familiar with all of the literature backward bending labor supply curves present certain difficulties with modeling of business cycles and economists focused in these areas may tend to think of labor supply elasticities as positive otherwise the survey seems at odds with the findings of backward bending labor supply response of men55 but the survey data do tend to accord in general way with the assessment made of the literature elasticities are probably small but there is great deal of uncertainty about them and about whether they are significantly different from zero

eighties even recent study published in 1998 pencavel used data from the early seventies to the mid nineties and thus tends to reflect on average the early eighties as discussed earlier elasticities are expected to change over time so there is always question of relying on existing estimates in particular the larger elasticities associated with female labor participation should be falling perhaps substantially particularly if one weights elasticities by current wage shares which reflect increased participation rates for women female labor participation increased from about 43 in 1970 to 52 in 1980 to 58 in 1990 moreover because the elderly population share was growing during this time for example the elde rly share of the over 15 population grew by about 5 percentage points between 1980 and 2000 for women the participation rate among those able to work grew even more of course the perceptions of labor economists reported above may reflect acknowledgment of the higher participation rates as noted above recent evidence has suggested lower elasticities for women and cbo has reduced elasticities in the neoclassical and shortrun models but not their intertemporal ones 56

on own elasticities should be an overstatement of the true elasticity for purposes of across the board changes with initial small elasticities this correction could reverse the sign of the aggregate supply response with composite elasticity of 01 the median values for men and women in the survey results with men weighted at 60 and women at 40 to reflect both womens slightly smaller numbers and the female to male wage ratio of 07 if we look back on the empirical evidence for us women we find value for the income elasticity of about 020 from the survey of the wide range of largely cross section elasticities 58 an average of 028 from the survey of studies incorporating taxes59 and value of 033 from later panel study60 these are little higher than the mean and median elasticities for all women computed by subtracting the hicksian demand from the marshallian demand elasticities from the survey of labor economists mentioned above which are 013 to 014 but it is commonly thought that married women have more elastic responses in general range from 013 to 033 seems to reflect reasonable assumption about these elasticities based on married womens participation and wages they would receive weight of about 025 however since these weights were corrected for gender wage gap it is appropriate to multiply the elasticities by 17 this yields range of 019 to 047 to reflect the effects of husbands proportional wage changes multiplying these numbers by 025 suggests that any aggregate elasticity computed by weighting mens and womens responses would be reduced by 005 to 012 at the lower end this change would cut the elasticity in half from 010 to 005 at the upper end this change would transform the 010 positive elasticity to 002 negative elasticity 57 pencavel the market work

includes the evidence on labor supply response in cross section study which examines the supply response across individuals as discussed above this evidence largely suggests relatively small income and substitution effects the evidence regarding the factor substitution elasticity again being relatively small is also directly applicable to intertemporal models another type of econometric evidence that is relevant to the intertemporal models is the substitution elasticity across time these studies have in some cases employed macroeconomic data and in others panel data on individuals there are two types of evidence in some studies the change in consumption over time is estimated as function of changes in the interest rate in others changes in labor supply are estimated over time as function of changes in the wage rate the first set of studies is relatively straightforward as direct estimate of the intertemporal substitution elasticity in model where labor is fixed or for combination of leisure and consumption with certain functional forms such as those frequently used in tax models the intertemporal labor supply elasticity with respect to wage changes has an interpretation that depends on functional form discussed below

elasticity of labor supply elasticity is given proportional change in wages across all periods and ignoring capital income on hand is lhs1 where l is leisure h is hours available and s the intratemporal substitution elasticity this formula is somewhat modified in the in termediate term for those who have already accumulated non labor income the substitution effect will be slightly larger and the income effect slightly smaller70 if the elasticities are not set to yield steady state growth which means that aggregate labor supply cannot respond to wage growth some assumption must be made in the model to correct for it for that reason it is difficult to justify very small or very large substitution elasticity to keep the income and substitution elasticities in line with empirical evidence from cross section labor studies the ratio of leisure to hours available should be set quite low probably around 02 it often is not leading to very large labor supply elasticities that are inconsistent with evidence similar problem can arise with conforming to the relatively low intertemporal substitution elasticities for labor with respect to wage rate changes the effects depend on the functional form of the model but in the nested utility functions that are commonly used in tax models the intertemporal substitution elasticity is weighted average of the intertemporal and intratemporal substitution elasticities γ and ρ new notation is chosen to conform to reference equation multiplied by the share of leisure over labor or 17 lh l 1 γρ where l is leisure and is the share of total consumption spent on leisure wlcwl where w is the wage rate and c is expenditure on goods this formula can be derived from the transition equation for leisure in equation 312 of the auerbach and kotlikoffs book dynamic fiscal policy making use of 311 and 39 note that 312 has an error which is that v tvt1 should not be raised to the power ρ and note also that equation 311 has an error in that the term α should be raised to the power ρ rather than being multiplied by it this formula would also require leisure to be relatively small part of hours and small relative to labor in order to keep the intertemporal labor elasticity with respect to wage relatively low for example in the cbo model γ is 05 ρ is 10 is 053 and lhl is 15 because leisure is 60 of hours available that result is 11 but if the leisure were set at 20 which would change to 02 and lhl to 025 it would be 0225 in the neighbor hood of the empirical estimates reduction in the intertemporal elasticity itself would reduce it even further in these nested functions consumption over time is also affected by available wages but in this case the elasticity is derived from equation 310 in dynamic fiscal policy 18 ρ γ which in the cbo model would be about 0265 making the change in leisure would reduce it to 01 and changing the intertemporal elasticity to 025 would change it to 015 the final set of substitution elasticities is the change in consumption and leisure with respect to the interest rate this value is estimated directly but not always over long period of time this 70 the substitution elasticity is 1xslh1xxl where x is the share of nonlabor income the income elasticity is lh1xxl

compounding of interest and the percentage change in current consumption rthe percentage change in consumption t years in the future is equal to 19 γtr1r if r is 05 and γ is 05 the one period apart the elasticity is 0024 for two periods apart 0048 for ten 024 and for 50 119 however if we convert it to an elasticity of substitution between savings in each period which has magnitude more closely corresponding to the reduced form savings estimates the elasticity should be divided by the savings rate which is usually well under 010 using 006 as an example the percentage change in savings today minus the percentage change in savings in the future would be 040 for times one period apart 4 for 10 years apart and 20 for 50 years apart thus the implied elasticities of savings with respect to the interest rate are very large there is also substitution elasticity for leisure over time which leads to an intertemporal labor supply response to the rate of return in this case its size also depends on the ratio of leisure to labor thus it is larger that the substitution between consumption in many models because it is multiplied by leisure over labor if leisure over labor is 15 as in the cbo model it is 50 larger however much lower substitution elasticity could be obtained by reducing the leisure share and also by reducing the intertemporal elasticity itself in the jct model the intertemporal subsitution elasticity is lower at 025 and the ratio of leisure to labor is less than one 043 so the elasticity of substitution for leisure over time is smaller note that the income effects are more complicated in these models there is an offsetting income and substitution effect that affects the price of future consumption goods so that if the intertemporal substitution effect were unitary th effects would offset each other with an intertemporal substitution elasticity of less than 1 these types of income effects would result in more consumption with rise in the interest rate because future consumption is discounted at higher rate however an increase in the interest rate also reduces the present value of human wealth and this latter effect would reduce consum ption and increase savings at the same time there is existing income from capital in the mode l that can be affected therefore how these effects occur depends on variety of factors in the model and what fraction of the tax cut affects average versus marginal rates of interest g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 jane g gravelle senior
