abused or neglected child welfare services are linked by history and share some of the sa clients who have similar service needs assessing the full significance of the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 to the child welfare system is complicated by the 1997 enactment of the adoption and safe familie s act pl 10589 which made direct and major changes to the child welfare system and by the fact that tanf implementation generally occurred during strong economy some child advocates were concerned that 1996 welfare reform initiatives including time limits family cap policies and work requirements might harm children andor place new strains on the child welfare system research on the effect of tanf implementation has not produced c onclusive findings changes in the size of the child welfare caseload have not been attributed to welfare reform although certain work requirements may increase the incidence of child neglect welfare reform also changed specific child welfare funding streams and renewed calls for stronger collaboration between child welfare and cash aid programs here too the evidence of an effect on the child welfare system is inconclusive greater colla boration has occurred in some locations and the flexible funding of tanf combined with st rong economy and rapidly declining cash assistance caseload meant new resources b ecame available for child welfare services in some states child welfare administrators are concerned however that because this money is not dedicated to their agencies it may not always be available further the 1996 welfare reform continues to base eligibility for federal foster care and adoption assistance on whether the family child is removed from was or would be eligible for cash aid as it existed in prior law aid to families with dependent children afdc this increased the complexity of determining eligible federal foster care and adoption assistance cost s and as th 1996 income and resource standards become dated might diminish federal child welf are funds by establishing diminishing pool of children eligible for federally reimbursable assistance finally some child welfare advocates ve also been concerned that children in families where adult is receiving tanf cash benefit childonly cases receive the necessary support services nd protection they require the percentage of childonly cases has grown since enactme nt of welfare reform although the actual number of these families being served has declined some states have used tanf funds to enact programs specific to th needs of childonly families and

that receive childonly benefit background assisting children of needy solesupport mothers was the purpose of the nations cash welfare program for poor fa milies when it was established in the 1935 social security act both then and now however eligibility for aid rests great deal on the circumstances of childs adult car egiver and federal reform efforts have focused on these adults in 1950 congre ss made caregivers of needy children eligible for federal cash aid in addition to the children themselves and as early as 1956 it amended the program to include pur poses oriented to adult caregivers accordingly the goal of family selfsuppor t joined the program goal of allowing children to be cared for in their own home or the home of relative over the next four decades reform efforts added employment training and other services to the program to bolster this family selfsupport goal these efforts culminated in the 1996 enactment of the tem porary assistance for needy families tanf block grant tanf strengthened efforts to redu ce dependence on government cash aid by requiring adult recipients to work and establishing time limits on their federal support to the longstanding goals of lfsupport and care of children in their own homes tanf added the goals of reducing th number of births occurring outside of marriage and encouraging the formation of twoparent families through all of these changes however responsibility for support of child remained condition of cash aid and in may 2002 the house passed tanf reauthorization legislation hr 4737httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31508crs2

their cash aid program to dependent children and their families and sought to ensure child welfare services would be made available in all parts of each state by july 1975 also in 1962 congress made pe rmanent the provision of federal foster care assistance to children who were necessarily removed by court order from families receiving afdc t anfs predecessor program federal foster care assistance had first b een authorized as component of the cash aid program in 1961 and it remained part of the af dc progra m until 1980 in that year the adoption assistance and child welfare act pl

progra m and funds for child welfare services that focused on family preservation and support the most significant change to the child welfare system since 1980 however came with the 1997 enactment of the adoption and safe families act pl 10589 this law emphasi zes the paramount im portance of safety for children and seeks to increase permanency for foster care children by establishing strict time lines for achieving family reuni fication adoption guardianship or another permanent placement for child how are tanf and child welfare linked today tanf policies are relevant to the wellbeing of all poor children and because they are the most often served especially those in singleparent families1 child welfare services by contrast are designed for children who experience abuse and neglect and they can come from families of an income level or structure although the vast majority of children in cash aid families do not experience maltreatment research shows higher rates of abuse and neglect among poor and singleparent families and many children in public foster care have been removed from families that receive cash welfare2 19951996 threestate study c alifornia illinois north carolina

receiving federally supported cash aid pl 87 314 eligibility for federal foster care assistance remained linked to afdc even after congress established this assi stance as an independent program in 1980 and although the 1996 welfare reform law repealed afdc it provided that eligibility for federal foster care assistance remains tied to children who are placed in foster families after initi ally being removed from fa milies receiving or eligible for cash aid under afdc as it existed on july 16 19965 nationwide an estimated 55 of the foster care caseload is eligible for federal foster care assistance6 what are the concerns and opportunities some child advocates feared that tanf requirements mandatory work participation benefit loss sanction for failure to comply with work or other requirements timelimited aid and broad restrictions on aid to immigrants would cause harm to children and would negatively affect the public child welfare system at the same time supporters of the welfar reform law argued that the changes especially requiring work would boost lfesteem among parents on welfare and improve their ability to parent and serve as role models for their young children aside from the effect of the new law on children and the size of the child welfare caseload enactment of tanf rene wed calls for better collaboration between child welfare and cash aid agencies and some new initiatives have followed the broad purposes of the tanf block grant combined with declining cash aid caseload provided potential source of flexible funds for child welfare services the 1996 welfare reform law however continues to link federal reim bursement for foster care and adoption assistance to afdc income and resource standards as they existed on july 16 1996 beyond the complexity

and adult portion is granted has raised new questions about the adequacy of care and services available to these children and their families child welfare trends and research findings research studying the effect of welfare reform initiatives in child welfare has not yet produced clear picture of changes7 the fact that many states implemented tanflike policies before the enactment of tanf in 1996 and the post welfare reform passage of extensive federal child welfare policy changes via the adoption and safe families act of 1997 pl 10589 complicates the task of assessing the importance of federal welfare reform to changes in the child welfare system researchers also note that the implement ation of tanf took place primarily in an expanding economy when many lowskilled parents could find jobs and that more time must pass before the implication of federal time limits on cash aid can be fully understood information now available to assess the meaning of tanf implementation to the child welfare system is drawn from survey data obtained primarily from child welfare workers as well as some welfare recipients and administrative data regarding child maltreatment victims foster care caseloads and welfare receipt some of the research l ooks exclusively at pe riods before welfare reform but in these cases the research ers are studying specific locations where federal waivers allowed establishment of tanflike policies available research varies widely in scope nd methodology and only one experimental study using random assignment and c ontrol group has been done national data on child maltreatment and foster care in cy2000 an estimated 879000 us children were found to be victims of abuse or neglect for an incidence rate of 122 child victims per every 1000 children this is above the number 826000 and incidence 118 of child maltreatment victims in cy1999 but below the cy1993 high of an estimated 1 million child victims with an incidence rate of 153 for cy2000 states also reporte d an increase in the percentage of child victims who experienced neglect as compared to other kinds of maltreatment the proportion of child victims experiencing ne glect including abandonment rose from 58 in 1999 to 63 in 2000 while the proportion of children who experienced physical or sexual abuse continued to dec line researchers do not yet know whether the 2000 data

certain policies including benefit size and work requirements may affect maltreatme nt rates andor the number of outofhome placements this studys strongest finding was that more generous welfare benefits are associated with significantly lower levels of neglect and smaller numbers of children in outofhome care or conversel reduced benefits are associated with higher levels of neglect and larger numbers of outofhome placements these researchers also report that family cap policies which typically mean that familys benefit is not increased to meet the needs of an infant born 10 months or more after the family begins to receive cash aid are associated with lower numbers of substantiated cases of maltreatment but increased numbers of outofhome placements other findings from this research suggest that more single mothers working leads to increased child maltreatment especially neglect13 other evidence of the effect of welfare reform on child maltreatment is mixed an

rate for postreform children although higher income was significant factor in speeding reunification and postreform children were more likely to have mothers with income from wages reunification was

the amount of f unding available for child welfare services and the kind of services offered is still being judged in some instances it appears child welfare has received new funding but because this money is not dedicated to child welfare purposes there is uncertainty about its availability in future years as part of the 1996 welfare reforms emergency assistance funds often used for child

half million dollars far below the 87 million sp ent under emergency assistance 2 years earlier but has since rebounded to 167 million in fy2000 childonly and relative caregiver cases close to 14 million children lived in fa milies that received childonly benefits in fy2000 some child welfare advocates have expressed cern about whether these childonly tanf families where adult receives cash aid have access to adequate resources and support services along with the rest of the tanf caseload the number of families receiving child only benefits declined from 978000 in fy1996 to 782000 in fy2000 however because the decline in the percentage of childonly cases has been slower than th overall tanf caseload decline childonly families now represent more than onethird of all cases 345 in fy2000 child only cases represented well below onequart er of all cases before welfare reform 215 in fy1996 and this s ubstantial percentage gain has helped to draw new attention to particular circumstances and needs of childonly families28 in childonly cases the family may be headed by relative nonparent caregiver frequently grandparent who is income ineligible for aid or who chooses not to receive tanf cash aid b ecause doing so would require compliance with work and other tanf requirements other kinds of childonly families include those where benefits to child continue after they are ended for the adults due to time limits on aid or because of sanc tions for failure to meet work or other tanf requirements childonly cases also include families where the adult head is ineligible for aid because of citizenship st atus or previous drug felony conviction finally childonly case may exist when the adult caregiver is recipient of ssi nationwide most childonly cases 624 go to

implements eg does the state end the entire familys benefit for violation or does aid always continue for children the availability of other state social programs to serve nonparent relative caregivers and the size of states immigrant population are some of the factor s that may affect states childonly caseload composition relative caregivers grandmothers aunts and other relative caregivers have been part of the cash welfare program for decades more than half million tanf children live with kinship caregiver alt hough not all of these are in childonly cases30 most children who live with their gr andparents or other relatives do so on an informal basis but some are placed in relative families by ch ild welfare workers who are seeking safe home for the child31 the 1996 federal welfare reform law encouraged formal relative placement by amending the law to require that child welfare agencies consider giving preference to an adult relative over nonrelated caregiver when determining placement for child who can longer safely live with hisher parents relatives are to be deemed fit and willing prior to formal placement by child welfare agency but many children live informally with relative caregivers although children living with grandparents and other relatives often have needs comparable to children placed in nonrela tive foster homes tanf childonly case typically receives far less fi nancial support than do childre n in foster care study using californias 1997 rate for high cost counties found that relative caregiver receiving tanf childonly grant to car for one child would receive 279 month while the basic rate for one foster care child ranged from 345 to 484 depending on the childs age and many counties supple mented this basic rate with additional payments for specified needs eg clothi ng allowance in addition foster care families may be eligible for supportive services and are also monitored to ensure childs safety32

of childonly cases in new jersey found that 60 of the nonparent caregivers reported that the child ren they care for did not live with parent due to parents s ubstance abuse problems 40 reported that child welfare services had required that the child not live with the mother and 58 reported that the child welfare agency had been involved with the parents or the child before the child came to live with them the math ematica survey also found that while on average nonparent caregivers had much higher incomes than tanf families that include parent in the cash grant the great majority 70 have incomes below 200 of the poverty level the average nonparent caregiver was 52 years of age but had considerably poorer physical health then residents of that age in the general us population furthermore desp ite relatively stable living arrangements more children in these nonparent childonly cases scor ed less well on school achievement and behavioral measures than did children in tanf cases that included parent in the cash aid grant33 in response to the growing number of relative caregivers and their specific needs some states have used tanf f unds to establish subsidized guardianship programs andor kinship caregiver s upport groups and services the advocacy coalition generations united reported in june 2001 that as many as 24 statewide subsidized guardianship programs existe d and that the majority access tanf funds to provide payments these programs generally allow nonparent caregiver usually relative to assume legal custody of child and to receive subsidy equal to or somewhat less than foster care suppor t but typically higher than childonly tanf payment most states require th at child be under child welfare custody before relative caregiver can have access to the subsidized guardianship program however and this significantly limits the scope of service benefit fl and mo are the notable exceptions some states require that the caregiver first access tanf childonly benefit befo re receiving additional assi stance while as many as nine states simply used tanf funds to operate subsidized guardianship program34 childonly cases with parents childonly cases where parent received ssi likely existed prior to the 1996 welfare reform law but changes made by the reform established several new kinds of childonly cases including families where parents are ineligible for benefits due to citizenship status or sanctions and these have been of particular concern to ch ild welfare advocates for fy2000 little less than half of 782000 childonl families 463

effect on child welfare the 1996 welfare reform law severely limited federal aid to legal immigrants who arrived in the united states after au gust 16 1996 and have lived in this country for fewer than 5 years citizen children of these immigrants however remain eligible for cash aid the new jersey study found th at compared to children living in tanf families that included parent in the

50 of the federal poverty level research concerning the effect of this change on child welfare is limited however analysis of state level data between 1990 and 1998 did not find an association between the level of substantiated child maltreatment and availability of benefits to immigrants at the same time urban institute researchers note that in 5 of the 12 states they surveyed in 1999 workers reported an increase in maltreatment among immigrant children36 the 1996 welfare reform law also required states to sanction adults who failed to meet work and other requirements curre ntly states have the option to reduce the family benefit by the amount of money th at would otherwise be paid to the non cooperating adult in these cases child only case occurs because of the sanctions some states however require full family sanction meaning the entire grant is ended and the house has pa ssed welfare reform legisla tion hr 4737 that would require full family sanctions in nearly every
