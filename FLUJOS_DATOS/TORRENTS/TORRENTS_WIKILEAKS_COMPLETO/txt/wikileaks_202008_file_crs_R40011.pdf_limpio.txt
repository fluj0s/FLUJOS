us military operations in iraq are congressionally authorized pursuant to hjres 114 pl 107 243 which authorizes the president to use the armed forces of the united states as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in order to 1 defend the national security of the united states against the continuing thr eat posed by iraq and 2 enforce all relevant united nations security council resolutions regarding iraq it also requires as predicate for the exercise of that authority that the president determine that diplomatic efforts and other peaceful means will be inadequate to meet these goals and that the use of force against iraq is consistent with the battle against terrorism 1 hjres 114 appears to incorporate any future resolutions concerning the continuing situation in iraq that the security council may adopt as well as those adopted prior to its enactment2 the authority also appears to extend beyond compelling iraqs disarmament to addressing the full range of concerns expressed in those resolutions as well as for the broad purpose of defending the national security of the united states against the continuing threat posed by iraq the united states and great britain along with number of other countries invaded iraq in march of 2003 asserting the authority to enforc compliance with earlier security council resolutions that addressed the situation in iraq and kuwait3 other security council members disagreed with this interpretation of the previous resolutions denying that these resolutions contained continuing authorization to use force against iraq despite the initial lack of consensus regarding the legality of the invasion the security council adopted subsequent resolutions recognizing the occupation of iraq and generally supporting the coalitions plans for bringing about democratic government in iraq 4 the first of these resolution 1511 october 16 2003 recognized the coalition provisional authority cpa and underscored the temporary nature of its obligations and authorities under international law which it said would cease when an internationally recognized representative government established by the people of iraq is sworn in and assumes the responsibilities of the cpa 1 in paragraph 13 resolution 1511 authorized multinational force under unified command to ta ke all necessary measures to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in iraq including for the purpose of ensuring 1 in march 2003 president george w bush reported to congress the determination that was required by pl 107243 regarding his

and programme for establishing permanent government in iraq as well as to contribute to the security of the united nations assistance mission for iraq the governing council of iraq and other institutions of the iraqi interim administration and key humanitarian and economic infrastructure the security council included in resolution 1511 commitment to review the requirements and mission of the multinational force not later than one year from the date of this resolution it further established that in any case the mandate of the force shall expire upon the completion of the electoral process outlined previously at which time the security council would be ready to consider any future need for the continuation of the multinational force taking into account the views of an internationally recognized representative government of iraq the security council resolutions do not provide for the immunity of coalition troops from iraqi legal processes sofa was not deemed possible prior to the recognition of permanent government in iraq 5 immunity for coalition soldiers contract workers and other foreign personnel in iraq in connection with security and reconstruction was established by order of the cpa which relied for its authority on the laws and usages of war as consistent with relevant security council resolutions cpa order 17 status of the coalition provisional authority mnf iraq certain missions and personnel in iraq6 established that all personnel of the multinational force mnf and the cpa and all international consultants are immune from iraqi

respect applicable iraqi laws but are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of their sending states states contributing personnel to the multinational force have the right to exercise within iraq any criminal and disciplinary jurisdiction conferred on them by their domestic law over all persons subject to their military law 7 in june 2004 in anticipation of the dissolution of the cpa and handover of sovereignty to the interim government of iraq the security council adopted resolution 1546 reaffirming the authorization for the multinational force in resolution 1511 while noting that its presence in iraq is at the request of the incoming interim government of iraq the terms of the mandate for the mnf are expressed in paragraph 12 in which the security council decides further that the mandate for the multinational force shall be reviewed at the request of the government of iraq or twelve months from the date of this resolution and that this mandate shall expire upon the completion of the political process set out above and declares that it will terminate this mandate earlier if requested by the government of iraq 5 the united states reportedly made an effort to estab lish sofa with the iraqi go verning council prior to the handover of sovereignty and establishment of the iraqi interim government but iraqi officials took the view that only permanently established government in iraq would have the authority to enter binding international agreements see robin wright us immunity in iraq will go beyond june 30 washington post june 24 2004 at a01 6 available at

reservations the resolution included statement that nothing in the agreement diminishes abridges or alters the right of the united states to safeguard its own security by excluding or removing persons whose presence in the united states is deemed prejudicial to its safety or security and that person whose presence in the united states is deemed prejudicial to its safety or security shall be permitted to enter or remain in the united states 27 the senate reservations to the nato sofa includ four conditions 1 the criminal jurisdiction provisions contained in article vii of the agreement do not constitute precedent for future agreements 2 when servicemember is to be tried by authorities in receiving state the commanding officer of the us armed forces in that state shall review the laws of the receiving state with reference to the procedural safeguards of the us constitution 3 if the commanding officer believes there is danger that the servicemember will not be protected because of the absence or denial of constitutional rights the accused would receive in the united states the commanding officer shall request that the receiving state waive its jurisdiction and 4 representative of the united states be appointed to attend the trial of any servicemember being tried by the receiving state and act to protect the constitutional rights of the servicemember 28 the department of defense issued directive 55251 providing policy and guidance specific to sofas29 the department of defense policy is to protect to the maximum extent possible the rights of us personnel who may be subject to criminal trial by foreign courts and imprisonment in foreign prisons30 the directive addresses the senate reservations to the nato sofa by stating even though the reservations accompanying its ratification only apply to na to member countries where it is applicable comparable reservations shall be applied to future sofas specifically the policy states that the same procedures for

and length of sofa and the united states has concluded agreements as short as one page and in excess of 200 pages sofa may address but is not limited to criminal and civil jurisdiction the wearing of uniforms taxes and fees carrying of weapons use of radio frequencies license requirements and customs regulations they do not generally authorize specific military operations or missions by us forces but the inherent right of selfdefense is not affected or diminished us personnel always have right to defend themselves if threatened or attacked and sofa does not take away that right32 the issue most commonly addressed in sofa is the legal protection from prosecution that will be afforded us personnel while present in foreign country the agreement establishes which party to the agreement is able to assert crimin andor civil jurisdiction in other words the agreement establishes how the domestic civil and criminal laws are applied to us personnel while serving in foreign country the united states has entered agreements where it maintains exclusive jurisdiction but the more common agreement results in shared jurisdiction between the united states and the other signatory country exclusive jurisdiction is when the united states retains the right to exercise all criminal and disciplinary jurisdiction for violations of the laws of the foreign nation while the individual is present in that country shared jurisdiction occurs when each party to the agreement retains exclusive jurisdiction over certain offenses but also allows the united states to request that the host country waive jurisdiction in favor of the united states exercising criminal and disciplinary jurisdiction the right to exert jurisdiction over us personnel is not solely limited to when an individual is located on military installation it may cover individuals off the installation as well the right to exert jurisdiction can result in complete immunity from the laws of the receiving country wh ile the individual is present in that country

agreement signed on november 17 20 08 is included by reference as part of the larger strategic agreement and although it is titled differently it is commonly referred to as the sofa as indicated above there are formal requirements as to the content detail or length of sofa but many agreements share the same basic framework and this one is different rules and procedures related to such issues as carrying weapons the wearing of uniforms entry and exit into iraq taxes customs and claims among other operational concerns are addressed in the agreement while there are many similarities between this and other sofas concluded by the united states most do not have an expiration date but this agreement is set to expire on december 31 2009 additionally there are substan tial departures from the clauses most often found in traditional sofa including in such areas as civil and criminal jurisdiction the authorization for military operations the establishment of withdrawal timeline and the creation of committees to implement the agreement 32 see cjcsi 312101b standing rules of engagement for us forces u june 13 2005 the sroe is classified document but portions are unclassified

of sofas and is addressed in article 12 of this agreement the agreement creates two distinct classes of individuals 1 us forces including the civilian component and 2 us contractors and their employees33 the two classes are treated differently with respect to civil and criminal jurisdiction iraq maintains exclusive jurisdiction over us contractors and their employees but shares jurisdiction with the united states over us forces including the civilian component as the term is defined in the agreement us contractors and their employees only applies to contractors that are operating under contractsubcontract with or for the united states forces 34 therefore us contractors operating in iraq under contract to other us departmentsagencies are not subject to the terms of the sofa and are arguably immune from iraqi civil and criminal jurisdiction as long as cpa order 17 remains in effect according to the terms of the agreement iraq is able to assert exclusive jurisdiction over us forces including the civilian component for the commission of grave premeditated felonies while offduty and outside agreed upon facilities and areas 35 it is unclear what crimes constitute grave premeditated felony as the term is not further defined rather the agreement calls for the creation of usiraqi joint committee to enumerate the grave premeditated felonies36 only after the committee enumerates the offenses and also establishes procedures and mechanisms consistent with due process standards and protections available under us and iraqi law will iraq be able to assert jurisdiction over us forces and members of the civilian component 37 additionally iraq is required to give notice to the united states within 21 days of discovery of the alleged offense that it intends to assert jurisdiction38 at that point the united states may request that iraq waive its right to jurisdiction but iraq is not obligated to relinquish its right39 all offenses committed by us forces or members of the civilian component not considered grave premeditated felonies remain under the exclusive jurisdiction of the united states the us forces and civilian components are entitled to due process standards and protections pursuant to the constitution and laws of the united states40 in the event that the victim of the crime is an iraqi citizen the united states when mutually agreed by the parties will seek to hold the trial of the accused in iraq but if it isnt feasible to do so efforts will be undertaken to allow for the personal attendance of the victim at the trial in the united states 41 33 agreement between the united states of america and the republic of iraq on the withdrawal of united states forces from iraq and the organization of their activities during

offense considered to be grave premeditated felony determination must be ma as to duty status if the individual is determined to not be in duty status iraq will be able to assert jurisdiction however if the determination is made that the individual is in duty status at the time of the offense the us will retain exclusive jurisdiction the determination of duty status is the responsibility of the us authorities42 if the iraqi authorities believe that an individual was not in duty status and therefore should be subject to their jurisdiction they may appeal the determination to the joint committee the same committee responsible for establishing the procedures and mechanisms for asserting jurisdiction but the ultimate determination remains with the us authorities43 article 12 of the agreement also includes one very unusual clause requirement to review the terms of the article every 6 months44 while the overall agreement is for term of three years and may be canceled by either party with oneyear notice the terms of the civil and criminal jurisdiction clause are reviewable but the agreement does not specify any mechanisms for modifying the agreement it remains to be seen who would approve the changes would it require the consent of all the political bodies in iraq like the original agreement or might it be changed at lower level

this agreement is different in that it specifically addresses military operations by us forces in cooperation with iraqi forces in article 4 iraq requests the temporary assistance of the united states

groups outlaw groups and remnants of the former regime 46 all military operations conducted must be with the agreement of the government of iraq47 the agreement calls for the creation of new joint military operations coordination committee jmocc which will oversee the coordination of all military operations48 there is an additional requirement that all operations shall not infringe upon the sovereignty of iraq and its national interests as defined by iraq and us forces must respect the laws customs and traditions of iraq 49 it has been suggested that us forces are in some manner under

foreign country is common clause found in many if not all sofas the potential for military operations is also addressed in article 27 deterrence of security threats of the agreement the agreement calls for strategic deliberations in the event of external or internal threat or aggression against iraq and states the united states shall take appropriate measures including diplomatic economic or military measures to deter the threat50 it has been argued that this clause requires the united states to come to the defense of iraq and therefore this agreement is more than sofa but rather it is security agreement and requires the input and consent of congress51 when the clause is read in its entirety the united states is not required to do anything other than engage in strategic deliberations and then only at the request of iraq as part of the deliberations all options are available to the parties including military measures but none are absolutely required actions 52

forces from foreign territory is unique to this agreement54 the withdrawal is twophase proce ss the first requires the withdrawal of all us combat forces from iraqi cities villages and localities later than june 30 2009 the second requires the withdrawal of all us forces from iraq i territory later than december 31 201155 the jmocc created to coordinate military operations will establish the areas and facilities where us forces will be stationed between june 30 2009 and december 31 201156 additionally the clause recognizes the sovereign right of iraq to request the departure of us forces at any time and also the right of the united states to withdraw its forces at any time57 even though the term of the agreement is three years and either party may cancel the agreement with oneyear notice both countries retain the right to remove us forces independent of the agreement however because the agreement requires the removal of all us forces later than december 31 2011 if any us forces were to remain in iraq in support of security training or other programs the withdrawal agreement will need to be extended or replaced with standard peacetime sofa 50 id article 271 51 for discussion

of sofas concluded by the united states have not required additional implementing agreements or the creation of co mmittees to implement the agreement this agreement is different in that it requires the creation of fewer than three joint committees for implementation58 joint ministerial committee is to be the first committee created and it requires participation at the ministerial level determined by both parties59 the joint ministerial committee is then responsible for creating the jmocc discussed above consisting of representatives from both parties60 the joint ministerial committee is also responsible for creating joint committee with representatives from both parties responsible for addressing all issues outside the exclusive competence of the jmocc61 the joint committee is then authorized to create joint subcommittees as needed62 while the agreement calls for the creation of the numerous committees the specifics of membership or the rules and procedures that should be utilized by the committees is not established how the committees are to operate within the framework of the overall agreement is unclear there is dispute resolution mechan ism within the implementation clause the potential exists for confusion as to how the committees will function and therefore they may be unable to implement the agreement for example are the committees able to modify the agreement or must the agreement be submitted to the larger government bodies congress through its ability to exercise oversight of the implementation of the agreement may be able to provide
