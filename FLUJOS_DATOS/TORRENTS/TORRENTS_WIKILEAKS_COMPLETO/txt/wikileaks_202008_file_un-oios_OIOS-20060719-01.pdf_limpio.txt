procurement task force report on walter cabrera strictly confidential ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 2force through separate referral fi rst mr cabrera is alleged to have improperly provided notification to prospective vendor that approval had been granted in favor of the vendor thunderbird llc thunderbird for contract to provide manpower support in missions prior to the official award of the contract secondly the audit report found that cabrera engaged in misconduct in connection with the procurement exercises in substantial contracts ultimately awar ded to the firm telecommunications consultants of india tcil th audit report found significant fraud indicators in connection with the procur ement exercises in these contracts conclusion with which the task force agrees the task force will report on these issues in much more detail in subsequent report addressing related matters however the focus of this report is upon the conduct of mr cabrera individually and whether mr cabrera acted improperly in his participation in these matters applicable rules and regulations this matter is examined within th confines of the applicable united nations regulations and rules nd in particular the following rule 12b which requires staff memb ers to uphold the highest standards of efficiency competence and integrity the regula tions define the concept of integrity to include but not limit ed to probity impartiality fairness honesty and truthfulness in all matters affecting thei r work and status rule 12i which requires that sta ff members shall exercise the utmost discretion with regard to all matters of official business they shall not communicate to any government tity person or any other source any information known to them by reason of their official position that they know or ought to have known has been made public except as appropriate in the normal course of their duties or by authorization of the secretary general methodology the task force has examined the di scussion and findings in the audit report and spoken with both the auditors responsible for the matter and on several occasions mr cabrera the ta sk force has examin ed the file from oios procurement task force report on walter cabrera strictly confidential ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 3the procurement department pd in connection with the thunderbird matter and the tcil contracts howeve r substantial portions of the files concerning both of these cases were f ound to be missing nonetheless the task force has examined relevant email communication electronically stored records and hard copy documen ts received through variety of sources the task force has spoken w ith the officials in dpko responsible for requisition of the items underlying the contracts at issue and other united nations procurement officer s involved in these matters with regard to the tcil contracts the investigation of mr cabreras involvement in the laptop procuremen t more fully discussed below has faced number of significant ch allenges including the procurement departments policy of short term retention of cancelled bids and the turnover and movement of staff neve rtheless forensic data recovery has been an important tool utilized to examine the circumstances and the relevant communication on the issue in connection with the thunderbird matter significant portions of the thunderb ird file are also missing in that case as well the task force has been able to use forensic resources to gather significant relevant information and evidence discussion notice of the award to thunderbird llc the facts of this matter as they relate to mr cabrera are not in dispute in may 2002 thunder bird llc thunderbird through mr nishan kohli its managing partner d submitted an application in support of registering with the organization as vendor authorizing it to submit proposals on upcoming contracts in july 2002 after successfully being registered by pd thunderbird throug h nishan kohli submitted proposal for the supply of engineering manpower to various missions in response to the rfp issued by the procurement department ultimately mr sanjaya bahel chief of field procurement had made presentation to the headquarters committee on contracts h cc in favor of the award to thunderbird the matter had not been assigned to mr cabrera until late december 2002 and he was involved in the case only peripherally until that time oios procurement task force report on walter cabrera strictly confidential ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 4however after the presentati on by mr bahel to the hcc on 4 september 2002 the hcc granted exped ited approval for an extension of the existing contract being performed at the time by iecsircon iecs and subsequent award to thunderbird to replace iecs the circumstances surrounding the request fo r expedited approval and the basis for it are not fully clear there is record of such request and there is reference to any such request in the minutes of th hcc mr cabrera has denied making the request and there is information in the procurement departments files on the issue or to suggest mr cabrera made the request however it is clear that the requ est is required to come from the procurement department either the fficer making the presentation or the supervisor the line officer who atte nded the hcc meeting with mr bahel has denied making the request at any time and there is not evidence to suggest that she did however the investigation s revealed mr bahels personal involvement in ensuring that the ve ndor thunderbird received advanced notice of the likely award other than the hcc secretary mr bahel is also the only individual associated with th request for expedited approval in position to seek it the need for expe dited approval for thunderbird in the first instance and the effort to notify t hunderbird quickly of likely award is questionable in light of the fact that in the same hcc meeting the current vendor iecs was granted an extension to continue for an additional two months and that thunderbird had fa iled to submit audited financial statements and was given an additional four weeks to accomplish the task however thunderbird took over eight weeks to file the forms thus the basis for the intensive effort by mr bahel to notify thunderbird is problematic especially in light of the fact that thunderbirds application was still not yet complete curiously there is request for advanced notification to iecs of the exped ited approval of their extension while the minutes of the hcc meeting were pending and not yet finalized however one page form had been issued by the hcc granting expedited approval for both the continuation of the current contractor and for the replacement thunderbird the circumstances surrounding the creation of this form and the request for expedited approval in the first instance are troubling and are tinued subject of the task forces investigation however at present there is evidence in the possession of oios procurement task force report on walter cabrera strictly confidential ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 5the task force which demons trates mr cabrera particip ated in this aspect of the matter after the hcc presentation mr ba hel who was scheduled to leave new york for annual leave convened meeting with ms jane redfern procurement officer and mr walter cab rera prior to his departure in this meeting mr bahel instructed them to notify thunderbird of the recommendation to award the contract to them according to mr cabrera he understood that he was not able to provide letter of intent loi to thunderbird but was able to give ve rbal notification of the hccs action based upon the document issued by the hc c mr cabreras understanding that this action was permissible was ba sed upon the fact that his supervisor mr bahel directed him to do it as well as his independent understanding at the time at the direction of mr ba hel mr cabrera did in fact notify mr nishan kohli that the hcc had recomme nded that the contract be awarded to thunderbird and that thunderbird woul d likely receive the contract mr cabrera asserts that he further notified mr kohli that pd could not issue an loi prior to receiving the approved h cc minutes and formal award of the contract mr kohlis explanation of the events in his written submission to the organization through his attorney ma terially differs however the task force does not find mr kohlis representations credible mr cabrera concedes that he pr ovided notice to nishan kohli at the express direction of mr bahel afte r the hcc had issued notice of expedited approval according to mr cabrera mr bahel left instructions to await copy of the approval in hi s inbox in the procurement office further according to mr cabrera mr bahel explained to mr cabrera that he would be out of the office and reque sted that mr cabrera should retrieve the document and notify the vendor of the likely award mr cabrera acknowledges that he followed the direc tion and in the course of contact with mr kohli he pr ovided the notification while the salient facts as they relate to mr cabrera set forth above are not in dispute the propriety of his ac tions has been questioned the task force has examined whether mr cabrer as conduct ran afoul of any relevant united nations regulations or rules particularly the prohibition against improper communication of propriety information to those outside of the organization not authorized to receive it regulation 12i the prohibitions oios procurement task force report on walter cabrera strictly confidential ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 6against favoring particular vendors in bidding exercises and the procurement rules in gene ral mr cabreras cont ention in defense of his actions is that in instances in which the hcc grants expedited approval and thereafter issues the approval form tification to the vendor that an award is likely does not contravene existing rules the task force has not been able to identify any precise procurement rule on this point in ex istence at this time and requests of numerous departments in the organizati on have failed to produce anything relevant hence there does not seem to be any clear directive either permitting or prohibiting such action fu rther several witnesses within the organization with significant experi ence in procurement matters have informed the task force that in circ umstances in which expedited approval is sought it is not improper to provi such conditional notice to allow contractor to prepare to comply with its obligations under the contract and allow them to adequately prepare themselv to perform in timely fashion while it is certainly questionable whethe r in this instance notice of expedited approval was truly exigent in light of the fact that the vendor was not going to perform under the contract for tw months and thunderbird had yet to submit audited financial statements th ere is evidence that suggests mr cabrera shared responsibility for the re quest in the first instance or was otherwise aware of the unexplained circumstances of the request for expedited approval and the basis for it therefore in light of the fore going and the absence of clear regulation to the contrary demonstra ting that mr cabrera should have known his actions were improper th notification mr cabrera provided cannot form the basis of an adverse finding against him the tcil contracts the contracts awarded to the firm telecommunication consultants of india tcil have been the subject of extensive examination by the task force again while these matters will be discussed in much more exhaustive and comprehensive detail in subsequent report they are addressed herein only as they relate to mr cabrera oios procurement task force report on walter cabrera strictly confidential ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 7 the task force has exam ined the five contracts set forth in table 11 of the audit report ap200560020 of ja nuary 19 2006 at paragraph 123 while the task force acknowledges that the auditors quite correctly found that strong indications of fraud existed in connection with these contracts an examination of mr cabreras role in these matters has not resulted in evidence of improper conduct on his part the investigation has found that mr cabrera was not involved in the bidding procedures in these matters with the exception of one contract wh ile an extensive discussion of all of these cases is therefore unnecessary an analysis of case 5 pd15502 the laptop computers requires discussion as mr cabrera was the case officer in this matter the audit report f ound at paragraph 12 5 that there were indications that walter cabrera distorted communication to dpko for the purpose of canceling the initial bid where tcil was not the lowest bidder and the compaq brand of co mputers offered by tcil was not going to be selected as standardized bra nd tcil won the replacement bid in addressing this issue some background is necessary first it should be noted that the procurement f ile in this matter was found to be incomplete missing documents and releva nt information the task force was able to identify more details as re sult of forensic analysis of electronic media however it cannot be said that the task for ce is comfortable that all information involving this matter has been gathered that said the task force was able to reconstruct the follo wing facts concerning this matter from various documents and searches of ectronic media and discussions with relevant parties in february 2002 dpko communica tions and technology services division cits sought to obtain new systems contract for laptop computers mr cabrera was the proc urement officer in the procurement department pd assigned to this matte r the chief of cits communicated his request to pd and on february 25 2002 an expression of interest was issued by pd an invitation to bi d followed on april 15 2002 which was transmitted to 36 vendors from nine countries cits advised pd th at they desired only ibm dell and compaq based on itsd standards for desktop com puters on the other hand pd and the information technology services division itsd involved in the oios procurement task force report on walter cabrera strictly confidential ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 8process by mr bahel recommended adding toshiba sony fujitsu and nec to the list in subsequent ex change of emails between pd and the requisitioner cits and it sd cits continued to assert that they sought only the three major brands of com puters to avoid inferior products laptops from questionable manufact urers clones and home built computers ultimately however cits agreed that they were amenable to expanding the field to include other ma jor brands of computer manufacturers who were recognized industry leaders as result on april 24 2002 the case officer mr cabrera issued bid amendment notification to the vendors correcting the anticipated qua ntity of the computers sought and clarifying that that only compaq ll ibm toshiba sony fujitsu and nec brands would be considered for solicitation on may 15 2002 the bids were read publicly cresta communications of california submitted the lowest priced bid based upon pentium iii toshiba model tcil wa s the next lowest bidder offering compaq model followed by dell and then ssdi with an ibm and finally manchester technologies offering fu jitsu model on may 30 2002 mr cabrera notified cresta that th company needed to resubmit the specifications for the toshiba model th ey were offering as the table of compliance with the bid technical term s was absent and specification pages from crestas submission were contrary to the proper format nevertheless mr cabrera allowed cresta to resubmit the pages in its response cresta informed pd that toshiba was discontinuing the pentium iii model offered in its original submission but that they would upgrade the model propos ed to pentium iv at extra cost to the organization cresta in formed pd that because toshiba was discontinuing the pentium iii model they therefore could not provide the anticipated quantity of pentium iii laptops called for in the rfp however cresta informed pd of its ability to fill the order for the guaranteed quantity with the currently proposed m odel and of its readiness to fill the remainder with an upgraded model at extra cost the investigation has re vealed that mr cabrera forwarded to cits by email crestas updated offe r of an upgraded model email communication reflects that mr cabrer as dialogue with dpko continued with respect to crestas offe r the task force has expended oios procurement task force report on walter cabrera strictly confidential ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 9considerable effort to reconstruct the sequence of events that followed three week lapse existed be tween the time of the find ing that cresta was determined to be compliant and the initi ation of the rebidding exercise in the interim period email corres pondence confirms that dpko found lacresta to be technically compliant ev after the offer of an upgrade mr cabrera was further in the midst of pr eparing the presentation to the hcc procurement department officials concede that at this point there was further issue and there was jus tification not to award the contract to lacresta indeed justification is provided to cresta or found in the file it seems that cresta was not formally informed of the cancellation typically the case offi cer maintains the responsibility for communicating the cancellation to the ve ndor in this case there is correspondence in the case file from procurement to the vendor notifying them of the cancellation dpko official involved in the process has informed the task force that in conversa tions with pd in this interim period it was represented to him that pd had expressed view that there was an issue with lacrestas submission according to the official the procurement department suggested re bid because of technicality while the official objected he was told that because the matter is commercial one it is only within pds prerogative to cancel the bid on the basis of commercial noncompliance this explanation is not persuasive as there was commercial or technical issu with lacrestas bid dpko had found cresta to be compliant and the firm was the lowest bidder mr cabrera agrees that the reasoning proffe red by pd to the dpko official is not sound but takes issue with ny claim participation by him in the exchange or decision nonetheless it is clear that new invitation to bid itb was issued the basis for this renewed itb however is not clear nor is the identity of the individuals who s ought it the task force has not identified any evidence to support fi nding that mr cabrera was involved in the decision and the documents demons trate that mr cabrera continued to maintain dialogue with dpko concerni ng its requests further the task force has not identified evidence whic h suggests mr cabrera sought to cancel the bid and then seek rebidding exercise oios procurement task force report on walter cabrera strictly confidential ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 10the investigation has revealed howev er that mr cabreras supervisor sanjaya bahel was intimat ely involved in the matter and interjected himself in it communicating with itsd offici als and dpko officials the dpko official referred to above stated that he had conversations with mr bahel in which mr bahel confirmed that pd was of the view that there was technical issue with lacrestas bid and there should be new bidding exercise the proposal was rebid in early july the supplemental itb ultimately limited the solicitation to th three brands requested by cits the itb was based upon the upgraded speci fications the pentium iv model ten companies responded and two companies tcil and danoffice were the most competitive both offering the same compaq model tcil offered the lowest price followed by danoffice of the initial bidders tcil was the only company to offer lower price for the computer model it offered all other vendors raised their prices fro m the initial bid although cresta offered compaq brand and the s econd lowest bid the model it was offering was inferior to the models offered by tcil and danoffice and was in fact determined by cits to be noncompliant on july 18 2002 sanjaya bahe l the officer in charge of procurement at the time recommended the award to tcil for systems contract in the amount of us5340000 in the presentation of the matter to the hcc officials questioned the basi s for limiting the bidding exercise to the three specified brands and intimated that the pd violated rules and regulations by the use of brand names in its itb email communication after the event describes circumstance in which dpko officials are questioned about the limitation of the resolicitati on to the three preferred brands the hcc stated that were it not for the imminent loss of funds the committee would have recommended that rebi dding exercise be conducted inviting all brands of laptops that met the s requirement nevertheless the proposed contract award to tcil wa s ultimately approved and signed the cancellation of the first bid and the invitation for vendors to resubmit further bids in light of the cancellation allowe d the other vendors second opportunity to bid on the laptop contract while it is unclear what precipitated this action the rebidding ex ercise is questionable in light of the fact that lacresta was held to be technically compliant and offered the oios procurement task force report on walter cabrera strictly confidential ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 11lowest bid on that basi s it appears that they s hould have been awarded the contract in the absence of objecti on by the requisitioner mr cabrera concedes that this is the case neve rtheless there is lack of evidence in possession of the task force that mr ca brera was factor in causing the re bidding exercise indeed he did not have the authority to do it and past practice suggests that such decision could only come from supervisor as such the task forces investiga tion cannot conclude that mr cabrera engaged in this act to favor tcil not withstanding the fact that cancellation of the initial bid and the rebidding exercise allowed tcil and the other vendors second opportunity for the contract conclusion based upon the foregoing the task forces investigation has been unable to identify sufficient basis to support finding that procurement officer walter cabrera acted in viola tion rules and regulations of the organization in connection with 1 his involvement in the thunderbird matter in 2002 and 2 his participa tion in the tcil contracts and in particular the laptop contract which were the subject of the audit report
