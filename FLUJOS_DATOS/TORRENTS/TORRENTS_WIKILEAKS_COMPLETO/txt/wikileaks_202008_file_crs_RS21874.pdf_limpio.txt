elections was the selection of former general wiranto to be the golkar party pr esidential nominee wiranto defeated golkar chairman and speaker of th parliament akbar tandjung in 315 to 227 vote of golkar party delegates wiranto was indicted in fe bruary 2003 by united nations prosecutors for his alleged role in crimes against humanity in east timor in 1999 the lodging of the arrest warrant with interpol meant that wi ranto could be arrested if he leaves the country16 bilateral relations with the united states would have been greatly complicated if wiranto had become president given th history of congressional concern over human rights abuses in east timor that said fo rmer us ambassador to indonesia ralph boyce issued statement that we can work with anybody that comes out of free election process17 in 2000 thenpresident wahid rem oved wiranto from the cabinet after indonesias national human ri ghts commission held him responsible for the violence that was associated with the east timor referendum18 positive aspect of the postsuharto period of reform has been the expansion of the political party system the opening of indonesias democracy in the reformasi period witnessed the emergence of plethora of political parties the number has decreased from 48 in 1999 to 24 in 2004 the national awakeni ng party pkb was established in 1998 by nu which is believed to have membership of some 30 million traditionalistmembers mean ing pluralist and tolerant muslims in the indonesian context19 nu rejects the goal of establishing an islamic state under shar ia law and is open to nonmuslim members 20 national mandate partys pan support base in 2004 was drawn from the modernist isla mic organization muhammadiyah21 indonesia has continued to ma ke progress on government reform and the expansion of democracy most recently in early 2005 president yudhoyonos government moved to get the military out of busin ess parliament passed legislation in 2003 to impose transparent

say for average indonesians in the affairs of their daily lives24 political developments the successful series of elections of 2004 did much to consolidate the democratic process in indonesia they also more fi rmly established the dominance of secular nationalist parties golkar remains the largest political party despite its association with the now discredited regime of former president suharto vice president jusuf kalla is leader of golkar and there is speculati on about rivalry betw een kalla and yudhoyono25 megawatis pdip remains the second largest party though reduced in stature after megawatis defeat by yudhoyono in 2004 the democratic party of president yudhoyono was relative newcomer in 2004 as it did not contest elections in 1999 it is thought to have done well because it offere d an alternative to golkar and pdip which formed the established political elite despite the predominance of the secularnationalist parties there are parties with more islamic orientation including the prosperous justice party pks the national mandate party pan th national awakening party pkb and the united development party ppp26 there is some concern that the political parties lack maturity as demonstrated by allegations of bribery and vote buying at some party congresses27
