statutes include the national environmental policy act and the endangered species act the migratory bird treaty act addressed in veral pending militaryexemption bills is not listed here because it neither explicitly addresses its applicability to federal activities nor has generated consistent body of case law on the issue1 the national environmental policy act nepa requires each federal agency to among other things prepare an environmental impact statement eis on major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment nepa 1022c 42 usc 43322c the case law rejects

adverse modifica tion of designated criti cal habitat 7a2 16 usc 1536a2 two exemption processes are set out in the act first if after consultation with the secretary of interior or co mmerce as appropriate that secretary concludes that the taking of an endangered or threatened species incidental to the agency action will not violate section the 7a2 st rictures against jeopardizing listed species the action may proceed the secretarys favorable opinion constitutes as well compliance by the agency with the incidental take excepti on to the section 9 prohibitions abovehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21217crs6 if however the secretary s opinion indicates that the proposed agency action would violate section 7a2 then second exemption process comes into play in this circumstance the federal agency may apply to the appropriate secretary to exempt its proposed action 7g 16 usc 1536g the secretary then must submit report to an endangered species committee popularly known as the god squad discussing the availability of alternatives to the agency ac tion its benefits compared with alternative courses of action consistent with section 7a2 whether the action is in the public interest and of regional or national significance etc within 30 days after receiving the report the committee must decide whether to grant the exemption important here the committee shall grant an exemption for any agency action if the secretary of defense finds that such exemption is necessary for reasons of national security 7j 16 usc 1536j emphasis added
