but was not prepared to negotiate additional reunions ministry of unification mou xxxxx that angling for food assistance the dprk delegation asked whether the rokg brought gift the rokg responded that such aid would be premature in separate meeting an mou official described the mechanics of the family reunion process noting that the dprk gathered its participants in pyongyang for month of fattening up and indoctrination prior to the family reunification end summary kji green light for chusok deadline but nothing beyond 2 c xxxxx who recently returned xxxxx xxxxx at mount kumgang xxxxx seasoned mou officer who participated in previous negotiations with the dprk said he was surprised that dprk head delegate choi sungik was unusually cooperative during this round of talks choi infamous throughout the rokg for his gruff demeanor and tough tactics came to the table emphasizing he was authorized by kim jongil kji to meet the chusok deadline the north korean delegation however was not authorized by kji to discuss anything beyond october dprk asks about food gift 3 c according xxxxx the dprk delegation inquired whether the south korean delegation had brought gift hinting that they were expecting food aid the rok delegation responded that it was premature for such an arrangement xxxxx noted that this was big change pointing out that during the past 16 rounds of red cross negotiations the rokg always asked for the family reunions and rewarded the dprk with rice and fertilizer aid this time however the reunion suggestion came from the dprk and the rokg did not and has plans to offer food aid atmospherics food shipped in from pyongyang 4 c addressing atmospherics during the talks xxxxx said the two sides came to an impasse when the dprk delegation pushed hard for the resumption of mount kumgang tours they argued that kji had given his oral guarantee that rok citizens would be safe and nothing could be more secure than kjis word the rok delegation pushed back asking for written guarantee the impasse was broken when the rok side inquired whether the resumption of kumgang tours was prerequisite for the chusok family reunions the dprk delegation said xxxxx added that he suspects some kind of amendment to the 2004 security agreement for mt kumkang tours will be reached in the near future as compromise end note 5 c xxxxx both delegations took turns hosting dinner for the two nights they spent at mount kumgang he said the hotel and kitchen personnel were hired in hurry from nearby villages and food was shipped in from pyongyang xxxxx noted that the rok delegation was charged usd 50 per person for hosting its 70person banquet price that in fact covered the tab for the banquet hosted by the dprk delegation the previous evening carrot time 6 c xxxxx related that following the red cross talks the rokg has been reviewing what if any carrots should be offered to the dprk for its string of conciliatory gestures according xxxxx senior mou officials recognize that north koreas goodwill is cyclical but also want to acknowledge that dprk has done all that it could do except for denuclearization during the past few weeks xxxxx said that the rokg was carefully observing developments in usdprk relations and emphasized that seoul would come up with position not too far from washingtons position potemkin fattening up the reliable relatives 7 c xxxxx walked us through the mechanics of what comes next in the family reunion process xxxxx explained that the two koreas exchanged list of 200 names each on september 1 the rokg picked its families by lottery the dprk by political reliability xxxxx explained that each government would then search for relatives of those on the lists in the past he said about half of the participating rok families received confirmation from the dprk that their relatives were alive and were then able to hold unifications the rest of the rok families received death confirmations or the ambiguous word unconfirmed 8 c xxxxx asserted that once the dprk identifies politically reliable family members to participate in the upcoming reunions they will be transported to pyongyang and then fattened up with regular meals and vitamins to mask the extent of food shortages and chronic malnutrition in the north the lucky dprk reunion participants will also be provided with new clothing suits for men and traditional korean hanbok for women for the televised event in our earlier meeting xxxxx had commented that mou gives pocket and travel money to rok participants which they then pass on to their north korean relatives xxxxx sighed that the majority of the mou cash is usually pocketed by north korean officials who also force the north korean participants to return their new clothes tokola
