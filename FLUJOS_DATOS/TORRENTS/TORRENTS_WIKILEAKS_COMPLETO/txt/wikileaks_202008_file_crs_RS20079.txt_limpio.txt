reporting jerry heykoop agricultural policy analyst resources science and industry division summary on april 2 2001 the us department of agriculture usda implemented the livestock mandatory price reporting lmpr law lmpr was passed as part of usdas fy2000 appropriations law pl 10678 to address the concerns of some livestock producers about low prices increasing industry concentration and the availability of price information under the previous voluntary system usda reported data provided on voluntary basis by meat packers and processors on the prices they pay for animals the new law requires large packers to report not only negotiated sales but also forward contract and formula arrangement transactions since implementation lmpr has provided new information and further disclosure on pricing but the system has experienced problems on may 14 usda announced an error in the computer program which incorrectly calculated published prices since then usda has announced corrections on august 3 usda announced new confidentiality rule to go in effect on august 20 this report will be updated as needed background under the broad authority of the agricultural marketing act of 1946 7 usc 1621 1627 ams has long collected livestock and meat price and related market information on voluntary basis the agencys trained market reporters attend public livestock auctions visit feedlots and packing plants personally contact many individual buyers and sellers and consult with trade associations to develop data so buyers and sellers all have access to accurate and objective information from major markets throughout the country the information is disseminated through daily weekly monthly and annual written and electronic reports covering sales of live cattle hogs and sheep and of the wholesale meat products from these animals in recent years more and more animals have been sold under private marketing arrangements where prices were not publicly disclosed or reported some agricultural producers believing such arrangements made it difficult or impossible for them to determine fair market prices for their livestock called for mandatory price reporting congressional research service the library of congress crs2 mpr requirements for packers and others who process and market meat opponents of mpr including some meat packers and other farmers and ranchers argued that mpr would impose costly new burdens on the industry and could cause the release of confidential company information mpr attracted interest in congress in 1999 as members sought ways to help producers coping with low cattle hog and sheep prices also fueling interest were concerns about the increasing concentration of the livestock industry into larger and fewer entities and the impact of these changes on price transparency that is the ability of producers to obtain accurate timely price information and open competition in the 106th congress the house and senate agriculture committees held hearings on april 29 and may 26 1999 respectively on mpr the senate committee then marked up and approved an original bill s 1672 srept 106168 on july 29 1999 to amend the agricultural marketing act of 1946 to require mandatory price reporting s 1672 was the culmination of long period of intensive negotiations involving meat packing companies and livestock producers to design comprehensive price reporting law acceptable to both segments of the industry although the full senate did not vote on the proposal similar one was added to the conference version of usdas fy2000 appropriations hr 1906 hrept 106354 congress cleared the conference measure in early october and the president signed it into law pl 10678 on october 22 1999 mandatory price reporting provisions of the plan1 the new lmpr plan is in effect for five years besides preempting state laws the measure subjects packers to civil penalties of up to 10000 for each violation of not reporting and requires usda to collect and publish at least monthly information on retail prices for meat and poultry products the law also increases the number of required reports to 91 new reports under lmpr include the prior days swine market forward contract and formula marketing arrangement cattle purchases packerowned cattle and sheep information sales and purchases of imported boxed lamb cuts and live lamb premiums and discounts ams continues to collect information under the voluntary system however only data not published under the mandatory system is still published under the voluntary system the law further contains the following speciesspecific provisions cattle provisions cattle plants that slaughter at least 125000 head annually must report delineated by domestic and import market purchases twice day on all cattle purchased on live or dressed weight basis packers must report weekly on all cattle not purchased on cash spot markets such as through forward contracts or formula marketing agreements they also are required to report their sales of boxed beef by price volume 1 for further information on lmpr please see the ams page at httpwwwamsusdagovlsgpricehtm crs3 grade and whether for domestic or export sale usda in turn is required to compile and publish the data in detailed form at regular statutorilyprescribed intervals some of it several times per day pork provisions federallyinspected pork plants that slaughter at least 100000 head annually must report daily all prices also reflecting any premiums discounts and merit adjustments plus volumes and terms of sale for domestic hog purchases from the previous business day packers also must report hogs they have committed to purchase for the next 14 days usda in turn is required to publish detailed reports on hog purchases and slaughter twice daily plus separate weekly reports distinguishing between barrow and gilt slaughter and monthly rather than quarterly hogs and pigs inventory report usda also must maintain an electronic library on open hog marketing contracts offered by packers and monthly report of contracted swine numbers lamb provisions2 federally inspected lamb packer that processes at least 75000 head annually must report daily on lamb purchases and sales of boxed lamb usda will publish the information at least once daily packers also must report weekly on lambs not purchased on cash spot markets such as through forward contracts or formula marketing agreements which usda will publish weekly lamb importer who imports 5000 metric tons of lamb meat must report once week on prices received for imported meat sold domestically packers and importers must report purchases within the following time frames swine reported three times each day cattle and lambs reported twice each day domestic and export sales of boxed beef cuts including branded boxed beef cuts reported twice each day sales and purchases of lamb carcasses and boxed lamb cuts including branded boxed lamb cuts must be reported daily and sales of imported lamb cuts weekly ams in turn must collect assemble analyze and report the data within one hour of receiving the data implementing mpr usda published proposed rule in the federal register on march 17 2000 with 30day comment period final rule was published on december 1 2000 with the starting date for lmpr set at january 30 2001 in order to give ams more time to test new electronic information system the implementation date was moved to april 2 2001 lmpr currently is in operation on may 14 2001 ams discovered technical error in the computer program for mpr the error affected the cutout values for beef carcasses and primals the major components of carcasses usda aggregates individual meat cut prices to construct carcass value individual meat cuts reported by packers were reported accurately but due to the programming error the calculated carcass values were incorrect the program inadvertently was set up to also include noroll cuts usda inspected but not graded in the calculations of both the choice and the select this had the effect of lowering the value of choice and select cutouts the problem became apparent only when ams 2 although the act did not specify requirements for establishing lamb reporting program the secretary was given the authority to mandate such program if it is determined one is needed crs4 observed that choice cutout values were decreasing while choice cut prices were increasing in addition reporters did not observe usual seasonal price patterns that normally result in widening spread between choice and select carcasses in reported boxed beef carcass and primal cutout values these observations alerted reporters to potential problem once the problem was identified ams immediately suspended publication of boxed beef reports pending review of the situation ams discovered the source of the problem on may 16 arrangements were made to report data under the voluntary system in the interim on may 25 ams released corrected choice and select boxed beef cutout and primal cut values for april 3 through may 11 corrected calculations for the daily select cutout values for the period april 3 through may 11 averaged 071 or 060 percent higher per hundredweight than the values originally reported ranging from oneday low of 110 to oneday high of 172 the corrected choice cutout values averaged 285 or 226 percent per hundredweight higher ranging from oneday low of 073 to oneday high of 769 choice and select boxed beef cutout and primal cut values reported since may 16 have been correct according to usda on may 18 secretary veneman appointed review team headed by keith collins usdas chief economist to evaluate the mpr program and to assess the economic impact the misreported data may have had on livestock producers as part of its activities the review team met with representatives of the livestock and meat packing industries congress ams and contractor officials the review teams report is available at httpwwwusdagovocempreportindexhtm the review team found 1 testing conducted by ams was inadequate to ensure that the mpr system was accurately calculating reported data 2 ams plan to implement an audit surveillance plan is behind schedule 3 confidentiality provisions of the program are preventing the release of significant quantity of information under mandatory reporting undermining the objective of the authorizing legislation the review team recommended 1 further testing of the system including periodic tests that use more realistic test data from industry 2 attracting more candidates or seeking personnel details or reimbursable agreements with other agencies to obtain the needed expertise in order to perform audits 3 developing alternative standards that would be applied over multiday reporting period incorporate measures that ensure adequate frequency of reporting by firms to maintain confidentiality and be appropriately reviewed additionally the review team estimated that cattle producers lost 15 to 25 million in sales revenue due to the reporting error the national cattlemens beef association ncba estimated cattle producers may have lost 4254 million based on studies done by virginia tech and kansas state university precise determination of losses is difficult given the complexity of the market difficulty determining exactly when reporting of incorrect data began and ended and the chosen method of analysis in some cases producers and packers use the price reports to negotiate deals with some contracts pegged directly to the price reports according to usda it would be almost impossible to specify any losses to an individual producer given the complexities the review team examined three avenues for compensation to livestock market participants and concluded 1 producers could not sue usda for compensation 2 usda does not have authority crs5 to make direct compensation and 3 usda not support legislation allowing for such authority usda announced on july 2 that it was implementing the changes recommended by the review team and was looking at ways to change reporting confidentiality while improving the reporting of data confidentiality of published information 360 rule to preserve confidentiality and the identities of reporting processors 360 rule was adopted at the request of the office of management and budget under the 360 rule usda collects but does not report data from markets where there are fewer than three reporting entities or where any entity handles more that 60 of the total volume within particular area the 360 rule is guideline used by other federal agencies as well and is not statutory requirement several other federal agencies follow the 360 rule sometimes with variants of 350380 since implementation of lmpr the 360 rule has prevented significant amount of information from being released according to usda between april 2 and june 15 894 daily reports out of potential of 3740 reports 24 and 46 weekly reports out of potential of 230 reports 20 were not issued as result of confidentiality provisions for lambs significantly less information is being made available to the public under lmpr than was available under the voluntary system in addition to the reports not released many of the released reports contain lines that do not have data because of confidentiality problems 37020 rule on august 3 usda proposed 37020 rule to take effect august 20 the 37020 rule means that over 60day period 1 at least three entities have to submit data at least 50 of the time 2 one entity can account for more than 70 of the data for report and 3 the same firm cannot be the only reporting entity more than 20 of the time the new rule is expected to increase the percent of market information reported usda estimates that between april 2 and june 14 30 of daily swine and cattle reports were withheld for confidentiality reasons under the 360 rule if the 37020 rule had been applied over that same period fewer than 2 would have been withheld the new rule would mean there may be days when only one packer reports live cattle prices although confidentiality will be maintained according to ams it is difficult for anyone other than the buyer and the seller to know the identity of the buyer however ams recognizes that too many successive days with only one and the same firm reporting could increase the chance that market participants could identify the reporting firm the national meat association nma trade association representing meat processors is concerned about the possibility of published report containing information from only one entity in letter to secretary veneman on july 5 nma argued the new rule will make small and mediumsized packers vulnerable to their competitors and that it will violate the first amendment to the united states constitution by disclosing information about single firm when that disclosure is not only contrary to the firms interest but also not in the publics interest the mpr law further directs usda to protect the identity and proprietary information of reporting parties which nma argues the 37020 rule will not do the ncba and the american meat institute ami have crs6 come out in support of the 37020 rule stating it will provide further market information to producers while maintaining confidentiality additional concerns have been raised about having only one or two packers in the market who then might use mpr to set prices the 37020 rule could allow two packers to communicate through publicly reported information creating the possibility of collusion and price fixing another concern raised about reporting over longer period of time states that such change would risk concealing current market information by blending it with historical data of the previous days markets other suggestions for increasing published information while maintaining confidentiality include lowering packer size from 125000 head slaughtered per year to 50000 thereby increasing the number of packers required to report potential legislative changes one potential issue for legislative change is the legislated timeframes for reporting data to usda usdas review team identified at least one report with reporting deadline that occurs before the reporting firms have all the information on slaughtered cattle needed for the report another issue is the legislated timeframes for issuing reports if alternative standards for confidentiality cannot be found that also substantially increase reported data usda recommends consideration should be given to altering reporting timeframes this change might eliminate reports that cannot be completed in the time window and establish timeframes that ensure accurate and complete reports while maintaining confidentiality for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20079
