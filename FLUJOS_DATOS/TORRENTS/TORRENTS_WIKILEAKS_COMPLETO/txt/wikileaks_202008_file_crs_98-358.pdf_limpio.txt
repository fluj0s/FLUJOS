it compelled the military judge to exclude relevant material and favorable evidence offered by him he argued that he was constitutionally entitled to be given an opportunity to rebut the attack on his credibility as witness by laying founda tion for favorable polygraph evidence the government alleged that rule 707 does not impermissibly infringe on the sixth amendment it argued that the rule merely codifies all the evidentiary prohibitions against polygraph evidence and that even without rule 707 polygraph evidence would never be admissible the united states court of appeals for the armed forces set aside the decision of the united states air for ce court of criminal appeals which ruled in favor of the government the court of ppeals for the armed forces ruled that the appellant should be provided an opportunity to lay foundation for admission of the polygraph evidence the united states supreme court granted certiorari in united states v sheffer3 on may 19 1997 one of the two issues4 presented on appeal to the court was whether military rules of evidence rule 707 violates the sixth amendment if it interferes with the accuseds right to present testimony that is relevant and mate rial to his defense prior to the courts decision the scien tific community was extremely polarized regarding the reliability of polygraph techniques it would appear that the sheffer decision will not contribute to the reputation of the reliability of these techniques inasmuch as the court noted th at its accuracy rate has been described as being little better than could be obtained by the to ss of

ruling in daubert the court first noted in performin g their gatekeeping role judges must satisfy themselves that scientific evidence meets certain standard of reliability before it is admitted this means that the experts bald assurance of validity is not enough rather the part presenting the expert must show that the experts findings are based on sound science and this will require some objective independent validation of the experts methodology8 the ninth circuit court of appeals also considered three significant factors for determining whether the experts testimony is admissible the first factor is whether the experts are proposing to tes tify about matters growing na turally and directly out of research they have conducte d independent of the litigat ion or whether they have developed their opinions expressl for purposes of testifying9 second if the expert is not testifying based upon research independent of the litiga tion the party proffering it must come forward with other objective verifiable evidence that the testimony is based on scientifically valid principles10 one way of showing this as suggested by the court is by proof that the research and analysis

independe nt of litigation or that the experts res earch has been subjected to peer review is testimony of other experts12 the court explained that for other expert testimony to be sufficient the experts must explain precisely how they went about reaching their conclusions and point to some objectiv sourcea learned treatise the policy statement of professional associa tion published article in reputable scientific journal or the liketo show that they have followed the scientific method as it is practiced by at least r ecognized minority of scientists in their field13 the eleventh circuit has recognized that since the frye14 decision tremendous advances have been made in polyg raph instrumentati on and technique15 however the court said that the effect of the military ru of evidence rule 707 is to freeze the law regarding polygraph examinations without regard for scientific advances16 thus the effect of the rule would appear to limit the use of opinion or reputation evidence to establish the credibility of the appellant and we believe that the truthseeking function is best served by keeping the door open to scien tific advances17 with respect to the appellants case the court said we cannot determine wheth er polygraph technique can be said to have made sufficient technological advan ce in the seventy years since frye to constitute the type of scientific technical or other specia lized knowledge envisioned by daubert18 while the court of appeals in sheffer did not decide whether polygraph examinations are scientifically valid nor did they decide that they will always assist the trier of fact in this or any other case it merely sought to remove the obstacle of the per rule against its admissibilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98358crs5 1966 usl w at 4237 20id 21id at 4238 22id at 4237 23deciding that the sixth amendment right of th accused to call witnesses in his favor had not been violated the courts r easoning appears to have been based upon the conclusion that the results of the polygraph exam did not constitute factual evidence regarding the crime at hand rather the evidence introduced is the expert opi nion testimony of the polygrapher about whether the subject was truthful or deceptive in answ ering questions about the alleged crime per rule excluding polygraph results therefore does not prevent an accusedjust as it did not prevent respondent herefrom introducing factual evidence or testimony about the crime itself such as alibi witness testimony for the same reasons an expert polygraphers interpretation of polygraph results is not evidence of the accuseds whole conduct it is not evidence of the accuseds conduct at all much less conduct concerning the actual crime at issue it is merely the opinion of witness with knowledge about any of the facts surrounding the alleged crime concerning whether the defendant spoke truthf ully or deceptively on another occasion 66 uslw at 4239 n 13 24id at 4237 25see eg united states v cordoba

without rejecting unqualifiedly the argument that the defendants may have constitutional right to have polygraph evidence admitted at trial the court apparently is willing to allow many state and federal courts to continue banning such evidence20 the court noted that various courts may reasonably reach differing conclusions as to whether polygraph evidence should be admitted21 the justices may have been influenced by the fact that to this day the scientific community remains extremely polarized about the reliability of polygraph techniques22 while holding that the military rule does not violate the constitution23 the supreme court noted that most state courts ban polygraph evidence it was alsonoted that some federal cour ts have recently dropped the ban on such evidence thereby leaving the decision to the trial judges 24 although rule 707 applie s to the military courts it is very likely that the decision will have an impact on those civilian courts which have abandoned the per rule excluding polygraph evidence 25
