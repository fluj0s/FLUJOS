in recent years primarily due to the fact that financial losses attributed to it are estimated to be billions of dollars each year based on the fact that the medicare and medicaid programs make up the largest single purchaser of health care in the world and over 20 of all us federal government spending it is not surprising that these federal health programs have been considered prime targets for fraudulent activity2 the government has an array of statutes that it may use to combat health care fraud this report provides brief overview of selected federal statutes including programrelated civil and criminal penalties the antikickback statute the stark law and the false claims act that may be used to address fraud and abuse in federal health care programs3

penalties for fraudulent activities in health care include civil and criminal penalties as well as permissive and mandatory exclusions from federal health care programs 4 the basic medicare and

an interest in an entity that holds an ownership or investment interest in any entity providing the designated health service compensation arrangement is generally defined as an arrangement involving

arrangements20 or both21 the most recent final regulations accompanying the stark law were published in the federal register on august 19 200822 commentators have noted that these regulations make

potentially affects physicia nhospital relationshi ps is the expanded definition of entity that furnishes dhs the new definition of entity includes 1 persons or entities that perform the dhs as well as 2 persons or entities that have presented claim to medicare for the dhs prior to the regulations only the person or entity that billed medicare for the dhs was considered an entity for purposes of the stark law according to the preamble of the new regulations this change was made in light of the concern about risk of overutilization of health services where services were furnished under arrangements eg where an entity owned by one or more physicians contracts with hospital to provide dhs on behalf of the hospital see 73 fed reg 48434 48721 aug 19 2008 commentators have stated that

wide variety of conduct large number of criminal prosecutions civil recoveries and other cases brought against federal health care program providers involve false claims 25 these cases may be brought under the false claims act fca26 law of general applicability that is invoked frequently in the health care context in general under the fca person who knowingly submits or causes to be submitted false or fraudulent claim for payment to the us government may be subject to civil penalties and damages health care program false claims often arise in terms of billing including billing for services not rendered billing for unnecessary medical services double billing for the same service or equipment or billing for services at higher rate than provided upcoding under the fca defendant is liable to the us government if the defendant knowingly presents false or fraudulent claim to an officer or employee of the us government for payment or if the defendant knowingly makes or uses false record or statement to get false or fraudulent claim paid27 knowingly as defined under the fca mean s that the defendant must have had actual knowledge of the falsity of the information furn ished to the government acted in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information or acted in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information28 penalties under the fca include treble damages plus an additional penalty of 5500 to 11000 for each false claim filed civil actions may be brought in federal district court under the false claims act by the attorney general or by person known as relator ie whistleblower for the person and for the us government in what is termed qui tam action29 the ability to initiate qui tam action has been 24 for additional information on the stark law and description of each of the stark law exceptions see crs report rl32494 medicare physician selfreferral stark i and ii by jennifer osullivan 25 health law 44 barry furrow 2d ed 2000 it should also be noted that the government may be able to bring an action for false claim under several statutes other than the false claims act see eg footnote 7 and accompanying text see also 18 usc 1347 26 31 usc 37293733 27 31 usc 3729b for additional discussion of the false claims act see crs report rl30463 constitutional aspects of qui tam actions background and analysis of issues in vermont agency of natural resources v united states ex rel stevens by t j halstead 28 id 29 it may be noted that while the antikickback statute contains qui tam provision it is possible that violation of the antikickback statute may lead to liability under the fca for example some courts have found that violation of the antikickback statute can constitute violation under the fca if the government conditioned payment of claim upon the claimants certification of compliance with the antikickback statute and the claimant made this certification when in fact the antikickback provision was violated

other district courts have disagreed with this use of the fca see eg united states ex rel barmak v sutter corp 2002 us dist lexis 8509 sdny 2002stating that i am not convinced continued

may be initiated by private party who may have direct and inde pendent knowledge of any wrongdoing30 popularity of qui tam actions brought under the fca may be attributed partially to the fact that successful whistleblowers can receive between 15 and 30 of the monetary proceeds of the action or settlement that are recovered by the government31
