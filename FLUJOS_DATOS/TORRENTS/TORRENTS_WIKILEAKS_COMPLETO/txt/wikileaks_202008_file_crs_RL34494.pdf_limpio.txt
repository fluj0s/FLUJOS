foreign tax credit alleviates the doubletaxation that would result if us investors overseas income we re to be taxed by both the united states and foreign country us taxpayers credit foreign ta xes paid against us taxes they would otherwise owe and in doing so concede th at the country where income is earned has the primary right to tax that income but the united states retains the primary right to tax ussource income placing limit on the foreign tax credit foreign taxes can only offset the part of us taxpayers us tax that falls on foreign source income it is this limit to which the american jobs creation act of 2004 pl 108357 jobs act applied to calculate the limit firm separates its revenue and costs for tax purposes into those having foreign source nd those having us source foreign taxes can offset us tax on revenue sourced abroad in effect foreignsource income is exempt from us tax for firm s whose foreign tax credits exceed the limit firms with excess credits but because deductions allocated abroad reduce us tax the effect is the same as if deducti ons allocated to foreign sources can not be claimed for us tax purposes if us firm has foreign investments current law requires at least part of the us interest to be allocated to foreign sources based on the theory that debt is fungible that regardless of where funds are borrowed they support firms worldwide investment but multinational firms have argued that if part of domestic interest is allocated abroad part of foreign interest shoul d be allocated to the united states which would reduce us tax some critics have suggested however that granting multinationals tax benefits throug h interest allocation revisions should be accompanied by restrictions on the be nefit of deferral which allows taxes this worldwide allocation rule was adopted in the jobs act but has not yet been implemented the jobs act called for implementation startin g in 2009 while pl 110289 has subsequently dela yed implementation until 2011 other bills before the 110th congress including hr 3920 hr 5720 hr 6049 and hr 7060 would also delay or repeal the implementation of the worldwide interest allocation rule the analysis here suggests that current laws interest allocation rules are likely imperfectly structured to achieve the objective of the foreign tax credit limit and that worldwide allocation of interest as enacted by the jobs act while losing revenue would probably be more consis tent with the basic objective of the foreign tax credit limit tax planning techniques however could undermine this objective and cause further revenue loss and like the forei gn tax credit limit itself allocation rules contribute to tax distortions which may be heightened with worldwide allocation further an expansion of the bank subgr oup elections contained in the jobs act may not be consistent with the general objective of worldwide allocation of interest although the jobs act contains antiabuse rules these subgroup elections may permit firms to avoid the impact of the interest llocation rules this report will be updated as legislative events warranthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34494contents f u n c t

congress jcs505 may 2005 was hington gpo 2005the foreign tax credits interest allocation rules the american jobs creation act of 2004 pl 108357 the jobs act contained number of provisions related to the taxa tion of multinational corporations among these provisions were more generous rules for multinationals to use in allocating interest expense for purposes of the us fo reign tax credit this rule is referred to as the worldwide allocation of interest and it is the subject of this report the acts changes are due to take effect for tax years beginning after december 31 2008 the implementation was subseque ntly delayed until tax year s beginning after december 31 2010 by pl 110289 other proposals in the 110th congress including hr 5720 hr 6049 hr 3920 and hr 7060 would also delay or repeal the worldwide interest allocation rule the jobs acts interest allocation provi sion was designed to correct what some argue was an imperfection in the design of the foreign tax credit rules in general the tax code places limit on the foreign tax cr edit to calculate the limit firms are required to separate interest and other expenses according to source foreign or domestic because of effects detailed below the more interest that is assigned to domestic sources the more foreign tax credits firm can claim and the lower its us tax liability some believed that the prior laws approach unduly left taxpayers exposed to double taxation of foreignsource income1 the jobs act addressed this perceived flaw the analysis here indicates that worldwide allocation rules while losing revenue would likely be bette r aligned with the objective of the foreign tax credit tax planning techniques c ould undermine this objective and lead to increased revenue loss and efficiency costs the act contained another re levant modification to the interest allocation rules that would increase firms creditable taxes specifically the provision expands the subgroup election for banks to include ot her financial intermediaries including insurance companies which allows for the separate calculation of interest allocation this provision could insulate some firms from portion of the interest allocation rules and it is at odds with the theory underlying the acts other provisionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34494crs2 2 that is the resident principle is subordina to the source principle when the two are asserted by different jurisdictions 3 income received under subpart f rules which are aimed at sheltering activities is not eligible for deferralfunction and mechanisms of the us foreign tax credit the united states in principle ta xes its resident corporations and individuals on their worldwide income regardless of where it is earned under the residence rule the foreign tax credit and deferral are the key structural pieces of the us taxation of foreignsource income the foreign tax credit provisions generally permit us taxpayers to credit foreign taxes they pay against us taxes they would otherwise owe on dollarfordollar basis for example us corporation chartered in north dakota is potentially subject to us tax on income it earns outside the united states concurrently however the foreign countries where the income is earned generally tax that income even if it is earned by foreign us in this case investor under the source principle in th absence of the foreign tax credit this income would potentially face doubletaxati on and possibly very high tax rates the foreign tax credit however genera lly alleviates the possibility of double taxation of foreignsource income with the credit the us concedes that the country where income is earned has the prima ry right to tax that income and collect the tax revenue that it generates2 this results in the us collecting only the us tax due after paying foreign taxes if positive as such the foreign tax credit helps to define the us tax jurisdiction and it is not tax expenditure favoring selected groups while theoretically straightforw ard overlapping juri sdictions introduce numerous complications to better understand interest allocation rules it is useful to first examine two key structural pieces deferral and the foreign tax credit limitation deferral as noted above deferral is one of the ke structural pieces of the us taxation of foreignsource income usowned firms can conduct their foreign operations through foreign chartered subsidiaries like us chartered firms these foreign chartered corporations ar generally taxed only on in come earned in the united states thus where us parent firm invests abroad through foreign chartered subsidiary us taxes do not apply to its foreign income as long as the income is reinvested abroad3 us taxes are in other wo rds deferred or postponed because of discounting firms view the cost of taxes paid in the future as less than an identical amount paid in the present us taxes do pply when the income is repatriated to the us parent firm as intrafirm dividends foreign tax credits can be claimed with respect to us tax on dividends received from foreign subsidiaries in additi on to the direct cred it indirect foreignhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34494crs3 4 while the us parent can claim indirect fore ign tax credits with respect to dividends the dividends are also grossed up by the amount of the foreign tax before they are included in the parents taxable income thus parents taxable dividend from foreign sources is 11t where t is the foreign tax rate 5 in the absence of limit foreign countries could in theory divert tax revenue from the us by simply raising their taxes on us investors without fear of placing additional burdens on the us firms themselves 6 firms whose foreign taxes exceed the limit ar said to be in an excess credit position 7 thus the total tax rate is 35 10 plus 25 8 these relationships assume uniform definiti on of taxable income in the us and foreign countries tax credits can be claimed by us parent firm for foreign taxes paid by the subsidiary during the time the income was taxdeferred4 foreign tax credit limitation as noted above the us concedes that the country where income is earned has the primary right to tax that income and collect the tax revenue that it generates the us retains however the primary right to tax us sourceincome in order to protect its domestic tax base the us imposes limitation on the foreign tax credit5 in effect the tax code only allows foreign tax credits to offset the us tax on foreignsourceincome any foreign taxes paid in excess of the limit become excess credits and can be carried back one year and carried forward up to 10 years 6 the foreign tax credit and its mechanic s can be understood clearly by looking at the tax rate on foreign income that is produced by the foreign tax credit with the foreign tax credit and its limitations us investor pays total taxes us plus foreign taxes on foreign income at an average rate equal to the higher of the us precredit tax rate or the foreign tax rate for example if firm pays us tax at 35 rate and the foreign tax rate is 10 its total tax on foreign income would consist of the 10 foreign tax plus the 25 of us tax that remains after the 10 offset by the foreign tax credit7 if instead the foreign tax rate is 50 the firm could offset all of its us tax on foreign income with the foreign tax credit and would pay only foreign taxes at 50 rate8 if firm is in an excess credit position its foreign taxes exceed us tax on foreignsource income the sourcing of income and deductions matters under the foreign tax credit limitation maximum creditable foreign taxes are limited to the amount of us precredit tax falling on fore ign source income rather than domestic source income it follows that if for example an item of revenue is determined to have foreign rather than us source then the maximum foreign tax credit is increased because foreign income and th share of us precredit tax falling on foreign income is increased the reverse is true with deductions deduction allocated to foreign rather than us s ources reduces foreign income and us pre credit tax on foreign income it reduces creditable foreign taxes and increases after credit us taxhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34494crs4 9 this implies fungibility of equity ie the subsidiarys retained earnings support investment at home and abroad 10 the interest allocation provisions of the jobs act become effective for taxable years beginning after december 31 2008interest allocation rules whether an expense is deducted from foreign or us income matters for tax purposes the tax code therefore contai ns rules for allocating deductions between foreign and us sources in the case of interest expense the rules generally are based on the approach that money is fungib and that interest expense is properly attributable to all business activities and property of taxpayer regardless of any specific purpose for incurring an obligation on which interest is paid for example us parent company might borrow in the us and use the funds to increase its equity stake in foreign subsidiary wh ich uses those borrowed funds to make its own investments conversely us fi rm could borrow domestically to finance domestic investment investme nt that might otherwise have been financed through repatriated earnings in this case domestic borrowing may support both domestic and foreign investment9 while it is beyond the scope of this report to determin if the fungibility of debt is reasonable assumption except to r ecognize that it underlies both the current interest allocation rules and those enacted by the jobs act some facts on each side are worth noting first in favor of fungibility corporations are legal entities and not economic ones as result corporate boundaries can be easily manipulated for financial gain conversely the existenc of crossjurisdic tional interest rate differentials suggest that fungibility may not hold between all jurisdictions current law applies the fungibility principle in manner sometimes referred to as waters edge allocation under this sy stem foreign subsidiaries are not explicitly included in the allocation this has tw implications for the allocation formula first only domestic parents equity stake in its foreign subsidiary is counted as an asset excluding the foreign subsidiarys assets financed by debt the parents assets in contrast are all included in th calculation whether financed by equity or debt secondly the subsidiarys inte rest expense is automatically allocated to foreign sources this occurs since the subs idiarys interest expense reduces dividend payments to the parent which are all allocated to foreign sources worldwide allocation an alternative to the waters edge allocation is worldwide allocation regime such as enact ed by the jobs act10 under worldwide allocation the borrowing of foreign subsidiaries would be taken into account this change would have two effects which combined increase the foreign tax credit limit of multinationals and therefore decrease aftercredit us taxes the first effect involves including interest of the foreign subsidia ry by allocating portion of foreign debt to domestic use this reduces foreign source deductions increases foreign source income increases the foreign tax credit limit and reduces us tax liability thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34494crs5 second effect involves counting fo reign subsidiary debt finan ced assets as part of the worldwide asset base of the parent company taken in isolation this would allocate more interest to foreign sources and raise us tax liability mathematically however the first effect dominates so tax liability is reduced under worldwide allocation the advantages of worldwide allocation one can argue that worldwide allocati on more accurately limits the foreign tax credit to income that is attributable to foreign source as long as borrowed funds are fungible briefly this perspective results as follows if it is true that borrowing in one location finances investment in all locations equally then it is true that borrowing domestically or abroad should not alter the share of income earned domestically or abroad remembering that the purpose of the foreign tax credit limitation is to protect the us tax base while minimizin g doubletaxation of foreignsource income it then follows that location of borrowing should not affect the maximum creditable foreign taxes under current law the limitation can be affected by shifting the borrowing location disadvantages of wo rldwide allocation while worldwide allocation would achieve more accurate foreign tax credit limitation there are also some complications and disadvantages to such an approach including administrative complications tax planning complications and increases in investment distortions even though us re venue is lost als if interest rates vary across jurisdictions it isnt clear whether fungibility of borrowing is pervasive and that worldwide allocation of interest is completely appropriate to achieving the goal of limiting the foreign tax credit to income that is attributable to foreign source administrative complications one obvious disadvantage of worldwide allocation is that it would require foreign subsidiaries which are not always wholly owned by us firms to classify their ssets and borrowing for us tax purposes as having us or foreign location this change would complicate both irs tax administration and firm compliance tax planning second issue with worldwide allocation is the possibility that firms could artificially increase their gross foreign assets to eliminate any interest allocation under worldwide allocation th ere are decreases in the foreign tax credit limit if the foreign subsidiary has debt to asset ratio as high or higher than the parent company however if firms c ould borrow and redeposit funds they could increase their debt to gross asset ratios for example suppose parent company has 100 million in assets and its subsidiary also has 100 million in assets with only 50 million in debt attributable to the parent company under both current and pending law half of the bt 25 million would be allocated to the subsidiary this allocation is consistent with the worldw ide fungibility of debt suppose however that the subsidiary could borrow 100 million and redeposit the 100 million in bank account then allocation would occur the subsidiary would now have 200httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34494crs6 million in gross assets twothirds of the total gross debt would be 150 million and 50 million would be allocated to domestic uses the possibility of borrowing is one reason to restrain the allocation to non negative one otherwise this technique could be used at the extreme to further reduce us tax liability and to render the foreign tax credit limit meaningless while this discussion outlines possible tax planning technique firms may not choose to use it and that transaction cost s could reduce the value of the technique it does illustrate that at an extreme tax planning could eliminate the allocation rules entirely it is possible that other methods could be used to prevent such abuses but they would likely be complex and add to the administrative complications mentioned above economic efficiency another worldwide allocation issue concerns economic efficiency as noted above th purpose of the foreign tax credit limit is not to ensure the efficient allocation of resources rather it is concerned with protecting the us tax base the impact of worldwide allocation on the ability of the economy to efficiently allocate investment and borrowing among different locations however can be viewed as one cost of finetuning the foreign tax credit limitation in some respects worldwide allocation might create greater distortions in the allocation of debt and equity capital relative to the nontax allocation first worldwide allocation magnifies taxbased incentives to borrow abroad an important consideration if debt is not fungible as assumed allocating interest on the worldwide basis of aggregate capital stock for purposes of the foreign tax credit limit effectively reduces borrowing in the us and increases it abroad in effect any savings can be calculated by multiplying the foreign tax rate times the interest shifted abroad for example if the interest rate were 10 percent and the foreign tax rate 40 percent 100 dollar shift in debt from the us to foreign locale would save the company 4 if there were allocation rule s however then the shift in debt abroad would lead to larger interest deduction abroad but smaller foreign tax credit limit because the flow of dividends is net of interest costs in this case the benefit of shifting is the difference in the tax rates continuing our example the foreign tax rate is 40 percent and the us tax rate is 35 percent so that the savings is only 050 005 times the interest the current syst em is in between these two cases the allocation of domestic interest does mean that shift in the debt abroad has an effect in reducing the foreign tax credit limitation but not the effect that would occur with allocation rules similarly the degree to which equity investment is discouraged in the high tax countries general efficiency problem with international ta xation while minimized when there is allocation rule at all is likely to be larger with the worldwide allocation system than with the current allocation system the efficiency effects of shifting both debt and equity abroad simultaneously would be more complex and depend upon the level of debt by the parent firm and other factors in some cases the current allocation rules cause more distortions and in some cases they reduce distortionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34494crs7 overall the best system for minimizing the distortions in both the allocation of borrowing and equity investment is to have allocation rules at all nevertheless if the parent tends to do most of the borro wing which may occur for variety of non tax reasons having alloca tion rules could cause sign ificant loss of us revenue compared to both the current system and to the worldwide approach that is some efficiency cost is necessary to protect the us tax base in both cases however partial allocation rules are less distortionary than full allocation rules the rules are less clear with respect to investment shifts that occur simultaneously with debt shift these issues become more complicated when considering multiple country investments since firms are generally not required to calculate separate foreign tax credit limits for different countries firms can use excess credits from one country high tax country to shelter income from low tax country from us tax accordingly even if firm is in an excess credit position and makes interest allocations it will still be faced with an incentive to invest in lowtax countries moreover it is difficult to make precise judgements about econo mic efficiency when the tax system is not efficient in other ways such as with deferral nevertheless it is interesting that there are cases where change in the allocation rules that lowers taxes of multinational corporations can magnify distortions interest rate differentials final complication relating to interest allocation rules is the possibility of interest rate differentials in perfect world with completely mobile capital such interest rate differentials would not occur however if the domestic savers prefer investing in particular locations or there are differences in risk across locations such differentials may arise in particular if foreign interest rates are higher than us rates worldwide allocation rules will have larger effect increasing the foreign tax credit limit than would be the case where interest rates are identical it is difficult to ascertain how these inte rest rate differentials should influence the allocation process certainly the presence of interest rate differentials suggests that the very presumption of fungibility is in question and also suggests that the presumed standard that justifies worldwid allocation equal bttoequity ratios may not be the case while beyond the scope of this paper this area may need further exploration subgroup elections along with allowing firms to allocate interest expense on the basis of worldwide groups the jobs act contained an additiona l related change current law contains subgroup election for firms th at are banks the act expands this election to wider range of financial intermed iaries including finance companies and insurance firms such an election could potentially reduce the amount of interest worldwide group is required to allocate to foreign sources for example firm that has financial subsidiary which conducts ge nuine financial inte rmediation could arrange to have portion of the nonfinancial part of the firms borrowing undertaken by the subsidiary if the financial subsidiarys assets are principally located in the us borrowing through the subsidiary could be insulated from allocation rules morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34494crs8 directly stated firms could distribute their borrowing am ong related subsidiaries to minimize foreign allocations of interest the act does contain antiabuse provisions whose apparent intent is to limit such arrangements nonetheless it remains to be seen if the antiabuse provisions will be effective in limiting such arrangements as mentioned above the j obs act contains number of rules intended to limit the extent to which the expansion of th bank group election can be used to avoid interest allocation for example the act would limit the extent to which subgroup member can increase the portion of its earni ngs it pays to the parent as dividends this rule is presumably designed to limit the means by which subgroup can borrow and subsequently transmit debt to its parent if the subgroup is new however the rules for calculating average di vidends are confined to the subgroups years in existence which may provide mechanism for avoiding the limitation in short the acts subgroup election provision appears to present potential opportunities for firms to avoid the allocati on of interest according to the fungibility principle unlike the acts other changes in the allocation rules discussed above this feature of the bill appears to move th system away from the theoretically pure foreign tax credit limitation under the assumption of fungibility conclusion the analysis in this report suggests that there are benefits and disadvantages to worldwide allocation of interest enacted by the jobs act if debt is fungible worldwide allocation is the most accurate thod of ensuring that the us foreign tax credit is used for its intended purpose allowing the foreign tax credit to offset the full share of us precredit tax that falls on foreign source income absent additional rules however opportunities for tax planni ng may limit the achievement of this objective also like the foreign tax credit limit itself allocation rules tend to contribute to the distortions that discour age equity investment abroad adopting worldwide allocation rules could in several ways increase these distortions relative to current law while the distortions created by current law can be viewed as cost of collecting taxes since they increase us revenue and potential increased distortion associated with worldwide rule s cannot since they decrease us revenue finally the subgroup election provision in the jobs act does not appear consistent with the general objective of the foreign tax credit limit or the acts own worldwide allocation regime this subgr oup election may permit firms to reduce the current domestic interest allocation costs while achieving foreign interest allocation benefitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34494crs9 appendix effects of alternative allocation rules this appendix derives the allocation rules that most accurately support the foreign tax credit limitation the rules that most accurately limit creditable foreign taxes to us tax on foreignsource income while this ideal rule is one under which the location of borrowing does not affect the foreign tax credit limit for us tax purposes taxpayers could still change their overall that is foreign and us combined tax liability by switching the location of borrowing the appendixcontinues by showing how the incentive to borrow abroad is affected by allocationrules the discussion concludes with an analysis of how the allocation rules affect investment deriving accurate allocation rules the shape that accurate allocation ru take depends crucially upon the assumption of debt fungibility as noted in the text it is unclear whether fungibilityaccurately represents real world experiences since both current and enacted lawboth make this assumption however fungib ility w ill be assumed that debt supports investment in all locations regardless of the borrowing locale with the assumption of fungibility shift in the location of borrowing should not shift the location of investment furt her since investment produces income shift in the location of borrowing should not alter the proportion of income earned at home or abroad thus for the foreign tax credit limit to be accurate firm should not be able to affect the limit by shifting its location of borrowing the basic limitation without allocation of interest assume multinationals us tax liability can be expressed as 1 us tax ty d1 t f ibd td1 tf where t is the us tax rate is ussource income before interest deductions d is dividends from foreign subsidiary tf is the foreign tax rate i is the interest rate and bd is domestic borrowing the equations fi rst term represents the tax on worldwide income with dividends grossed up to pr eforeign tax basis while the second term is the foreign tax credit which is limited to the us tax on grossed up dividendsthe foreign tax credit is also limited to actual foreign taxes paid or deemed paid inthe case of dividends as result changi ng the base of the foreign tax credit only has an effect when company is in an excess credit position where the foreign tax rate is greater than the us rate for this analysis foreign subsidiary di vidends are defined in terms of foreign earnings and other elements as 2 f d r ibf tfyf ibf where yf is foreign earnings before deducting in terest r is retained earnings and bf is borrowing by the foreign subsidiary in all cases the amounts would be scaled back for subsidiary that isnt wholly owned eg if subsidiary is 90 percentowned then all three values would be mu ltiplied by 09 foreign earnings are the sum of dividends retained ear nings interest payments nd foreign taxes thereforehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34494crs10 3 d1 tf yf r1 tf ibf thus equation 1 can be rewritten4 us tax ty f r1 tf ibf ibd tyf r1 tf ibf for firm in an excess credit position the limitation l is the last term5 l ty f r1 tf ibf in this world without allocation rules that require the allocati on of domestic interest to foreign sources the taxpayer could increase the limitation and reduce theirtaxes by shifting borrowing to their subsidiary by reducing ib f and increasing ibd by equal amounts clearly if fungib ility is assumed requiring allocation rules does not result in an effective limitation adjusting for the fungibility of borrowing the ideal f r t h limitation to be unaffected by the location of borrowing geographicspecificborrowing cannot be parameter in equation 5 that is neither b f nor bd can appear in the equation this condition is satisfied incompletely by replacing the term ibf in the equation with ibt in this formulation the limitation could be unaffected by the borrowing location with an allocation rule allocating all borrowingcosts to foreign income or alternatively to domestic income clearly this is at odds with the assumption of fungibility that is if firm has both foreign and domesticinvestment supported by borrowing some portion of the interest on total borrowing must be allocated to foreign sources and that proportion must be independent of the borrowing locale thus assuming fung ibility an accurate limita tion can be written as 6 l ty f r1 tf iabt where is the portion of interest allocated to foreign sources fungibility requires that cannot be an arbitrarily chosen fraction 50 for example and that only the location of assets defines thus 7 kfkt the ideal limitation can therefore be defined as 8 l tyf r1 tf ikfktbt next we compare the current laws allocation and the jobs acts rules to this ideal formula adjusting for the fungibility of borrowing current law and the jobs act as noted in the text current law requires part of domestic borrowing to be allocated to foreign sources however because the subsidiarys own interestpayments reduce repatriated earnings and not domesticsource income all the subsidiarys borrowing costs are automatically allocated to foreign sources thus theparameter b t in the ideal limitation equa tion 8 bove is repl aced by bd in addition not all the subsidiaries assets ar included in the allocation rule only the parents equity stake in the subsidiary is included thushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34494crs11 9 kf bfkt bf and 10 l tyf r1 tf ibf ikf bfkt bfbd and since bd bt bf 11 l tyf r1 tf ibf ikf bfkt bfbt bf given that the limitation is clearly dependent on the location of borrowing ie the respective values of bf and bd current law violates the principle of fungibility that is taxpayer can increase or decrease the limitation by shifting the borrowinglocation while full discussion of this topi c is in the following section below note for now that dldb f 0 and that taxpayer can increase their limitation by shifting borrowing from domestic to foreign locations given current law violates the principle of fungibility lets turn to the jobs acts rules as noted in the text all assets of the subsidiary are included in theallocation formula thus equation 7 is unchanged additionally the interest expense of the subsidiary is so subject to allocation both b d as in equation 9 and bf are multiplied by this can be acco mplished by allocating part of domestic interest to foreign sources and part of fo reign interest to dom estic sources since foreign borrowing has already been nette d out of the dividend thus the limitation equation can be expressed as 12 l tyf r1 tf ibf ibdkfkt ibfkdkt this simplifies to13 l l ty f r1 tf ikfktbt which is the ideal limitation formula equation 8 as it is consistent with fungibility the value of the limitation is independent of the location of borrowing and it is proportional to th location of investment effects on borrowing location in order to examine the effects of tax regimes on borrowing locale we depart from the base model by adding foreign taxes to simplify the analysis we assumea single tax rate applies to both dividends and retained earnings this analysis assumes that foreign tax authorities do not make allocation adjustments thus thetotal tax paid by company can be expressed as 14 total tax ty f r1 tf ibt tyf r1tf ibf ibt bfkf bfkt bf tfyf ibf where tf is the foreign tax rate this rule can be contrasted with the circumstances where there is allocation rule in place 15 total tax ty yf r1 tf ibt tyf r1tf ibf tfyf ibf and the worldwide allocation rule contained in the jobs acthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34494crs12 11 for completeness one would need to make similar adjustment to retained earnings in this analysis however retained earnings cancels out16 total tax ty yf r1 tf ibt tyf r1tf ikfktbt tfyf ibf totally differentiating equation 14 gives us the effect of shifting small amount of debt from domestic to fo reign use under current law as 17 change in tax tfi tikt kf kt bt change in foreign debt kt bf kt bf when there is allocation rule the result is18 change in tax t fi change in foreign debt and finally with worldwide allocation19 change in tax t fi change in foreign debt note that the largest incentive to borrow abroad occurs with the worldwide allocation and the smallest incentive occu rs with allocation rules without allocation rules the savings from shifting debt abroad is the difference between thetax savings from the foreign deduction and the tax savings from the domestic deduction with worldwide allocation worldw ide interest is allocated the same way regardless of where it originates so that the only effects that multiply the expressionti each one less than one that dilute but do not eliminate the effect of the foreign tax credit limit the first term is the direct effect from allocating domestic interest andthe second is the effect of using net rather than gross foreign assets in the allocation formula effects on equity investment next let us consider the effect of allo cation rules on equity investment to do so we change the notation slightly to reflect the idea that gross income is the return on capital multiplied by the capital stock11 under current law the total tax of firm can be expressed as 20 total tax trkd rfkf r1 tf ibt trfkf r1 tf ibf ibt bfkf bfkt bf tfrfkf ibf where r is the return on us capital and rf is the return to foreign capital both on beforetax basis this rule can be contrasted with the circumstances where there is allocation rule at all 21 total tax trkd rfkf r1 tf ibt trfkf r1 tf ibf tfrfkf

when the foreign debt to asset ratio falls below the domestic debt to asset ratioin order to isolate the tax effect consider the case where the pretax returns are equal in practice they will not equal after the consideration of tax rules further consider the case where very small but slightly different taxes are added to this previously case without taxes next we totally differentiating equations

cases the tax systems discourage investment abroad due to the high tax country allocation rule s magnify this effect because the adjustment to the foreign tax credit limit increases with larger shares of the capital stock located abroad in this case however the worldwide allocation rule will further discourage investment abroad because of more powerful effect on the allocation rule as result worldwide allocation is likely to be less efficient than domestic interest allocation with respect to disincentives for equity investment12 effects on investment fina nced by debt and equity finally we consider the effects on inves tment abroad that are financed by both debt and equity assume that the debt to asset ratio of the subsidiary is fixed and that the total assets and debt of the parent and subsidiary are also fixed to consider the effects on equity inve stment we again adjust our notation to reflect idea that gross income is the return on capital multiplied by the capital stock the equations from the previous secti on are modified to allow borrowing to change when the capital stock is altered in examining the change in taxes for given change in foreign assets the tax ffects of the change in foreign debt are incorporated it is assumed that bf bears constant relationship of kf if the initial ratio of foreign debt to foreign assets is defined as the constant then bf akf and change in bf is equal to times the change in kf that assumption along with the preceding assumption allows the following derivations under current law the effect of the change in tax can be expressed

tax country although this effect is moderated by the deduction for debt financed investment the worldwide alloca tion rule when debt to asset ratios are lower abroad than in the united states would discourage investment to lesser amount than equity investment this moderation of effect results from small allocation being made as some of the us interest is shifted abroad since the worldwide allocation rule would not apply when foreign debt to equity ratios are higher the worldwide allocation rule w ould either further discourage investment abroad or have effect in contrast the current allocation rule may either encourage or discourage investment abroad the fi rst term is unchanged from the previous section and reflects the effect of alloca ting more existing domestic interest abroad as the capital stock increases the second term reflects the fact that some interest has shifted abroad and would not be allocate d if domestic debt is small relative to foreign debt then the current allocati on rule would simultaneously raise us revenue and discourage fore ign investment in high tax jurisdictions
