our projects forward jeff murphy valerie barnard recert gov in ff wants to teach her grandson in lexington can she do so being female governor raja rogers delicate question how old jeff murphy getting his sitting technique raja rogers in this one special case its okay but we shouldnt take this as any movement away from the principle that ladies teach ladies and men teach men maharishi made beautiful call after the removal of poverty conference dr hagelins mother is here maharishi was very wonderfully talking about the darshan of the mother he didnt use that word darshan hes been emphasizing to bevan to bring his mother who is 94 yrs old and he mentioned it again hes very positive on the blessings of the mother i have heard maharishi tell people go take the blessings of your mother nothing can replace it not even the guru thats why we would have this exception because she is the grandmother jeff moses marine who was an arabic interpreter he did lot of research on tm and decided to start this weekend he told that on the fbi statistical website there is info about the dc course in 93 it proclaims that that course was successful and that it did everything that it claimed to do in advance raja rogers consciousness is really really changing even though we have fewer numbers in the field we have strong people in the field and the numbers on the inv america course really help send that info dr hagelin would be really excited about this we are working so hard here in ny because it is such power center just few days ago he said we have broken the heart of kaliyuga one of the ways to get the info out is to meet with the ambassadors and financial people we are meeting with here alcine when on mother divine the question came up if we could teach small boys we couldnt teach men maharishi said it would be okay because the small boys come with their mothers raja rogers yes that is true yet maharishi really wants to establish at young age the boys school and girls school so better to go with birds of feather alcine mother here asked to teach her who is autistic ive had experience teaching disturbed children raja in this case this will be fine
