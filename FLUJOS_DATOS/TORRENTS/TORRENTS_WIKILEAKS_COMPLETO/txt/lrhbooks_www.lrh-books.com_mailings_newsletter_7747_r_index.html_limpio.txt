and then wither away and fertilize the earth from which they said you came scientology has answers to those questions good answers that are true answers that work for you for the subject matter of scientology is you l ron hubbard this excerpt was taken from the book scientology new slant on life by l ron hubbard success story from mr hubbards assists last week i went to visit my mom and when i got there she was bit scratched up and i found out that she had just fallen down on the concrete pretty badly she then showed her hand and wrist which were all blue and swelling i immediately took her to the place she had fallen and i had her duplicate the exact same motion that happened when she fell and hurt her hand at first it was hurting then suddenly she felt tingling in her hand and the pain went away we looked at her hand and the blue reduced and my mom said that her hand was much better during the rest of the day she kept saying that her hand was much better and after that it was healed this was the result of the contact assist we did the assists can be found in the scientology handbook click here for more information or to purchase the scientology handbook what are scientology assists n scientology an assist is an action undertaken to help person confront physical difficulties if child has fallen and hurt himself an assist can help him overcome the trauma if person has toothache or has had tooth pulled an assist can help relieve the pain when people are ill assists can ease the discomfort and speed recovery even broken bones respond to assists these and many other conditions can be improved by application of procedures classified under this heading of assists an assist then can be described as scientology process which is done to alleviate present time discomfort process is an exact series of directions or sequence of actions taken to accomplish desired result there are many processes contained in the materials of scientology but assists make up class of processes in themselves all scientology processes address and handle wide range of conditions affecting the spirit the being himself the spirit in scientology is called the thetan by which is meant the person himselfnot his body or his name the physical universe his mind or anything elseit is that which is aware of being aware the identity which is the individual the term thetan was coined to eliminate any possible confusion with older invalid concepts it comes from the greek letter theta which the greeks used to represent thought or perhaps spirit to which an n is added to make noun in the modern style used to create words in engineering probably the greatest discovery of scientology and its most forceful contribution to the knowledge of mankind has been the isolation description and handling of the human spirit in scientology it can be demonstrated that that thing which is the person the personality is separable from the body and the mind at will and without causing bodily death or mental derangement in ages past there has been considerable controversy concerning the human spirit or soul and various attempts to control man have been effective in view of his almost complete ignorance of his own identity as you know that you are where you are at this moment so you would know if you spirit were detached from your mind and body man had not discovered this before because lacking the technologies of scientology he had very little reality upon his detachment from his mind and body therefore he conceived himself to be at least in part mind and body the entire cult of communism was based upon the fact that one lives only one life that there is hereafter and that the individual has religious significance man at large has been close to this state for at least the last century the state is of very low order excluding as it does all selfrecognition the thetan spirit is described in scientology as having mass wavelength energy and time or location in space except by consideration or postulate postulate simply put is decision that something will happen the spirit then is not thing it is the creator of things by spiritual means but means which are as precise as mathematics host of bad conditions of life may be remedied in scientology illness and malfunction can be divided into two general classes first those resulting from the operation of the spirit directly upon the communication networks of life or the body and second those occasioned by the disruption of structure through purely physical causes the term psychosomatic means the mind making the body ill or illnesses which have been created physically within the body by derangement of the mind psycho refers to mind and somatic refers to body unhappiness inability to heal and psychosomatic illnesses which include some 70 percent of the illnesses of man are best handled by immediate address of the thetan illnesses caused by recognizable bacteria and injury in accident are best treated by physical means these fall distinctly into the field of medicine and are not the province of scientology even though accidents and illness and bacterial infection are predetermined in almost all cases by spiritual malfunction and unrest and conditions in accidents are definitely prolonged by any spiritual malfunction thus we have the field of medicine addressing the immediate injury such surgical matters as birth and acute infection and such things as bruises and scrapes resulting from accidents as well as the administration of drugs and antibiotics to prevent the demise of the patient in crisis this is the role of medicine where tendency to disease or injury exists or where disease or injury is being prolonged or where unhappiness and worry causes mental or physical upset we are dealing in the realm of scientology for such things are best healed or best prevented or best remedied by immediate and direct recourse to the thetan and its action on the body the only truly therapeutic agent in this universe is the spirit in scientology this has been demonstrated with more thoroughness and exists with more certainty than the physical sciences or mathematics scientologist can help make an individual well and happy simply by addressing the human spirit the assists can be found in the scientology handbook click here for more information or to purchase the scientology handbook helping an individual heal himself injuries operations delivery of babies severe illnesses and periods of intense emotional shock all deserve to be handled with thorough and complete assists an assist in way intrudes upon the role of medicine medical examination and diagnosis should be sought where needed and where treatment is routinely successful medical treatment should be obtained as an assist can at times cover up an actual injury or broken bone chances should be taken especially if the condition does not easily respond in other words where something is merely thought to be slight sprain to be on the safe side an xray should be obtained particularly if it does not at once respond an assist is not substitute for medical treatment and does not attempt to cure injuries requiring medical aid but is complementary adds to it it is even doubtful if full healing can be accomplished by medical treatment alone and it is certain that an assist greatly speeds recovery in short one should realize that physical healing does not take into account the being and the repercussion on the spiritual existence of the person injury and illness are predisposed made more likely to occur by the spiritual state of the person they are precipitated brought on by the being himself as manifestation of his current spiritual condition and they are prolonged extended in time beyond normal limits by any failure to fully handle the spiritual factors associated with them the causes of predisposition precipitation and prolongation are addressed with assists certainly life is not very tolerable to person who has been injured or ill to woman who has just delivered baby to person who has just suffered heavy emotional shock and there is reason person should remain in such low state particularly for weeks months or years when he or she could be remarkably assisted to recover in hours days or weeks it is in fact sort of practiced cruelty to insist by neglect that person continue on in such state when one can learn and practice and obtain relief for such person one does not have to be medical doctor to take someone to medical doctor and one does not have to be medical doctor to observe that medical treatment may not be helping the patient and one does not have to be medical doctor to handle things caused spiritually by the being himself just as there are two sides to healingthe spiritual and the structural or physicalthere are also two states that can be spiritually attained the first of these states might be classified as humanly tolerable assists come under this heading the second is spiritually improved any minister and this has been true as long as there has been subject called religion is bound to relieve his fellow being of anguish there are many ways minister can do this an assist is not engaging in healing it is certainly not engaging in treatment what it is doing is assisting the individual to heal himself or be healed by another agency by removing his reasons for precipitating and prolonging his condition and lessening his predisposition to further injure himself or remain in an intolerable condition this is entirely outside the field of healing as envisioned by the medical doctor and by actual records of results is very very far beyond the capability of psychology psychiatry and mental treatment as practiced in those fields in short the assist is strictly and entirely in the field of the spirit and is the traditional province of religion though not restricted to religion only person applying assist technology should realize the power which lies in his hands and his potential skills when trained he has this to give in the presence of suffering he can make life tolerable he can also shorten term of recovery and may even make recovery possible when it might not be otherwise the assists can be found in the scientology handbook click here for more information or to purchase the scientology handbook dear friend as i am sure you know people sometimes get hurt in the business of living the human body is subject to disease injuries and various mishaps of accidental or intentional character today medicine treats the body when there is something wrong with it but it overlooks almost totally the relationship of the spiritual being to his body the fact is after any necessary medical treatment the individual himself has an enormous capacity to influence the body and its wellbeing or lack of it l ron hubbard developed numerous applications of his discoveries for the mental and spiritual aspects of persons physical difficulties and as more and more techniques evolved new body of technology came into use called assists the ways assists can be applied are almost limitless they always help and
