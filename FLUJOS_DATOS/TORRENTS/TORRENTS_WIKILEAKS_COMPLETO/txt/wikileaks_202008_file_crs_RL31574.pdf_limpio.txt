corporate accountability act hr 5095 summary on july 11 2002 house ways and means committee chairman wi lliam thomas introduced hr 5095 the american compe titiveness and corporate accountability act the focus of this re port is the bills proposed changes in us taxation of income from international transactions the bill also contains provisions designed to restrict corporate tax she lters the report does not discuss these the bills international proposals are in th ree general areas first the bill would repeal the extraterritorial income eti tax benefit for exporting thereby attempting to end longrunning dispute between th united states and the european union eu over whether the us tax benefit is an export subsidy prohibited by the world trade organization agreements second the bill contains proposals aimed at offshore corporations with subsidiaries in the united states in part these proposals are aimed at corporate inversions where some usowned firms have reorganized to include paper parent corpor ations chartered in tax have n countries in part these proposals also address earnings stripping or the shifting of us profits abroad by means of intrafirm transactions third hr 5095 contains proposals altering the tax treatment of us firms with foreign operations and investment the bill terms these changes international tax simplifi cation the bulk of the provisions would have the effect of reducing us tax on foreignsource income the chief areas that would be affected are rules related to th foreign tax credit nd provisions affecting the deferral tax benefit for overseas business operations this report does not attempt comprehe nsive economic analysis of hr 5095 several likely broad effects however can be identified fi rst taken alone repeal of the eti export benefit would likely not incr ease the us trade deficit but would reduce the overall level of us trade exports and imports alike by small amount because export subs idies generally reduce the aggregate economic welfare of the subsidizing country repeal of th eti provisions would likely increase us economic welfare while leading to sma ll contraction of the export sector and small expansion of import competing sector s second taxmotivated inversions are apparently events that chiefly occur on paper involving little alteration of the location of economic activity their chief economic impact is probably reduction in us tax revenues thus the chief impact of hr 5095s inversion provisions would probably be to reduce the extent to which inversions erode us corporate tax collections the bills earnings stripping provisions may likewise reduce erosions in us tax collections but an assessmen t of whether these provisions would reduce foreign investment in the united states is not attempted here third the bills foreign source income provisions would likely reduce the tax burden on foreign source income as result their impact would probably be to increase the level of us investment abroad beyond what woul d otherwise occur preliminary estimates by the joint committee on taxation indicate the bill would increase tax revenue by net of 64 billion over five years nd net of 11 billion over 10 years this report will be updated as gislative developments occurhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31574contents b sic f r s f th u s i n r n tio n l t x sy ste m2 overseas investment fo

accountability act hr 5095 the american competitiveness and corporate accountability act accaa hr 5095 was introduced on july 11 2002 by chairman william thomas of the house committee on ways and means the fi rst title of th bill contains several provisions designed to restrict corporat tax shelters provisions beyond the scope of this report the balance of the bill however contains broad range of proposals for taxation of income from international transactions and is the reports focus the international proposals are in three genera l areas taxation of income from foreign business operations and investment export tax benefits and the tax treatment of offshore corporations that have us subs idiaries including foreign inversions or expatriation compared to changes enact ed in international taxation in recent years the bills changes are important and broad in scope at the same time however the proposals are incremental rather than broad structural revision of the us international tax system the likely impacts of the proposals on bus iness tax burdens vary its foreign source income provisions would likel reduce the tax burden on the overseas operations of usowned firms while the export provisions probably will increase the tax burden on us export firms the inversions provisions may restrict the viability of the restructuring transactions as taxsaving devices and thus reduce us revenue losses from the transactions although the proposed provisions are temporary the bills earnings stripping provisions would probably reduce revenue losses from the shifting of otherwisetaxable profits abroad and may increase the tax burden on foreign business investment in the united states according to preliminary estimates by the joint co mmittee on taxation hr 5095s proposals including both its internati onal and tax shelter provisions would increase us tax revenue on net basis by 64 billion over five years and 11 billion over 10 years1 the scope of hr 5095 is broad t ouching almost every area of us international taxation from expor t profits to overseas subsidiary firms to the foreign tax credit to foreign parent corporations chartered in tax havens accordingly this report begins by describing the basic structur features of the us international tax systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31574crs2 basic features of the us international tax system in the international setting countries ba their tax jurisdiction on either the source of income or the residence of the ta xpayer that is in determining whether it has jurisdiction to tax income tax sy stem can look either to the geographic or territorial source of the income or to the residence of the entity or person earning the income under territorial system country taxes only income earned within its borders however under residence syst em country taxes the worldwide income of its resident individuals or firms in applying its tax jurisdiction to the overseas income of its own citizens and firms the united states generally with some exceptions operates residence based system it looks to the nationality of the taxpayer taxing us citizens and residence on their worldwide income nd in the case of businesses taxing corporations chartered or or ganized in the united states on their worldwide income thus if us corporation earns dividends whose source is say ireland or germany the us firm will generally be subject to us tax on the dividends at least in principle in applying its tax system to foreign investors in the united states the united states operates sour cebased system taxing the us branches of foreign corporations only on their ussource income but there are exceptions to this general st ructure first the united states grants foreign tax credits while the united states taxes its residents worldwide income it concedes that the country of source has the primary right to tax that income and permits its corporate and non corporate taxpayers to credit foreign income taxes they pay against us taxes they would otherwis owe in so doing the united states in effect accepts the responsibility for lleviating the doubletaxation that would result when the us worldwide tax jurisdiction overlaps the normal practice of host countries in taxing income earned within their borders importantly however to protect the us tax base the us foreign tax credit is limited to offsetting us tax on foreign income foreign taxe s cannot be credited against us tax on us income the tax credits limitation and associated rules give rise to some of the most complex parts of the tax code as described further in the section below on hr 5095s foreign tax cr edit provisions in general terms hr 5095 would ease restrictions on the fore ign tax credit embedded in number of foreign tax credit rules along with the foreign tax credit another exception to us worldwide taxation is the socalled deferral principle while the united states taxes foreign income earned directly by branches of us corporations branches that are not separately incorporated abroad the united states does not tax foreignchartered corporations on their foreignsource income thus if us firm conducts foreign operations through subsidiary firm chartered abroad the foreign income is not subject to us tax until the income is remitted to the us parent as dividends or other income at which point it enters the us tax jurisdiction as income of usresident corporation us tax on the subsidiarys in come is thus taxdeferred as long as the income is reinvested abroadhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31574crs3 deferral poses tax incentive for us firm s to invest abroad in countries with relatively low tax rates and reduces us tax revenues but since 1962 the tax codes subpart f provisions have nied deferrals benefit to certain types of income generally income from passive investment and other in come whose source is thought to be easy to manipulate in order to re duce taxes subpart f and deferral are described in more detail below in the section on hr 5095s proposals for us controlled foreign corporations in br oad terms hr 5095 reduces the scope of subpart f and expands potential areas where deferral can apply us tax treatment of foreig n corporations has also b een focus of attention in the recent controversy over corporate invers ions or expatriation since foreign corporations are not taxed on foreigns ource income number of us firms with usincorporated parent segm ents have reorganized so that the parent segment or holding company is foreign corporati on chartered in lowtax country or tax haven the tax savings on foreignsour ce income is apparently supplemented in many cases by earnings stripping the use of relatedcompany debt to shift us income from us subsidiaries into the hands of foreignchartered parent hr 5095 contains number of provisions signed to limit inversions and earnings stripping under the united states residencebase d tax system us taxes would normally apply to export income in full if us corporation were to sell exports directly us worldwide taxation would ordinarily sure full us taxation if us firm were to sell exports through related foreign subsidiary outside the us tax jurisdiction us transfer pricing rule s rules governing the allocation of income among related firms would restrict the extent to which export income could be allocated abroad to foreign subsidiary outside the us tax jurisdiction to the extent flexibility in the application of transfer pricing permits the allocation of income to foreign subsidiaries subpart f apparently rules out much of the potential for deferral to apply notwithstanding thes rules however seve ral provisions of the us tax code provide tax benefits for us exports one of these the extraterritorial income eti benefit has been the focus of controversy between the united states and the european union eu with the eu complaining to the world trade organization wto that eti constitutes an illegal export subsidy several wto rulings have supported the eu and unless the united states brings its tax code into compliance the wto may permit the eu to levy tariffs on eu imports of us products the controversy is described more fully below hr 5095 would repeal the eti provisions at the same time how ever the bill would relax the subpart f rules applicable to sales to related subsidiaries we turn now to the specific provisions of hr 5095 overseas investment foreign tax credit proposals while the foreign tax credit generally concedes to foreign host countries the primary right to tax foreign income the limitation of the credit to offsetting us tax on foreign and not us income is designed to protect the part of the us tax basehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31574crs4 2for more comprehensive explanation of the interest allocation rules see crs report rl30321 the taxpayer refund and relief act of 1999 and the foreign tax credits interest allocation rules by david l brumbaugh and jane g gravelleconsisting of us income if not fo r the limitation foreign governments could conceivably impose extremely high tax rates on the us investors they host without fear of discouraging inbound investment with an unlimited credit investors would be impervious to the high foreign taxes they could simply credit their foreign taxes against us taxes on their us earnings while the foreign tax credits limitation protects the us tax base it is also responsible for some of the most complex and difficulttoadminister rules in the tax code hr 5095s foreign tax cred it proposals generally simplify and ease restrictions on the tax credit rules in number of areas relate d to the limitation in addition it increases the extent to which the credit can reduce firms alternative minimum tax interest allocation rules in calculating its foreign tax credit limitati on whether firm can assign an item of income or deductible expense to fo reign or domestic sources can have substantial impact on the companys maximum creditable foreign taxes and thus on its us tax liability after credits am ong hr 5095s foreign tax credit proposals that which is likely to have the largest imp act may well be proposed change in rules governing the allocation of interest expe nse between foreign and us sources to illustrate the provision is estimated to reduce tax revenue by 234 billion over 10 years approximately half the revenue loss from all the bills foreign tax credit proposals and about one quarter of the re venue loss of all the bills revenuelosing items firms with foreign earnings have long argu ed that current laws rules for interest allocation work improperly and are unfair and in 1999 congress included revision of the rules as part of the more general tax cut it passed with the taxpayer refund and relief act hr 2488 106th congress2 however president clinton vetoed the act hr 5095 would essentially implement the changes passed in 1999 how income and expenses are allocated matters to firm only if the foreign tax credit limitation is binding constraint and the firm has excess foreign tax credits to see why note that under the foreig n tax limitation maximum creditable foreign taxes are limited to the share of us precredit tax falling on foreign source rather than domestic income it follows that if for example an item of revenue is determined to have foreign rather than u s source the share of us precredit tax falling on foreign income is increased and maximum creditable foreign taxes are therefore increased the reverse is true with deductions deduction allocated to foreign rather than us sources reduces foreign income nd us precredit tax on foreign income thereby reducing creditable foreign taxes and increasing aftercredit us tax for interest expense specifically the important point is this interest deductions allocatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31574crs5 3hr 5095 leaves out part of set of s ubgroup election rules included in the 1999 legislation under current law firms can elect to apply the interest allocation rules separately for those parts of corporate gr oup that are financial institutions the 1999 bill would have expanded this election to include finance companies and insurance firms it also would have permitted second election to allocate interest separately for any group of subsidiaries subject to certain antiabuse rules hr 5095 includes the expansion for financial firms but not the second broader ection for more detailed discussion see ibid pp 911 to foreign rather than us sources reduce foreign tax credits and increase us taxes or looking at it another way firm in an excess credit position has remaining us tax liability on foreignsource income it has all been eliminated by foreign tax credits thus deductible cost allocated to foreign rather than us sources can produce further tax savings and th deduction is in effect lost given the importance of allocating income and expenses the tax code contains detailed rules for making the allocations including the rules governing interest expense current law provides for the llocation of interest expense by combining the parent firm and its domestic subsidiaries portion of the interest is then allocated to foreign source income and affects the foreign tax credit limit based on the proportion of the groups assets that are located abroad thus even if all of domestic firms borrowing is done in the ited states part of its interest expense may be allocated abroad this is based on the notion that debt is fungible that regardless of where borrowing occurs it funds the totality of firms investment the controversy over the rules is base d on the particular way in which this allocation is applied under current law method of allocation some times referred to as waters edge allocation unde r this method the borrowing of foreign subsidiaries is not explicitly included in the allocation specifically debtfinanced assets of subsidiaries are not included in the calculation subsidiary assets are included only to the extent of parent owners hip of subsidiary stock in isolation this omission has the effect of reducing the amount of interest allocated to foreign sources and increases creditable foreign taxes s econd while some parent interest expense is allocated to foreign sources subsidiary interest is allocated to domestic sources in isolation this second omission reduces foreign income and creditable foreign taxes mathematically the impact of omitting foreign interest is larger than omitting foreign assets so that on balance omitting foreign debt from the formula reduces creditable foreign taxes in manner similar to the vetoed 1999 act section 311 of hr 5095 would substitute worldwide allocation regime for current laws waters edge rule3 under this method the interest costs of fore ign subsidiaries would be included in the allocation formula and subsidiary assets w ould be included in the allocation formula on gross basis rather than netofdebt basi s in isolation the first of these changes would increase firms foreign tax credits and reduce taxes while the second would have the reverse effect on balance sw itching to hr 5095s worldwide allocation regime would increase firms foreign tax credits and reduce their aftercredit us taxes httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31574crs6 consolidation of tax cred it limitations baskets one feature of the foreign tax credits limit that has occupied the attention of policymakers on number of occasions is the ab ility of investors to cross credit high foreign taxes on one stream of income or high foreign taxes paid to one country against residual us taxes that might be due on other more lightly taxed foreign income cross crediting works like this if us firms only foreignsource income is subject to low foreign taxes the firm will not have sufficient foreign tax credits to offset all us taxes on the income and will owe some residual us tax or if corporations only foreign income is subject to rates that are high compared to the us tax rate it will be able to eliminate its entire us tax on foreign income but will have excess credits left over but if firm has both heavilytaxed and lightlytaxed foreign income it can cross credit the ex cess credits from the heavilytaxed income against us tax due on the lightlytaxed income in effect cross crediting shields investme nt in lowtax countries from us tax leaving the low foreign taxes as the only tax burden the investment faces and posing an incentive to invest abroad in low tax countries while reducin g us tax revenue at the same time crosscrediting reduces the effective tax burden where foreign taxes are high thereby reducing what would otherwise be tax disincentive to invest abroad in hightax countri because of these in centive and revenue effects legislation has been enacted on number of occasions that is intended to limit the ability of firms to cross credit by requiring the foreign tax credit limit to be calculated separately for different type s or baskets of income in effect segregating different streams of foreign income and prohibiting crosscrediting between different baskets in some periods in the pa st separate limits have applied on countrybycountry basis thereby prohibiting taxes paid in h igh tax countries from being cross credited against income earned in low tax countri under current law however separate limits apply to several different categories of income rather than to separate countries much of their structure was imp lemented by the tax reform act of 1986 public law 99514 under current law there are nine separate foreign tax credit baskets as follows1 dividends from domestic interna tional sales corpor ations discs 2 income attributable to foreign trade income 3 distributions from foreign sales corpora tions fscs 4 financial services income 5 shipping income 6 dividends from each section 902 corporation 7 high withholding tax interest 8 passive income 9 all other income in addition section 907 of th tax code limits the amount of taxes on foreign oil and gas extraction income that can be credited albeit under somewhat different mechanism the first three of the baskets in the above list are of limited importance applying to export income that is typically not subject to high foreign taxes and tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31574crs7 4pointed out by richard doernberg in his international taxation in nutshell 5th ed st paul mn west group 2 001 p 215 our explanation of baskets relies heavily on

the next two baskets are relatively narrow applying to specific industries income from financial services and shipping inco note however that irs data show that the financial services basket is th second larges t in terms of the amount of taxable income it contains5 the geographic source of this income is thought to be relatively flexible and thus relatively eas to locate in lowtax foreign countries making crosscrediting with heavilytaxed income particularly useful to the taxpayer the next three baskets apply to di fferent types of income from passive investment one is dividends taxpayer receives from each foreign subsidiary corporation that is not controlled by us stockholders but in which the dividends recipient owns at least 10 of the stock these are known as section 902 corporations as described more fully below however th is basket is scheduled for elimination in 2003 under this basket s rules separate limitation must be calculated for dividends from each subsidia ry thus restricting crosscrediting among income from different foreign corporations the remaining passive income baskets are basket for passive income in general for example interest rents and royalties and interest income that is subject to high foreign withholding tax6 as with the transportation and banking limitations the separate basket for general passive income was implemented because passi ve income is thought to be geographically flexible7 the highwithholdingtax bask et was created because ev low foreign withholding taxes on us lenders gross interest r eceived from abroad could amount to high effective tax rate on the investors net interest from loan thereby generating large amounts of excess credits8 the last remaining basket is residual category into which any remaining type of income is placed it is thus general overall basket into which income from most active business operations is placed section 313 of hr 5095 would consolid ate current laws nine baskets into three general passive income basket basket for financial services income and general overall basket in doing so the bill eliminates the separate baskets related to export income the basket for shipping income the basket for high withholdingtax interest and the basket for section 902 corporations the general effect of the proposal would be to increase cross crediting what data are availablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31574crs8 9us congress joint committee on taxation general explanation of tax legislation enacted in 1997 joint committee print 105th cong 1st sess washingt on gpo

consolidations would be eliminating the high withholdingtax basket whos contents would most likel be placed in the passive income basket and eliminating the ba sket for section 902 corporations look through treatment for dividends from section 902 corporations as noted above the tax code currently requires separate foreign tax credit limitation to be calculated for dividends received from each section 902 corporation noncontrolled corporations where the recipien t owns at least 10 of the stock the purpose of the separate limita tions is to prevent crosscrediting between dividends from 902 corporation and other streams of income the provision was first enacted with the tax reform act of 1986 in 1997 congress concluded that the separate limitations for section 902 dividends were overly complex and discouraged participati on by us firms in joint ventures overseas9 the taxpayer relief act of 1997 scheduled the limitation for manner of phaseout by applying look thr ough rules for section 902 dividends paid out of earnings generated after 2002 unde r the look through rules the dividend is apportioned among the tax credit basket s in proportion to the types of income comprising the section 902 corporations earnings and profits the 1997 act also changed the treatment of section 902 divi dends paid out of earnings and profits generated prior to 2003 ffective beginning in 2003 the act places dividends from all section 902 corporations in single basket as described in the preceding secti on hr 5095 would remove the separate limitation for section 902 dividends hr 5095 would also apply look through rule to all section 902 dividends allocating the dividend among the bills three baskets in proportion to the am ount of passive financial services and general activebusiness income comprising the firms earnings and profits recharacterization of ov erall domestic losses an additional foreign tax credit proposal in hr 5095 changes the way the tax codes loss rules and foreign tax credit rules interact under current law if taxpayer incurs loss for tax purposes that is if it has negative taxable income the loss termed net operating loss or nol in tax parlance can be carried back up to two years and used to offset taxable income in those years potentially generating tax refund10 if some or all of the nol remains after applying it to carryback years the loss can be saved and carried forward up to 20 years in the futurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31574crs9 11for description of the double benefit see us congress senate committee on finance 198384 miscellaneous tax

who incurs loss with respect to domestic operations can use the loss to reduce foreign income if firm has some residual us tax liability on foreign income that is if it does not have excess credits the loss can generate tax savings by reducing us tax on foreign source income however hr 5095s loss provision is aimed at taxpayers in different situation firms that have domestic loss and excess foreign tax credits here while the loss does reduce foreigns ource income it produces tax saving in the loss year because there is us tax liability on foreignsource income further the potential nol carryforward embodied by the loss and the resulting future tax savings is reduced to the extent the loss is deducted from foreign income excess foreign tax credits can be carried forwar d up to five years and deducting the nol from foreign income in this case generally increases foreign tax credit carryforwards in manner that potentially offsets the loss in tax savings from the reduced nol carryforward however if firm expects to be in an excess credit position indefinitely this offsetting mechanism does not work and the taxpayer will in effect have lost some or all of its nol carryforward an important loss if the firm anticipates returning to having positive taxable income in the near future hr 5095 would give firms with domestic losses the option of recharacterizing certain amount of ussource income as foreignsource income in subsequent year for firms in an excess credit position in the year the recharacterization occurs the recharacterization would increase the am ount of foreign tax credits that can be claimed thereby compensating for the redu ced nol the amount of income that can be recharacterized would be equal to th firms previouslyincurred domestic loss subject to cap equal to 50 of th firms ussource taxable income hr 5095s recharacterization proposal s been proposed previously first in 1983 and again in 1992 but was not adopted in part this was because of concern over whether firms without excess credits in loss year but with excess credits in subsequent year could obtain both the bene fit of deducting the loss in the loss year and recharacterizing income in the later excess credit year treasury department testimony in 1992 indicated that certain objections to the proposal had been rendered moot but did not elaborate thus it is not certain whether the double benefit exists with the current proposal11 extension of foreign tax credit carryforward period excess foreign tax credits that accrue in one year can be carried back to the two preceding years and any credits that remain after the carryback can be carried forward up to five years the carryback and carryforward provisions were instituted as means of compensating for the possibility that income and deductions may behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31574crs10 12us congress joint committee on taxation general explanation of the tax reform act of 1986 joint committee print 100th cong 1st sess washingt on gpo 1987 p 436recognized at different times under foreign tax systems than under the us system hr 5095 would extend the carryforward period to 10 years repeal of foreign tax credit restrictions under the alternative minimum tax under current law taxpayers pay either their regular tax or their alternative minimum tax amt whichever is larger the two amounts ordinarily differ because taxable income is defined more strictly under the amt while tax rates under the amt are lower than under the regular ta x the purpose of the amt is to ensure that every firm or individual who registers positive economic income pays at least some tax and is not able to use various tax benefits to eliminate their tax completely the foreign tax credit is generally not considered tax benefit but is instead mechanism for alleviating double taxation of foreignsource income the credit is therefore generally allowed to offset taxpayers amt nonetheless as part of broad revision of the amt in 1986 congre ss concluded that every taxpayer with positive income should make at least minal contribution to the us tax base even when it is foreign tax credits that eliminate us taxes12 accordingly foreign tax credits are permitted to offset only 90 of taxpayers amt hr 5095 would repeal the 90 limitation overseas investment deferral and subpart f as described above the tax deferral available to inco earned through foreign subsidiary corporations is restricted in some cases by the tax codes subpart f provisions provisions that were first acted in 1962 and that were designed to restrict firms ability to augment the deferral tax benefit by concentrating income in tax havens or other countries with low tax rates subpart f denies the deferral benefit to certain types of income whose ge ographic source is thought to be easily manipulated the tax code contains several other antideferral regimes in addition to subpart f most prominent of the othe r antideferral regimes is the passive foreign investment company pfic rules the tax code applies subpart f to those us stockholders who own at least 10 of controlled foreign corporation cfc as defined by the tax code cfc in turn is foreign corporation that is mo re 50 owned by those us stockholders owning at least 10 of the corporations stock one component of income covered by subpart f is income the tax code terms foreign personal holding company income which is generally income from passive investment eg interest dividends and royalties subpart f income also includes income from international air or sea transportation certain oilrelated income certain insurance income and certain sales and services income from tran sactions with related firms hr 5095httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31574crs11 13the possibility of solving the dispute in this manner was raised as early as 1988 see robert hudec reforming gatt adjudi cation procedures the lessons of the disc case minnesota law review vol 72 june 1988 p 1449 however the writer ignores the obstacle to this solution posed by pplication of arms length pricing 14doernberg international taxation in nutshell p 237would generally reduce the scope of subpart f thus expanding the applicability of deferral sales and services income subject to subpart f hr 5095s most important change to s ubpart f is likely its proposal to remove sales and services income from the provi sions coverage as defined under current law these categories of income termed foreign base company sales income and foreign base company services income consist respectively of income from sales to related corporation where the propert is both produced and used outside the related corporations country of incor poration and income from the provision of services to related corpor ation outside the cfcs count ry of incorporation hr 5095 would retain subpart f c overage for sales of us products back to the united states thus apparently restricting the ability of firms to apply the deferral benefit to what might be ussource income given the elimination of the extraterritorial income eti tax benefit for exporting by other parts of hr 5095 the stion of whether or not the bills repeal of foreign base company sales and services income could pose replacement export benefit is relevant13 suppose for example us exporting corporation sells its exports to subsidiary foreign corporati on chartered in lowtax country and the foreign subsidiary in turn sells the exports in various foreign markets to the extent export income is allocated for tax purposes to the foreign subsidiary rather than the us parent an export tax be nefit results further it is not clear whether continuing to apply subpart f coverage to sales of products back to the united states while exempting exports would run afoul of the wto agreements absent stringent regulations governing the allocation of income firm might be able to achieve such an export benefit by for example charging an unrealistically low price for exports sold to its foreign subsidiary such technique would make the foreign subsidiarys income unrealistically high and the us parents income unrealistically low however the internationallyaccepted norm for allocating income between related tities for tax purposes is method known as arms length pricing method that pproximates the division that would occur if the different parts of the firm were in f act unrelated and where arms length pricing rules are followed in allocating income between us parent and its foreign sales subsidiary little or export income can be allocated to foreign sales subsidiary irs regulations issued under section 482 of the internal revenue c ode generally require arms length pricing to be used in allocating income14 some observers

from passive investment which is defined to include divide nds current law makes an exception however for dividends and in terest cfc recei ves from related corporation that is incorporated in the sa foreign country as the cfc itself and that conducts business in that country s ubpart f income also does not include rents and royalties received for the use of prope rty in the cfcs own country hr 5095 would add to these exceptions dividend in terest and other pa ssive income cfc receives from related cfc to the extent the payments are not attributable to what would be subpart f income in the hands of the related corporation the proposed look through rule contrasts with current ws exceptions in that the country where the excepted income originates would be immaterial but would not include all dividend or other income received from the related cfc other provisions for us investment in foreign corporations as described above one type of subpart f income is foreign personal holding company fphc income which is generally income from passive investment generally including dividends interest rents royalties and annuities fphc income also includes gains from the sale of assets that produce the identified types of passive income gains from the sale of interests in partnerships or trusts and gains from certain commodities transactions hr 5095 would repeal subpart fs inclusion of gain from the sale of partnership interests and would ease its applicability to gains from commodities transactions it would also provide more generous treatment under subpart fs oilincome rules to income from transportation of oil as noted above subpart f is not the onl antideferral regime contained in the us tax code although it likely is the most broadly applicable next to subpart f the most widely applicable set of rules limiting deferral are the passive foreign investment company pfic rules enact ed with the tax reform act of 1986 in contrast to subpart f the pfic rules ny the deferral benef it to all income of defined corporations pfics and to all stockholders not just 10 stockholders pfic is defined differently than cfc however rather than criteria based on control by us stockholders pfic is foreign corporation that is intensively engaged in passive investment according to several tests set forth in the pfic rules beyond the subpart f and pfic rules deferral of tax on foreign income can potentially be restricted under four additional sets of rules the foreign personal holding company provisions the forei gn investment company rules the personal holding company provisions and the accumulated earnings tax rules the last two of these can apply to domestic as well as foreign corporations thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31574crs13 16these reasons were cited by

of potential business financial and strategic benefits the statement is available on the ir website at httpwwwingersollrandcomproxypdf that on aug 1 stanley works announced that it was cancelling its planned reorganization scope and applicability of the regimes differ and can overlap in some cases the tax code contains rules coordi nating the various regimes hr 5095 would repeal the foreign pe rsonal holding company rules and the foreign investment company rules it w ould exclude foreignch artered corporations from coverage under the persona l holding company provisions provisions directed at earnings stripping and corporate inversions or expatriation recent news reports and articles in prof essional tax journals have drawn the attention of policymaker s and the public to phenomenon some times called corporate inversions or expatriation instances where firms that consist of multiple corporations reorganize their struct ure so that the parent element of the group is foreign corporation rather than corporation chartered in the united states firms engaged in the inversions cite number of reasons for undertaking them including creating greater operational flexibility improved cash management and an enhanced ability to access international capital markets16 prominent if not primary however is th role of taxes firms that undertake inversion have indicated they exp ect significant tax savings from the reorganizations prototypical inversion begins with firm with operations in both the united states and abroad but whose parent corpor ation the component of the firm whose stock is traded on the stock exchange is chartered in the united states thus the firm may use the deferral tax benefit for its foreign operations but its foreign income is ultimately subject to us tax when it is repatriated to the united states the firm in question inverts by creating foreign corporation chartered in low tax country bermuda and the cayman islands have b een cited as popular destinations the firm reorganizes so the new foreign cor poration becomes the parent of the us corporation that was formerly the parent firm the former us parent transfers its foreign subsidiary corporations to the ne w foreign parent the stockholders of the erstwhile us parent firm automatically become stockholders of the new foreign parent inversions need not involve the shift of economic activity from the united states abroad and those that have been prominen tly featured in the recent controversy have apparently been accomplished entirely on paper the transaction does however produce tax savings from two general sources first as described above although the united states does not tax the foreignsource income of foreign subsidiaries immediately it does tax their income when it is ultimately remitted to the unitedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31574crs14 17at the same time however an inversion may trigger us capital gains tax for us individual stockholders of inverting firms so have suggested this provides clue as to the reason for the recent apparent upsurge in in versions the declines in the stock market have made the individuallevel capital gains tax consequences of inversions less onerous for further information see crs report rl31444 firms that incorporate abroad for tax purposes corporate in versions and expatriation by david l brumbaugh 18note that aside from the corporate income ta x the united states in some cases applies withholding tax on interest or royalty payments to nonresidents however the withholding tax is frequently reduced or eliminated by treaty provisionsstates an inversion eliminates this deferred tax liability by placing the ownership of foreign subsidiaries in the hands of the new foreign parent17 second source of tax saving from an inversion known as earnings stripping actually applies to us rather than foreignsource income the practice of earnings stripping involves us subsid iary corporation esse ntially shifting us source income out of the us tax jurisdiction from the hands of taxable us corporation into the hands of foreign cor poration in general the us subsidiary of foreign corporation makes taxdeductible payments eg interest or royalties to its foreign parent firm in compensation for intrafirm loans or the use of patents or copyrights the tax deduction reduces the ta xable income of the us subsidiary while increasing the income of the foreign subsidiary given that foreign corporations are subject only to us co rporate income tax on the active conduct of us trade or business the interest or royalty income is removed from the us tax base18 note that earnings stripping is not unique to inverted usowned firms but can be practiced by foreignowned firms th at invest in the united states through uschartered subsidiaries indeed in 1989 provisions designed to curtail earnings stripping were enacted with section 163j of the intern revenue code hr 5095 contains provisions that would curtail each of these sources of tax savings first it would revamp existing restrictions on earning s stripping contained in section 163j under current law ductions are denied for interest paid to related entities if the payors debttoequity ratio exceeds 15 to 1 the deduction is generally denied for interest exceeding 50 of its taxable income after certain adjustments denied deductions are permitted to be carried forward indefinitely and used to reduce taxable income in the future hr 5095 would redesign the restrictions by removing the debttoequity test and reduc ing the percentage threshold to 35 from 50 the bill would also limit the carryforward of interest to five years in addition to these changes hr 5095 would disallow portion of interest deductions if domestic subsidiarys inde btedness is out of proportion to the entire corporate groups indebtedness and the inde btedness consists of debt to related entities more specifically the deductibility of interest on related party debt would be disallowed to the extent the subsidiary s total debt to bot h related and unrelated entities exceeds share of the entire groups external debt equal to the subsidiarys share of the groups assetshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31574crs15 19this provision is similar to antiinversion pr ovisions of several other bills introduced in the 107th congress although those proposals would generally not be temporary for discussion of those bills see crs report rl31444 firms that incorporate abroad for tax purposes corporate in versions and expatriation by david l brumbaugh 20an alternative implicit tax benefit for xporting is provided by the socalled export source rule under whose terms an exporter can allocate as much as 50 of export income to foreign sources for purposes of calculating its foreign tax credit limitation this has the effect of providing 50 tax exemption for firms in an excess credit position the eu has continuedhr 5095 addresses inversions saving s on foreignsource income with temporary measure that would treat the new foreign parent firms created in an inversion transaction as us firms the foreign parents foreignsource income would thus be subject to us taxation upon its receipt the provision would apply to transactions where the shareholders of the former us parent corporation own 80 or more of the new foreignchartere d parent and the foreign parent does not have substantial business ac tivity in its country of incorporation the provision would apply for inversions occurring durin g the threeyear period spanning march 20 2002 to march 20 200519 an additional inversion provision under the bill would apply to transfers of foreign stock by us corporation eg former parent corporation to new foreign parent firm under current law such transfers are in principle subject to us tax but us tax can be offset by foreign tax credits or net operating losses hr 5095 would prohibit such toll taxes from be ing offset by tax credits and other tax attributes this provision would apply to transactions where 60 or more of the foreign parent company is owned by stockhol ders of the former us parent the provision would be permanent rather than limited to three years in contrast to the tax savings inversi ons can generate at the corporate level individual stockholders of an inverting firm are generally required to recognize any gain embedded in their stock at the time of inversion in contrast current law provides that persons holding stock options are not subject to us tax until the option is exercised accordingly persons holding stock options in inverting firms for example corporate officers coul d avoid the capital gains tax that would ordinarily apply when an inversion ccurs hr 5095 would impose 20 excise tax on certain holders of an inverting firms stock options including officers directors and persons owning 10 or more of the firms stock the tax would be imposed on gain determined by reference to an optionpricing model specified by the treasury department repeal of the extraterritorial income tax benefit for exports under the us residence based tax system the unite d states would ordinarily tax income its exporters earn from sales of us goods abroad however prior to 2001 the us tax codes fore ign sales corporation fsc rules provided an explicit tax benefit for exporting20 the fsc provisions were the statutory descendant of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31574crs16 20continued not lodged complaint against the export source rules 21for further information on the etifscwto controversy see crs report rs20746

provisions first enacted in 1971 however european countries charged that disc was an export subsidy and so violated the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt although gatt panel supported the european charge the united states never conceded that disc violated gatt the fsc provisions were enacted in 1984 in an attempt to fuse the controversy in 1997 the countries of the european union eu complained to the world trade organization wto successor to gatt that fsc also was an export subsidy and contravened the wto wto panel ruling upheld the eu complaint and to avoid wtosanctioned retaliatory tariffs the unite d states in november 2000 replaced fsc with the eti provisions which deliver tax benef it of similar size but that was redesigned in an attempt to achieve wtocompliance the united states maintained that the eti provisions were wtocompliant but the eu disagreed and asked the wto to rule against them and approve 4 billion in tariffs wto panel ruled against the eti provisions in august 2001 and in january 2002 wto appellate body denied an appeal by th united states on august 30 2002 wto arbitration panel issued re port approving the level of ta riffs requested by the eu some eu officials have suggested th at the eu is not anxious to impose sanctions and will delay their implementation as long as it believes the united states is making progress in becoming wtocompliant unlike the previous legislative responses to gatt and wto rulings hr 5095 does not attemp t to construct wtocompliant export tax benefit rath er it would simply repeal the provision21 other provisions as noted at the outset of the report hr 5095 contains set of provisions designed to restrict the use of tax shelte rs by corporations these provisions are not discussed in this report in addition the bill contains several other proposals not related to taxation of income from international transactions one of these provisions is indexati on and expansion of the expensing allowance contained in section 179 of the tax code under current law firms are permitted to deduct immediately expense rather than deduct gradually depreciate up to 24000 of equipment investment each year the allowance is scheduled to increased to 25000 in 2003 and thereafter the amount that can be expensed is reduced and gradually eliminated for fi rms investment above 200000 the effect of the expensing allowance is to confer tax benefit in the form of tax deferral because the expensed investment is deducte d more rapidly than the asset in question actually declines in valuehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31574crs17 hr 5095 would index for inflation both the basic allowance and the 200000 threshold above which the allowance is phased out indexing would begin in 2005 in addition the bill would increase the base allowance to 40000 and the phaseout threshold to 325000 beginning in 2013 hr 5095 also contains set of rela tively narrow revenueraising items apart from its tax shelter eti and inversion pr oposals the largest item is extension of set of user fees applied by the us customs service that are scheduled to expire at the end of fy2003 economic effects impact on investment and economic welfare the range of provisions contained in hr 5095 is broad and comprehensive analysis of its likely economic effects is not undertaken here nonetheless several general preliminary asse ssments are possible first the bills proposals relating to the foreign tax credit controlled foreig n corporations and repeal of the eti provisions will each probably increase the share of usowned capital that is employed abroad rather than in the ited states beyond what would otherwise occur second in isolation repeal of the eti provisions is likely to reduce the level of us trade reducing both exports and imports at the same time however the increased flow of us capital abroad that would occur in the near term is likely to reduce the us trade deficit in the near rm below what would otherwise occur the bills net impact on us ec onomic welfare is uncertain with repeal of the eti benefit probably increasing us welfare in isolation and the foreign tax credit and cfc provisions reducing it according to very preliminary estimates by the joint committee on taxation the bill would incr ease revenues by net 64 billion over five years and by 11 billion over 10 years business taxes apply to co rporate profits the return from capital investment accordingly the most direct impact of changes in international business taxes is on the level location and type of investment firms undertak and it is here hr 5095 would likely have its most immediate impact as we have seen the bill proposes changes in two broad areas affecting the income from overseas operations changes to the foreign tax credit and related s ourceofincome rules and changes for the deferral principle and subpart f in pplying to income from overseas operations the proposals affect the aftertax rate of return on overseas investment the changes would generally reduce the tax burden on i nvestment abroad and thus increase its attractiveness for us firms accordingly one broad impact of the bills foreign tax credit and cfc proposals would be to increase the share of usowned capital consisting of foreign rather than domestic us investment compared to what would otherwise occur in contrast two other broad areas of the bill its earnings stripping and eti exporting provisions would both likely affect the rate of return on investment in the united states export production by defi nition involves inves tment and production in the united states and sales abroad re peal of the eti provisions would thereforehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31574crs18 probably reduce the aftertax rate of return on investment in the united states export sector and in isolation may increase the flow of us investment abroad by small amount at the same time portion of i nvestment released from the us export sector would likely stay in the united states flowing to the importcompeting sector and other parts of the economy for thei r part the earnings stripping rules would likely increase the tax burden on foreign inve stment in the united states by making it harder to shift ussource income abroad for tax purposes accordingly the earningsstripping provisions would probabl reduce the stock of foreign investment to the united states below what would otherwise occur each of these effects works in the same direction working to increase the share of usowned capital employed abroad the lone exception of the bills proposals appears to be the increase in the expensin g allowance for domestic us investment this provision in is olation w ould probably reduce the level of investment abroad compared to what would otherwise occur nonetheless because the great bulk of the bills proposals would increase the flow of us investment abroad the bills net impact would probably be in that direction the bills likely impact on us exports is harder to discern in isolation repeal of the eti provisions would probably redu ce the level of us exports although exchange rate adjustments that would reduce the price of the us dollar would probably also reduce us imports in isol ation repeal of the eti provisions would probably not alter the us balance of trade but the provisions of the bill that would alter the level of us capital employed abroad the foreign tax credit and cfc provisions would likely alter the balance of trade at least in the near term triggering exchange rate adjustments that would also reduce the price of us currency in world markets in isolation us exports woul d increase and imports would fall reducing the us trade deficit it is likely that the net impact of the bill would be to reduce us imports but whether the bill would increase exports on balance is uncertain these effects may actually reverse in the l ong run as capital stocks abroad adjust to the new levels induced by the bills foreign investment provisions economic theory suggests however that countrys ultimate economic welfare in this case that of the united states does not depend for example on exporting as much as it possibly can or even on maximizing the competitiveness of its firms operations abroad rather it depends heavily on whether investment locations are distorted in inefficient ways or on whethe r the benefit of subsidies accrues to us individuals or firms or flows out of the united states in the case of an export subsidy such as the eti provisions economic theory suggests that its repeal would in isolation increase the economic welfare of the united states on both counts an export subsidy distorts the allocation of investment drawing an inefficient amount of capital to the export sector and encour aging the subsidizing country here the united states to export more than is economically efficient at the same time part of the export benefit flows to foreign c onsumers as us producers pass on part of their tax reduction in the form of lower prices for us goods the net impact of the remaining parts of the bill on us economic welfare are harder to discern and definite conclu sion is not possible at this point for example the deferral tax benefit poses an incentive for us firms to invest in low tax countries more than they otherw ise would and traditional economic theoryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31574crs19 suggests that such distortion of inve stment reduces us economic welfare accordingly the parts of the bill that relax subpart f and expand deferral for example the provisions relating to secti on 902 firms and the repeal of foreign base company sales income probably in isolation reduce us economic welfare in contrast the bills interest allocation rules may reduce distortions in investment as noted above the rules are signed to correct an imperfection in the design of existing rules that affect the operation of the foreign tax credit limitation and in any case one general impact of th foreign tax credit limitation is to distort investment by posing tax disincentive to invest abroad accordingly the revised interest allocation rules by providing more generous foreign tax credit limitation rules may ease the limitations distor tion and increase economic welfare the impact of other foreign tax cred it proposals is more ambiguous the practice of crosscrediting foreign tax credits between different streams of foreign income probably poses an incentive to invest in lowtax countries by shielding such investment from us tax expansion of crosscrediting would likely result from hr 5095s consolidation of the foreign tax credits separate bask ets on the other hand however crosscrediting probably also re duces disincentive to invest in high tax countries thereby reducing distorti on posed by the us foreign tax credit but even if both the interest allocation rules and reduction of foreign tax credit baskets were to reduce inves tment distortions on balance we could not automatically conclude that the provisions enhance us economic welfare the reason is tax revenue to the extent the provisions redu ce us tax revenue collected from foreign sources the provisions may reduce us we lfare and whether that reduction would be sufficient to offset efficiency gains from allocation of investment is not clear impact on us tax revenue as noted above the joint committee on taxations prelimin ary estimates are that hr 5095 would on balance increase tax revenue over 64 billion over its first five years and by 11 billion over its firs t 10 years these figures are modest compared to other tax bills enacted in recent years for example the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 public law 10716 was estimated to reduce ta x revenue by 5525 b illion over five years and by 13485 billion over 10 years the estimates we c ite for hr 5095 however are net amounts equal to the revenue gain from the bills revenueraising items minus the revenue loss from its revenuelosing provisions and the net amounts mask larger swings in revenue that are estimated to occur taken alone the revenueraising items would increase revenue by an estimated 431 b illion over five years and 947 billion over 10 years the revenue losing items would reduce revenue by an estimated 366 billion over five years and by 936 billion ove r 10 years these revenue changes are still small however compared to those pr ojected to result from the 2001 tax cut table 1 shows the joint committees estimates for the billhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31574crs20
