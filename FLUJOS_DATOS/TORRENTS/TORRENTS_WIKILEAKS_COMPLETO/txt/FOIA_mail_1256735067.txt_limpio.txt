from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to michael mann mannmeteopsuedu subject re the web page is up about the yamal treering chronology date wed oct 28 090427 2009 cc gavin schmidt gschmidtgissnasagov mike sept 2009 isnt up yet i expect it in the next day or so ill check again tomorrow away friday and montues next week our web site will update on sunday if the hc have updated theirs seems nothing yet on keiths yamal one of the russians has reason why khad hasnt grown so much all the sites in the region have permafrost at depth those nearer the rivers have the permafrost at greater depth partly due to the rivers warmth in the 20th century has meant greater depths for the roots khad is walk from the river and slightly higher so possibly has less available soil depth above the permafrost all the sites are sampled through river transport when the coring was done in the 1980s and early 1990s the fieldwork teams ate lot of fish permafrost idea is impossible to prove without going back to the sites and drilling down the russians plan to do this when they revisit the area but that depends on resources cheers phil cheers phil at 1707 27102009 michael mann wrote hi phil thankswe know that the point is simply that if we want to talk about about meaningful 2009 anomaly every additional month that is available from which to calculate an annual mean makes the number more credible we already have this for gistemp but have been awaiting hadcru to be able to do more decisive update of the status of the disingenuous globe is cooling contrarian talking point mike ps be bit careful about what information you send to andy and what emails you copy him in on hes not as predictable as wed like on oct 27 2009 at 104 pm phil jones wrote mike yes link will be fine ill look into sept numbers but you shouldnt be looking at individual months cheers phil at 1654 27102009 michael mann wrote thanks phil perhaps well do simple update to the yamal post eg linking keiths new pagegavin t as to the issues of robustness particularly wrt inclusion of the yamal series we actually emphasized that including the osborn and briffa 06 sensitivity test in our original post as we all know this isnt about truth at all its about plausibly deniable accusations m ps any word on hadcru sep numbers yet on oct 27 2009 at 1237 pm phil jones wrote gavin mike andy it has taken keith longer than he would have liked but it is up there is lot to read and understand it is structured for different levels the link goes to the top level there is more detail below this and then there are the data below that you can either go to our main page 1httpwwwcruueaacuk then click on the link or directly here 2httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffayamal2009 ill let you make up you own minds it seems to as though mcintyre cherry picked for effect there is an additional part that shows how many series from ch 6 of ar4 used yamal most didnt also there is sensitivity test of omitting it which comes from the supplementary info with osborn and briffa 2006 as expected omitting it makes very little difference to get to this follow the links from the above link mcintyre knows that the millennial temperature record is pretty robust otherwise he would produce his own series similarly the instrumental temperature is even more robust which he also knows cheers phil prof phil jones climatic research unit telephone 44 0 1603 592090 school of environmental sciences fax 44 0 1603 507784 university of east anglia norwich email 3pjonesueaacuk nr4 7tj uk michael mann professor director earth system science center essc department of meteorology phone 814 8634075 503 walker building fax 814 8653663 the pennsylvania state university email 4mannpsuedu university park pa 168025013 website 5httpwwwmeteopsuedumannmannindexhtml dire predictions book site 6httpwwwesscpsueduessc_webnewsdirepredictionsindexhtml prof phil jones climatic research unit telephone 44 0 1603 592090 school of environmental sciences fax 44 0 1603 507784 university of east anglia norwich email 7pjonesueaacuk nr4 7tj uk michael mann professor director earth system science center essc department of meteorology phone 814 8634075 503 walker building fax 814 8653663 the pennsylvania state university email 8mannpsuedu university park pa 168025013 website 9httpwwwmeteopsuedumannmannindexhtml dire predictions book site 10httpwwwesscpsueduessc_webnewsdirepredictionsindexhtml prof phil jones climatic research unit telephone 44 0 1603 592090 school of environmental sciences fax 44 0 1603 507784 university of east anglia norwich email pjonesueaacuk nr4 7tj uk references 1 httpwwwcruueaacuk 2 httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffayamal2009 3 mailtopjonesueaacuk 4 mailtomannpsuedu 5 httpwwwmeteopsuedumannmannindexhtml 6 httpwwwesscpsueduessc_webnewsdirepredictionsindexhtml 7 mailtopjonesueaacuk 8 mailtomannpsuedu 9 httpwwwmeteopsuedumannmannindexhtml 10 httpwwwesscpsueduessc_webnewsdirepredictionsindexhtml
