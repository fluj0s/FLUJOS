international affairs foreign affairs defense and trade divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31539nuclear smuggling and international terrorism issues and options for us policy summary the collapse of the ussr and its framework of totalitarian control raised fears of rampant nuclear proliferation fueled by leakages of fissile materials fromincreasingly insecure russian stockpiles major us concern is that suchmaterials and even complete nuclear wea pons could gravitate into dangerous hands increasing the array of potentially lethal dangers to western security and stability the dimensions of this threat have not been precisely calibrated the amount of weaponsusable material leaking out of russia has been small little visible evidence exists of participation by terrorists or rogue states in the black market for stolen highlyenriched uranium or plutonium indeed terrorists and rogues mayplace higher priority on other weapons of mass destruction wmd objectives or in the case of states on domestic ma nufacture of nuclear bomb ingredients nevertheless the possibility can be consider ed that the observed market in the west does not reflect the true state of affair s because many smuggling incidents might go undetected or unreported various worrisome scenarios can be contemplated froma shadow market organized by professiona ls and brokered by criminals to outright statesponsored proliferation by highranking russian officials the united states is funding broad range of activities in russia and other newly independent states nis of the former soviet union designed to stem outflows of nuclear material weapons and weapons design intelligence suchprograms have been controversial some believe that they have been underfundedand advocate major expansion while others see the programs as intrinsicallyunworkable in the russian context or put bluntly that nothing much can be done pervasive crime and corruption and russi as nuclear cooperation with iran which seemingly contradicts the goal of nonproliferation are cited to support the latterposition recent congressional budget decisions and bipartisan legislation currentlybefore congress indicate desire that inve stment in proliferation prevention in the nis should be increased significantly nevertheless concerns remain that more investment by itself will not translate into increased effectiveness against serious proliferation episodes especially those organized by wellplaced nuclear insiders and corrupt officials in response to alucrative offer from states or groups of concern technological and managerial improvements are being introduced in existing programs to address suchcontingencies yet some experts argue that washington should move beyond whatis now reactive and containmentoriented strategy to focus more on the demandside of the proliferation equation in particular improved intelligence collection on potential adversaries who they are what they want and how they plan to obtain itis seen as vital tool for guiding resource allocation and project managementdecisions on proliferation prevention and in strengthening overall prospects fornuclear risk

international terrorism issues and options for us policy how much of threat introduction the demise of soviet communism nd the end of the cold war provided welcome new opportunities for ending the arms race and advancing the cause ofworld peace yet po litical and ec onomic upheavals associated with the soviet collapse also sparked an array of new tr ansnational concerns potentially as serious as those emanating from the bipolar confront ations of the previous 50 years perhaps foremost among these was the apparently diminished capacity of russia and othernewlyindependent states nis of the form er soviet union to monitor and control their vast nuclear assets the prosp ect of leaky nuclear stockpiles seemed compatible with worstcase proliferation scen arios as us bipartisan task force reporting on us nonproliferation prospects in russia argued in january 2001report the most urgent unmet national secu rity threat to the united states today is the danger that weapons of mass destructi on or weaponsusable nuclear materials in russia could be stolen and sold to terrorists or hostile nationstates and used againstamerican troops abroad or citizens at home 1 the precise nature and implications of this threat and the adequacy of the us response to it form the principal subject matter of this report this report highlightstwo general problems first penumbra of uncertainty

missions and platforms to identify shadow marketmechanisms and to disrupt nuclear deals in the making identifying conditions worries about nuclear smuggling from the newlyindependent states of the former soviet union nis reflect the sharp economic decline and wrenching societalchanges resulting from the end of the cold war and the disintegration of the ussr to cite some revealing statistics ru ssias gross national product in 1998 was only 71 percent of what it was in 1992 and russian government orders for nucleardefense goods in that year were only one seventh of what they were in 1990 2 the economic downturn virtually destroyed the sovietera lifestyle of elite workers atnuclear enterprises as of 1999 the averag salary of the work force in russias formerly secret nuclear cities was just 43 per month and most employees had tomoonlight in other jobs to survive 3 furthermore the economic crisis destroyed the foundations of the soviet nuclear custodial system as july 2001 department

the 1990s reported various signs of deterioration holes in perimeter fences nonfunctioning alarm systems and paper records that fail to match physicalinventories of materials overall conditions have improved in th nuclear complex since the late 1990s thanks partly to an array of us assistance programs and partly to growth in the russian economy which has averaged 53 percent since 1998 salaries

nuclear weapons work force in the formerly closed nuclear cities by the year 20055 whether new jobs can be created for this number of workers by us and russi an efforts is uncertain altogether the structure inside the russian nuclear comp lex is still unstable and possibly conducive to nuclear theft the appearance of the nuclear genie the diminished economic circumstances of russias nuclear workers were in themselves source of proliferation cern in addition the lifting of communist political controls the opening of borders and the ushering in of market economymade the potential theft and sale of nuclear materials both thinkable and possiblethe result was an emergent traffic in radio active substances of various descriptions some of which found their way into inte rnational smuggling channels yet surveys of confirmed thefts and smuggling from the early 1990s in the nis indicate thatnuclear leakages pose less of security danger than anticipated though the nis has been described as vast potential superm arket for nuclear goods little material of direct military value at least for fission weapon has surfaced in the black market 6 as will be detailed below the amount of heu reported seized internationally since the ussrs collapse was not enough to ma ke single fission bomb this has been seen by some observers as cause for optimism as one alamos nuclear expertwrote recently as we look back on the decade since the collapse of the soviet union the good news is that nothing terrible has happened in spite of the terribletimes faced by the russian people 7 furthermore as will be shown evidence of interest by terrorists or nationstates in stolen nuclear materials is extremely slim in fact the market is almost entirely supplierdriven consisting of chains of sellers usually petty traders carrying thegoods on consignment stretching outward fr om the source enterprise in search of prospective customers internationa l demand for such items seems thin or nonexistent this finding implies that rrorists and rogue states have other unconventional weapons priorities shaped in part by the technically simpler task of developing chemical and biological or radiological weapons alternatively terrorists might be content to wreak havoc on their victims with conventionalexplosives or fuelladen aircraft other explanations though view the apparently supplydriven and anemic traffic in nuclear materials in more ominous terms for example an analysis by the center for nonproliferation research of washingtons national defense university argued in 1996 that current patterns of nuclear theft and smuggling may be aprelude to more serious episodes including major covert exports of fissile materialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31539crs4 8 james l ford and c

institute of international studies the university of pittsburghs ridgway center for international studies the institute for international studies at stanford univers ity the us department of energy and the russianamerican nuclear security advisory councilweapons components and even intact nuclear weapons8 at the very least movement of radioactive material and successful interdiction by law enforcementmight produce learning curve of sorts for smugglers allowing themopportunistically to shift methods and routes indeed there is some evidence that this is the case as will be detailed below furt hermore it is possible that as with other illegally traded commodities the totality of what is seized does not reflect what is stolen and pushed onto the black market still the impression of sellers market persists raising questions about the sever ity and the immediacy of the proliferation threat the nuclear black market the visible market contents and trends an extensive black market in nuclear materials and other radioactive isotopes developed in the aftermath of the soviet collapse nuclear crime was almostunknown in the soviet period systemic constraints such as closed borders restrictions on population movement and the pervasive presence of the committee of state security kgb virtually excluded opportunities and incentives forprivatized nuclear deals yet literally hundr eds of thefts of radioactive substances have occurred at nuclear enterprises and industrial installations across the formersoviet union since the early 1990s traffi ckers in such materi als have looked for buyers abroad mostly in europe where radioactive seizures are commonplacethe scope of the proliferation threat from this traffic and its potential for affecting international security and relationships though are matter of controversy amongpolicymakers and analysts for example clear evidence exists of participation in the market by terrorists rogue states or major transnational crime formationslikely brokers between wouldbe sellers and interested buyers of nuclear goodssome observers believe that the current level of nuclear smuggling might help open new trade channels and potential opportunitie s for proliferation of weapons of mass destruction as traffickers refine their tactic s to exploit gaps in border defenses yet it is not clear that sellers and buyers have been able to connect in ways that couldpose serious danger to us and western security interests various us and international institutions maintain databases on nuclear theft and smuggling incidents 9 perhaps the most wiselyreferenced one though it is in certain respects incomplete is that co mpiled by the international atomic energy agency iaea in vienna the iaea data and other data sets based on it suggest that nuclear trafficking in its visible manifestations at least is more minorinternational nuisance than major proliferation threat the agency recorded totalof 426 cases of nuclear

uranium cesium137 and the like which may pose environmental hazards but which is useless in making fissionweapons only 17 of the incidents or 4 per cent concerned thefts or seizures of more than microscopic quantities of weaponsusa ble uranium or plutonium some of them were the product of sting operations by the german police and intelligence services the us general accounting office gao has compiled list of 20 such casesfrom 1992 and based on information mostly from the iaea list and from usgovernment sources 10 russia is known or suspected to be the source of the material in at least 15 of the cases significantly the substance seized was not traceable toweapons plants or stockpiles but rather to naval fuel depots fuel production plants and nuclear research institutions taken together the amount of seized materialadded up to only 167 kilograms this quantity included 87 kilograms of uranium235 equivalent and 400plus grams of plutoniumnot enough to build nuclearbomb also more than 80 percent of the gro ss weight of the material was seized in the 19921995 period suggesting declining theft rate perceptions of weak marketor of market created by the authorities for stolen wares and

washington dc february 2002 p 2 12 telephone interview us drug enforcement agency washington dc july 17 2002finding buyers would deter serious criminal organization from participating in the market the iaea and gao data sets show fairly noticeable pattern surge of incidents in the 1993 to 1995 period decline between 1996 and 1998 when noweaponsusable material was observed in the black market and an increase againbetween 1999 and 2001 see table 1 economic deprivation alone does not seemto explain this pattern since nuclear sm uggling has shown an upward trend even as the russian economy has begun to show pos itive growth the ia ea also shows shift in the geographical direction of smuggling between 1993 and 1995 central europe comprising germany poland the czech republic slovakia and hungary accounted for 45 percent of the interdicted cases this slowed dramatically to 18 percent between 1999 and 2001 at the same tim the share attributable to bulgaria turkey and the countries along russias sout hern tier jumped from 7 percent to 52 percent between the two periods conceiva bly the relatively high vigilance of police and border control authorities in central eu rope has induced smugglers to ply their wares along more accommodating pathways shadow market thus little nuclear material of significance and nuclear warheads seem to circulate in smuggling channels and the market as whole is sellerdominated inthe view of some experts however the obs erved reality of the nuclear traffic may not reflect the pattern of the traffic as whole february 2002 report to congress by the national intelligence council part of the us intelligence community notes we assess that undetected smuggling has occurred although we do not know thecontext or magnitude of such thefts so analysts have drawn an analogy to the traffic in other illicit commodities notably drugs 11 according to the us drug enforcement administration us federal authorities are able to confiscate only 20 to 25 percent of the 500plus tons of south american cocaine estimated to be in transit to the united states in given year12 while fissile materials are not mass market items like drugs it is possible that what is captured represents relatively small percentage of what is stolen and delivered to smugglers second and related problem is that many trafficking incidents simply go unreported or sufficient details about them are not made available the nis is aparticular offender in this regard as william potter of the center fornonproliferation studies of the monterey in stitute of international studies

before fsb clamped down on theconspiracy on the other hand accounts of the incident do not indicate whether or not the conspiracy went beyond the planning stage whether the participantsactually got their hands on the material in question additional questions concern the overall sh ape of the nuclear black market and the relationships of actors within it the stereotype of the visible market as noted consists of myriad sellers searching usually vainly for prospective customers it is conceivable though that purveyors of stra tegic nuclear wares could converge with endusers or their representatives in ways that are not readily apparent to western intelligence or law enforcement agencies such shadow market or clandestine supply chain could be organized by wouldbe suppliers potential customers or third party brokers such as organized crime groups or quasilegitimate trading firms withthe appropriate contacts doubtless it woul d require the connivance of senior nuclear managers and others in authority the gree of official cover might vary some us intelligence analysts for example be lieve thatunder the umbrella of russias technical cooperation agreements with ira

evidence that terrorist and rogue states are participating in the market is sparse to be sure terrorists have demonstrated interest in nuclear weapons osamabin laden for example in famous interview published in time magazine in 1999 stated in answer to question about nuclear and chemical weapons acquiringweapons for the defense of muslims is religious duty 17 yet qaedas efforts to acquire nuclear capability seem sporadic and unsophisticated only single welldocumented case involving negotiations fo r purchase of what was purported to be enriched uranium in the sudan in 1993 or 1994 can be cited from available sources central intelligence agency cia report to congress in 2001 concludedalthough the potential devastation from nuclear terrorism is high we have nocredible reporting of terrorists acquiring nuclear weapons or sufficient material tomake them 18 in the case of nationstates the picture is also unclear as signatories to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty iran ira q and north korea are likely to use extreme circumspection in their nuclear weapons acquisition programs an iraqidefector familiar with iraqs nuclear weapon development khiddir hamza claimsthat iraq tried unsuccessfully to buy fissile material in the 1980s and early 1990s but was scammed by black marketeers they came to baghdad with bags of samplesand left with bags of money and we never got any serious nuclear materials hamzatold nbcs geraldo rivera in january 2001 interview 19 senior iraqi official in 1996 offered somewhat different version of events stating that in the previous 10 years iraq had received more than 200 offers of everything from red mercury to fissile materials to complete nuclear weapons but had turned them all down20 the abovementioned cia report expresses concern that baghdad may be attemptingto acquire materials that could be used in resuscitating its nuclear weapons program but offers details similarly the report cites irans interest in acquiring foreign fissile material for nuclear weapons development yet cases of smuggling ofweaponsgrade materials by iranian nationals or agents have been recorded to datehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31539crs9 21 michael

incident was an elaborate hoax intended perhaps to cause consternation in the west or an incredibly obtuse solicitation by genuine terrorists cannot be determined with certainty another case reported

had made an attempt to buy uraniu m in kazakhstan in 1994 months before us operation operation sapphire which funded the transfer of 600 kilograms of weapons grade uranium out of that country see kirill belyaninov utechka literaturnaya gazeta january 20 1993 p 3 and isis personal communication june 25 2002also the case can be made that aspiri ng nuclear states prefer to manufacture fissile ingredients of atomic weapons independently rather than pursuing the riskyand difficult course of acquiring them abroad hence their purchasing strategiesfocus on the means of production for instance irans attempts to obtain gascentrifuge enrichment and laser isotope separation technologies from russia havebeen wellpublicized iraqs nuclear program was set back as result of the gulfwar yet recent intelligence reports suggest th at iraq has tried to acquire spare parts for flow forming machines used to produce components for uranium enrichmentsystems 21 and north korea has recently reveal ed the existence of clandestine program to produce enriched uranium for use in nuclear bomb in the iran case though concerns have been raised that clandestine transfers of nuclear materials could occur under official cover irans various nuclear agreementswith russia are constant sources of worry in this regard for example us state department official in october 2000 articulat ed us concern that iran would exploit their russian reactor project to develop wideranging contacts with russias nuclearentities and to engage in more sensitive forms of cooperation with directapplicability to nuclear

comparatively innocuous at least there is little to suggest otherwise there are also mediaaccounts that bin laden has sought and succe ssfully obtained tactical or portable nuclear weapons from the former soviet ion for instance lurid story appearing in the parisbased arabic newspaper alwatan arabi in november 1998 asserts that bin ladens emissaries concluded d eal with members of the chechen mafia to buy 20 tactical nuclear warheads for 30 million and 2 tons of afghan opium said to be worth 70 million according to th source the warheads originated from different arsenals in several republics such as ukraine turkmenistan and evenrussia 30 whether such contacts led to qaeda representatives making offers for nuclear warheads is conjectural it is true that contacts between qaeda and thechechen resistance appear to have been ex tensive chechen fighters have trained in qaeda training camps in afghanistan and at least one qaeda camp wherechechen rebels and others trained functioned at one time in the former sovietrepublic of georgia according to an apr il 2002 fbi affidavit also according to the affidavit usbased charity with ties to qaeda the benevolence international foundation is said to have diverted substantial funds to support the chechen causeincluding 685000 delivered to chechencontrolled relief organization ingeorgia 31 whether the chechens had any nuclear weapons to sell however is unlikely gaps in intelligence reporting and the evident common hatred of both sidestoward the west may tend to inflate commentary on the issue nuclear terrorism plausible

involved nuclear weapon the probability of being swindled is high even if qaeda were successful in obtaining nuclear materials or weapon major obstacles would remain in the cas of finished weapon the problem would be to operate or bypass its multiple armi ng and failsafe codes though how elaborate these are would depend on the type and or igin of the weapon building weapon from scratch would be even more difficult all experts agree that guntype deviceusing heu would be substantially simpler project than an implosive deviceinvolving heu or plutonium yet larg amount of heu might be requiredsome 40 to 50 kilograms for an unsophisticated device 32 also as one source observes although the basic principles are well known and described at length on the internet the devil is in the

cultivate contacts with pakistani nuclear scientistsultan bashiruddin mahmoudwho hadin his retirement managed pakistani programs to produce enriched uranium andweaponsgrade plutonium however mahmoud lacked the specialized knowledgenecessary to make weapon apparently the scientist had established charitable organization that operated in afghanistan and in the context of visits to that country met with bin laden twice it is not cl ear whether nuclear secrets of value were passed but according to one account mahmoud told bin laden you cant justbuild bomb you need big institution you can forget it 34 bin laden may or may not have heeded this advice in any case qaeda appears to have explored other wmd options including development of chemicaland biological weapons qaeda also contemplated

and interest currently paid on the 27 billion sovietera debt owed by the russian federation to the united states in contemplating funding decisions for nuc lear security in russia congress and the administration may wish to consider veral major issues one is simply whether the overall threat of proliferation to hostile states and groups is overstatedof particular concern is whether evidence of demand for strategic nuclear items by such adversaries is sufficiently compelling to justify significant increases in current programs second is whether increases in funding for existing programs are likely to translate into increases in their effectiveness against major diversion threats the essentially reactive nature of us programs their supplyside focus andtechnological limitations and what some view as russias ambiguous commitment to nonproliferation are points to be considered third issue is related to the role ofintelligence in proliferation preventionhow this role should be defined and shaped to improve overall us nucle ar security policy in the nis these issues will be considered below an exaggerated threat as was noted earlier overt evidence of proliferation pressures on the demand side is sparse there is virtually evidence of participation by terrorists roguestates or organized crime formations in the market the amount calculated inweight of weaponusable material being offered for sale never voluminous appearsto have diminished drastically since the early to mid1990s while this may reflect improved security at russian facilities it may also suggest the absence of demand for these items whether such groups as aum and qaeda have made sustainedeffort to acquire nuclear capability can be questioned as one harvard university researcher observed qaeda has

efforts to obtain nuclear materials or weapons also is largely lacking what president george bush calls the axis of evil statesall appear to have nuclear weapons programs but emphasis has been on trying toproduce special nuclear materials indigenousl rather than procuring such materials from foreign sources concern about the vari able quality of material proffered on the black market much of which is below the standard used in weapons and about the substantial risks of being caught trying to buy such material doubtless affect states procurement programs 73 counterarguments also may be advanced and some of these have been introduced in this report one related to gaps in reporting relating to the nuclearsmuggling business and the actors engaged in it should the traffic in fissile materials conform to the pattern of certain other illegal enterprises what is seized by theauthorities might represent small portion of what has been detected and seized furthermore evidence suggests that many theft and smuggling incidents from russiahave gone unreported the pattern of di ssimulation or denial goes back years in 1994 russian authorities were asserting that not single gram of plutonium had been stolen even as 363 grams of plutonium from russian research institute wasseized in munich the result of german sting operation 74 in addition mention can be made of the large resources available to aspiring nuclear states and groupsosama bin ladens personal fortune s been estimated at 200 to 400 million 75 and of the difficult economic situation prevailing at many russian nuclear enterprises efforts of nationstates to procure nuclear weapons material are likely to be painstakingly devious and wellconcealed as previously noted thehypothetical possibility can be advanced

are much higher than for other international programs and that consequences offailures can be catastrophic for regional and global stability and even for life on theplanet within congress the tendency has been in recent years to increase spendingfor proliferation prevention even beyond the level requested by the bush administration the apparent threat of nuclear terrorism however defined hasadded urgency and legitimacy to us nuclear containment efforts in the nis and indeed worldwide given congress evident desire to support such efforts critical issue is how the overall us nuclear security position in the nis might bestrengthened one possible course is to introduce qualitative improvements inexisting programs for instance making mpc more resistant to insider corruption and introducing better radiation detection equipment on nis borders to someextent steps are already being taken in th is direction second approach is to move beyond the generally reactive and supplyside orientation of us nuclear securitypolicy to focus more attention on the demand side of the proliferation equation that is on the machinations of the adversarie s themselves the preeminent need here is for greatly enhanced intelligence collection effort what harvard university expertgraham allison calls the long pole in the tent where us nuclear security andnonproliferation interests are concerned 80 pushing the technology frontier qualitative improvements for us nuclear security programs appear to be in the works for instance both doe and dod reportedly have plans to improve human reliability systems for nuclearcustodians these include providing breat halysers and drug testing equipment dod reportedly also has provided polygraphs to its russian military counterparts anddoe is also contemplating such st eps as part of the mpca program 81 doe is initiating new phase in mpca the mpca operations monitoring project mom that potentially could help deter or defeat insider nuclear conspiraciesthe basis of mom is the introduction of motiondetection cameras for untended visual surveillance at nuclear material storage vaults and guard posts the data recorded by the cameras would be transmitted to review stations inside the enterprise for example the office of the chie f engineer of the vice president for administrative security importantly the data flow also would be reviewed beyond the

that stateoftheartequipment more extensively deployed at nis border crossings can enhance thedeterrent value of current systems intelligence the long pole in the tent much attention has been given to the failure to anticipate the apparently wellplanned and coordinated terroristattacks on the world trade center and th pentagon major concern of congress has been whether existing us intelligence capabilities especially in the sphere of human collection are adequate to detect nd prevent further terrorist episodes the report of the house of representatives on the intelligence authorization act for the fiscal year 2003 for example notes of all the lessons that should be lear ned in the wake of september 11 the importance of having reliable and timely human intelligence is among the mostimportant the information most important to the nations national security isidentifying and understanding the plans of and intentions of those who would harm our interests some of that information is available only throughhumint 85 the lesson seems highly relevant to the nuclear proliferation field as well here gaps in intelligence co llection and reporting appear particularly striking as noted throughout this report while alls ource intelligence is required to cover these gaps the role of humint operations appears critical because of the clandestine andidiosyncratic nature of nuclear smuggling activities and because of the highlevelcollusion required to orchestrate significant nuclear deals the importance of intelligence in proliferation prevention is essentially three fold one task is simply to clarify the na ture of the threat this means collecting information about the adversaries who they are what material and weapons theyseek and where and how they intend to obt ain these items while broad assumptions have been made about the nuclear intention of certain states and nonstate actorstheir precise targets and plans remain unclear second objective is to assist

materials or weaponry already have occurred intelligence is potentially ke to identifying the perpetrators and the recipients intelligence can guide such preparations or stingoperations against suspected targets as well as what one nuclear expert calls joint emergency response exercises that run the gamut from disabling an adversarysnuclear capability to mitigating the consequences of nuclear attacks 86 an issue for congress and for the us intelligence community itself is how an enhanced collaboration effort in the nis would be organized and implemented one possible mechanism is an increase in formal information sharing with intelligenceand law enforcement counterparts and nuclear security officials in the nis relevantagencies would include the ministry of internal affairs the fsb russian customsand gan among others th authorities harbor w ealth of information on nuclear smuggling incidents actors and tr ends that could be of great value in configuring us nonproliferation prevention programs in those countries vehicle for advancing such sharing might be the newlyformed usrussian working group on terrorism which recently issued statement stressing the importance ofcooperation against threats posed by nucl ear biological and chemical terrorism 87 nevertheless it can be argued that the liaison partners russia and other nis countries have different interests from the united states as well as differentassessments of the nuclear proliferation threat 88 for this reason according to some observers maintaining and expanding unilateral us capability may be of centralimportance the clear differences between the united states and russia or thelatters nuclear relations with iran are obvious cases in point ideally welldesigned effort would provide advance warni ng of covert nuclear deals failing that it might pick up clues such as sudden displays of wealth by lowsalaried nuclearemployees that smuggling conspiracy ready was afoot and aid in subsequent
