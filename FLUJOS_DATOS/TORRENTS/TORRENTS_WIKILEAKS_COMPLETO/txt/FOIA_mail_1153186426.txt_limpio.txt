briffa kbriffaueaacuk eystein jansen eysteinjansengeouibno valerie massondelmotte valeriemassonceafr xflowed hi tim et especially valerie again sorry for the confusion but hopefully the emails sent and forwarded from valerie and this evening helps figure this out i think were going with borehole for law dome but you guys need to confirm its the way to go im ccing to valerie in the hope she can try to provide more guidance in this with confirmation that its the best way to go and will stand up to criticism if we have multiple conflicting temp recons from law dome and one cant be shown from the literature as being the best then we should state that and show neither just an idea but i think valerie was pretty sure the borehole was best she should be more available in day or so thanks all cheers peck hi all im halfway through these changes and will get the revised figures out to you probably tomorrow except maybe the sh one because im not sure if the van ommen pers comm data shown by jones mann and suggested by riccardo are the data to use or not is it published properly ive seen the last 700 years of the law dome 18o record published so perhaps we should show just the period since 1300 ad that period appears in mayewski pa maasch ka white jwc et 700 year record of southern hemisphere extratropical climate variability annals of glaciology 39 127132 2004 and goodwin id van ommen td curran maj et mid latitude winter climate variability in the south indian and southwest pacific regions since 1300 ad climate dynamics 22 8 783794 jul 2004 see below for some more comments in respect to individual figures at 2136 30062006 jonathan overpeck wrote figure 610 1 shade the connection between the top and middle panels yes 2 remove the dotted long instrumental curve from the middle panel yes 3 replace the red shaded region in the bottom panel with the greyscale one used in fig 613 yes 4 label only every increment of 10 in the greyscale bar formally color in the bottom panel yes 5 increase font sizes for axis numbering and axis labeling all are too small you can figure out the best size by reducing figs to likely page size minus margins we guess the captions need to be bigger by couple increments at least yes figure 611 1 this one is in pretty good shape except that ricardo has to determine if s african boreholes need to be removed i think henry said they were published and could stay figure 612 1 again please delete s african borehole if ricardo indicates its still not published i think henry said they could stay 2 consider adding law dome temperature record ricardo is investigating but perhaps keithtim can help figure out if its valid to include feel free to check with valerie on this too as she seems to know these data at least little already discussed above 3 also please increase font sizes and make sure they match 610 probably better to use bold fonts you are right that ive mixed bold and nonbold when reduced to small size the nonbold actually read more clearly than the bold i think so ill standardise on nonbold its not possible to completely standardise on the size because each figure i provide might be scaled by different amounts i dont know final figure size so will make good guess should be ok figure 613 1 we are going to split the existing 613 into two figure the first is 100 tims fig and is just an upgrade of the existing 613 ad with the only changes being 1a delete the old echog red dashed line curve in panel d and keith says this was discussed and rejected so i should keep old echog in 1b please also increase font sizes and make sure they match 610 and 12 please use bold fonts ok as discussed above 2 the existing 613e is going to become new 614 with the addition of new forcings panel on top of the existing panel which becomes 614b to make this happen tim and fortunat have to coordinate as tim has the forcing data and knows what we what and tim has the existing figure we suspect it will be easier for fortunat to give tim data and layout advice and for tim to make figure that matches the other figs hes doing please note that this fig cant be as large as the existing 613ad but needs to be more compact to permit its inclusion done cheers tim dr timothy j osborn academic fellow climatic research unit school of environmental sciences university of east anglia norwich nr4 7tj uk email
