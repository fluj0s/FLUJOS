conditional emissions reduction target of 30 percent if others commit to comparable efforts the dutch had pushed to make the 30 percent offer unconditionally dutch climate officials are recalibrating their negotiating strategy after cop15 and putting greater emphasis on pragmatism they have praised several facets of the copenhagen accord and are eager to make it operational the dutch are concerned that failure by donors to get fasttrack financing flowing quickly will lead to more friction with developing countries later this year end summary ambassador discusses climate with environment minister 2 sbu ambassador delivered reftel points january 13 during her initial call on environment minister jacqueline cramer cramer said the eu should inscribe its target as single entity she also emphasized the need for developed country pledges taken as whole to add up to convincing number for the developing world she expressed concern that the january 31 annex would be insufficient because this bottomup approach will not get to 25 percent developed country commitment she advocated specific negotiating track led by the us and others to determine how the developed world can come up with convincing target cramer acknowledged this is delicate process and offered dutch help regarding the dutch national goal cramer reiterated the dutch governments longstanding target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 30 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 note most domestic environmental and energy analysts consider this unachievable end note given this ambitious domestic goal cramer cautioned that dutch government and industry were looking for comparable efforts and level playing field with other eu member states and major global emitters netherlands joins uk in push for 30 percent eu commitment 3 c emboffs reinforced reftel points january 25 with the dutch foreign ministry climate negotiator sanne kaasjager he said the netherlands would join the eu in inscribing conditional collective target of 30 percent the socalled 2030 commitment eitheror he described vicious january 20 coreper meeting where the uks and the netherlands push for an unconditional 30 percent target or at least 2030 percent leaving the option for figure in between met stiff resistance from italy and poland the netherlands will not inscribe its own national target 30 percent by 2020 for fear of distracting attention from the eu target and because its national commitment is political rather than legal one enthusiasm for copenhagen accord 4 c kaasjager said the netherlands considered the copenhagen accord significant accomplishment specifically he called the accord breakthrough for setting out political consensus around the 6 to 8 most contentious issues in climate negotiations the dutch were pleased the accord reiterated the 2 degree celsius objective kaasjager praised president obamas handson role in securing the accord while sharply criticizing the inept qsecuring the accord while sharply criticizing the inept danish performance as chair of cop15 5 sbu the dutch government is taking steps to convince developing countries to associate with the accord kaasjager has drafted messages for embassies in capitals receiving dutch development assistance to solicit support this is an unprecedented move for the dutch government which traditionally recoils at any suggestion to use aid money as political leverage but at the annual dutch chiefs of mission conference in midjanuary ambassadors were clamoring for guidance on how to engage and persuade developing countries on climate negotiations however kaasjager said the netherlands would find it difficult to make association with the accord condition to receive climate financing eu introspection after cop15 6 c according to kaasjager the copenhagen endgame has the hague 00000054 002 of 002 caused the eu to take hard look at its role in climate talks he was taken aback by the sight of european leaders eg pm brown and chancellor merkel hovering around the vip room sofas where the chinese indian south african and brazilian representatives were consulting trying in vain to get pull asides with the basic leaders kaasjager took exception with the medias portrayal of the eus exclusion from the final stages of the copenhagen talks but delivered harsh verdict on the eus performance at cop15 he lamented the lack of member state discipline and the failure to bring tactical plan meaning the eu was unprepared to adjust quickly to changing dynamics as the talks unfolded he said his eu counterparts are coming around to the notion that europes strategy must shift from how to involve the us to how to involve china path forward for climate talks 7 sbu in word kaasjager said what emerged from copenhagen was pragmatism more than ever dutch climate officials appreciate that climate negotiations will be an incremental process of small steps they are still deliberating on what the right longterm negotiating track is going forward bilateral cooperation between major emitters coalitions of the willing such as the major economies forum g20 or greenland dialogue or the legalistic process the dutch think bottomup bilateral approach will not achieve enough emissions reductions they worry about exclusion from mef and g20 fora and they are currently disenchanted with the topdown process vulnerable to spoiler countries kaasjager said the netherlands will work to forge middle road that is achievable and inclusive in the nearterm the dutch are eager to use the next several months to make the copenhagen accord operational and bring its elements to the formal negotiating table in bonn in june fasttrack financing pivotal 8 sbu kaasjager was particularly concerned about bottlenecks in the flow of fasttrack financing envisioned in the copenhagen accord without serious effort by donor countries he predicted worst case scenario in which g77 members use the late 2010 cancun meeting to accuse the developed world of failing to follow through on its fasttrack financing promises he identified three potential areas of friction with developing countries on financing most of the pledged funding is not additional it is skewed towards mitigation programs rather than adaptation and much of it is already committed without much say from recipients kaasjager has circulated proposal for donor country counterparts to meet informally at working levels with recipients countries to address these issues headon rather than wait for them to surface as pr disaster later levin
