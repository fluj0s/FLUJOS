prohibit this procedure scribed as partialbi rth abortion by its opponents was first passed by congress in 1995 during the 104th congress4 the pbaba of 1995 was vetoed by president clinton because it did not include an exception that would allow the procedure to be used to protect the health of the mother the president stated that the bill does not allow women to protect themselves from serious

the grounds that it did not include health exception8 in 2000 during the 106th congress the senate did not appoint conferees to resolve differences between the hous and senatepassed versions of the legislation the partialbirth abortion measure th at was enacted in 2003 prohibits physician from knowingly performing par tialbirth abortion and killing human fetus the term partialbirth abortion is defined as an abortion in which the person performing the abortion deliberately and intentionally delivers living fetus until specified part of the fetus is outside the body of the mother for the purpose of performing an overt act that the person knows will kill the fetus and performs the overt act that kills the fetus9 under the pbaba physician who knowin gly performs partialbirth abortion and kills fetus will be subject to fine imprisonment for not more than two years or both10 the act does not prohibit partialbirt h abortions that are necessary to save the life of mother whose life is endangered by physical disorder physical illness or physical injury including lifee ndangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself thus the pbaba allows an exception for partial birth abortions to preserve the life of the mother however similar exception to protect the health of the mother is not included in the act the pbaba provides cause of action for certain individuals affected by the performance of partialbirth abortion the father of the fetus if married to the mother at the time partialbirth abortion is performed and the maternal grandparents of the fetus if the mother is under 18 years of age at the time of the abortion may obtain appr opriate relief except when the pregnancy is the result of the plaintiffs criminal conduct or the pl aintiff

psychological and physical injuries th at arise as result of the abortion the most notable difference between th pbaba and the other partialbirth abortion bills previously passed by congress is the inclusion of significant findings section in the law12 section 2 of the act which comprises more than half of the measure identifies congresss findings with respect to partial birth abortion for example in this section congress finds and declares that moral medical and ethical consensus exists that the practice of performing partial birth abortion is gruesome and inhumane procedure that is never medically n ecessary and should be prohibited13 concerns about the safety of the procedure raised in testimony received during hearings in past congresse s are also described in this section finally the findings section includes di scussion of supreme court cases involving the courts deference to congressional findings in his introduction of the pbaba th acts sponsor former senator rick santorum indicated that congress may not only engage in factfinding but that the court will defer to such factfinding14 senator santorum indi cated that congress is entitled to reach its own factual findings findings that the supreme court accords great deference and may enact gislation based on these findings15 gonzales v carhart and gonzales v planned parenthood the decision to review both carhart and planned parenthood provides the court with the opportunity to evaluate all of the legal theories asserted against the constitutionality of the pbaba in carhart the eighth circuit found the act unconstitutional solely on the grounds that it does not include an exception for abortions to protect the health of the mother in planned parenthood however the ninth circuit concluded that the act is unconstitutional for three distinct reasons it does not include an health exception it imposes an undue burden on womans ability to have an abortion by prohibiting both the dx procedure and the standard dilation and evacuation procedure16 and it is unconstitutionally vague thus depriving fair notice to physici ans about what is prohibited17 the courts

1994 turner i 520 us 180 1997 turner iito review planned parenthood made nearly four months after its decision to review carhart was hailed by some members of the prochoice community who believe that the ninth circuit decision provides more complete record on the likely impact of the statute18 the government has made three ar guments in support of the pbaba19 first the government maintains that the absence of health exception does not impose an undue burden on womans ability to have an abortion second the government contends that the act is not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad finally the government argues that even if the court is able to identify some aspect of the act that is invalid it may be possible to craft narrower injunctive relief consistent with ayotte v planned parenthood of northern new england the courts 2006 decision in which it held that the first circuit erre d in striking down st ate parental consent statute in its entirety20 health exception in stenberg v carhart 2000 case involving the constitutionality of nebraska partialbirth abortion statute the court invalidated the state law because it failed to include an exception to protect the health of the mother and because the language used to define the prohib ited procedure was too vague21 the government asserts that proper reading of stenberg requires statute that regulates abortion but lacks an health exception to be upheld unless it w ould create significant health risks and thereby impose an undue burden on large fraction of women the government maintains that congressional factfinding supports both th position that the absence of health exception does not create significant health risks for large fraction of women and that partialbirth abortion is never medically indicated to preserve the health of mother according to the government the testimony of physicians who appeared before congress and other evidence in the legislative record emphasize that ban on partialbirth abortion would not endanger womans health because the procedure is never medically necessary in addition the government argues th at congressional factfinding should be afforded high degree of deference citing turner broadcasting system inc v fcc two cases from 1994 and 1997 commonly referred to as turner i and turner ii22 involving federal cable legislation and mustcarry

college of obstetricians gynecologists submitted statements to congress opposing the actfactual findings in wide variety of contex ts and with regard to wide variety of constitutional claims23 in turner i the court indicated that reviewing courts must accord substantial deference to the predictive judgments of congress when evaluating the constitutionality of statute the court observed that reviewing courts sole obligation is to assure that in formulating its judgments congress has drawn reasonable inferences ba sed on substantial evidence24 the respondents planned parenthood and carhart ch allenge the governments reliance on congresss findings and the belief that the court owes great deference to such findings and also argue that the gove rnments use of significant health risks standard is inappropriate25 planned parenthood maintains that the stenberg court was guided by planned parenthood of southeaste rn pennsylvania v casey the courts 2002 abortion decision and the c onclusion that medical emergency exception should be broad enough to ensure that compliance with an abortion restriction would not in any way pose signif icant threat to the life or health of woman thus in stenberg the court held that to prevent significant threat to the life or health of woman methodspecifi c ban must have health exception if substantial medical auth ority supports the propos ition that banning that method could endanger womens health planned parenthood cont ends that by requiring substantial medical authority as the quantum of proof for whether health exception is constitutionally required individual physicians are prevented from acting with unfettered discretion and reasonable differences of dical opinion are tolerated26 in short planned parenthood argues that the governments fa ilure to address th substantial medical authority standard articulated in stenberg is not constitutionally tolerable27 by considering only whether significant health risks are imposed on large fraction of women some women could be forced to endure significant health risks in contravention of roes essential holding that the health of pregnant women must remain paramount when regulating abortion planned parenthood and carh art dispute the governments position that partialbirth abortion is ne ver medically necessary they assert that during consideration of the act numerous physici ans and medical groups expressed concerns about the legislation preventing them from using the safest procedures28 examples of specific circumstances when dx offered particular advantages were

reduced risk of complications is particularly important for women with serious medical problems because such women do not have the physiological reserves to cope with the complications29 additional support for the use of dx under certain circumstances to preserve the health of th woman was also identified during the district court trials of the two cases in addition to challenging the factual findings defended by the government the respondents question the governments position that such findings demand great deference from the court in particular the respondents dispute the governments reliance on turner i and turner ii carhart contends that the turner cases are inapplicable with regard to the pbaba carhart argues that the court has never deferred to congressional findings in case where congress uses such findings in an attempt to alter the meaning and scope of substantive constitutional rights30 carhart maintains that an extension of turner to this case would effectively provide congress with carte blanche to violate the constitution simply by making carefully chosen findings31 according to carhart deference is ppropriate only when legisl ation involves areas where congress has particular expe rtise and courts have prev iously shown deference to congressional findings moreover carhart stresses that the turner cases require deference only with regard to congresss predictive judgments carhart argues that these judgments pertain to circumstances in which c ongress must make its best predictions concerning how an industry will evolve or how individuals will respond to economic motivations32 from this viewpoint congress s findings on the medical necessity of the partialbirth abortion proce dure do not involve similar predictions like carhart planned parenthood believes that th factual findings are not entitled to deference pla nned parenthood argues that the findings are simply baldfaced attempt to endrun stenberg s constitutional rule33 in addition planned parenthood emphasizes that the turner cases require defere nce only when congress has drawn reasonable inferences based on substantial evidence in this case planned parenthood believes that congresss findi ngs are unreasonable and therefore not entitled to deference planne d parenthood notes that all thr ee district courts to have considered the validity of the pbaba ve

f3d at 1179 contrary to the governments claim properly construed the act covers nonintact as well as intact des as result despite containing some provisions that are different in form from those in the nebraska statute the act is sufficiently broad to cause those w ho perform nonintact procedures to fear prosecution conviction and imprisonment citation omitted the resulting chilling effect on doctors willingness to perform previability postfirst trimester abortions would impose an undue burden on the constitutional rights of women 36 brief for the petitioner at 31 planned parenthood 051382 37 idparenthood found that all of the governments own witnesses disagreed with many of the specific congressional findings34 undue burden and the overbreadth doctrine the ninth circuits invalidation of the pbaba was based in part on the statute being unconstitutionally overbroad35 the overbreadth doctrine is concerned generally with statutes precision and the possibility of restricting constitutionally protected activities in stenberg the court found that the nebraska partialbirth abortion statute was improperly overbroad because it defined partialbirth abortion in such way as to prohibit th standard procedure as well as the dx procedure as result the stat ute imposed an undue burden on womans access to an abortion similar arguments have been made against the pbaba the government maintains that the federal definition for partialbirth abortion is different from the nebraska definition and thus should not imperil the statute the government argues that th federal definition differs in two critical ways first by identifying anatomical landmarks partial birth abortion under the act could not encompass the procedure36 under the act partialbirth abortion involves the delivery of the fe until either the entire feta l head or any part of the fetal trunk past the navel is outside th body of the mother during procedure the government asserts only small portion of the fetus such as foot or an arm may be brought outside the body of the mother second the government contends that the federal statute app lies only where the person performing the abortion also completes an overt act that kills the fetus37 thus by requiring the overt act the act does not apply to the procedure where the delivery of portion of the fetus and the dismembermen t of the fetus are indistinguishable the respondents maintain that the acts definition for par tialbirth abortion could still encompass abortions involving the procedure findings by the district court in planned parenthood indicate that there is standard degree to which fetus is extracted during pro cedure before an obstructing part of the fetus may be disarticulated or reduced in size thus the respondents argue that the extraction of the fetus to the point of the anatomic landmarks may occur during standard abortionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33778crs8 38 see brief of respondents at 41 carhart 05380 39 id

planned parenthood 051382the respondents also dispute the govern ments reliance on the completion of an overt act as sufficient to distinguish th partialbirth aborti on procedure from the standard procedure38 they maintain that during abortion physician may have to perform the overt act of disarticulation or the compressing or decompressing of fetal part to complete the abortion these acts are distinct from the extraction of the fetus and would seem to constitute an overt act the respondents state that even the government has found disarticula tion to be an overt act carhart notes that the overt act requi rement does not eff ectively exclude procedures because as the government concedes the overt act may include disarticulation39 if such an act is necessary and the fetus has been extracted to the point of the anatomic landmarks the physician will have arguably performed partialbirth abortion vagueness the doctrine of vagueness involves the clar ity of statute statute must be drawn with sufficient clarity to inform pe ople of the conduct that must be avoided to avert the statutes penalties the ninth circuit concluded that the pbaba was void for vagueness because it failed to clearly define the medical procedures that are prohibited and thus deprived physician s fair notice of improper conduct and encouraged arbitrary enforcement40 the government contends that the c onstitution does not require impossible standards of clarity41 rather statute must simply give person of ordinary intelligence reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited so that he may act accordingly42 the government believes that the act readily satisfies the relatively modest requirements of the voidforvagueness doctrine43 t h government maintains that the statute prohibits particular type of abortion in which the physician deliberately and intentionally delivers living fetus to specific anatomical point outside the body of the mother for the purpose of knowingly performing an overt act that will kill the fetus moreover the government asserts that the act contains ambi guous terms or phrases the respondents maintain that the act is unconstitutionally vague because it not only fails to clearly define the prohibited procedure but also forces physicians to guess at the acts meaning nd differ as to its application44 the respondents stress that some abortions do satisfy the anatomical landmark requirements identified in the act and thus would seem to constitute partial birth abortions under the statute similarly some acts undert aken as part of procedure mayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33778crs9 45 brief of respondents at 45 planned parenthood 051382 46 brief for the petitioner at 4950 carhart 05380 brief for the petitioner at 40 planned

the acts language and the governments strained interpretations th respondents maintain that the act is unconstitutionally vague45 narrower injunctive relief although it maintains firmly that the pbaba is constitutional the government suggests that it may be possible to craft more narrow injunctive relief rather than complete invalidation if some aspect of the act is found unconstitutional46 in ayotte the court concluded that the first circuit acted inappropriately when it invalidated state parental consen t statute in its entirety alt hough the state law at issue did not include health exception the court he ld that more narrow remedy was appropriate because only some aspects of the law raised constitutional concerns the court returned the case to the court of appeals with instructions to craft narrower remedy the respondents assert that the act should be enjoined in its entirety citing ayotte they discuss the three interrelated principles identified by justice oconnor in that case that inform the courts approach to remedies47 first the court should not nullify more of statute than is n ecessary second the court must be mindful that its constitutional mandate and institutional competence are limited finally the court cannot use its remedial powers to ci rcumvent the intent of the legislature with regard to this third principle justice oconnor noted after finding an application or portion of statute unconstitutional we must next ask would the legislature have preferred what is left of its stat ute to statute at all48 if the court determines that the pbab is unconstitutional because of its failure to include health exception the responde nts contend that remedy that somehow adds health exception to th act would be inappropriate49 they argue that because congress expressly rejected even narrow health exception when it passed the act the court would engage in the kind of linedrawing it rejected in ayotte if it permitted such remedy similarly if the court determines that the act is unconstitutional because it is vague or overbroad the respondents ar gue that it would be impermissible to engraft either narrower definition for the term partialbirth abortion or clearerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33778crs10 50 see brief for respondent at 49 planned parenthood 051382 51 id at 50 52 see transcript of oral argument gonzales v carhart 05380

httpwwwsupremecourtusgovoral_argumentsargument_transcripts05 1382pdf in an exchange with the solicitor ge neral justice kennedy stated that the dx procedure could be warranted in some situations in response to the solicitor generals assertion that prohibiting the dx procedure would pose little risk to womans health because the standard procedure has been welltested and works every single time as way to terminate the pregnancyjustice kennedy maintained but there is risk if the uterine wall is compromised by cancer or some forms of preeclampsia and its very thin theres risk of being punctureddistinction between par tialbirth abortion and standard abortion50 acknowledging the courts dispositi on of the nebraska statute in stenberg the respondents contend that the federal law should be simila rly invalidated in toto according to the respondents because th act implicates many if not all abortions it unduly burdens large fraction of affected women and must be facially invalidated planne d parenthood also contends that any attempt to establish distinction between partialbirth bortion and abortion would merely propagate the substantive problems with the act that lead to the need for remedy in the first place in other words it would be cure at all51 conclusion the courts consideration of carhart and planned parenthood has garnered widespread interest not just because of the possible invalidation of the pbaba justice oconnors retirement in early 2006 and the appointment of two new seemingly conservative justices have prompt ed many to believe that the court may use this opportunity to establish new standa rds with regard to the evaluation of all laws that regulate abortion for exampl the court may explore whether health exception is always needed in an abortionrelated statute the court may also clarify whether the term health should continue to be broadly understood to include not only physical but mental and emotional health considerable attention has focused on justice kennedy because of justice oconnors retirement his dissent in stenberg and his position as swing vote on the court while justice kennedy has been protective of the courts role in defining the scope of constitutional rights his suppor t for the nebraska pa rtialbirth abortion statute has been noted during the oral arguments in carhart and planned parenthood before the court on november 6 2006 justice kennedys questions and comments suggested arguably that he may have some skepticism about the act52 justices scalia and thomas both part of the dissent in stenberg are widely expected to support the validity of the pbaba if they were joined by the courts newest justices chief justice roberts and justice alito as we ll as justice kennedy the act would be upheld
