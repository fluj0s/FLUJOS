federal criminal justice system for convictions after november 1 1987 like parole supervised release is term of restricted freedom following an offenders release from prison the nature of supervision and the conditions imposed during supervised release are also similar to those that applied in the old system of parole however whereas parole functions in lieu of remaining prison term supervised release begins only after an offender has completed his full prison sentence sentencing court determines the duration and conditions for an offenders supervised release term at the time of initial sentencing in most cases federal law limits the maximum duration to five years although it permits and in some cases mandates longer durations for relatively serious drug sex and terrorismrelated offenses sentencing court retains jurisdiction to modify the terms of an offenders supervised release and to revoke the term and return an offender to prison for violation of the conditions several conditions are standard features for supervised release some conditions such as ban on the commission of further crimes are mandatory other conditions such as an obligation to report to probation officer have become standard by practice and by the operation of the federal sentencing guidelines which courts must consider along with other statutorily designated considerations together with these regularlyimposed conditions the federal sentencing guidelines recommend additional conditions appropriate for specific circumstances courts also have the discretion to impose any other conditions as long as they involve greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary and reasonably relate to at least one of the following the nature of the offense the defendants crimerelated history deterrence of crime protection of the public or the defendants rehabilitation in addition to the statutory reasonably relate requirement both defendants constitutional rights and federalism concerns create outer limits for the application and scope of supervised release conditions by nature such conditions restrict releasees freedom and some conditions involve systems such as child support orders ordinarily governed by the states nonetheless federal courts have upheld wide range of such conditions against constitutional challenges

release is the successor to parole in the federal criminal justice system in 1984 congress eliminated parole to create more determinate federal sentencing structure2 in its place congress instituted system of supervised release which applies to all federal crimes committed after november 1 19873 like parole supervised release is period of supervision following release from prison however an importa nt difference distinguishes the two systems whereas parole stands in lieu of portion of an offenders original prison term supervised release begins only after full service of prison term4 thus supervised release does not operate to reduce the duration of imprisonment instead sentencing courts determine terms and conditions of supervised release at the same time they determine other components of federal offenders sentence and the duration as well as the conditions of supervised release are components of sentence 5 sentencing courts have broad discretion when determining the duration and imposing the conditions for supervised release6 in addition except in specified drug and domestic violence cases courts may technically exercise discretion to decline supervised release altogether for particular defendant however the federal sentencing guidelines promulgated by the united states sentencing commission recommend that sent encing courts impose term of supervised release in most federal felony cases 7 as rule courts impose supervised release only in conjunction with prison sentences however former bush administration officials case made news when his lawyers agreed to supervised release despite president george w bushs commutation of his prison sentence8 1 two reports on this topic were originally prepared by charles doyle senior specialist american law division 2 comprehensive crime control act of 1984 pl 98473 title ii 98 stat 1976 see 154 cong rec h7237 daily ed july 29 2008 statement of sen king referring to the 1984 laws unquestioned success and stating that determinate sentencing makes incarceration terms more meaningful and ensures that offenders actually serve most of their sentences 3 parole continues to apply to the small number of remain ing federal offenders serving sentences for crimes committed prior to november 1 1987 it also applies to offenders convicted for pre2000 violations of the district of columbias criminal code although congress officially repealed the parole provisions including those authorizing the parole commissions activities in the 1984 act congress has several times extended the life of the federal parole commission to address these remaining offenders most recently the 110 th congress extended the life of the parole commission to october 31 2011 pl 110312 in administering parole the parole commission follows federal policy guidelines which are the precursors to the policies contained in the sentencing guidelines promulgated by the united states sentencing commission 28 cfr 220 ussg 5d 4 see ussg pta2b unlike parole term of supervised release does not replace portion of the sentence of imprisonment but rather is an order of supervision in addition to any term of imprisonment imposed by the

guidelines suggests that court should decline to impose supervised releas only if it determines that supervised release is neither required by statute nor required for any of the following reasons 1 to protect the public welfare 2 to enforce financial condition 3 to provide drug or alcohol treatment or testing 4 to assist the reintegration of the defendant into the community or 5 to accomplish

regardless of when he should have been released9 although court may sentence an offender to several terms of supervised release for each of several crimes the terms are served concurrently rather than consecutively10 this rule applies even where criminal statutes require an offender to serve the multiple terms of imprisonment consecutively11 g6g158g155g138g157g146g152g151g561 supervised release term lengths generally correspond to the severity of the crime for which the sentence is imposed thus longer imprisonment generally corresponds with longer term of supervised release special rules govern term lengths for terrorismrelated crimes drug offenses kidnapping and some sex offenses for other crimes maximum durations range from less than year to not more than five years specifically federal statute limits such terms to 1 five years for class or class b felonies such as firstdegree murder 2 three years for class c or class d felonies such as bank robbery and 3 one year for all other crimes 12 within the maximum and minimum limits set by statute courts typically have significant discretion over the length of supervised release in special cases particularly those involving drug offenses terrorismrelated crimes kidnapping and some sex offenses federal statute allows and sometimes mandates supervised release terms that exceed the typical one to fiveyear maximums for example several federal controlled substance statutes establish mandatory minimum rather than maximum durations for supervised release terms in cases involving relatively large quantities of the most dangerous controlled substances for instance kilogram or more of heroin courts must sentence defendants to term of supervised release of at least five years after an initial conviction or ten years upon subsequent conviction13 mandatory minimums also apply but are lower when smaller quantities for instance 100 to 1000 grams of heroin or less dangerous controlled substances are involved14 these minimum statutory terms double treble for recidivists in cases involving aggravating circumstances aggravatin g circumstances include among other things 9 18 usc 3624e united states v johnson 529 us 53 54 2000 holding that prisoners term of supervised release could not be reduced by the two and half years during which he inadvertently remained incarcerated after the expiration of his lawful prison term 10 the term of supervised release commences on the day the person is released from imprisonment and runs concurrently with any federal state or local term of probation or supervised release or parole for another offense to which the person is subject or becomes subject during the term of supervised release term of supervised release does not run during any period in which the person is imprisoned in connection with conviction for federal state or local crime unless the imprisonment is for period of less than 30 consecutive days 18 usc 3624e united states v hernandezguevara

guidelines in offense classification 292 f3d 115 11819 2d cir 2002 13 21 usc 841b1a 960b1 at one time it was thought that these mandatory minimum terms of supervised release in drug cases might be subject to the 531 year maximums delineated in 18 usc 3583 see eg united states v kelly 974 f2d 22 25 5th cir 1992 united states v good 25 f3d 218 222 4th cir 1994 however statute now makes clear that

an individual under the age of 18 and distribution to pregnant woman15 similar reversal of maximum to minimum term duration applies to supervised release in the context of specified federal kidnaping and sex offenses for those crimes the authorized term of supervised release is any term of at least five years and may extend to life16 for terrorismrelated offenses the statutory rules essentially eliminate any minimum or maximum length for supervised release terms instead permitting courts to determine the appropriate duration specifically the usa patriot act and the usa patriot improvement and reauthorization act authorize supervised release terms of any number of years or life for specified crimes associated with acts of terrorism17 g5g152g151g141g146g157g146g152g151g156g561 conditions for supervised release are determined during federal offenders initial sentencing based on the nature of the offense the defendants particular history and other factors when determining applicable conditions courts consider both federal statute and federal sentencing guidelines following 2005 supreme court case booker v united states courts may depart from the sentencing guidelines if grounds for departure exist 18 courts also exercise independent judgment in each individual case courts must impose small set of mandatory conditions any time they order supervised release other conditions enumerated in statute or by the sentencing guidelines are discretionary although some discretionary conditions have become standard practice over time in addition to specifically listed conditions courts may impose almost any other condition as long as the condition satisfies several parameters and is constitutionally permissible courts may delegate some decisions regarding specific conditions to probation officers to determine during the course of an offenders supervised release term19 however such delegations must be relatively minor courts cannot delegate key decisionmaking obligations for example although court may assign probation officer discretion to determine the specifics of condition imposing treatment the order for supervised release may not delegate the determination of whether such treatment is necessary20 likewise courts rather than probation officers must decide broad parameters for the number of drug tests necessary for particular defendant21 15 21 usc 849 21 usc 861a 21 usc 861f 16 18 usc 3583k the offenses covered by section 3583k include kidnaping sex trafficing producing child pronography sexual exploitation of children aggravated sexual abuse and related offenses 17 18 usc 3583j this subs ection applies to long list of activities that endanger national security such as hostage taking attempting to murder government officials and unlawful use of biological weapons see 18 usc 2332bg5b 18 543 us 220 24546 2005 holding that courts must consider federal sentencing guidelines when sentencing federal offenders but that the guidelines do not ultimately bind courts decision 19 probation is similar to supervised release in that it is term during which an offender lives outside of prison but is subject to various conditions however probation typically applies in lieu of prison sentence whereas supervised release typically applies after an offender has served prison term despite the differences probation officers are the officials responsible for monitoring offenders activity in both systems 20 see united states v nash 438 f3d 1302 1305306 11th cir 2006 united states v pruden 398 f3d 241 250 3d continued

conditions that apply only in cases involving domestic violence or sex offenses all supervised release orders require offenders to 1 refrain from criminal activity 2 cooperate with authorized collection of dna samples and 3 submit to periodic drug tests22 in addition prior to release all prisoners must agree to adhere to the payment schedule for any unpaid fine imposed however federal statute does not specify that such agreements will be enforced as conditions of supervised release after the agreement is made 23 to fill this gap federal sentencing guidelines suggest that courts require adherence to such agreements as conditions of supervised release24 additional mandatory conditions apply to domestic violence and sex offenses specifically first time domestic violence offenders must attend an approved rehabilitation program if one is located within 50 miles of their residence and convicted sex offenders must register their addresses with relevant authorities if the federal sex offender registry requirements apply25 g6g146g156g140g155g142g157g146g152g151g138g155g162g561g5g152g151g141g146g157g146g152g151g156g561 courts have relatively broad discretion to impose supervised release conditions that supplement the mandatory conditions for particular defendant court may impose any discretionary condition that 1 is reasonably related to specified factors 2 involves greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary and 3 is consistent with policy statements issued by the us sentencing commission 26 continued cir 2005 21 the permissible scope of probation officer discretion relating to the mandatory drug testing condition has been the subject of considerable litigation for example the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit has heard multiple appeals addressing this issue see united states v stephens 424 f3d 876 9th cir 2005 striking down the sentencing courts delegation to the probation officer of the authority to determine of the number of additional nontreatment drug tests to which the defendant was required to submit united states v garcia 522 f3d 855 9 th cir 2008 distinguishing stevens where probation officer had

1 the nature and circumstances of the offense and the defendants history and character 2 deterrence of crime 3 protection of the public and 4 the defendants rehabilitation27 although the statutory language repeats the conjunction and between factors and thus appears on its face to require that particular condition relate to all rather than just one of these factors courts have generally interpreted the statute such that reasonable relationship to any one factor is sufficient to justify discretionary condition 28 as long as these prerequisites are satisfied for each condition court may impose any of twenty discretionary conditions listed in statute any conditions recommended by the sentencing guidelines or any other condition it considers to be appropriate for particular offender29 nineteen of the twenty statutorilyenumerated discretionary conditions are borrowed from the list of permissible conditions for probation 30 the twentieth condition authorizes deportation of defendants who are foreign nationals31 federal sentencing guidelines quote some of the statutorily identified discretionary conditions suggest expanded versions of others and pro pose additional considerations in still other situations32 they divide the discretionary conditions into three groupsstandard conditions which courts impose as matter of practice in most cases special conditions that may be applied to particular kinds of cases and additional conditions such as community confinement curfews and occupational restrictions 27 id incorporating by reference 18 usc 3553a1 a2b a2c and a2d

of any change in address or employment37 remain in the district unless the court or probation officer approves leaving38 and notify his probation officer if the defendant is arrested or questioned by

felony convictions 49 likewise when conviction is for sex or child pornography offense or defendant has history of sexual misconduct court might mandate sexoffender treatment limit computer use or

activities they include community confinement 54 home detention55 community service56 curfew 57 and restrictions on defendants occupation58 perhaps because many additional conditions restrict defendants freedom of movement commentary accompanying these additional conditions in the federal sentencing guidelines shows special caution that such restrictions not become excessive for example the commentary advises that community confinement generally should not be imposed for period in excess of six months although longer period may be imposed to accomplish the objectives of specific rehabilitative program such as drug rehabilitation59 likewise it limits community service conditions to more than 400 hours60 continued holding that the district court had reasonably believed that

frame for restrictions on defendants occupation advising that such restrictions last only for the minimum time and to the minimum extent necessary to protect the public61 the guidelines also limit occupational restrictions to the narrow set of circumstances where both 1 reasonably direct relationship existed between the defendants occupation business or profession and the conduct relevant to the offense of conviction and 2 imposition of such restriction is reasonably necessary to protect the public because there is reason to believe that absent such restriction the defendant will continue to engage in unlawful conduct 62 g515g3g151g162g561g17g157g145g142g155g561g5g152g151g141g146g157g146g152g151g516g561 finally court may impose any other condition that it considers to be appropriate provided that the condition meets the same statutory prerequisites which apply to all discretionary conditions 63 courts occasionally exercise this discretion to impose unique conditions upon defendants supervised release for example in united states v gementera the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit upheld condition requiring defendant to stand outside post office for one day wearing or carrying sign declaring i stole mail this is my punishment64 in that case the defendant argued that the condition failed to satisfy the statutory requirements because its only purpose was humiliation65 the court rejected this argument66 emphasizing sentencing courts wide discretion to impose conditions the court held that the sentencing court had not abused its discretion in finding that the condition was reasonably related to deterrence and rehabilitation factors and that it did not restrict the defendants liberty more than was reasonably necessary67 in other circumstances courts use their discretionary authority to impose conditions in areas other than the one for which the sentencing gu idelines recommend it for example in united states v goodson district court had imposed condition authorizing warrantless searches of the defendants place of business in case in which defendant pled guilty of wire fraud and making and uttering counterfeit checks condition that the sentencing guidelines recommend for child pornography cases but do not specifically mention for financial crimes68

successfully argued that condition imposed on supervised release is invalid because it is not reasonably related to the offense in question for example in united states v ferguson the us court of

court of appeals for the second circuit invalidated supervised release condition requiring defendant to repay his personal debts where the defendant had been convicted of illegal transfer of false immigration documents70 likewise in case involving wire fraud the us court of appeals for the eighth circuit struck down conditions requiring defendant to abstain from alcohol and submit to unannounced warrantless searches71 in all three examples courts emphasized that sentencing court has wide discretion72 and typically may impose condition if it is reasonably related to any one or more of the specified factors73 however they concluded that the imposed condition did not bear sufficiently reasonable relationship to the particular offense at issue the defendants history or any other statutory factors74 on the other hand many courts have upheld conditions based solely on defendants history even in the absence of any nexus to the particular offense at issue for example courts have upheld the imposition of special conditions targeted to sex offenders based on defendants prior sex offenses in cases where the crime of conviction was for bank robbery narcotics or other offenses unrelated to sex75 numerous courts have likewise upheld drug or mental health treatment conditions justified solely by defendants previous history76 however courts have occasionally invalidated such conditions in cases where the need for the treatment or other condition appears to have disappeared or grown stale 77 the federal courts have developed unique rules governing the reasonable relationship analysis in few categories of conditions for instance although the federal sentencing guidelines 69 369 f3d 847 85254 5th cir 2004 70 58 f3d 43 467 2d cir 1995 71 united states v

factors prendergast at 1293 the district court failed to explain any relationship between the wire fraud offense and the supervised release provision permitting warran tless searches for drugs or controlled substances we see reasonable relationship and are of the view that the district court abused its discretion in imposing these special conditions of supervised release 75 see eg united

courts will not typically uphold such conditions unless they directly relate to the offense of conviction78 conversely courts appear to permit restrictions of alcohol use justified by only relatively small connections to the particular defendant or offense79 furthermore although the federal sentencing guidelines specifically permit court to prohibit the excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages as condition of supervised release conditions demanding total abstention are apparently common there may be some question however whether ban on alcoholic consumption may be imposed as condition of supervised release where there is connection with either the offense at issue or the defendants particular history 80

persons freedom and may intrude upon persons privacy supervised release conditions occasionally implicate defendants constitutional rights for instance conditions might implicate the fourth amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures the first amendment right to free speech and free association or the fifth amendment right against selfincrimination however although the supreme court has made clear that conviction does not eliminate an individuals constitutional rights it has also emphasized that by virtue of their status alone probationers and others along the continuum of

includes as condition of defendants supervised release the warrantless search of his person or property the fourth amendment to the us constitution guarantees right against unreasonable searches and seizures82 to be reasonable under the fourth amendment the governments search that is its intrusion into persons reasonable expectation of privacy must typically have the support of judiciallyissued warrant or valid exception to the warrant requirement and probable cause to believe that evidence of criminal activity will be found 83 however in cases involving people serving criminal sentences the supreme court has instead employed general balancing test in which it assesses on the one hand the degree to which the government action intrudes upon an individuals privacy and on the other the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate interests84 because people on supervised release like others along the continuum of punishment have reduced expectation of privacy under the courts fourth amendment jurisprudence their privacy interests are disfavored in this balancing test85 perhaps in part for this reason courts have generally upheld such conditions as long as they are reasonably related to the defendants crime history or rehabilitation86 however whether individual searches conducted pursuant to such condition pass muster under the fourth amendment may depend upon the facts in particular case other supervised release conditions might implicate releasees first amendment rights to free speech or free association for example condition restricting defendants contact with felons may implicate defendants first amendment associational rights however courts have generally upheld such conditions against first amendment challenges for example courts have upheld conditions restricting defendants associations with people convicted of related misdemeanors the defendants associational rights notwithstanding87 in addition courts have upheld associational restrictions couched in geographical terms for instance at least one court has upheld condition banning defendant from the scene of her past criminal activities88 likewise where the defendant has history of exce ssive gambling courts have upheld conditions that prohibit him from gambling or entering gambling establishments89 similarly in the free speech context courts have upheld conditions restricting defendants possession of sexually explicit material even if the material is legal 90 however they have occasionally invalidated such conditions if restrictions on access to material are drawn too broadly91 82 us const amend iv 83 atwater v city of lago vista 532 us 318 354 2001 84 samson 547 us at 848 citing united states v knights 534 us 112 11819 2001 85 see samson 547 us 843

that order state to act94 in other words unless the federal government has acted pursuant to constitutional authority in particular area it cannot require states to act in that area95 for example because the federal government has not asserted regulatory power over state drivers licenses federal courts are constitutionally barred from unilaterally ordering suspensions of defendants state drivers licenses96 likewise although sentencing court may condition defendants supervised release on his compliance with the terms of state childsupport order97 it may not impose more demanding payment schedule than the state order requires98 however these concerns do not limit courts ability to condition supervised release upon compliance with state laws for example court may require that defendant comply with state notification provisions even when those requirements are not otherwise applicable 99

illegality of the original conditions110 occasionally court has an obligation rather than the discretion to modify the terms or conditions of supervised release specifically court must revoke
