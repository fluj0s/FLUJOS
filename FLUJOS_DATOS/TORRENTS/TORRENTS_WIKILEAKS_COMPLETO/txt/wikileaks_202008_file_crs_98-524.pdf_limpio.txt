be made separately conviction on any one of the articles f impeachme nt brought against an individual subject to impeachment is sufficient t constitute conviction in the impeachment trial should conviction occur judgment i s limited to either removal from office or removal and prohibition from holding futur offices of public trust under the united states the precedents in impeachment suggest that remova l may flow automatically from conviction in an impeachment trial but tha t the senate must vote to proh ibit the individual from holding future offices of public trust if that judgmen t is also deemed appropriate in given case conviction on impeachment does not foreclose the possibility of criminal prosecution arising out of the same factual situation in light of the language in the former presidents act one consequence of removal of presid ent from office as result of conviction in an impeachment trial would b that the individual involved would longer fit within the definition of forme rhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98524crs3 it may be noted that resignation before impeachment proceedings are initiated r2 completed may lead the house of representatives or the house and the senate to decide not t pursue impeachment proceedings see eg hres 803 impeachment of richard m nixon presi dent of the united states report of the committee on the judiciary of the house f representatives hrept 1305 93 cong 2d sess 1974 in which the house committee onrd the judiciary filed its report on its impeachment inquiry with respect to president richard m nixon with the full house including resolution impeaching president nixon and setting fort h articles of impeachment against him because president nixon resigned from office the hous did not vote on the resolution and took further action with respect to impeachment of th former president see als the impeachment of george w english district judge for the united states district court for the eastern district of illinois 192526 there the house impeache d and voted articles against judge english and the house managers appeared before the senate to advise the senate of the house action and to begin the process which would lead to senate trial judge english resigned si x days before the scheduled start of the senate trial on his impeachment the house managers recommended to the house that the impeachment proceedings b discontinu ed while stating that the resignation did not affect the senates authority to try th matter the house voted to accept the managers recommendation 68 cong rec 297 1926 discussed in committee print entitled constitutional grounds for presidential impeachment report by the staff of the impeachment inquiry committee on the judiciary house f representatives 93 cong 2d sess 5254 feb 1974 the senate having been advised by therd house managers that t he house wished to discontinue the proceedings in light of judge englishs resignation passed resolution dismissing the impeachment proceedings 68 cong rec 344 348 1926 on the other hand in 1876 secretary of war belknap resigned from office just before the adoption of impeachment articles against him by the house of representatives the senate after having given exhaustive consideration to the arguments of the house managers and counsel fo r the respondent concluded that the former secretary of war was amenable to trial b impeachment for acts done in that office despite his resignation from office before he wa s impeached belknaps demurrer to the replication of the house on the ground that the senat lacked jurisdiction to go forward with the impeachment was therefore overruled iii hinds preced ents of the house of representatives 2007 at 321 it may be noted that belknap wa s acquitted of the charges brought against him in the articles of impeachment those voting in favor of conviction falling short of the requisite twothirds of those members present this acquitta l seems to have reflected in part residual level of concern on the part of some of the senator s as to the wi sdom of trying an impeachment of person longer in office two of the 37 voting guilty and 22 of the 25 voting not guilty stated that they believed the senate lacke d jurisdiction in the case iii hinds preced ents of the house of representatives 2467 at 94546president for purposes of the act he would therefore not be eligible to receive th benefits avai lable under the acts provisions it would seem to follow that his spouse or widow would also be ineligible to receive those benefits available under the act to th spouse or widow of former president because of the way in which forme r president is defined in subsection f of the act it would appear also that if president were to be th subject of an impeachment trial but not convicted on any article f impeachment and therefore not removed from office he would remain within th definition of former president for purposes of the act further if president resigned from office before impeachment proceedings were initiated or during an impeachmen t proceeding but before conviction on any article he would not have been removed from office pursuant to the impeachment process and the refore he would still seem to fit within the definition of former president under the act 2
