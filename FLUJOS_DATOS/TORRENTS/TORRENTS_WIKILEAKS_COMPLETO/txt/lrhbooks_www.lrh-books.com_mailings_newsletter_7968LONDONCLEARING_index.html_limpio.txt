bridge enewsletter lrhs congress lectures date the identity of the thetan thetans begin to believe they have identity of their own they dont think they can be spotted they hope thats their well saving grace they say well i cannot be identified as thetan i cannot be identified but as body i can be identified and if i adopt other identities why then i will have an identity because i have identity of my own actually people have simply invalidated him as thetan to point where he believes he has identity unless he adopts something to give him identity and what are we back to now were back to the first basicbasic rock excerpted from the london clearing congress lectures the rock the first basicbasic an article by l ron hubbard from the london clearing congress lectures now this thing called the rock has been known to be found in cases its habitat its habitat is in the genus preclearus it is usually the thing that makes the preclears bank more solid now its called the rock not because it is rock in every case but simply because its called the rock and thats all the information i can give you on it because i think thats all that is known concerning the genus of its name its simply the rock not even that its hard to carry around because youre seldom aware of it but where it came from and why it came and what it is and what it does is unfortunately the concern of all of us back in dianetics which we have to study all over again if were going to go up the lines of the certificates and going to do good job of auditing we had thing called basicbasic you ever heard of basicbasic well after all these years we finally found what basicbasic was basicbasic is an object people used to please people an object basicbasic was simple geometric object they started to reach people with this object and the first time they ever tried to reach people with this object instead of themselves reaching people they began the formulation of what became reactive mind in other words its reachingness on via and that is rock fascinating thing fascinating thing if after all these ages this bit of residue this mockup is still around without you knowing about it id say you were awful clever youve got enough vias reaching into enough vias that form enough vias you see so that you dont know what the first or last via was on the subject and youve got this thing called rock now i dont say you have to have it you you you personally probably dont have one youre probably the exception i mustnt evaluate for you and here we have however this object mass of some sort or another mass to which people could communicate thinking they were communicating to you well it kept you from being reached and it kept you from reaching directly and the next thing you know you had all sorts of vias going and maybe it was lot of fun for while but after while you forgot you had it and then you wondered what all of these engrams and facsimiles were sticking to what were these mental image pictures sticking to what made the basis of them all and evidently that thing is this thing called the rock so what were describing really is basicbasic and were simply giving it new name because we know it better and that is it is this thing which person used to reach people and this thing which person expected other people to reach thinking they were reaching him its communication via is all it is but it happens to be solid object and it happens to be simple geometric form now we know by experience that everyone has reactive mind that we can tell pretty well if somebody didnt have reactive mind hes out hes out there doing things the like of which nobody else is doing hed be quite spectacular as human being or he wouldnt be here at all and it doesnt say then that everybody has reactive mind it just says those people we are interested in and those cases which are around do have reactive minds well if they have reactive minds theyve evidently got some kind of rock to hold it together because these reactive minds by our experience with thousands and thousands and thousands of cases are hung together on some basic idea or object and that basic idea or object is that thing which holds together the remaining facsimiles engrams chains secondaries locks machines and the rest of it which we know as the reactive mind in dianetics which freud knew as the subconscious mind l ron hubbard excerpted from the lecture the rock this lecture is available in the london clearing congress lectures success from listening to the congress lectures lrh is simply incredible he takes datum and holds it in front of your face he gets that you dont get it thats why he keeps holding it in front of your face suddenly your thinking does flipflop as the datum hits home and the staggering implications send you laughing out loud the beauty of these lectures is they get better and better as you continue they build one upon the other progressing forward in perfect gradient making them far more palatable than any other body of data ive been exposed to what an easy way to assimilate tech you sit down put the cd in and press play you have glossaries that hallmark the definition of thorough id be hardpressed to find reason not to listen to these lectures also they vastly improve my wins in session validating each and every one of them not only that but as i listen to the congresses daily i find myself cogniting much faster in session lrh says in hcob 7 june 1961 academy schedules clarification of now you will also find that if the student doesnt listen to at least fifty taped lectures of mine he wont know the mood or flavor of all this i stand behind this statement 100 kc now available in the following languages english danish dutch french german greek hebrew hungarian italian
