wikileaks document release httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34059 february 2 2009 congressional research service report rl34059 the carbon cycle implications for climate change and congress peter folger resources science and industry division updated march 13 2008 abstract if humans add only small amount of co2 to the atmosphere each year why is that contribution important to global climate change the answer is that the oceans vegetation and soils do not take up carbon released from human activities quickly enough to prevent co2 concentrations in the atmosphere from increasing humans tap the huge pool of fossil carbon for energy and aﬀect the global carbon cycle by transferring fossil carbon which took millions of years to accumulate underground into the atmosphere over relatively short time span as result the atmosphere contains approximately 35 more co2 today than prior to the beginning of the industrial revolution 380 ppm vs 280 ppm as the co2 concentration grows it increases the degree to which the atmosphere traps incoming radiation from the sun radiative forcing warming the

between the atmosphere and other storage pools including the oceans vegetation and soils on the land surface the exchange or flux of carbon among the atmosphere oceans and land surface is called the global carbon cycle comparatively human activities contribute relatively small amount of carbon primarily as carbon dioxide co 2 to the global carbon cycle despite the addition of relatively small amount of carbon to the atmosphere compared to natural fluxes from the oceans and land surface the human perturbation to the carbon cycle is increasingly recognized as main factor driving climate change over the past 50 years if humans add only small amount of co 2 to the atmosphere each year why is that contribution important to global climate change the answer is that the oceans vegetation and soils do not take up carbon released from human activities quickly enough to prevent co 2 concentrations in the atmosphere from increasing humans tap the huge pool of fossil carbon for energy and affect the global carbon cycle by transferring fossil carbonwhich took millions of years to accumulate undergroundinto the atmosphere over relatively short time span as result the atmosphere contains approximately 35 more co 2 today than prior to the beginning of the industrial revolution 380 ppm vs 280 ppm as the co 2 concentration grows it increases the degree to which the atmosphere traps incoming radiation from the sun radiative forcing warming the planet the increase in atmospheric co 2 concentration is mitigated to some extent by two huge reservoirs for carbonthe global oceans and the land surfacewhich currently take up more carbon than they release they are net sinks for carbon if the oceans vegetation and soils did not act as sinks then the concentration of co 2 in the atmosphere would increase even more rapidly key issue to consider is whether these two sinks will continue to store carbon at the same rate over the next few decades or whether their behavior will change currently most of the total global carbon sink is referred to as the unmanaged or background carbon cycle very little carbon is removed from the atmosphere and stored or sequestered by deliberate action congress is considering legislative strategies to reduce us emissions of co 2 andor increase the uptake of co 2 from the atmosphere congress may also opt to consider how land management practices such as afforestation conservation tillage and other techniques might increase the net flux of carbon from the atmosphere to the land surface how the ocean sink could be managed to store more carbon is unclear iron fertilization and deep ocean injection of co 2 are in an experimental stage and their promise for longterm enhancement of carbon uptake by the oceans is not well understood congress may consider incorporating what is known about the carbon cycle into its legislative strategies and may also evaluate whether the global carbon cycle is sufficiently well understood so that the consequences of longterm policies aimed at mitigating global climate change are fully appreciated

considering several legislative strategies that would reduce us emissions of greenhouse gasesprimarily carbon dioxide co 2andor increase uptake and storage of co 2 from the atmosphere both approaches are viewed by many observers as critical to forestalling global climate change caused in part by the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from human activities others point out that the human contribution of carbon to the atmosphere is small fraction of the total quantity of carbon that cycles naturally back and forth each year between the atmosphere and two huge carbon reservoirs the global oceans and the planets land surface question raised is whether the human fraction of the global carbon cyclethe exchange or flux of carbon between the atmosphere oceans and land surfaceis large enough to induce climate change and global warming despite the addition of relatively small amount of carbon to the atmosphere compared to natural fluxes from the oceans and land surface the human perturbation to the carbon cycle is increasingly recognized as main factor driving climate change over the past 50 years for most of human history the global carbon cycle has been roughly in balance and the concentration of co 2 in the atmosphere has been fairly constant at approximately 280 parts per million ppm human activities namely the burning of fossil fuels deforestation and other land use activities have significantly altered the carbon cycle as result atmospheric concentrations of co 2 have risen by over 35 since the industrial revolution and are now greater than 380 ppm1 an understanding of the global carbon cycle has shifted from being of mainly academic interest to being also of policy interest policy makers are grappling with for example how to design capandtrade system that accurately accounts for carbon sequestration by components of the land surface sink such as forests yet how much co 2 forests are capable of taking up in the future is largely scientific question more broadly capandtrade system that limits emissions and is designed to keep atmospheric co 2 below specific concentration would depend inherently on continued uptake of carbon by the oceans and land surface how those two carbon reservoirs will behave in the futurehow much co 2 they will take up or release and at what rateare also topics of active scientific inquiry2 thus the scientific understanding of the carbon cycle is integral to many aspects of the current congressional debate over how to mitigate climate change this report puts the human contribution of carbon to the atmosphere into the larger context of the global carbon cycle the report focuses almost entirely on co 2 which alone is responsible for over half of the change in earths radiation balance3 moreover

atmosphere oceans vegetation and soils on the land surface all store carbon see error reference source not found geological reservoirs also store carbon in the form of fossil fuels for example oil gas and coal 5 of these reservoirs or pools dissolved inorganic carbon in the ocean is the largest followed in size by fossil carbon in geological reservoirs and by the total amount of carbon contained in soils see error reference source not found and table 1 the atmosphere itself contains nearly 800 billion metric tons of carbon 800 gtc6 which is more carbon than all of the earths living vegetation contains7 carbon contained in the oceans vegetation and soils on the land surface is linked to the atmosphere through natural processes such as photosynthesis and respiration in contrast carbon in fossil fuels is linked to the atmosphere through the extraction and combustion of fossil fuels the atmosphere has fairly uniform concentration of co 2 although it shows minor variations by season about 1due to photosynthesis and respirationand by latitude8 carbon dioxide released from fossil fuel combustion mixes readily into the atmospheric carbon pool where it undergoes exchanges with the ocean and land surface carbon pools thus where fossil fuels are burned makes relatively little difference to the concentration of co 2 in the atmosphere emissions in any one region affect the concentration of co 2 everywhere else in the atmosphere9 the oceans vegetation and soils truly exchange carbon with the atmosphere constantly on daily and seasonal time cycles figure 1b in contrast carbon from fossil fuels is not exchanged with the atmosphere but is transferred in oneway direction from geologic storage at least within the time scale of human history10 some of the co 2 currently in the atmosphere may become fossil fuel someday after it is captured by vegetation buried under heat and pressure and converted into coal for example but the process takes millions of years how much of the fossil fuel carbon ends up in the atmosphere instead of the oceans vegetation and soils and over what time scale is driving much of the debate over what type of action to take to ameliorate global warming continued report 42007 ipcc working group i report summary for policymakers 5 carbon in the earths crust is mainly in the form of carbonates and is linked to the atmosphere by natural processes such as erosion and weathering and by metamorphism over geologic time scales in contrast the key source of fossil carbon for the purposes of this report are fossil fuels which are now linked to the atmosphere almost entirely via human activities 6 one metric ton of carbon is equiva lent to 367 metric tons of co 2 metric ton or tonne is 22046 pounds one billion metric tons of carbon is one

larger fluctuations by season occur in the northern hemisphere 9 concentrations of co 2 are slightly higher in the northern hemisphere compared to the southern hemisphere by several parts per million because most of the emissions of co 2 from human activities are in the north 10an exception to this is the concept of carbon capture and sequestration whereby the geologic time scale cycle of carbon storage is short circuited by capturing co 2 at its sourcea fossilfueled electricity generating plant for exampleand injecting it underground into geologic reservoirs

poolespecially the atmospheric poolis important in global warming because as more co 2 is added to the atmosphere its heattrapping capacity becomes greater11 each storage pooloceans soils and vegetationis considered sink for carbon because each pool takes up carbon from the atmosphere conversely each storage pool is also source of carbon for the atmosphere because of the constant exchange or flux between the atmosphere and the storage pools for example vegetation in the northern hemisphere is sink for atmospheric carbon during the spring and summer months due to the process of photosynthesis in the fall and winter it is source for atmospheric carbon because the process of respiration returns carbon to the atmosphere from the vegetation pool the pool of fossil carbon is only source not sink except over geologic time scales as described above how much carbon is transferred between the atmosphere and the sources and sinks is topic of scientific scrutiny because the mechanisms are still not understood completely whether storage pool will be net sink or net source for carbon in the future depends very much on the balance of mechanisms that drives its behavior and how those mechanisms may change 12 11see crs report rl33849 climate change science and policy implications by jane leggett for an explanation of the heattrapping properties or radiative forcing of co

exchanges fluxes between the atmosphere and the other storage pools or stocks of carbon over 90 gtc is exchanged eac h year between the atmosphere and the oceans and close to 60 gtc is exchanged between the atmosphere and the land surface annually see table 1 13 human activitiesprimarily landuse change and fossil fuel combustioncontribute slightly less than 9 gtc to the atmosphere each year14 if the human contribution of co 2 is removed from the global carbon cycle then the average net flux the amount of co 2 released to the atmosphere versus the amount taken up by the oceans soils and vegetationis close to zero most scientists conclude that for 10000 years prior to 1750 the net flux was less than 01 gtc per year when averaged over decades15 that small value for net flux is reflected by the relatively stable concentration of co 2 in the atmospherebetween 260 and 280 ppmfor the 10000 years prior to 175016 currently the atmospheric concentration of co 2 is approximately 100 ppm higher than it was before 1750 because human activities are adding carbon to the atmosphere faster than the oceans land vegetation and soils remove it the relatively rapid addition of co 2 to the atmosphere has tipped the balance so that the oceans and the land surface take up more co 2 per year on average than they release yet atmospheric concentrations of co 2 continue to rise see table 1 why is that occurring the short answer is timing co 2 from fossil fuel combustion and land use changes is being released to the atmosphere faster than the oceans vegetation and soil can take it up so co 2 is accumulating in the atmosphere about 45 of the co 2 released from fossil fuel combustion and land use activities during the 1990s has remained in the atmosphere while the remainder has been taken up by the oceans vegetation or soils on the land surface17 carbon dioxide is nonreactive18 in the atmosphere and has relatively long residence time although eventually most of it will return to the ocean and land sinks about 50 of single pulse of co 2 will be removed within 30 years further 30 removed in within few centuries and the remaining 20 may persist in the atmosphere for thousands of years19 if co 2 emissions continue or grow however atmospheric concentrations of co 2 will likely also continue to increase with serious implications for future climate change 13these massive exchanges of co 2 between the atmosphere oceans and land surface result mostly from natural processes such as photosynthesis respiration decay and gas exchange between the ocean surface and the lower atmosphere 14about 80 of humanrelated co 2 emissions results from fossil fuel combustion and 20 from land use change primarily deforestation fossil fuel burning and industrial activities release

degree to which the atmosphere traps incoming radiation from the sun warming the planet at present the oceans and land surface are acting as sinks for co 2 emitted from fossil fuel combustion and deforestation but as they accumulate more carbon the capacity of the sinksand the rate at which they accumulate carbonmay change it is also likely that climate change itself eg higher temperatures more intense hydrologic cycle may alter the balance between sources and sinks due to changes in the complicated feedba ck mechanisms between the atmosphere oceans and land surface 20 how carbon sinks will behave in the future is prominent question for both scientists and policy makers g14g138g151g141g561g21g158g155g143g138g140g142g556g3g157g150g152g156g153g145g142g155g142g561g8g149g158g161g561 most estimates of the carbon cycle indicate that the land surface vegetation plus soils accumulates more carbon per year than it emits to the atmosphere 21 see figure 1b and table 1 the land surface thus acts as net sink for co 2 at present some policy makers advocate strategies for increasing the amount of co 2 taken up and stored or sequestered by soils and plants typically through land use changes such as agricultural or forestry practices22 how effective those strategies are likely to be depends in part on how the carbon cycle behaves in the future particularly the landatmosphere flux how the landatmosphere flux may change and how land use practices will change in the future is not clear the land use change component has the largest uncertainty of any component in the overall carbon cycle23 most scientists agree however that in the past two decades tropical deforestation has been responsible for the largest share of co 2 released to the atmosphere from land use changes24 tropical deforestation and other land use changes released approximately 16 gtc per year to the atmosphere in the 1990s and may be contributing similar amounts of carbon to the atmosphere today 25 even though deforestation releases more carbon than is captured by forest regrowth within some regions net forest regrow th in other regions takes up sufficient carbon so the land surface acts as global net sink of approximately 1 gtc per year by some estimates even tropical lands despite widespread defore station may be carbonneutral or even net carbon sinks tropical systems take up substantial carbon to offset what is lost through deforestation and fire 26 what used to be known as the missing sink component in the overall global carbon cycle is now understood to be that part of the terrestrial ecosystem responsible for the net uptake of 20see crs report rl33849 climate change science and policy implications by jane leggett for more information on climate feedback mechanisms

or boreal forests27 scientists now prefer the term residual land sink to missing sink as it portrays the residual or left overpart of the global carbon cycle calculation once the other components are accounted for fossil fuel emissions landuse emissions atmospheric increase and ocean uptake28 precisely which mechanisms are responsible for the residual land sink is topic of scientific inquiry one mechanism postulated for many years has been the fertilizing effect of increased atmospheric co 2 concentrations on plant growth most models predict enhanced growth and carbon sequestration by plants in response to rising co 2 levels however results of experiments have been mixed many experiments show enhanced growth from increased co 2 concentrationsat least initiallybut nutrient and water availability and other limitations to growth are common longterm observations of bi omass change and growth rates suggest that fertilization effects are too small to account for the residual land sink at least in the united states29 in north america particularly the united states the landatmosphere flux is strongly tilted towards the land with approximately 05 gtc per year accumulating in terrestrial sinks30 that amount constitutes large fractionpossibly 40of the global terrestrial carbon sink31 according to some estimates approximately half of the north american terrestrial carbon sink stems from regrowth of forests on abandoned us farmland32 woody encroachmentthe increase in woody biomass occurring mainly on former grazing landsis thought to be another potentially large terrestrial sink possibly accounting for more than 20 of the net north american sink although the actual number is highly uncertain33 wood products eg furniture house frames etc wetlands and other smaller poorly understood carbon sinks are responsible for accumulating the remaining carbon in north america most of the north american terrestrial carbon sink such as the forest regrowth component is sometimes referred to as the unmanaged or background carbon cycle very little carbon is sequestered by deliberate action34 the future behavior of the unmanaged terrestrial carbon sink is another consideration for lawmakers whether the united states will continue its trajectory as major terrestrial carbon sink is highly uncertain and little evidence suggests that the terrestrial ecosystem sinks will increase in the futu re some current sinks may even become sources for carbon 35 27 however recent study indicates that the northern latitude forests take up less carbon than previously

land surface the oceans today accumulate more carbon than they emit to the atmosphere each year acting as net sink for about 17 gtc per year see figure 1b and table 1 if the land surface and oceans were not acting as net sinks the co 2 concentration in the atmosphere would be increasing at faster rate than observed more than the land surface the oceans have huge capacity to store carbon ultimately the oceans could store more than 90 of all the carbon released to the atmosphere by human activities but the process takes thousands of years 37 policy makers may be more concerned about co 2 accumulating in the oceans now its impact on ocean chemistry and marine life eg ocean acidification and its behavior as net sink over the next few decades carbon dioxide enters the oceans by dissolving into seawater at the ocean surface at rate controlled by the difference in co 2 concentration between the atmosphere and the sea surface38 because the surface waters39 of the ocean have relatively small volumeand thus limited capacity to store co 2how much co 2 is stored in the oceans over the time scale of decades depends on ocean mixing and the transport of co 2 from the surface to intermediate and deep waters mixing between surface waters and deeper portions of the ocean is sluggish process for example the oldest ocean water in the worldfound in the north pacifichas not flowed to the ocean surface for about 1000 years40 thus the slow rate of ocean mixing and slow transport of co 2 from the surface to the ocean depths is of possible concern to policymakers because it influences the effectiveness of the ocean sink for co 2 and because co 2 added to the surface waters of the ocean increases its acidity in addition to the vertical mixing of the ocea n largescale circulation of the oceans around the globe is critical component for determining the effectiveness of the ocean sink41 surface waters carrying anthropogenic co 2 descend into the ocean depths

simulations suggest that the southern ocean around antarctica accounts for nearly half of the net airsea flux of anthropogenic carbon43 from that region large portion of dissolved co 2 is transported north towards the subtropics despite its importance as co 2 sink the southern ocean is poorly understood and at least one study suggests that its capacity for absorbing carbon may be weakening44 as co 2 is added to the surface of the ocean from the atmosphere it increases the acidity of the sea surface waters with possible impacts to the biological production of organisms such as corals corals and calcifying phytoplankton and zooplankton are susceptible to increased acidity as their ability to make shells in the water column is inhibited or possibly reversed leading to dissolution45 some reports indicate that sea surface ph has dropped by 01 ph units since the beginning of the industrial revolution46 one report suggests that ph levels could drop by 05 ph units by 2100 and suggests further that the magnitude of ocean acidification can be predicted with high level of confidence47 the same report states however that research on the impacts of high concentrations of co 2 on marine organisms is in its infancy the oceans appear to be larger net sink for carbon than the land surface at present as with the land surface however consideration for policy makers is the future behavior of the ocean sink particularly the southern ocean given its importance to the net oceanatmosphere co 2 flux in contrast to the terrestrial carbon sink where management practices such as afforestation and conservation tillage may increase the amount of carbon uptake it is unclear how the ocean carbon sink can be managed in similar fashion some proposed techniques for increasing ocean sequestration of carbon such as iron fertilization48 and deep ocean injection of co 2 are in an experimental phase and have unknown longterm environmental consequences49

much shorter time scale co 2 injection into the subsurface has been used for decades to enhance recovery of oil however largescale geologic sequestration of co 2 for storage is currently in pilot testing stage less than half of the total amount of co 2 released from burning fossil fuels over the past 250 years remains in the atmosphere because two huge sinks for carbonthe global oceans and the land surfacetake up more carbon than they release at present congress is exploring if and how management practices such as afforestation conservation tillage and other techniques might increase the net flux of carbon from the atmosphere to land surface how the ocean sink could be managed to store more carbon is unclear iron fertilization and deep ocean injection of co 2 are in an experimental stage and their promise for longterm enhancement of carbon uptake by the oceans is not well understood also of possible concern to congress is how the ocean and land surface sinks will behave over the coming decades and longer and whether they will continue to take up more carbon than they release for example carbon emissions may be capped so as to keep atmospheric co 2 concentrations below prescribed level at some future date but changes in the magnitude or even the direction of the ocean or landsurface sinks may affect whether those target concentrations can be achieved congress may wish to incorporate what is known about the carbon cycle into its legislative strategies congress may also wish to evaluate whether the global carbon cycle is sufficiently well understood that the consequences of longterm policies aimed at mitigating global climate change are fully appreciated
