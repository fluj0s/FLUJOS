congress approved on november 13 13147 billion foreign operations spending measure hr 2159 for fy1998 the legislation falls about 175 million short of the presidents request but is 880 million higher than for fy1997 this reverses twoyear sharp decline in foreign aid spending and clears all us overdue payments to the world banks international development association for family planning programs hr 2159 provides 385 million the same as last year and deletes the housepassed restrictions concerning abortion and lobbying mexico city policy substituting language similar but somewhat less restrictive than what was enacted for fy1997 although the president achieved several of his top priorities congress did not approve 3521 billion appropriation for us participation in the imfs new arrangements to borrow nab lawmakers also refused to attach to hr 2159 authorization to pay 819 million for us arrears to the united nations major administration foreign policy initiative that had earlier been negotiated in conference on hr 1757 foreign relations authorization act fy199899 senate efforts to package foreign operations with these and other unrelated issues in an omnibus bill was rejected by the house house leaders made final attempt on november 13 to gain approval of the mexico city antiabortion family planning restrictions by combining it in new bill with imf funds and arrears the effort collapsed after the white house said the president would veto any legislation containing mexico city policy house appropriations committee chairman livingston said the imfnab issue may come up in supplemental spending measure early in 1998 the president signed hr 2159 on november 26 pl 105118 praising congress for including high levels of funding for multilateral programs the middle east and other administration priorities and for dropping the house family planning provisions president clinton however expressed strong regret that congress did not fund the imfnab and raised concerns over several aid restrictions added by congress including those associated with russias new law on religion and moscows support for irans missile program introduction the annual foreign operations appropriations bill is the primary legislative vehicle through which congress reviews and votes on the us foreign assistance crs2 budget and influences executive branch foreign policy making generally1 it contains the largest share about 67 of total international affairs spending by the united states see figure 1 the legislation funds all us bilateral development assistance programs managed mostly by the us agency for international development usaid together with several smaller independent foreign aid agencies such as the peace corps and the interamerican and african development foundations foreign operations includes separate accounts for aid programs in the former soviet union also referred to as the new independent states nis account and centraleastern europe activities that are jointly managed by usaid and the state department figure 1 international affairs discretionary budget authority fy1998 security assistance economic and military aid for israel and egypt is also part of the foreign operations spending measure as are smaller security aid programs administered largely by the state department in conjunction with usaid and the pentagon us contributions to the world bank and other regional multilateral development banks managed by the treasury department and voluntary payments 1 although the foreign operations appropriations bill is often characterized as the foreign aid spending measure it does not include funding for all foreign assistance programs food aid administered under the pl 480 program and managed by the department of agriculture and usaid is appropriated in the agriculture appropriations bill further the foreign operations measure includes funds for one activitythe exportimport bankthat is not regarded as foreign assistance but rather as us government activity promoting trade opportunities for american businesses in most years this results in foreign operations appropriation including the eximbank that is slightly less 15 in fy1998 than the official foreign aid budget throughout this report references to foreign operations and foreign aid are used interchangeably crs3 to international organizations handled by the state department are also funded in the foreign operations bill finally the legislation includes appropriations for three export promotion agencies the overseas private investment corporation opic the exportimport bank and the trade and development agency from the perspective of congressional oversight and involvement in us foreign aid policy making the foreign operations bill has taken on even greater significance during the past decade congress has not enacted foreign aid authorization bill since 1985 leaving most foreign assistance programs unauthorized as result foreign operations spending measures increasingly have expanded their scope beyond budget issues and played major role in shaping authorizing and guiding both executive and congressional foreign aid and broader foreign policy initiatives it has been largely through foreign operations appropriations that the united states has modified aid policy and resource allocation priorities since the end of the cold war the legislation has also been key tool used by congress to apply restrictions and conditions on administration management of foreign assistance actions that have frequently resulted in executivelegislative clashes over presidential prerogatives in foreign policy making status table 1 status of foreign operations appropriations fy1998 subcommittee conference report markup house

for foreign operations appropriations programs for the next three months house and senate foreign operations subcommittees held series of hearings including testimony from secretary of state albright treasury secretary rubin and usaid administrator atwood the first formal action was taken by the senate foreign operations subcommittee when it marked up draft legislation on june 18 the full senate panel approved the bill s 955 on june 24 and the bill passed the senate on july 17 the house foreign operations subcommittee met on june 25 to issue its recommendation an action followed by full house appropriations committee markup on july 9 hr 2159 the house passed hr 2159 on september 4 series of housesenate conference committee meetings scheduled several times during the final week of september and october were postponed because of continuing disagreement on several foreign operations matters including crs4 international family planning policy2 conferees met on october 28 worked out common positions on all nearly all issues but deferred consideration of two contentious provisions housepassed family planning restrictions and senate passed 35 billion for us participation in the imfs new arrangements to borrow consequently the foreign operations conference remained open pending resolution of these two matters ongoing efforts to resolve these issues especially the family planning provision had not resulted in compromise arrangement when the senate on november 9 attached the terms of the tentative foreign operations conference of october 28 to hr 2607 the district of columbia appropriations passed the measure and sent it to the house the senate measure added funding for the imfnab and less restrictive family planning provision than had passed the house plus it attached new administration high priority foreign policy initiatives for paying us arrears to the united nations and reorganizing the state department and other foreign affairs agencies that had been negotiated in other legislation the house however did not act on the senates omnibus bill and instead filed conference report on foreign operations and passed it on november 12 33376 without imf funding arrears and agency reorganization the senate agreed to hr 2159 the next day by voice vote president clinton signed the measure on november 26 pl 105118 house leaders made final attempt on november 13 to gain approval of the mexico city antiabortion family planning restrictions by combining it in new bill with imf funds arrears and agency reorganization the effort collapsed after the white house said the president would veto any legislation containing mexico city policy and senate minority leader daschle predicted the senate would not support the bill house appropriations committee chairman livingston said the imfnab issue may come up in supplemental spending measure early in 1998 foreign operations funding trends in recent years as the united states has adjusted its foreign and defense policy to postcold war environment one of the major foreign assistance issues for congress and executive branch policymakers has been the question of resources and how to reduce foreign aid spending while sustaining the program as an effective foreign policy tool after peaking in size at 207 billion in fy1985 foreign operations appropriations began period of declining levels falling to about 123 billion in fy1997 representing 074 of the entire federal budget and 24 of total discretionary budget authority these same figures in fy1985 were 2 and 46 respectively moreover in real terms taking into account the effects of inflation fy1997 foreign operations spending was 34 below the average appropriation level approved by congress during the late 1980s 23 less than fy1992 year that might 2 in an effort to underscore the importance of abortion restrictions for population aid programs the house voted 233194 on october 7 to instruct foreign operations conferees to insist on the housepassed prohibitions crs5 be considered the first postcold war foreign aid budget and 14 less than fy1995 when the majority in congress changed foreign operations appropriations excluding funding for the exportimport bank had grown steadily in real terms taking into account the effects of inflation during the early 1980s when the united states rapidly expanded securityrelated aid programs in central america pakistan and to countries providing the us with military bases3 funding peaked in fy1985 at 313 billion in fy1998 dollars followed by sharp cut in fy1986 as the effects of the grammrudman deficit reduction initiative took hold and limited federal spending in most areas for the next five years appropriations remained relatively stable at about 188 billion per year real terms amounts dropped again in fy1992 to about 164 billion and continued to fall to 147 billion in fy1995 fy1998 dollars appropriations for fy1997 were the smallest foreign operations level in real terms since 1975 when congress slashed foreign assistance spending during the us withdrawal from vietnam table 2 foreign operations appropriations fy1995 to fy1998 discretionary budget authority in billions of current

arrangements to borrow nab that when combined with regular foreign operations programs brought the total request to 16 845 billion the senate bill included the imfnab request bringing its total to 16816 billion the house measure did not include imfnab funding nor did the enacted bill see data notes box for explanation although cutting the foreign aid budget became central theme of congressional deliberations in the 104th congress relatively solid consensus also emerged within the administration and among congressional leaders to maintain current levels of assistance for israel and egypt humanitarianrefugee programs and children activities with nearly half of all foreign assistance allocated to these high priority categories significant overall budget reduction fell disproportionately on the remaining countries and programs illustrative of this pattern congress during debates in 1995 and 1996 on the foreign aid spending bill protected funds for few priority foreign aid activities but cut significantly most everything else under the foreign operations appropriations hr 3610 as enacted as part of the omnibus consolidated appropriations act september 30 1996 pl 104208 bilateral economic assistance outside the middle east and europe fell about 16 below fy1995 amounts moreover after accounting 3 funding for the exportimport bank program generally not regarded as foreign aid declined from 54 billion in fy1981 to 39 billion by fy1985 while appropriations for security aid programs grew from 53 billion in fy1981 to 119 billion in fy1985 crs6 for earmarks that protected funding for children and disease programs from budget reductions remaining bilateral economic aid activities declined over 19 from the fy1995 level us assistance for africa latin america and asia and global population and environment programs were the areas most affected us contributions to multilateral development banks mdbs have been another main target for funding cuts especially the international development association ida the arm of the world bank lending to the poorest countries the fy1997 foreign operations measure fell 41 below the funding level for multilateral programs appropriated for fy1995 data notes unless otherwise indicated this report expresses dollar amounts in terms of discretionary budget authority the foreign operations appropriations bill includes only one mandatory program usaids foreign service retirement fund that is not included in figures and tables shown for fy1997 the retirement fund received 438 million with small increase to 442 million enacted for fy1998 in addition comparisons made in the report between foreign operations levels for fy1998 and prior years exclude onetime 3521 billion proposal to fund us participation in the imfs new arrangements to borrow nab the nab is new imf facility that will include lines of credit from about 25 potential participants including the united states the imf will be able to draw on the funds in the event that an international financial crisis depletes regular imf resources imf members agree to expand the institutions resources only occasionally five times in the past 20 years although congress provides new budget authority through appropriations for the full amount of us participation the transaction is considered an exchange of assets between the united states and the imf and results in outlays from the us treasury in short the appropriations are offset by the creation of us counterpart claim on the imf that is liquid and interest bearing for more see crs report 96279 us budgetary treatment of the international monetary fund foreign operations appropriations request fy1998 much of the early debate in the 105th congress on foreign policy resources focused on the overall international affairs budget request of which foreign operations as illustrated in figure 1 above accounts for over twothirds administration officials in justifying their 19451 billion fy1998 international affairs request placed foremost emphasis on shoring up us diplomatic capabilities then secretary christopher launched this campaign for additional foreign policy resources in speech at west point october 1996 in which he argued that the united states must maintain balanced and wellfunded capability to both conduct diplomacy and apply military force when appropriate to preserve military and diplomatic readiness crs7 if the united states is to sustain global leadership and protect vital american interests by diplomatic readiness secretary christopher emphasized the need to remain engaged in the decisions made by international organizations to support american businesses overseas to promote the development prospects of emerging democracies to combat transnational national security threats stemming from drugs terrorism crime arms proliferation and disease and to have the necessary organizational infrastructure to operate and communicate with us representatives around the world he concluded that the united states could longer sustain its diplomacy on the cheap without jeopardizing significant national interests upon confirmation secretary albright embraced these same themes and vigorously defended before several congressional committees including the foreign operations appropriations subcommittee the need to support 63 increase for international affairs in fy19984 while several of the diplomatic readiness themes emphasized in the international affairs budget request would be funded in the commerce justice and state departments appropriation bill the bulk of the 1161 billion increase for foreign policy programs fell within the purview of the foreign operations funding measure president clinton sought 13324 billion in discretionary budget authority for foreign operations programs in fy1998 1056 billion or 86 higher than available for fy1997 although this was roughly double the growth sought in early 1996 for fy1997 most of the increases were concentrated on only three activities multilateral development bank mdb contributions especially payment of arrears the administration sought 1523 billion for mdb contributions up from 986 million in fy1997 about 315 million of the increase was to begin threeyear plan to clear all us arrears to the world bank and other regional development institutions congress had cut sharply similarly large increases each of the past two years for multilateral financial organizations partnership for freedom pff new phase of us aid to russia and other former soviet republics with expectations that us aid to the former soviet union would continue to decline and eventually settle at relatively low amounts the administration asked congress to support 900 million package for fy1998 44 higher than the 625 million for fy1997 of the 900 million requested 540 million would fund the new pff initiative that aimed to shift the emphasis from technical assistance and focus more on trade and investment projects and those strengthening civil society the pff would emphasize activities in russia and central asian countries meeting emerging regional democracy human rights and peace making needs in an effort to enhance the presidents ability to respond more flexibly to growing and in some cases unanticipated contingencies around the world 4 the issue was heightened further with the release in early 1997 of several studies on the question of the foreign policy budget see for example jan 13 1997 report issued by the brookings institution and the council on foreign relations by task force on resources for international affairs and false alarm over foreign affairs spending cuts released by the heritage foundation backgrounder 1102 jan 31 1997 for more details on the international affairs budget see crs report 97384 foreign affairs budget for fy1998 understanding the numbers and assessing the request updated may 16 1997 crs8 the request included substantial increases for series of regional democracy and peacekeeping programs funded within the economic support fund and voluntary peacekeeping accounts in total the president proposed 105 million for these regional activities up from 43 million

years house and senate bills for fy1998 also adopted different account structures from one another for comparative purposes all columns have been adjusted to conform to the structure of the fy1998 enacted bill most notably this shifts funding for unicef 100 million from title iv to title ii in the development assistance line for detailed funding levels of each program see table set out in the appendix of this report not specified in bill the administration will allocate funds out of development assistance and child survival accounts in addition and not included in the 13324 billion total cited above the foreign operations proposal included 3521 billion for us participation in the international monetary funds new arrangements to borrow imfnab the nab is intended to expand the imfs ability to assist during an international financial crisis as noted in the box note above imf appropriations do not result in an outlay of us funds or increase the deficit for most other foreign operationsfunded programs the fy1998 request set spending at or near fy1997 levels bilateral development programs operated by crs9 usaid for example would have grown by about 66 million 48 although the change in purposes for which the funds would be used was more substantial see below under major issues the usaid operating expense budget fell by 31 to 473 million reflecting among other things savings from the closure the past four years of 26 overseas missions and fewer staff although usaid does not anticipate another reduction in force with reduced operating expenses for fy1998 it plans to close several more missions by the end of the year peace corps 67 international drug control programs 8 aid to eastern europe 36 and trade and development agency 75 also received modest increases humanitarian assistance extended for international disasters and refugee relief activities would remain the same as for fy1997 at combined total of 890 million funding for the exportimport bank fell by nearly 12 although the administration believed the reduced subsidy appropriation would support increased lending by the bank because borrowers are expected to be more credit worthy and represent lower risk to us lending for military aid programs the 50 million sought for international military education and training imet was double the fy1995 appropriation and up 15 over fy1997 with the same 20 million level appropriated in fy1997 year for military loans for central european countries the administration believed it could increase the loan value from approximately 242 million to 402 million because of an improving economic climate in several of these prospective members of nato at the country level the fy1998 proposal did not alter significantly the fy1997 list of leading recipients of us aid see table 4 in general the roster of major recipients reflects us policy emphasis on middle east peace democratic transition in the former soviet union implementation of the dayton peace accords in bosnia and to somewhat lesser extent efforts to counter the drug trade in latin america israel 3 billion and egypt 2116 billion would continue at about the same levels for fy1997 as would assistance for greece turkey ukraine and bosnia5 assistance to russia under the pff initiative would increase significantly from 100 million allocated from fy1997 appropriations to 246 million for fy1998 while jordans program would grow by over onehalf the list of top 15 recipients also reflects key us policy priorities in south africa and haiti major foreign operations policy issues for congress as congress considered the presidents fy1998 request it debated wide range of foreign aid and broader foreign policy issues set out below is general overview of actions taken by both the house and senate including comparisons of overall and specific account funding levels also discussed are six major areas that received 5 following enactment of the foreign operations appropriations the administration decided to provide greece and turkey with military aid grants rather than loans as has been requested and earmarked by congress because grants require full appropriation and loans only subsidy appropriation the level of military grants for greece and turkey are about oneseventh the amount of the anticipated loan size as result greece and turkey are longer among the largest recipients of us foreign aid for the first time since the late 1970s crs10 considerable attention during the fy1998 foreign operations debate including details on

turkey longstanding leading recipients of us aid were earmarked to receive 105 million and 196 million respectively in fy1998 economic and military grants and loans the administration decided however to convert military loans to grants thereby lowering considerably the size of military assistance greece and turkey will receive 144 million and 266 million respectively in fy1998 overview of congressional action on the presidents request formal congressional consideration of the fy1998 foreign operations spending measure began in midjune with senate subcommittee markup followed by senate passage midjuly and house committee work and passage early september crs11 housesenate conference committee meeting on october 28 negotiated common positions on nearly all issues in dispute but deferred consideration of the most contentious matter restrictions on us international family planning programs and abortion conferees resolved the remaining differences on november 12 and congress sent to the president the fy1998 foreign operations spending measure in the final hours of the session senate consideration on july 17 the senate agreed to 133 billion foreign aid spending bill s 955 slightly more than 1 billion higher than fy1997 funding and just 29 million below the presidents request this level was closer to any administration request than approved by congress in several years and higher than any foreign aid spending legislation acted on by congress since republicans assumed the majority over two years ago many accounts as itemized in detailed table at the end of this report were fully funded under the senate recommendation in particular s 955 approved the presidents entire 35 billion request for us participation in the imfs new arrangements to borrow following adoption of an amendment by senator leahy adding 845 million the senatepassed bill further included the full 1035 billion request for us contributions to the world banks international development association in other areas s 955 added funds beyond what was requested bilateral development aid was set about 69 million 4 higher than the budget submission subsidy appropriations to back exportimport bank loans and guarantees were 68 million 11 more than the request and foreign military financing was up 50 million 2 above the presidents proposal in other areas however the senate bill was set below amounts proposed for key administration initiatives including aid to the former soviet union 100 million earmarks in the senate bill for country aid levels stimulated some of the sharpest controversy especially concerning the appropriations committees decision not to set aside specific amount of assistance for egypt breaking practice continued since the signing of the camp david accords in 1979 s 955 as reported by the committee excluded an earmark for the 815 million esf and 13 billion fmf requests for egypt committee members believed that egyptian leaders had taken number of steps during the past 18 months that suggested lack of commitment to the middle east peace process on the other hand the committee expressed strong appreciation for the risks undertaken by jordans king hussein in the pursuit of regional peace and earmarked 250 million for jordan about 80 million more than the administration anticipated providing during floor debate however at the urging of executive branch officials and key senate leaders the senate approved an amendment restoring the earmarks for egypt on other countryspecific issues the senate recommended that aid to russia and ukraine have eligibility conditions attachedfor russia because of its continuing support for irans ballistic missile and nuclear programs and because of legislation discriminating against religious minorities for ukraine because of limited progress on economic reforms and evidence of corruption some of which has had detrimental impact on americans investing in the country two amendments by senator mcconnell restricted us aid to cambodia and proposal by senator specter conditioned assistance to the palestinian authority on among other things crs12 presidential certification that the palestinian authority is using maximum efforts to combat terrorism and has ceased using violence as part of its policy toward israel during two days of debate in midjuly the senate adopted numerous amendments some of which are noted above but also rejected few controversial proposals an amendment by senator allard to cut back to fy1994 levels the administrative costs of the overseas private investment corporation opic failed 3564 opic critics have argued for several years that the corporation represents one of several taxpayersupported corporate welfare activities and have attempted to terminate or reduce its operations6 senators dodd and mccain proposed an amendment to suspend for two years the socalled drug certification process through which the president must annually certify whether drug producingtransiting countries are cooperating with us efforts to counter international narcotics trafficking during this two year suspension the amendment called on the president to develop new approach to achieve greater international cooperation in curbing drug production the march 1997 certification became especially controversial when president clinton certified mexico as cooperating but declined to certify colombia the senate however rejected the doddmccain proposal 3860 the senate further defeated 3861 an amendment by senator bingaman which would have permitted familyrelated humanitarian aid and compassionate travel to cuba by cuban americans finally the senate rejected 2277 senator hutchinson amendment to express the nonbinding sense of the senate that the us should revoke chinas mfn trade status house consideration the companion measure passed by the house hr 2159 was sharply different in many respects from s 955 especially concerning overall funding levels as approved on september 4 37549 the house foreign operations funding package held spending for fy1998 at the fy1997 12267 billion level this placed hr 2159 over 1 billion less than the presidents request and the senatepassed level the largest reductions from the presidents proposal and the senate recommendations came in two accounts aid to the former soviet union and us contributions to the world banks international development association moreover the house bill did not include budget authority for the imfs nab like the senate measure hr 2159 provided more funding for development assistance than requested by usaid 15 million but directed the agency to increase spending on children and disease programs and reduce funds for family planning aid although the legislation did not earmark funds for specific countries the appropriations committee recommended that israel and egypt receive amounts as proposed by the president the house bill further deferred program funding for the overseas private investment corporation because congress had yet to take action on legislation to extend opics operations beyond november 7 1997 the house began debate of hr 2159 on july 30 but after considering several amendments the bill was set aside and not completed until after the august recess during consideration the house adopted among others an amendment by representative saxton that suspends us aid to the palestinian authority for ninety days an amendment by representative menendez to prohibit contributions to the 6 in separate action the senate approved an amendment by senator hagel authorizing opic operations to continue through fy1999 at the time opics authority was set to expire on sept 30 1997 crs13 international atomic energy agency to be used for projects in cuba an amendment by representative campbell transferring 25 million from the economic support fund to the african development bank and separate amendments by representatives rohrabacher and bereuter prohibiting us aid for the government of cambodia the house also rejected several other amendments two addressed the issue of funding us export promotion agencies and charges of corporate welfare royce amendment reducing opics administrative expenses to fy1994 levels lost 156272 and an amendment by representative paul to eliminate funding for opic the exportimport bank and the trade and development agency was defeated 40387 an amendment by representative burton to limit us aid to india failed 82 342 as did an amendment by representative fox to prohibit assistance in support of trophy hunting or trade in elephant ivory hides or rhinoceros horns 1592677 the house further rejected 210217 an amendment by representative torres to ban military training funds for the us army school of the americas see crs report 97726 on what has come to be the most contentious issue in the foreign operations spending bill the house voted on three amendments concerning us family planning programs the house defeated 147278 an amendment by representative paul that would have struck the entire 385 million funding level for population assistance before voting on an amendment by representative smith nj that would ban us funds for foreign organizations engaged in abortion activities the house narrowly defeated 210218 substitute proposal by representatives gilman pelosi and others the gilman substitute would have restricted funding only to groups that promote abortion as method of family planning but not to those performing abortions with nonus money the house then approved the smith amendment 234191 subsequently after failing for several weeks to resolve informally house senate and houseadministration differences over family planning restrictions the house voted 233194 on october 7 to instruct house conferees to insist on the smith amendment during its deliberations with the senate see below for more discussion on the family planning issue housesenate conference committee negotiations after nearly two months of informal discussions house and senate conferees met on october 28 and reached agreement on all issues except family planning restrictions and the imfnab as result the conference committee remained open until members resolved the two issues on november 12 and filed conference report8 the house approved the 7 the latter amendment was aimed at blocking usaid funding for the campfire program an activity supporting zimbabwes elephant conservation efforts but which critics claim has promoted the killing of african elephants for more information see crs report 97752 african elephant issues cites and campfire 8 after several further attempts to resolve these two issues failed the senate attached modified text of the tentative foreign operations october 28 conference agreement to hr 2607 the district of columbia appropriations and sent it to the house on nov 9 the foreign operations modifications included imfnab funding and revised family planning restrictions but with presidential waiver the house however deleted foreign operations from hr 2607 and instead completed action on foreign operations as separate bill hr continued crs14 conference agreement on the same day 33376 followed by the senate on november 13 voice with the house and senate bills far apart on overall funding for foreign operations conferees settled on levels closer to the senatepassed and president requested amounts representing sharp increase for foreign operations for the first time in several years total discretionary spending is set at 1315 billion divided into two components 12787 billion for regular foreign operations programs and 360 million for us arrearage payments to the world bank and other multilateral development banks this amount is about 175 million less than the administrations proposed budget 13 but 880 million more than fy1997 and the houseenacted bill 729 moreover this reverses seven year trend during which congress cut the regular foreign operations spending below the previous years total10 it would also support to large extent the administrations yearlong campaign to shore up resources for foreign policy programs from the administrations perspective the conference agreement backs one of its primary foreign operations initiatives full funding for the world banks international development association but falls well short of another priority item of expanding aid for russia and launching its partnership for freedom activity restrictions attached to russian aid by house or senate bills however are modified somewhat in the conference report to provide greater presidential flexibility see below under specific issues for complete discussion on the most divisive foreign operations issue family planning policy restrictions the white house successfully blocked attachment of the housepassed mexico city provisions but will receive 385 million for population programs rather than the roughly 443 million requested the legislation also apportions or meters the funds at monthly rate of 321 million this arrangement is similar but somewhat less restrictive than congress enacted for fy1997 funding remains 8 continued 2159 9 revised sec 302b allocations approved by house and senate appropriation committees in late september provided foreign operations conferees with spending totals much closer to the senatepassed amount the revised house allocations gave foreign operations 128 billion plus allowance for us arrearage payments sec 302 allocations refer to the process by which congress translates actions taken on the budget resolution and the establishment of broad budget function totals into the distribution of these funds among committees with jurisdiction over spending decisions house and senate appropriations committees as well as other congressional committees are issued 302a allocations in reference to section 302a of the congressional budget act of 1974 the appropriations committees subsequently allocate their available funding totals among each of the 13 subcommittees the 302b allocations at the initial stage of debate on the 13 spending bills house and senate 302b allocations are usually different sometimes widely different appropriation panels revise these allocations prior to conference meetings frequently narrowing the gaps between earlier house and senate differences 10 this applies only to the regular foreign operations bill such as hr 2159 in two years fy1991 and fy1993 supplemental appropriations for persian gulf war related aid and assistance to the former soviet union pushed foreign operations spending higher than the previous year crs15 the same but instead of delay until july for access to the money as was the case last year usaid would begin to receive the 321 million monthly apportionments immediately moreover there is requirement for presidential certification and congressional vote early next year in order to accelerate the availability of funds while the conference agreement excludes the housepassed abortion restrictions over which the president said he would veto the bill it derailed passage of other major administration foreign policy priorities hr 2159 does not fund the 3521 billion appropriation for us participation in the imfs new arrangements to borrow nab nor does it include authorization to pay 819 million for us arrears to the united nations that had earlier been negotiated in conference on hr 1757 foreign relations authorization act fy199899 and that supporters had hoped to attach to foreign operations house leaders made final attempt on november 13 to gain approval of the mexico city antiabortion family planning restrictions by combining it in new bill with imf funds arrears and foreign affairs agency reorganization the effort collapsed after the white house said the president would veto any legislation containing mexico city policy and senate minority leader daschle predicted the senate would not support the bill house appropriations committee chairman livingston said the imfnab issue may come up in supplemental spending measure early in 1998 other executive branch proposals supported by the conference package include full funding for the peace corps 220 million humanitarian disaster relief 190 million refugee assistance 700 million international narcotics programs 230 million military training 50 million opic credit programs including the extension of opics authority to operate for another year and regional development banks for europe 358 million and north america 565 million development assistance funding slightly exceeds by about 30 million amounts proposed by the president although congressional addons for certain activities and reductions for population programs will require usaid to alter some of its strategies the conference agreement also protects several house and senate priorities plus introducing new initiatives as part of compromise solutions to contentious issues conferees adopted the houseapproved child survival and disease account 650 millionincreased resources for the exportimport bank 680 million total about 10 higher than the request and near the senatepassed level and expanded military aid to the baltics as proposed by the senate the conference committee further adopted nearly the entire senate addons for jordan 225 million earmarks for economic and military aid but within the context of new funding cap on foreign aid spending in the middle east amounts for the region are limited to 54 billion the same as for fy1997 which has the effect of reducing the proportion of foreign operations funds going to the middle east from 44 last year to 42 in fy1998 within the cap the legislation earmarks 3 billion for israel and 2115 billion for egypt but permits the transfer of 50 million from each to fund part of the increases for jordan as new initiative conferees created 250 million southern caucasus regional aid fund with specific earmarks for armenia 875 million and georgia 925 million and 525 million to support peace efforts in the region six specific major foreign operations issues addressed in the senate and house bills are discussed below crs16 policy priorities of us development aid since the end of the cold war common theme of administration discussions and congressional debates has been what should replace the anticommunist foreign aid rationale of the past 50 years more fundamental question raised by some especially critics of development assistance is whether the united states still needs to maintain an active globally focused economic aid program or can it be transformed as smaller more targeted instrument with some elements being privatized that would support only the highest us foreign policy interests although there has been definitive consensus reached on these questions between the executive and legislative branches the clinton administration has strongly supported the retention of an activist foreign aid policy which can be used to bolster any number of us foreign policy initiatives around the world in early 1994 usaid released its blueprint for postcold war development aid policy based around the goal of sustainable development and its four strategies of promoting economic growth stabilizing global population protecting the environment and advancing democracy while usaid has confronted some critics who question whether these are the right set of strategies that serve the highest us interests more fundamental issue has emerged given the reductions in development aid funding levels in fy199697 can usaid continue to pursue its sustainable development strategies in an integrative manner that has impact and produces results usaid has maintained since adopting these strategies in 1994 that they must operate as interlinked mutually reenforcing elements of an overall us effort to promote the advancement of market economies and democratic transitions in the developing world until countries reach point of sustainability that longer requires external aid funding reductions congressional restrictions and fluctuating administration priorities however have required usaid to alter the mix of resources devoted to each of the strategies raising questions over whether the integrative mutually reenforcing principles can be maintained congress for example limited development aid for population programs in fy1996 and fy1997 to roughly two thirds the amount provided in fy1995 see below for more discussion on family planning restrictions further the state departments bureau of global affairs places high priority on environment programs and presses usaid to allocate the maximum amount possible to such activities as result the environment sector of sustainable development probably has not declined as much as it might otherwise but at the center of this issue for the past two years has been differences between congress and the executive branch regarding funding levels for programs supporting child survival basic education and hivaids and other infectious diseases despite cutting overall development aid the past two years by about 23 from fy1995 levels congress has earmarked children and disease programs at levels equal to or somewhat greater than those allocated in fy1995 making the cuts on all other elements of sustainable development closer to 30 congressional proponents of the child survival earmark argue that even though budget pressures require the united states to reduce foreign aid spending the protection of children remains core american value demanding that cuts should be implemented without putting at risk the lives and wellbeing of small children in developing nations they further point out that the crs17 spread of infectious diseases poses direct threat to us citizens and that american national interests require continued support for global efforts to reduce or eliminate such illnesses while agreeing with the importance of child survival and infectious disease programs usaid officials apply broader definition to the terms arguing for example that efforts to protect small children go well beyond immunizations and access to other health services the quality of childs life they assert also is determined by an array of other factors including the degree of relative stability in society protection of the surrounding environment access to adequate shelter and implementation of sound economic policies that will ensure jobs and economic opportunities in the future consequently they contend the squeeze that earmarks place on other areas of sustainable development undermines to some extent the success of programs that also benefit children table 5 usaid sustainable development programs in millions of dollars fy1997 fy1998 goalstargets estimate request s of total s of total economic growth 5205 319 5050 298 of which

sustainable development request restored some funding to elements reduced most significantly the past two years the agency further asked crs18 congress to support these addons by in part cutting appropriations for child survival programs from roughly 248 million in fy1997 to 220 million next year as table 5 illustrates the request maintained the same funding for hivaids programs but sought substantial increases for environmental activities population projects agriculture and to lesser extent democracy programs congressional action senatepassed foreign operations appropriations for usaid permitted the agency to fully fund its proposed fy1998 request plus accommodate selected congressional priorities bilateral development aid programs were set at 1893 billion including unicef contributions and grants to the inter american and african development foundations about 59 million more than proposed by the administration hr 2159 included separate account for population aid at 435 million slightly higher than usaid plans for fy1998 and directed that infectious disease programs receive 30 million increase in fy1998 the house measure set development assistance at 1849 billion about 19 million higher than the presidents budget submission figures also include unicef and interamerican and african development foundation funds the legislation however changed usaids planned program mix by setting child survival and disease activities at 650 millionabout 100 million more than proposedand by limiting population aid programs to 385 million well below both the presidents and the senates mark hr 2159 made children programs one of the highest priorities in the legislation including recommended funding levels of 98 million for basic education 245 million for child survival activities 100 million for unicef and 50 million increase to fight the spread of infectious diseases including polio tuberculosis hivaids yellow fever malaria and measles for other usaid sustainable development activities including economic growth democracy and the environment house funding levels substantially supported requested appropriations but would still require an overall cut from the request of about 45 million 25 the conference agreement sets development aid funding about 30 million higher than requested by the administration reversing sharp downward trend the past two years conferees adopted the houseproposed child survival and disease fund at 650 million an amount that includes 50 million increase for communicable diseases and 100 million for unicef although it will receive more funding than requested usaid will likely have to adjust somewhat its planned program allocations for fy1998 in order to accommodate congressional priorities on children and disease programs since the enacted bill also reduces the request for population assistance to 385 million some of the planned family planning money could help fill the additional congressional requirements whatever the adjustments however they are likely to be far less difficult to manage for usaid than during the past two years because of the higher overall amount approved by congress for fy1998 population assistance for over decade congress has engaged in contentious debates over us international population assistance policy often as part of the foreign operations appropriations twice congressional positions on this issue have been one of the major reasons prompting presidential veto debate during the past three years has crs19 focused largely on two intertwined elements 1 funding for population programs and 2 restricting abortion activities funding for us international family planning programs had been one of the largest growth areas of the foreign aid budget in the 1990s from an average of about 250 million in the late 1980s fy1995 spending across all foreign operations accounts totaled approximately 548 million when congress deadlocked over abortionrelated restrictions and us population aid policy situation that blocked movement of the entire foreign operations bill each of the last two years lawmakers adopted interim provisions that among other things strictly limited the amount of funding for usaid family planning programs the fy1996 and fy1997 appropriation levels of 356 million and 385 million respectively are roughly two thirds the amount provided in fy1995 and represent the smallest funding levels since fy1992 moreover also as result of the impasse over abortion restrictions congress established delayed timetable for making these funds available schedule that included monthly apportionments or metering of the appropriation second issue in the population aid debate and one directly connected to funding reductions and metering of the past two years deals with abortion restrictions and the eligibility requirements for foreign organizations receiving funds to implement ussponsored family planning programs during the mid1980s in what has become known as the mexico city policy the reagan and later the bush administrations restricted funds for any foreign nongovernmental organization that was involved in any way in voluntary abortion activities even if such activities were undertaken with nonus funds several groups including international planned parenthood federationlondon ippf became ineligible for us financial support in some years congress narrowly approved measures to overturn this prohibition but white house vetoes kept the policy in place president clinton in 1993 reversed the position of his two predecessors allowing the united states to resume funding for all family planning organizations so long as us money was not used in abortionrelated work during the past two years the house and senate have taken opposing positions on the mexico city issue that in each case held up enactment of the final foreign operations spending measure the house position sponsored by representative smith nj supported reinstatement of the mexico city policy restricting us aid funds to foreign organizations involved in abortionrelated activities the senate on the other side has deleted the house provision dealing with mexico city policy leaving decisions in the hands of the administration moreover administration officials have stated that president clinton would veto the bill if it included the house passed mexico city restrictions unable to reach an agreement satisfactory to both sides congress adopted for both fy1996 and fy1997 an interim arrangement that did not resolve the broad population program controversy for congress but did permit the stalled foreign operations measure to move forward it was hoped that the arrangement which neither side liked would provide incentives for those involved in the debate to find middle ground under the terms of the most recently enacted temporary arrangement as included in pl 104208 the housesupported mexico city restrictions were deleted and fy1997 population aid funding was set at 385 million down from 435 million requested like the previous year however the money would be delayed until july 1 1997 at which time usaid could program only one crs20 twelfth of the total about 32 million each month over the next year nevertheless the legislation offered the president second opportunity to accelerate the availability of funds to march 1 1997 instead of july 1 if he reported and congress agreed through passage of joint resolution early in the 105th congress that the delayed funding restrictions were having negative impact on proper functioning of family planning programs as expected president clinton issued the required determination on january 31 1997 stating that without the march 1 availability of fy1997 population aid funds usaid would face shortfall of 35 million between march and july 1 causing the agency to suspend delay or terminate 17 bilateral and worldwide programs additional management costs for usaid to administer its global family planning activities would total more than 1 million the president further asserted that four month funding delay would increase both the number of unintended pregnancies and abortions in developing countries raise the number of maternal and infant deaths and increase the level of births congress by narrow margin agreed with the presidents determination hjres 36 pl 1053 house passed 220209 senate passed 5346 during house debate representative smith had offered an alternative measure hr 581 that would have released all population aid funds on march 1 and eliminated the metering procedure if modified mexico city restrictions were restored the house approved hr 581 231194 but the senate did not consider it or companion measure s 337 for more information see crs report 97147 population assistance programs early action in the 105th congress march 14 1997 with the house and senate and the administration still at odds over population aid policy the issue was prominently featured again during this years foreign operations debate usaid requested approximately 441 million for fy1998 family planning programs including 400 million from the development aid accounts the total was up 14 over fy1997 appropriations congressional action hr 2159 as passed in the senate established separate 435 million account for population assistance subject to longstanding policy prohibitions on using the money for directly funding abortions or for lobbying these limitations similar to those included in foreign aid bills for many years stopped short of the metering restrictions contained in the fy1997 appropriation or the mexico city policy because they would apply only to the use of us government funds and not to money raised by organizations from nonus sources the house bill also removed the fy1997enacted family planning program restrictions dealing with the metering of funds but limited spending to the fy1997 amount of 385 million during house floor debate lawmakers considered three amendments concerning family planning and population aid issues the first proposal offered by representative paul and defeated 147278 would have deleted all population assistance funding in the bill the house next took up an amendment proposed by representatives gilman pelosi greenwood campbell and others that was offered as substitute to pending amendment by representative smith nj the smith amendment closely mirrored the mexico city family planning restrictions by prohibiting us funding to foreign nongovernmental and international organizations unless they certify that they would not perform abortions in any foreign country while receiving us money except where the life of the mother was in crs21 danger or in cases of forcible rape or incest or lobby to change abortion laws in foreign countries the gilman substitute on the other hand had the effect of banning funds to these organizations only if they promote abortion as method of family planning for groups that perform abortions the gilman text would have continued current law that is us funds may not be used for performing abortions but restrictions would apply to what organizations do with nonus money on separate but related issue the smith amendment also prohibited contributions to the population fund unfpa unless the president certifies that the organization is not operating in china or that china has not engaged in coercive abortion practices during the past twelve months the gilman substitute did not change the certification requirement but would allow funds not available to unfpa to be transferred to usaid for bilateral population aid programs after defeating the gilman substitute 210218 the house adopted the smith amendment 234191 the impasse over reaching an acceptable resolution to housesenate and house administration differences blocked formal meetings of foreign operations conferees for nearly two months on october 7 the house voted 233194 to instruct house members of the conference committee to insist upon the smith amendment during conference deliberations11 although conferees met on october 28 they had agreed in advance to defer the family planning and mexico city policy issue and the matter remains unresolved subsequent efforts to negotiate an acceptable alternative yielded results one attempt ended on november 6 when conference committee leaders fell two votes shy of gaining majority of conferees in favor of modified provision subsequently the senate incorporated into hr 2607 an omnibus spending measure for three pending appropriations bills including foreign operations text similar to the language rejected on november 6 by majority of conferees the revised family planning text section 592 division c of hr 2607 included the housepassed mexico city restrictions banning us funds to foreign nongovernmental groups and international organizations which 1 perform abortions with their own money or 2 lobby to change abortion laws in foreign countries although the text also included presidential waiver lifting these restrictions in fy1998 and fy1999 if exercised usaid would have had its funding for population programs capped at 410 million if one provision was waived or 385 million if both were waived resolution to the impasse came on november 12 when housesenate conferees filed conference report on hr 2159 as approved population aid is capped at 385 million the level for fy1997 but about 56 million less that requested the legislation also apportions or meters the funds at monthly rate of 321 million the conference agreement however deletes the housepassed 11 in related legislation the house had approved on june 5 an amendment proposed by representative smith to the foreign relations authorization act hr 1757 that applies the mexico city restrictions to us family planning programs senate counterpart authorization bill approved june 17 had population aid provisions on oct 8 the house also voted 236190 to instruct house conferees meeting on hr 1757 to insist upon the smith amendment like foreign operations the family planning issue was major stumbling block to finalizing the authorization bill legislation that also includes the consolidation of two foreign affairs agencies into the state department and provisions addressing reform and the payment of us arrears authorizing conferees did not report bill in 1997 crs22 restrictions on family planning policy and contributions to unfpa this arrangement is similar but somewhat less restrictive than congress enacted for fy1997 funding remains the same but instead of delay until july for access to the money as was the case last year usaid would begin to receive the 321 million monthly apportionments immediately moreover there is not requirement for presidential certification and congressional vote early next year in order to accelerate the availability of funds regional allocations of development assistance the declining level of development assistance over the past several years coupled with congressional efforts to minimize the impact of these reductions first for africa and more recently for latin america has heightened attention on the issue of regional aid distribution because there are separate accounts within the foreign operations bill for assistance to countries in eastern europe and the former soviet union congress votes directly on aid levels to these regions likewise since the economic support fund esf is comprised largely of middle east assistance with separate earmarks for israel and egypt the structure of the foreign operations bill permits congress more direct control over amounts provided to that region but the balance of usaids development assistance 1632 billion in fy1997 and 1698 billion proposed for fy1998 is distributed widely throughout africa latin america south asia and southeast asia among countries at various stages of development and of varying degrees of importance to us interests in principle absent congressional earmarks or directives usaid and the state department decide how to allocate funds on country and regional basis task made more difficult with shrinking resource base africa had been afforded special treatment for nearly decade between fy1988 and fy1995 when foreign operations spending bills annually included separate lineitem for the region known as the development fund for africa dfa through the dfa congress directly set the level of us development resources to africa thereby protecting funding levels for the region that might otherwise have been diverted to meet shortterm foreign policy crises elsewhere practice that had occurred routinely prior to 1988 in fy1996 however over the opposition of some strong congressional proponents of the dfa congress and the administration agreed to drop the separate lineitem folding africa into the worldwide development assistance account nevertheless to ensure that the administration did not cut african assistance disproportionately compared to other regions congress directed the president to seek to ensure that africa receive substantially the same proportion of worldwide development aid that it was allocated in fy1995 36 congress repeated similar proportional requirement for fy1997 this time based on the proportion requested by the president for africa 412 alarmed over declining economic aid levels for latin america amounts that had fallen from 986 million in fy1991 to about 361 million in fy1996 for combined development and esf appropriations congress added in fy1997 for latin america the same proportional allocation directive as for africa under this nonbinding formula latin america would be expected to receive 286 million 175 in development aid while the allocation for africa would be 672 million although the administration asked congress to reinstate for fy1997 the dfa crs23 earmark it opposed the proportional allocation requirement for latin america and africa arguing that with overall reductions in development assistance and changing global circumstances programs in asia would be unduly squeezed after extensive consultations with congressional committees usaid ultimately reduced the amounts slightly for africa 665 million and latin america 2735 million from what strict proportional allocation required by altering the formula usaid made available an additional 20 million for programs in south asia southeast asia non esf middle east recipients and for centrally funded programs managed by the agencys global bureau despite these efforts to adjust the proportional requirements downward for fy1997 the request for fy1998 asks congress to reestablish the dfa at 700 million an amount 35 million higher than the fy1997 allocation but representing the same 412 share of total development aid proposed year ago latin america would receive 2735 million the same dollar level as in fy1997 but totaling smaller 161 share the largest regional growth for fy1998 development assistance is for usaids asianear east programs 310 million up 57 million from current levels the request includes increased funding for india bangladesh and indonesia but the largest growth would occur in 255 million asianear east regional reengineering development and support project intended to support the review of usaid mission strategic and action plans in the region congressional action neither house or senate bills established separate line item for africa as requested or included proportional allocation requirement as has been the case the past two years nevertheless given the overall spending approved in each bill for development aid worldwide it was likely the administration could accommodate the full 700 million request for africa in its report the house appropriations committee noted that the additional funds provided for the communicable diseases initiative should ensure that africa would receive more aid in fy1998 than in fy1997 the house panel further expressed its strong support for aid programs in latin america and directed that the administration increase spending by 20 million from current amounts provided under development aid and esf programs based on the housesenate conference agreement it appears that the administration will be able to allocate amounts for africa latin america and asia at roughly the levels proposed the conference committee however adopted the house position of increasing economic aid for latin america by 20 million middle east assistance since the late 1970s by far the largest portion of us foreign aid has supported american friends and allies in the middle east especially israel and egypt combined these two countries have received over 100 billion during the past 20 years for the past decade foreign aid bills have annually earmarked 3 billion for israel and 2115 billion for egypt in economic and military assistance the fy1998 request matches these traditional levels as overall foreign operations funding amounts have declined the past several years however the proportion of funds going to israel and egypt has climbed to over crs24 40 in fy1997 some in congress and in the executive branch have suggested that at time of overall budget cuts all aid activities including those for israel and egypt should be examined for possible reductions in order to fund other emerging initiatives for which new money is not available in this spirit the administration announced on june 17 its intentions to provide jordan with an additional 100 million in economic assistance annually over the next five years amounts drawn largely from aid accounts for israel and egypt state department officials say that it is important for the united states to send clear signal of support to king hussein for his efforts in advancing the middle east peace process and to bolster his countrys economic reform initiatives the first installmentfor fy1997came from taking 50 million from previously appropriated economic aid for egypt and 50 million payment from israel12 for fy1998 the administration said it would ask congress for transfer authority to shift an additional 50 million each from israel and egypt to jordan according to july 11 state department notification to congress israel and egypt have agreed with this arrangement the 100 million would come on top of 40 million estimated for economic and military aid for jordan in fy1997 and 70 million proposed for fy1998 congressional action the senate appropriations committee expressed strong support for increasing aid to jordan proposing to go beyond the presidents initiative and provide 250 million in fy1998150 million in economic aid and 100 million for military support at the same time the committee registered serious concern over actions by egypt that they believed run counter to the peace process departing from practice over the past 20 years the senate panel did not include an earmark for egypt during floor debate however the senate restored the traditional earmark israels aid was earmarked at 3 billion while egypt would receive 2115 billion although the house bill did not recommend specific country earmarks the appropriations committee assumed full funding for both israel and egypt at the same time the committees report on the legislation encouraged the administration to consider options for reallocating middle east funding to address newly emerging us aid priorities elsewhere in the region and around the world conferees meeting on foreign operations funding agreed to 54 billion cap on middle east assistance of which israel 3 billion egypt 2115 billion and jordan 225 million will account for all but 60 million while supporting us aid to the region and efforts to move the peace process forward concern of some is that additional resources for the middle east often come at the expense of funding for initiatives in other parts of the world the cap which equals the dollar level of funding for last year will lower the proportion of foreign operations going to the region from 44 in fy1997 to 42 and permit the transfer of 50 million each from israel and egypt to fund the jordan increase 12 all us aid to israel for fy1997 had already been disbursed so unlike egypt it was not possible to transfer previously obligated but unspent funds crs25 aid to russia and the partnership for freedom initiative since the collapse of the soviet union the administration with generally strong support from congress has utilized us economic assistance to facilitate the transition of russia and the other successor states referred to as the new independent states or nis to democracy and free market economies beginning in early 1992 the united states has extended approximately 9 billion in grant assistance and 83 billion in export credits13 to the nis much of it appropriated through the foreign operations legislation but nis assistance had been framed as temporary initiative that would be phased out as countries moved towards more open democratic and economic systems congressional reductions the past two years accelerated the downward trend in nis aid to 625 million in fy1997 with russia in particular cut sharply from 341 million in fy1995 to 95 million in fy1997 as one of its top fy1998 foreign affairs budget priorities the administration sought approval from congress for what is termed as second phase of us assistance to russia and the other states of the former soviet union the partnership for freedom pff initiative the pff initiative extends the duration of the aid program targets more assistance for russia central asia and parts of the caucasus and shifts the aid strategy to deemphasize the technical assistance focus in favor of private sectortrade and investment programs and grassroots civil society building the president sought 900 million overall for the nis account in fy1998 up 44 from current levels of which 528 million supported pff activities under the plan aid to russia alone would grow from 95 million to 242 million in fy1998 because of the size of the increase the extension of us assistance beyond the assumed timeframe and questions over russias commitment to economic and political reforms and relations with countries such as iran and cuba congress examined the pff proposal closely for more details on pff see crs report 97 342 partnership for freedom foreign aid initiative for the former soviet union march 12 1997 congressional action action taken by the senate on july 17 provided much of what the president sought for the nis account800 millionbut placed several conditions on when aid could be allocated the bill restricted aid to russia until moscow ends its support for irans nuclear program the senate measure further provided full funding for ukraine 225 million but withheld 50 until the secretary of state certified that ukraine is making progress on implementing economic reforms and controlling corruption senate floor amendments added further restrictions for russia should it enact laws that discriminate against minority religious faiths or fail to terminate activities relating to ballistic missile programs in iran further senate amendment directed that not less than 25 million in funding for ukraine be allocated to comprehensive legal restructuring to facilitate decentralized marketoriented economic system in the house hr 2159 held nis funding levels to 625 million the house measure included aid conditions similar to those in the senate expressing particular concern over russian nuclear transfers to iran and cuba and the situation in ukraine regarding economic reforms and impediments to foreign investment 13 the 83 billion in export credits represents the face value of the loans and guarantees subsidy appropriations to back up the risk in making these loans have been substantially lower crs26 funding level of 770 million for the nis set by the housesenate conference committee expands us assistance to the southern caucasus and support for peace efforts in the region 250 million provides full funding for ukraine 225 million but would leave significant shortfall for proposed aid initiatives in russia and the central asian republics where the administration hoped to focus its pff program conferees further modified restrictions on russian aid linked with its relationship to iran by including presidential waiver based on vital national security interests and certification that russia is taking meaningful steps to limit its nuclear relationship with iran on the issue of religious discrimination conferees included text requiring presidential certification the russia had not implemented laws or regulations that would discriminate against religious groups world banks international development association and other multilateral funding title iv of the foreign operations bill funds us contributions to series of multilateral development banks mdbs and voluntary payments to 30 international organizations io and p account as it has the past two years the administrations largest foreign operations funding increase is for these multilateral agencies for fy1998 the president seeks 1523 billion for the mdbs an increase of more than 50 how much economic aid to channel through multilateral rather than bilateral channels where more us control can be maintained is continuing source of controversy in foreign operations debates in tightened budget environment the competition becomes even more intense the 1035 billion request for the world banks international development association ida and the administrations proposal to launch threeyear effort to clear us arrears to the mdbs 315 million requested for fy1998 235 million of which is for ida drew most congressional attention further multilateral aid issue was the presidents proposal for an initial 525 million us contribution to the new middle east development bank funding that would be drawn not from title iv but from the economic support fund in title ii congress authorized us participation in the middle east bank last year but rejected appropriations for first payment for more details on us participation in mdbs see crs issue brief 96008 multilateral development banks issues for the 105th congress ida is the socalled softloan window of the world bank offering concessional lending to the poorest nations mainly in africa and south asia although it has been criticized in the past from nearly all parts of the political spectrum for having limited impact aiding undesirable countries placing too little emphasis on the needs of the poor limiting access to information and being insensitive to environmental consequences of its programs congress has usually supported the bulk of appropriations requested some fear that sharp reduction in ida lending will leave the poorest countries largely in africa without access to adequate development financing for further information see crs report 95947 multilateral development banks possible impact of major reduction or termination of mdb aid because ida accounts for such large proportion of multilateral contributions over 70 in fy1997 it is frequently the focus of intense congressional scrutiny crs27 the 1035 billion ida request was divided into two parts 235 million to pay us arrears to idas tenth replenishment ida 10 and 800 million for the first of two us payments for ida 11 the replenishment agreed to by international donors in march 1996 but overshadowing the ida 11 agreement was the uncertainty of us final payments to ida 10 and whether congress would support us participation in ida 11 because of world bank claims that it would run out of lending authority by june 1996 donors other than the united states agreed to 33 billion interim trust fund for 1996 controversy emerged however over the terms of the interim fund which limited decision making and procurement to contributing countries only consequently us officials and businesses were excluded from participating in projects financed by the 33 billion fund through pressure by congress including provision in last years foreign operations bill the administration convinced other donors in february 1997 to modify the procurement restriction allowing american firms to bid on 1 billion or about onethird of projects financed by the trust fund congressional action the senate bill set ida funding at 1035 billion as requested by the president the measure however conditioned the availability of ida contributions on treasury department certification that procurement restrictions effecting us firms had been lifted full funding for clearing us arrears to ida and the asian development bank resulted from floor amendment sponsored by senator leahy adding 94 million for arrearage payments although the bill met many administration priorities within the mdb account total funding fell about 90 million below the request primarily due to denial of 50 million for the african development fund in the house hr 2159 provided 606 million for ida sharp cut that would leave the us in arrears for ida 10 and short by nearly 200 million on ida 11 payments like the senate the house measure would withhold us contributions until 1 billion in procurement from the interim trust fund becomes available for open competition overall the house bill was about 573 million less than the proposed mdb budget for fy1998 and below the senatepassed levels for ida the world banks global environment facility the interamerican development banks multilateral investment fund and the concessional window of the asian development bank for the african development fund however the house measure fully funds the presidents 50 million request supporting one of the administrations top priorities in the fy1998 foreign operations debate conferees agreed to full funding for ida 800 million for ida 11 and 2345 million for arrears although none of the funds may be obligated until the secretary of the treasury certifies that interim trust fund procurement restrictions affecting us companies have been lifted the conference committee further agreed to full funding for the european development bank 358 million and the north american development bank 565 million but money for the middle east development bank related legislation the foreign operations appropriation was influenced by number of other bills and resolutions moving through congress in 1997 the fy1997 crs28 supplementalrescissions measure pl 10518 did not modify spending levels for foreign operations programs for last year but did include policy provision relating to us aid to ukraine14 beyond this two other congressional actions affected the foreign operations appropriations debate the budget resolution and partial consideration of foreign aid authorization bills budget resolution fy1998 within the fy1998 budget resolution congress approved the broad framework of us foreign policy spending as part of the international affairs budget function 150 foreign operations makes up about 67 of the total international affairs budget as illustrated in figure 1 above although the budget resolution does not set precise funding levels for foreign operations accounts decisions made on the international budget have considerable impact on how much funding is available to the appropriations committees instead of proceeding directly to consideration of budget resolution congressional leaders and white house officials negotiated for several weeks the terms of bipartisan blueprint for balancing the federal budget by 2002 the broad outlines of an agreed budget package were announced on may 1 but final details including specific funding levels for international affairs did not conclude until may 15 budget negotiators agreed to full funding 1945 billion for the presidents fy1998 foreign policy recommendation this permitted although it did not require house and senate appropriations committees to allocate to the foreign operations subcommittees funding levels at the presidents 13323 billion proposal whether to allocate the full amount provided in the budget resolution for international affairs and how to allocate it among the three subcommittees with major foreign policy spending remained decision for the appropriations committees to make at the early stages of the appropriations debate the house committee allocated only 125 billion for foreign operations while its senate counterpart set aside 132 billion subsequent house revisions of the foreign operations allocation made prior to conference committee meetings in midseptember provided amounts close to the senate level 128 billion plus 315 million for arrearage payments to the multilateral development banks for total of 131 billion the budget resolution is also important to foreign operations appropriations for resources in future years normally executive branch spending projections for the next several years receive little attention because they are routinely adjusted in subsequent budget proposals with congress and the president committed to balancing the budget by 2002 however administration and congressional projections for international affairs and other discretionary spending take on added significance as the target date grows close 14 as agreed to sec4001 of pl 10518 allowed the president to waive the 225 million earmark of aid to ukraine for projects assisting the ukrainian government if he determined that ukraine had not made significant progress toward economic reform and the elimination of corruption senate amendment proposed by senator stevens barring aid to uruguay unless cases involving the seizure of us business assets in that country have been resolved was dropped by conferees crs29 as illustrated in figure 2 the budget agreement reached on may 15 sets international affairs discretionary spending for fy1999 at 196 billion in real terms slightly 08 above amounts for fy1998 this is followed by downward slide to 164 billion stated in fy1998 dollars by 2002 level 127 below this year in real terms for foreign operations however the decline in available resources would likely begin in fy1999 this is because the amount function 150 is scheduled to rise in fy1999 would be more than absorbed solely by proposal to clear us arrears to the 921 million an activity funded under the commerce justice state departments appropriation measure as result foreign operations most likely would be left with an amount less than the 13324 billion requested for fy1998 in order to meet these outyear targets large foreign operations budget items especially such as usaids development aid program contributions to the world bank and other multilateral agencies middle east assistance and the export import bank would require close examination for cost savings in future years figure 2 international affairs budget

foreign operations bill foreign aid authorization measure will establish the maximum amount available to be appropriated for each account and include numerous conditions restrictions and policy language regarding foreign assistance programs it may also include text of contentious legislative provisions such as population aid policy that because of the absence of authorization bills have been dealt with in the foreign operations spending measure if so these nonappropriation and often controversial matters would be removed from the foreign operations debate crs30 the house international relations committee reported on may 9 hr 1486 the foreign policy reform act measure that was scheduled to be taken up by the house in early june when it appeared that the bill did not have sufficient support to pass house leaders pulled the legislation and substituted measure that excluded most foreign assistance provisions reported in hr 1486 new foreign aid authorization bill was introducedhr
