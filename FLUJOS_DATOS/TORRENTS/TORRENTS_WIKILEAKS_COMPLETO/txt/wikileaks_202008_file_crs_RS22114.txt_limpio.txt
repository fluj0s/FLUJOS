normal trade relations pntr that is nondiscriminatory trade status the importance of the issue had been elevated since the orange revolution in ukraine that led to the election of viktor yushchenko as president of ukraine the issue before congress was whether to remove the requirements of title iv of the trade act of 1974 including the socalled jacksonvanik amendment and authorize the president to extend unconditional nondiscriminatory treatment to trade with ukraine on march 8 2006 the house passed 4172 hr 1053 and the senate passed unanimous consent it on march 9 2006 president bush signed it pl 109205 on march 23 2006 this report will be updated as events warrant permanent normal trade relations pntr status has been an issue in usukrainian relations since the country obtained its full sovereignty with the collapse of the soviet union in december 1991 legislation to grant pntr to ukraine had been introduced in previous congresses but received further action as critics raised concerns about some ukrainian trade practices among other issues recently the significance of the issue has been elevated in the wake of the orange revolution in ukraine that led to the election of president viktor yushchenko at the end of 2004 at his april 4 2005 washington summit meeting with president yushchenko president bush pledged to work towards securing pntr for ukraine in his april 6 2005 address to joint meeting of the us congress president yushchenko urged members of congress to grant ukraine pntr while ostensibly trade issue granting pntr is seen by many as also foreign policy instrument to convey us support for democraticallyelected leader who has indicated his intention to strengthen ties with the united states and western europe and reduce dependence on russia yushchenko has made pntr top priority in us congressional research service the library of congress crs2 ukrainian relations1 at the same time some view debate on pntr as an opportunity for the congress to weigh in on us policy toward ukraine and to make sure that us economic interests as well as foreign policy interests are considered granting ukraine pntr status requires change in law because ukraine is denied unconditional and permanent ntr under title iv of the trade act of 1974 which includes the socalled jacksonvanik amendment what is ntr status and the jacksonvanik amendment normal trade relations ntr or mostfavorednation mfn trade status is used to denote nondiscriminatory treatment of trading partner compared to that of other countries only few countries do not have ntr status in trade with the united states in practice duties on the imports from country which has been granted ntr status are set at lower concessional rates than those from countries that do not receive such httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22114 treatment thus imports from nonntr country can be at large price disadvantage compared with imports from ntrstatus countries section 401 of title iv of the trade act of 1974 requires the president to continue to deny nondiscriminatory status to any country that was not receiving such treatment at the time of the laws enactment on january 3 1975 in effect this meant all communist countries except poland and yugoslavia section 402 of title iv the socalled jackson vanik amendment denies the countries eligibility for ntr status as well as access to us government financial facilities such as the exportimport bank or the overseas private investment corporation opic as long as the country denies its citizens the right of freedom of emigration these restrictions can be removed if the president determines that the country is in full compliance with the freedomofemigration conditions set out under the jacksonvanik amendment for country to maintain that status the president must reconfirm his determination of full compliance in semiannual reports due by june 30 and december 31 to congress his determination can be overturned by the enactment of joint resolution of disapproval concerning the december 31st report the jacksonvanik amendment also permits the president to waive full compliance with the freedomofemigration requirements if he determines that such waiver would promote the objectives of the amendment that is encourage freedom of emigration this waiver authority is subject to annual renewal by the president and to its possible congressional disapproval via joint resolution before country can receive ntr treatment under either the presidential determination of full compliance or the presidential waiver it must have concluded bilateral agreement that provides for among other things reciprocal extension of ntr or mfn treatment the agreement and presidential proclamation extending ntr status cannot go into effect unless joint resolution approving the agreement is enacted 1 see crs report rl32845 ukraines orange revolution and us policy by steven woehrel crs3 the united states extended ntr treatment to ukraine under the presidential waiver authority beginning in june 1992 after the two countries signed and entered into force bilateral agreement as required under title iv of the trade act of 1974 since june 1997 ukraine has received ntr status under the full compliance provision presidential extensions of ntr status to ukraine have met with virtually congressional opposition thus for ukraine permanent normal trade relations pntr status is mostly symbolic because its tariff status would not change while ukraine remains subject to the jacksonvanik amendment some of the other former soviet republics have been granted pntr by the united states for example kyrgyzstan and georgia received pntr in 2000 most recently armenia received pntr in january 2005 usukrainian economic ties during the cold war ussoviet economic ties were very limited they were httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22114 constrained by national security and foreign policy restrictions including the jackson vanik amendment they were also limited by soviet economic policies of central planning that prohibited foreign investment and tightly controlled foreign trade since the collapse of the soviet union ukraine has struggled with shedding the structures of planned economy and building market economy these problems hampered ukraines economic growth early in the transition period in the last few years ukraines gross domestic product gdp has grown at fairly rapid rates but many observers contend that ukraine needs to address problems with contradictory and excessive government regulations and corruption if it is to reach its economic potential ukraine remains heavily tied economically to russia it is highly dependent on russia for energy and russia accounts for around 18 of ukraines exports and 40 of ukraines imports however ukraine has been diversifying its trading partners the eu has become an important trading partner2 the united states has encouraged closer economic ties with ukraine since the collapse of the soviet union along with granting conditional ntr status the united states has made government loan guarantees from the us exportimport bank available to us exporters to ukraine and has made insurance and credit programs from the governmentoperated overseas private investment corporation opic available to us investors in the ukraine although increasing usukrainian trade remains very small in 2005 ukraine was the 78th export market for the united states and the 75th source of imports it accounted for about 05 of total us exports and 07 of total us imports in 2005 in 2004 the united states accounted for about 3 of ukrainian exports and 2 of ukrainian imports in 2005 over half of us imports from ukraine consisted of steel and steel products plus coke that is used in making steel sharp increase in us imports from ukraine in 2004 2 economist intelligence unit country risk service ukraine march 2005 p 17 crs4 was due largely to the lifting the us government restrictions on steel imports that had been in place from march 2002 to december 2003 foreign investment in ukraine is modest excessive government regulation an inadequate commercial code corruption lack of enforcement of property rights and an underdeveloped banking system have contributed to poor investment climate3 as of january 1 2005 the volume of foreign direct investment fdi investment in production facilities real estate etc in ukraine stood at 84 billion of that amount investors from the united states accounted for 12 billion or 14 and were the leading source of fdi in ukraine4 issues in usukrainian economic ties several economic issues may arise during debate on pntr for ukraine from the us perspective one of the most serious issues is the lack of ukrainian enforcement of intellectual property rights ipr the united states trade representative ustr httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22114 identified ukraine as priority foreign country in 2002 2003 and 2004 under the section 182 of the trade act of 1974 as amended also called special 301 at this time ukraine is the only country that the ustr has so identified although other countries have been identified as potentially problematic5 the ustr took this action because of ukraines failure to adequately prevent the production and distribution of pirated optical disks cds and cdroms as result the united states withdrew gsp benefits for ukraine in august 2001 benefit that the united states had extended to promote trade and economic development in ukraine in january 2002 the united states also imposed 100 tariffs under 23 tariff items with an annual value of around 75 million6 on august 31 2005 the united states announced that it was going to lift the tariffsanctions in recognition of steps ukraine had taken to improve its ipr laws the office of the ustr announced on january 23 2006 that it has restored ukraines gsp benefits 7 us exporters and investors have cited other problems that plague the business environment in ukraine for example the ukrainian government prevents foreign banking and insurance providers from establishing branches in addition us exporters consider some ukrainian government health and safety regulations and certification procedures to be unnecessarily burdensome and government procedures for privatizing stateowned assets to be insufficiently transparent us agricultural producers consider 3 us department of commerce us and foreign commercial service doing business in ukraine country commercial guide for us companies february 2005 not paginated 4 ibid and the ukrainian statistical office 5 office of the united state trade representative special 301 report washington 2004 6 under special 301 the ustr is required to identify each year trading partners that do not adequately protect intellectual property rights if that country fails to remedy the situation then the ustr is required to apply trade sanctions commensurate with the losses to us holders of the ipr 7 international trade reporter september 8 2005 p 1419 crs5 ukraines restrictions on imports of american pork poultry and beef to be unscientifically based and unnecessary8 along with the current application of the jacksonvanik amendment ukrainian officials have raised other issues in its trade relations with the united states foremost among them is the application of nonmarket economy nme status by the us department of commerce to trade with ukraine under us antidumping laws fair prices for imports from nonmarket economies are calculated differently then prices on imports from market economies the methodology used to make these calculations leads to higher antidumping margins and therefore places imports from ukraine at competitive disadvantage visavis other imports or us domestic production in august 2002 the department of commerce indefinitely deferred its final decision on whether to eliminate the nme designation for ukraine and told ukraine it needed to resubmit its request for such status the ukrainian government did so in march 2005 and the commerce department granted ukraine nme status on february 17 2006 prospects implications and legislation httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22114 although pntr has been an issue in usukrainian relations for many years trade issues and political issues such as allegations of official ukrainian involvement in the september 2000 murder of ukrainian investigative journalist georgy gongadze had caused us political leaders to distance themselves from the regime of thenukrainian president kuchma the election of president viktor yushchenko has elevated the priority of pntr for the bush administration and the congress support for pntr for ukraine appears strong nevertheless concerns about ipr protection in ukraine and other trade issues are likely to arise during debate on pntr some nontrade issues may arise as well for example while the representatives of the jewish community acknowledge improvement in the lives of ukrainian jews they have expressed concerns about what they consider to be the slow pace at which jewish community property seized during the holocaust and the soviet period is being returned its owners granting ukraine pntr status will have little direct impact on usukrainian trade ukrainian imports have entered the united states on an ntr or mostfavorednation mfn basis since 1992 however ukraine is negotiating with the united states and other members of the world trade organization to enter the wto wto members must extend reciprocal mfn pntr treatment to one another if ukraine becomes wto members and the united states does not grant ukraine pntr it would force the united states to invoke the nonapplication article xiii of the wto agreement which would prevent the application of the entire wto agreement including all of ukraines concessions between the united states and ukraine pntr has considerable political importance to ukraine it would signify ukraines treatment as normal country by the united states the timing of extending pntr could have political implications as well especially relating to russia russian president putin has been pressing the united states to grant it pntr president bush has pledged 8 office of the united states trade representative national trade estimates report on foreign trade barriers march 2005 crs6 to him on several occasions to work with the congress to obtain pntr but legislation introduced in the 107th and 108th congresses to do so received further congressional action because of concerns regarding russian ipr and other trade practices the russian political leadership would likely be upset if ukraine received pntr from the united states before russia the house passed 4172 hr 1053 gerlach on march 8 2006 the senate passed unanimous consent it on march 9 2006 the president signed the bill into law on march 23 2006 pl 109205 hr 1053 authorizes the president to determine that title iv of the trade act of 1974 as amended would longer apply to ukraine and to proclaim nondiscriminatory treatment normal trade relations status to the products of ukraine9 under hr 1053 once the president has taken these actions title iv including the jacksonvanik amendment would longer apply to ukraine httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22114 9 on april 5 2005 sen mccain az introduced an amendment samdt 267 to s 600 bill to authorize funding for the state department that would eliminate the jacksonvanik requirements for ukraine the amendment is pending at this writing
