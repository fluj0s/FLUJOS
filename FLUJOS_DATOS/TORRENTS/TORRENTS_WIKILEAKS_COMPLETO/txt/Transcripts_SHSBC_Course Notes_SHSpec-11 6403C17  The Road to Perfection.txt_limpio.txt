6403c17 shspec11 the road to perfection lrh has had gamble on time going since january of 1963 the question was could he complete the job before the roof fell in he neglected organizations and scientologists until february of 1964 in order to research full time msh caught the brunt of it august marked the point at which he found out that it could be done the materials were there from then until january of 1964 the material was labelled codified and put together so that it could be communicated at the same time bridge had to be created from the man on the street up to reach for the upper levels one that would be real to the man on the street that was more difficult operation person has to be walked forward with wins at every step that are real to the person so that he will keep going forward and not get discouraged some pcs in fact most pcs cannot have win that amounts to anything at all the tiniest of wins is all that would be tolerable to such person at apathy there is low acceptance level of win eg nothing terrible happened to today would be the highest acceptable level of win to such person so you may have to rehabilitate the pcs ability to have win too for this reason it is more difficult to get someone from level 0 to level iv than to get him from level v on up he has certainty yet it is easier to climb mont blanc with an experienced mountaineer than it is to climb foothill with girl in tight dress and spike heels there is political problem in that we are faced with world that is getting more and more pessimistic and bent on giving people wins the acceptance level of win dwindles away to practically nothing anyway lrh did the job in time so now he is working out organization classification etc basic auditing has been put into good condition it has been rough but it has made seasoned individuals things dont have to be smooth if they are certain giving someone gradient series of wins can be interfered with by his having minor arc breaks and stopping auditing for awhile or there is someone who is openminded win isnt available and you get discouraged and give up seeing that win is available you dont create one dissemination hangs up on this one point the available win you write off someone if you see win available but that is monitored by your acceptance level of win you have to be able to accept level of win that is so low that it is real to the public person the scale of win is gradient scale it is important to anyone trying to get somewhere with scientology it has two sides an outward win of assisting someone and an inward win of being assisted it is win for someone if he assists and lose if he fails to assist based on his intention to assist if an auditor helps pc and the pc doesnt recognize the change in order to feel good about it the auditor must have certainty of observation that requires agreement from the pc that something has been done you have to be able to see and be certain of having seen win in pc whose acceptance of wins is so low that he doesnt know that he has had one your certainty level has got to be high that is an almost impossible level to attain but if you dont attain it you will go into agreement with the pc on acceptability of wins comfort relaxed frame of mind and some serenity about things requires that you know the exact situation and know that it is the exact situation true selfconfidence and poise as opposed to the ability to endure or suffer depends on the ability to conceive the truth of any situation knowing the truth of the existing situation is the only thing that supports selfconfidence most departures from the truth come about as an effort to attain safety and selfsecurity from fear of what might happen to him mans civilization forces lies on him at many points by making telling the truth uncomfortable or even fatal it promulgates the idea that if you said nothing but the truth for 24 hours you would lose everything but if one fails to announce truth one is to that degree protecting lie at this point person begins to surround himself with lies so society brings the individual to tolerate lies it sees virtue in lies it aids lies recognition of the truth is therefore converted into enduring the truth this is downscale mockery of an upscale item recognition of the truth in situation is the only way to asis the situation however one can be confronted with so much truth that one cannot asis it and one gets swamped by it this discourages person from recognizing truth also it leads to notis of truth it is lack of gradient that brings person away from recognition of truth and makes him less clearsighted there is gradient and youve got to have one time enters into it since it is part of gradient for instance the french revolution was the result of ramming in couple of major truths too fast political freedom is ok people could be educated to advantage but there was gradient so the french people ended up more debased after the revolution than before the truth of the situation wasnt gradiently recognized or approached there was evolution from darkness to dazzle the true believer has real reality with the truth that he espouses truth requires reality which is the ability to assimilate truth if someone reaches with gradient with reality they wind up with reality on truth it is not ever assimilated assimilation depends on causedistanceeffect on communication and on an even balance of mind affinity while assimilating truth without arc is denied to the individual and can wrong and harm him truth must go hand in glove with understanding if there is understanding truth is not truth to anyone it is just truth all truths are attainable transcendentalism the notion that the truth transcends our ability to understand is lot of baloney there is point in studying the route to truth if you dont know what the truth is studying the truth when one has idea of what the truth is when one has idea of what one is looking for is like looking for memphis without having any idea that there are any towns called memphis or even that there are any towns it is an idiotic activity lets all sit down and study how we can get to gmpsxgrtz and then nobody ever asks what is gmpsxgrtz what do you mean how to get there is it road across space is it measured by time is it spacetime journey that we are making what kind of journey is this to gmpsxgrtz the answer is we11 lets just discuss how to get to gmpsxgrtz the above totally bogs down philosophy kant solved it by saying that you could never find out what gmpsmgrtz is he cut off speculation the work of all current gurus adepts and of lao tze etc is all concerned with how you approach truth with idea of what truth is this is ridiculous lrh performed the flatworm experiment in 1938 and found that memory was transferable in monocell lrh points out that current experimenters in the area will quit soon because their results will shortly get bizarre enough as with the advent of past lives in the wichita foundation so that their appropriations will be cut off since their researches will be too unreal to their money sources we are in an optimum condition with regard to knowing what truth we are trying to approach since we can demonstrate by exteriorization separation between the person and the body we know that we are going towards the free individual we know that our road to truth is the creation of such an individual we know that there is difference in orders of life between man and vegetable we know what truth we are trying to attain everybody has some sympathetic harmonic with that truth what is their reaction to it it depends on their reality on the approach to this truth we know that life is right there where the pc is sitting so to get to truth journey across time and space is not really required the journey consists of undoing the lies by which the person has walled himself in all we have to do to recover the individual and his ability is to undo the turns for the worse that he has taken we are traveling road that has been followed only backwards the way the tao whatever we know what it is it is the road that the individual has followed from degree of perfection and beingness and selfness on down to disintegration forgettingness bluntingness until hes in the state you find him in all the auditor has to do is walk him back that road its all there its all metermarked we are taking each lie in turn that landmarked further degradation and undoing it we are recovering the individual and his potential so the road to truth adds up to 1 the individuals potential 2 the situations in which the persons potential got lessened and what has happened to this individual 3 how this individual is related to the rest of the universe 4 what we can do to restore the potential of that person that is all part of the truth truth from the viewpoint of the auditor is what actually happened or the situation that actually exists at any moment in the state of beingness of an individual it is not the ultimate that we are seeking to attain it is not something transcendental truth is that which exists the road to truth might be better called the road to perfection or to an ultimate truth truth is usually all hedged up in so many pitches and so many directions that people want you to go so many curves on the line that you cant separate the wheat from the chaff we know where we are going and how to get there what it takes but we have not mastered an estimation of the individuals ability to conceive of truth you may be talking to grocer about scientology but actually you are talking to him about the road to perfection the composition of himself who are you what do you consist of what potentials do you have what potentials have you robbed yourself of where are you going what is life what is your relationship on any dynamic you may be using the word scientology but these are the things you have embarked upon to discuss and the unanswered question is what can he recognize we need to master the estimation of persons ability to assimilate truth it is not hard to overwhump someone with big chunk of truth eg by exteriorizing him you have had the experience of exteriorizing someone and then having him say omigawd im and its it and then two hours later what exteriorization i wasnt exteriorized well possibly something happened but i dont know youve shot the guy momentarily into the rarefied air of being able to see it but he couldnt have it so you can show people things they cant have and thats how you generate an unreality if we had gradient between wog and ot we would soon get very unreal to everybody but ourselves you can show people things they cant have thus generating an unreality the common denominator here is hit with too much truth the individual degrades you hit this guy he exteriorizes bang he says im im spirit i dont have mass body is body im different than it two hours later hes harder to process his ability to win has been exceeded and he has lost it puts you on withhold not to lay the truth before people so lay out the truth but provide the road by having levels of acceptable truths or realities that an individual can attain establish and rehabilitate his ability to win so that eventually he can have truth and that way you wont just throw the person into complete frothing ecstatic worshipping apathy this is the condition of the true believer in the past when people got some truth they built up secrecy about it but the route must exist and must be wide open not cloaked in secrecy training and skill do have to be there but there is other effort at secrecy the main point is to provide gradient scale to get people up to higher reality the route must exist wide open even if 100 of the people dont travel it
