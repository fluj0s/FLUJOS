summary federally supported child nutrition programsinitiatives and the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children the wic program reach more than 39 million children and 2 million lowerincome pregnant postpartum women in fy2006 spending on them is anticipated to be 184 billion supported by new appropriations of lesser amount 179 billion the administrations fy2007 budget request envisions spending total of 191 billion with new appropriations of 188 billion for fy2007 the house and senate appropriations bills hr 5384 call for spending 192 billion supported by new appropriations of 186 billion in the house and 189 billion in the senate child nutrition programs the school lunch and school breakfast programs provide cash subsidies for all meals they serve to schools choosing to participate larger subsidies are granted for free and reducedprice meals offered to lowerincome children the child and adult care food program subsidizes mealssnacks served by child care centers and day care homes federal subsidy rules differ significantly between those provided to centers and those for day care homes schools and organizations operating programs for children also can receive subsidies for snacks and in some cases meals served in afterschool and other outsideofschool settings the summer food service program subsidizes food service operations by publicprivate nonprofit sponsors volunteering to operate projects during the summer all mealssnacks they serve are free the special milk program operates in schools and other venues without lunch program and subsidizes all milk served all these subsidies are inflationindexed and are paid only where the mealssnacks meet federal nutrition and other standards in addition to cash aid many providers receive food commodities from the agriculture department at set value per meal and may receive bonus commodities from department surplus stocks grants also are made to help cover state administrative expenses other significant federal programsactivities include free fresh fruit and vegetable program in selected schools money for food service management institute small nutrition education initiative activities to improve program integrity meal quality food service and safety and support for local school wellness policies separately the wic program provides nutrition services eg nutrition education breastfeeding support and tailored food packages to lowerincome pregnant and postpartum women infants and children who are judged to be at nutritional risk and wic farmers market program offers vouchers to wic recipients for the purchase of fresh fruit and vegetables at farmers markets these are administered by the agriculture departments food and nutrition service and state education health social service and agriculture agencies they actually are operated under state oversight by over 300000 local providers such as schools child care centers health clinics federal payments do not necessarily cover all program costs and nonfederal support is significant eg childrens families school meal payments statelocal contributions this report will be updated as warranted

funding general background child nutrition programs and the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children the wic program provide cash commodity and other assistance including nutrition services and food packages in the wic program under three major federal laws the national school lunch act originally enacted in 1946 and renamed the richard b russell national school lunch in 1999 the child nutrition act originally enacted in 1966 and section 32 of the act of august 24 1935 7 usc 612c1 the agriculture departments food and nutrition service fns administers the programs at the federal level most funding is included in the annual agriculture department appropriations laws and congressional jurisdiction is exercised by the senate agriculture nutrition and forestry committee the house education and the workforce committee and to limited extent relating to commodity assistance and section 32 the house agriculture committee the most recent major amendments to the laws affecting child nutrition and wic programs were made in the 2004 child nutrition and wic reauthorization act pl 108265 enacted june 30 2004 and number of laws enacted in the 106th and 107th congresses most notably as part of larger measures not specifically targeted at child nutrition or wic programs eg pl 106224 and pl 107171 the next general reauthorization of child nutrition and wic authorities is scheduled for 2009 note for information about legislation see 1 crs report 96987 child nutrition legislation in the 104th congress 2 crs report 97108 child nutrition issues in the 105th

legislation in the 108th and 109th congresses by joe richardson section 32 authority provides funding for cash child nutrition subsidies permanent appropriations under section 32 are transferred to the child nutrition account annually and the acquisition of food commodities for distribution to child nutrition programs section 32 money is used to buy surplus and distribute commodities for more information see crs report rs20235 farm and food support under usdas section 32 program by geoffrey becker crs2 child nutrition and wic programs are operated by variety of local public and private nonprofit providers and the degree of direct state involvement varies by program and state eg in the wic program state health agencies exercise substantial control in the school meal programs local educational agencies leas and local school food authorities most often have the major role in very few instances the federal government fns takes the place of state agencies for example where state has chosen not to operate specific program or where there is state prohibition on aiding private schools at the state level education health social services and agriculture departments all have roles at minimum they are responsible for approving and overseeing local providers such as schools summer program sponsors and child care centers as well as making sure they receive the federal support they are due at the local level program benefits are provided to more than 39 million children and infants and some 2 million lowerincome pregnant and postpartum women through just over 100000 public and private schools and residential child care institutions about 200000 child care centers and family day care homes approximately 30000 summer program sites and in the case of the wic program some 10000 local health care clinicssites operated by nearly 2000 health agencies all programs are available in the 50 states and the district of columbia virtually all operate in puerto rico guam and the virgin islands and there are restrictions on eligibility related to citizenship or legal residence status american samoa gets assistance for school lunch and wic operations and the northern marianas receive school lunch support in addition wiclike benefits are available for overseas military personnel and defense department overseas dependents schools participate in the school lunch and breakfast programs in the meal service programs like the school lunch and school breakfast programs summer programs and assistance for child care centers and day care homes federal aid is in the form of legislatively set subsidies paid for each mealsnack served that meets federal nutrition guidelines most subsidies are cash payments to schools and other providers but about 10 of the total value of assistance is in the form of federally donated food commodities while all mealssnacks served are subsidized those served free or at reduced price to lower income children are supported at higher rates all federal mealsnack subsidy rates are indexed annually for inflation2 as are the income standards of eligibility for free and reducedprice mealssnacks3 however federal subsidies do not necessarily cover the full cost of the meals and snacks offered by participating providers and states and localities contribute significantly to cover program costs as do 2 most often using the food away from home component of the consumer price index cpi for all urban consumers 3 cash subsidy rates and income eligibility standards typically differ are higher for alaska and hawaii however 1 while free milk eligibility standards vary for alaska and hawaii in the special milk program federal subsidies do not and 2 since commodity support is provided without regard to the freereducedprice character of meals served commodity assistance rates do not differ for alaska and hawaii cash subsidy rates and eligibility standards for the district of columbia guam puerto rico and the virgin islands are those for the contiguous 48 states crs3 childrens families by paying charges for nonfree or reducedprice meals and snacks required nonfederal costsharing matching is relatively minimal states must expend at least an amount totaling just over 200 million year nationally in order to receive federal school lunch funds federal permealsnack child nutrition subsidies may cover local providers administrative costs but separate federal payments for administrative expenses are limited to administrative expense grants to state oversight agencies small setaside of funds for state audits of child care sponsors and special administrative payments to sponsors of summer programs and family day care homes under the wic program federal appropriations pay the cost of specifically tailored food packages and include specific amounts for related nutrition services and administration the basic goals of the federal child nutrition programs are to improve childrens nutrition increase lowerincome childrens access to nutritious meals and snacks and help support the agricultural economy child nutrition programs are treated as entitlements federal funding and commodity support is guaranteed to schools and other providers based on the number of mealssnackshalfpints of milk served who is served eg free mealssnacks to poor children get higher subsidies and legislatively set and inflationindexed permealsnack subsidy rates on the other hand the wic program is discretionary grant program wic agencies serve as many applicants as possible with the money available from federal grants and in some cases voluntary state subsidies but not necessarily all eligible applicants extensive information about child nutrition programs and the wic program may be found at the agriculture departments food and nutrition service website httpwwwfnsusdagov this website provides information on all of the following programs for applicantsrecipients governments researchers program operators and those interested in child nutrition legislation regulations and guidelines as well as recent news releases announcements and regulatory action programs and participation school lunch program public and private nonprofit schools and residential child care institutions rccis including defense department overseas dependents schools choosing to participate in the school lunch program receive permeal federal cash subsidies and federally donated commodities for all lunches they serve to schoolchildren while similar aid primarily federally donated commodities for school meals was provided as early as the mid1930s the basic school lunch program as it operates today dates to the enactment of the 1946 national school lunch act and major changes to the law in the early 1960s and early 1970s subsidized meals must meet federal nutrition standards based on recommended dietary allowances rdas and the dietary guidelines for americans and certain food safety requirements participating schoolsrccis also must guarantee to offer freereducedprice meals to lowerincome children adhere to federally set crs4 administrative standards under state oversight and follow buy american rules4 however there is only minimal federal regulation of foods offered separately from subsidized school meals competitive foods such as carte items and food sold from vending machines cash subsidies are set by federal school lunch law and indexed annually each july for inflation and the amount of federal aid is not dependent on providers costs these cash subsidies also called reimbursement rates differ depending on whether the lunch is served free at reduced price more than 40 cents or at full price paid meals for which participating school or rcci may charge as it sees fit free lunch cash subsidies are paid for meals served to those who apply and are judged eligible claiming annual family cash income below 130 of the inflation indexed federal poverty guidelines eg 21580 for family of three or 26000 for fourperson family in the 20062007 school year free lunch eligibility also is extended automatically to children who are directly certified eligible as public assistance eg food stamp recipients migrant and homeless children and those served under federal runaway and homeless youth grant programs for the 20062007 school year these basic freelunch subsidies are 240 lunch reducedprice lunch subsidies are paid for meals served to those who apply with family income between 130 and 185 of the inflationindexed poverty guidelines eg between 21580 and 30710 for family of three or between 26000 and 37000 for fourperson family in the 20062007 school year for the 20062007 school year these basic reducedprice subsidies are 200 lunch subsidies for fullprice paid lunches are paid for meals served to children with family income above 185 of the poverty guidelines eg above 30710 for family of three or 37000 for fourperson family in the 20062007 school year or whose families do not apply for free or reducedprice lunches for the 2006 2007 school year these subsidies are 23 cents lunch all of the above rates are increased by flat 2 cents lunch for schoolsrccis with very high 60 free and reducedprice participation about half of all lunches are subsidized with this added 2 cents5 4 buy american rules require that participating schools purchase usproduced agricultural commodities and food products processed in the us using usproduced commodities to the maximum extent practicable these rules apply to schools located in the continental us in addition special rule directs schools in hawaii and puerto rico to buy commodities or food products produced there if they are produced in sufficient quantities to meet schools needs 5 participating schools may offer all meals free and not make annual freereducedprice eligibility determinations for individual students or separately count free reducedprice and fullprice meals if they pay any extra cost ie claim from the federal government only the estimated amount they would have received if they had operated regular free reducedprice and fullprice meal program this choice generally is used by schools with very high proportions of needy children it reduces the burden of making individual eligibility determinations and simplifies daily meal counts and procedures for claiming continued crs5 on top of cash subsidies schoolsrccis are entitled to federal commodity assistance also discussed later in this report for any lunch served under this rule schoolsrccis are entitled to receive entitlement commodities valued at minimum of 1675 cents lunch in the 20062007 school year this amount is inflation indexed annually each july two special provisions are made with regard to fresh fruit and vegetables 1 50 million taken from the amount schools are entitled to in commodities is set aside and used to make available fresh fruit and vegetables through department of defense distribution systems the dod fresh program and 2 about 400 schools in 14 states and 3 indian reservations receive assistance to operate program under which all students are offered free fresh fruit and vegetables6 in addition to the regular school lunch program schoolsrccis may expand their program to cover snacks served to children through age 18 in afterschool programs or other programs operating outside regular school schedules during the school year serving an educational enrichment purpose7 federal subsidies are paid to schools operating these programs at the free snack rate offered to child care centers if the snacks are served free to children in lowerincome areas in other cases subsidies vary by the childs family income see the later discussion of the child and adult care food program for the various federal subsidy rates for snacks as well as separate authority for child care organizations including schools to get subsidies for snacks and in some cases meals served free in afterschool programs finally the 2004 child nutrition reauthorization law pl 108265 requires local educational agencies participating in school meal programs to establish local school wellness policies as they determine appropriate these policies are to include goalspolicies for nutrition education physical activity nutrition guidelines for all 5 continued federal subsidies thereby saving schools administrative costs three options to accomplish this are offered to schools the two most widely used are named provision 2 and provision 3 under provision 2 schools make freereducedprice eligibility determinations in the first year of fouryear cycle in the following three years they count the total number of meals served and the percentages of free reducedprice and fullprice meals served in the first year are applied to the total meal count to calculate their federal subsidies under provision 3 schools can for four years receive federal subsidies equal to those received in the last year in which they made freereducedprice eligibility determinations adjusted for enrollment changes and inflation for both provisions schools may be approved for fouryear extensions if the composition of their school population remains stable 6 this free fresh fruit and vegetable program is funded separately from the school lunch program it began as pilot project established by the 2002 farm bill pl 107171 and was expanded given mandatory annual funding and made permanent by the 2004 child nutrition reauthorization law pl 108265 9 million year was provided to operate the program in selected schools in eight states and three indian reservations later law pl 10997 expanded the number of covered states to 14 and added funding 6 million for fy2006 7 additional useful information on afterschool programs is available through the website of the food research and action center frac httpwwwfracorg crs6 foods available on campus during the school day and plan for measuring implementation of the policy in fy2005 well more than 90 of schools and rccis got school lunch program subsidies some 95000 schools enrolling 493 million children and 6000 rccis with almost 300000 children average daily participation in the regular lunch program during the school year was about 296 million children 60 of enrollment in participating schoolsrccis children receiving free lunches averaged 145 million day 49 of participants or 29 of enrollment those paying for reduced price lunches averaged 29 million day 10 of participants or 6 of enrollment and those buying fullprice lunches averaged 122 million day 41 of participants or 25 of enrollment8 average daily participation in the afterschool snack component of the school lunch program reached some 1 million children in fy2005 school breakfast program9 as with the school lunch program all breakfasts meeting federal nutrition standards and other rules applicable to the school lunch program are subsidized in participating public and private nonprofit schools and rccis including defense department overseas dependents schools inflationindexed subsidy rates set by federal law vary depending on whether the breakfast is served free at reduced price more than 30 cents or at full price the school breakfast program dates back to twoyear pilot project first established by the 1966 child nutrition act and made permanent in 1975 income eligibility standards for free and reducedprice breakfasts are the same as in the school lunch program see the earlier discussion and for the 20062007 school year basic cash subsidies are 131 per free breakfast 101 per reducedprice breakfast and 24 cents per fullprice breakfast10 special severe need rates an extra 25 cents for each free or reducedprice breakfast indexed annually are paid to schools and rccis with relatively high 40 free and reducedprice participation and the majority of breakfasts are subsidized at this higher rate with the exception of different subsidy rates and the lack of specific entitlement to commodity support the school breakfast program operates very much like the school lunch program although in fewer schools and with lower rate of participation among enrolled children as with the school lunch program participation in the school breakfast program by schools and rccis is voluntary although number of states have enacted laws requiring some schools with lunch programs to join the breakfast program 8 there is noticeable gap between the proportion of children whose families apply and who are certified eligible for free or reducedprice lunches and the proportion of children who actually participate based on estimates from the 19992000 school year at least 10 more students are certified eligible than participate 9

million day 18 of participants or 4 of enrollment child and adult care food program cacfp11 the cacfp dates to 1968 when federal assistance for programs serving children outside of school special food service programs was first authorized in 1975 the summer food service and child care components were first formally separated as individual programs public private nonprofit and under certain conditions forprofit nonresidential child care centers typically serving 3050 children or more choosing to participate in the cacfp receive cash subsidies for each meal or snack they serve up to two meals and one snack or two snacks and one meal per child day or three meals day in emergency homeless shelters eligible centers also include after school projects and head start centers as well as recreational centers centers caring for children with disabilities and residential emergency homeless shelters in order to qualify for subsidies mealssnacks must meet federal nutrition standards and be served to children age 12 or under or migrant children age 15 or under or children with disabilities in the case of emergencyhomeless shelters the age limit is 18 in addition participating centers receive commodity assistance see the later discussion of commodity distribution or cashinlieu of commodities this represents about 4 of the value of aid they get inflationindexed federal cash subsidies to centers vary by the type of meal served breakfast lunchsupper snack similar to the school meal programs these subsidies vary by whether they are served to 1 children with family income below 130 of the federal poverty income guidelines for those who would be eligible for free school meal see the school lunch program discussion 2 children with family income between 130 and 185 of the poverty guidelines those who would be eligible for reducedprice school meal see the school lunch program discussion or 3 children with family income above 185 of the poverty guidelines those who would not be eligible for either free or reducedprice school meal12 11 under this program few adult day care centers some 1600 sponsors with about 2600 sites serving 100000 persons in fy2005 also receive subsidies for meals and snacks served to elderly and chronically impaired disabled adults under the same basic terms as child care centers 12 at state option subsidies for centers also may be calculated according to the family income demographics of the center granting standard subsidy for each mealsnack that is weighted or blended to reflect the family income makeup of the centers children continued crs8 subsidies for lunches or suppers and breakfasts are the same as those noted above for the school lunch and breakfast programs for july 2006june 2007 the subsidies for snacks are 65 cents for free snacks 32 cents for reducedprice snacks and 6 cents for all other snacks however unlike the school meal programs while federal cash subsidies differ according to the family income of individual children in center there is requirement that free or reducedprice meals be served centers may adjust their fees to account for the federal subsidies or charge or not charge separately for meals to account for the subsidies but the cacfp itself does not regulate the fees they charge the cacfp generally operates through child care centers that are public or private nonprofit entities however forprofit child care centers can participate in the cacfp if they meet certain conditions they are qualified if they receive at least some payments derived from title xx of the social security act the federal social services block grant for at least 25 of enrolled children13 in addition under pilot project that began operating in iowa and kentucky more liberal test can be applied to forprofit centers they may participate if at least 25 of enrolled children meet the family income requirements for freereducedprice school meals this pilot was expanded to delaware in fy2002 finally under provisions of law enacted in december 2000 pl 106554 the more liberal iowakentuckydelaware rule was made applicable nationwide the nationwide authority granted in the december 2000 law originally covered fy2001 only but series of laws pl 10776 pl 108 134 and pl 108211 extended it through june 30 2004 and pl 108265 made it permanent and nationally applicable14 as result there now are three potential methods by which forprofit centers can qualify the original title xx rule the pooling variation of that rule see footnote 13 and most important the now permanent and nationwide iowakentuckydelaware rule in addition to the regular cacfp the law allows organizations that would normally be eligible to participate in the regular cacfp as child care centers including schools and running afterschool programs or other similar programs operated outside regular school schedules serving an educational enrichment purpose to get federal cacfp subsidies for snacks served free in their programs to children through age 18 in lowerincome areas at the free snack rate noted above15 moreover in seven states delaware illinois michigan missouri pennsylvania new york and oregon the law allows federal subsidies to be 12 continued or weighting total payments to center by its family income makeup 13 under fns policies any funding forprofit centers receive that includes some title xx contribution meets this requirement including funding sources that pool title xx money with other funds eg child care and development block grant ccdbg funding 14 also see 1 crs report

more useful information may be found at the website of the food research and action center frac httpwwwfracorg crs9 offered for free meals typically suppers served in afterschool programs at the free lunch rate 240 supper separately the cacfp provides cash subsidies to family and group day care homes typically serving four to six children this component operates very differently than the component for centers although like centers subsidies for day care homes are limited to two meals and one snack or one meal and two snacks per day per child day care homes receive cash subsidies that generally do not differ by individual childrens family income unlike the subsidy structure in programs for schools and child care centers which differs according to the family income of the child to whom the mealsnack is served16 instead there are two distinct sets of subsidy rates that generally depend on the location of the home or the providers income tier i homes those located in lowerincome areas or operated by lowerincome providers receive higher cash subsidies for july 2006june 2007 all lunchessuppers are subsidized at 197 each all breakfasts are subsidized at 106 and all snacks are subsidized at 58 cents the majority of participating homes are in tier i on the other hand tier ii homes those not located in lowerincome areas or without lowerincome provider receive much lower subsidies for july 2006june 2007 all lunchessuppers are subsidized at 119 each all breakfasts at 39 cents and all snacks at 16 cents tier ii homes may seek the higher tier i rates for individual lower income children and similar to the program in centers day care home sponsors may opt to have subsidies calculated according to the family income demographics of the children in the homes they sponsor if family income documentation is obtained17 day care homes participate under the aegis of public or private nonprofit sponsoring organizations that handle administrative tasks eg overseeing compliance with program requirements making federal subsidy claims these sponsors receive separate inflationindexed monthly payments for their administrativeoversight costs varying according to the number of homes the sponsor oversees for july 2006june 2007 these perhome payments ranged from 50 to 95 month centers may participate either directly as independent centers or through sponsoring organization but center sponsors do not receive additional federal administrative funds although sponsors can assess centers for administration to limited degree participating day care homes and centers generally must meet state or local licensing or other stateset approval requirements or certain alternate federal standards if there are state or local rules applying to them 16 however like the child care component of the program the day care home component of the cacfp does not regulate fees charged parents provision of free or reducedprice mealssnacks is not required although day care homes may adjust their fees to take federal subsidies into account 17 in all cases children of day care home operator must have family income below 185 of the federal poverty income guidelines the income cutoff for reducedprice school meals in order to have their mealsnack subsidized crs10 finally the cacfp funds state costs connected with auditing sponsors and providers states are provided an annual amount equal to 1 of their cacfp subsidies and unused money can be reallocated among states that need it in fy2005 some 47000 centerssites with some 19000 sponsors with an average daily attendance of 21 million children participated 31 660000 of the children were in forprofit centerssites 5 115000 participated in outsideof schoolhour centerssites and 26 540000 were served in head start centerssites in addition 153000 day care home sites with about 1000 sponsors received subsidies for an average daily attendance of 900000 children summer food service program18 local public and private nonprofit service institutions running youthrecreation programs summer feeding projects or camps can receive cash subsidies and some federally donated food commodities for free food service to children aged 18 and younger and older disabled children during the summer participating service institutions also called sponsors often but not of necessity are entities that provide ongoing yearround service to the community and include schools local government agencies camps colleges and universities in the national youth sports program and with some restrictions governing the number of sites and children served private nonprofit organizations eg churches summer programs date to 1968 when federal assistance for special food service programs serving children outside of school was first authorized in 1975 the summer and child care food service components of the old special food service program were first formally separated as individual programs sponsors of three types of summer program sites can be approved 1 open sites operating in lowerincome areas where 50 or more of the children have family income below 185 of the federal poverty guidelines ie more than half of the children are eligible for free or reducedprice school meals 2 enrolled sites where at least half of the children enrolled in sponsors program eg summer education or recreation activity are eligible for free or reducedprice school meals and 3 summer camps summer mealssnacks are provided free to all children at open or enrolled sites and to lowerincome children in camps summer sponsors get operating cost subsidies for all mealssnacks served free one meal and one snack or two meals three meals for children in programs for migrant children per child per day these subsidies cover documented food and food service costs up

subsidy rates are 256 for each lunchsupper 147 for breakfasts and 59 cents for snacks subsidies do not vary by individual childrens family income and most sponsors receive the maximum allowable rates summer program sponsors also receive significant payments for administrative costs up to about 27 cents meal according to the number and type of mealssnacks served and the type of program eg urban vs rural sites self preparation vs contracted vendor preparation and state agencies receive special administrative cost payments for oversight see later discussion of state administrative expenses and health inspections see below schools wishing to sponsor summer programs may effectively bypass most separate summer food service program rules and under seamless summer option operate summer program using school lunch and school breakfast program rules and subsidy rates in addition to subsidies to sponsors states receive direct subsidies for health and meal quality inspection costs related to summer programs an amount equal to 1 of states summer program subsidies in july 2005 nearly 3800 sponsors operating some 30000 sites provided subsidized meals and snacks to an average daily attendance of just under 2 million children in addition at least 16 million children received summer meals subsidized through the school lunch program 14 million of these children received free or reducedprice meals special milk program under this program schools and institutions like summer camps and residential and nonresidential child care facilities not otherwise participating in federally subsidized meal service program along with schools with split partday sessions for kindergartners or prekindergartners where the children do not have access to regular school meal programs provide milk to all children at reduced price or free each halfpint served is federally subsidized at different rate depending on whether it is served free to those meeting criteria for free school lunches or not but the provision of free milk to needy children is up to the participating school and is not required halfpints are subsidized at 145 cents halfpint for the 20062007 school year or at their net cost typically 12 cents higher if served free participating schools and other outlets must have policy of lowering any prices charged for milk they serve to the maximum extent possible and of using their federal payments to reduce the price of milk to children although similar assistance existed in prior years this program dates to 19541955 in fy2005 almost 7000 schools and other outlets served about 100 million subsidized halfpints 7 free to roughly 500000 children 19 continued sponsors in these areas can receive the maximum federal subsidies without documenting all their costs crs12 commodity assistance20 the agriculture department provides commodity support for school lunch program schools the cacfp and the summer food service program federal donations of food commodities for child nutrition operations began in the mid1930s to support the agricultural economy most prominently following the enactment of section 32 of the agricultural act of august 24 1935 in 1974 basic entitlement to commodity assistance was placed in child nutrition law in addition to cash subsidies schools which receive the bulk of federally donated commodities and other providers are entitled to specific dollar value of commodities based on the number of meals they serve21 the inflationindexed each july commodity entitlement is set at 1675 cents meal for the 20062007 school year the department purchases these commodities and pays for most processing costs to fulfill this guarantee with the goals of meeting the preferences of recipient agencies supporting agricultural prices and removing agricultural surpluses schools and other providers also receive bonus commodities donated from federal stocks acquired at the departments discretion for agricultural support reasons eg surplus commodities and excess commodity credit corporation holdings these bonus commodities were valued at 120 million in fy2005 finally the value of commodity donations both entitlement and bonus must equal at least 12 of the total cash and commodity assistance provided under the school lunch program if this 12 requirement is not met the agriculture department is required to purchase and distribute additional commodities to schools because of the value of bonus commodity donations this 12 requirement has not triggered added commodity purchasesdistributions in recent years state administrative expenses under authority in the child nutrition act tracing back to 1966 states receive grants to help cover general administrative and oversightmonitoring costs associated with child nutrition programs including commodity distribution costs but not including wic program costs the national amount each year is equal to 15 of federal cash payments for the school lunch school breakfast special milk and child and adult care food programs the majority of this money is allocated to states based on their share of spending on the programs covered above about 15 is allocated under discretionary formula granting each state additional amounts for the child and adult care food program commodity distribution and coordinated review efforts see the later discussion of other child nutrition special projects and activities for description of coordinated review efforts in addition states receive 20 also see the discussion of fresh fruit and vegetables in the school lunch section of this report for important supplemental information see crs report rs20235 farm and food support under usdas section 32 program by geoffrey becker 21 one state kansas receives cash in place of commodity assistance in limited number of cases schools in lieu of commodities receive cash payments or commodity letters of credit cloc to purchase commodities themselves crs13 administrative payments for their role in overseeing summer programs equal to approximately 25 of their summer program aid states are free to apportion their various federal administrative expense payments among child nutrition initiatives including the summer program as they see fit the wic and wic farmers market programs22 the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children the wic program provides nutritious foods and other support to lowerincome pregnant postpartum and breastfeeding women and to infants and children up to age 523 the program is operated through some 10000 local health care clinicssites run by 2000 local agencies and state health agencies and more than 30 indian tribal organizations participating as separate grantees treated like states in addition special wiclike extension run through the defense department serves overseas military personnel24 the wic program originated as twoyear pilot project in 1972 and was established in law as national program in 1975 although the administering state and tribal wic agencies have some discretion in judging eligibility recipients household income generally can be higher than 185 of the federal poverty guidelines the same standard used for determining eligibility for reducedprice school meals eg 24440 for family of two or 30710 for threeperson family until the next annual inflation adjustment in july 2007 and all state agencies now use the 185 income test in the alternative applicants who are recipients of medicaid food stamp or temporary assistance for needy families tanf benefits may be judged automatically incomeeligible however just as important as meeting the income test enrollees also must be judged at nutritional risk by health professionals in the health agencies and clinics that administer the program eg based on clinical measurements documented nutritionally related medical conditions dietary deficiencies foods are provided prescribed through voucherschecks listing the specific foods and amounts appropriate to the recipients status that are redeemed at approved retail outlets or much less commonly supplied directly by the administering agency itself25 the specific foods prescribed eg juice infant formula cereal eggs are 22 the commodity supplemental food program csfp the predecessor to the wic program provides federally purchased commodity food packages to lowincome elderly as well as women infants and children it operates through more than 145 local projects in 32 states the district of columbia and two tribal areas while the overwhelming majority of its recipients 90 are now elderly persons some 50000 women infants and children were assisted in fy2005 23 very useful additional information on the wic program is available from recent report by the agriculture departments economic research service the wic program background trends and issues 24 the separate defense department wic program is funded with defense department money 25 two states mississippi and vermont provide wic food items directly to recipients not using vouchers and several indian tribal agencies directly distribute some items such as continued crs14 based on set of federally established food packages that differ by recipient type eg infant pregnant mother however wic agencies have considerable leeway in implementing the federally defined food packages they choose which infant formulas or other items like juices or cereals are offered to meet the federal food package requirements and how to respond to recipients special needs participating retailers more than 45000 are approved then redeem the voucherschecks for cash through arrangements with their state wic agency the program also provides financial support for state and local clinic nutrition services and administrative nsa costs about 27 of total federal aid provided to states and tribal organizations these include costs associated with nutritional risk health and immunization assessments nutrition and substance abuse education and counseling health care and immunization referrals certain breastfeeding promotion and support costs determining eligibility and issuing and redeeming vouchers or directly delivering food items or operating an ebt system26 in addition about 1 of wic spending goes for grants to improve infrastructure eg computer systems technical assistance and special projects like breastfeeding peer counselors and help with state management information systems annual federal appropriations are granted to state and indian tribal wic agencies under formula that reflects food and nsa caseload costs inflation and need as evidenced by poverty indices although small amounts are set aside and distributed at the agriculture departments discretion for infrastructure development like building and upgrading ebt and management information systems and other eg breastfeeding counselor projects and other funds have been used for small special initiatives eg immunization and health care outreach efforts these annual new appropriations are supplemented by unused money carried over from year to year and reallocated among state and tribal grantees or retained by state wic agencies for use in the next year moreover recent appropriations also have included small 125 million contingency fund the direct support supplied by appropriations and funding carryovers is added to by the effect holding down food costs of substantial rebates discounts from manufacturers with which state agencies contract through competitive bidding to be the sole source for particular food item this cost control strategy is used by all state agencies for infant formula and in fy2005 the majority of them received 9097 discounts on the wholesale cost of infant formula27 moreover 11 state 25 continued infant formula five state agencies nevada new mexico ohio texas and wyoming statewide have implemented electronic benefit transfer ebt systems that provide wic benefits through ebt debit cards rather than paper vouchers 26 approximately twothirds of nsa expenses are for nutritionrelated service activities like nutrition education breastfeeding support and nutrition risk evaluations the remainder roughly 10 of total program costs represents traditional administrative costs eg income eligibility determinations issuing and redeeming vouchers 27 recently new state rebatediscount contracts for infant formula as previous ones expired have yielded noticeably smaller discounts on the order of 7694 the median being continued crs15 agencies also have rebate contracts for juice and cereal in fy2005 the estimated rebate savings was worth 16 billion28 as part of this cost containment effort special limits are in place for approving retailers who derive the majority of their revenue from wic vouchers socalled wiconly stores at present new wic only stores may be certified for participation and the prices they may charge the wic program are significantly constricted finally relatively small in dollar terms wic farmers market nutrition program operates with significant nonfederal matching funding 30 of administrative costs in 38 states the district of columbia puerto rico guam and four indian tribal organizations it is run by variety of state agencies typically state agriculture offices coordinating with the regular wic program and offers some 25 million wic participants special vouchers that are used to buy fresh produce through about 4700 participating farmers markets roadside stands and community supported agriculture projects the federal government pays the cost of the first 30 per participant per year of each farmers market voucher and shares administrative costs with the states and other political jurisdictions sponsoring the program in fy2005 average monthly wic participation was 80 million persons 197 million women 205 million infants and 40 million children average perperson federal costs were 3750 month for food and 1440 month for nsa expenses special projects and other support activities29 under the coordinated review effort cre the fns in cooperation with state agencies conducts periodic school compliance and accountability evaluations to improve management and identify administrative subsidy claim and meal quality problems this 5 millionayear effort is the major ongoing initiative related to maintaining the integrity of child nutrition programs although under the terms of the most recent child nutrition reauthorization law pl 108265 new funding is available for additional administrative reviews of schools needing special oversight the agriculture departments economic research service ers and the fns conduct nutrition research studies surveys and evaluations typically totaling 6 8 million year for child nutrition and wic activities this work was formerly done exclusively by the fns30 national food service management institute fsmi provides technical assistance instruction materials in nutrition and food service management it is funded at 4 million year and an information clearinghouse provides information to support communitysponsored food assistance initiatives 27 continued 89 for additional information on infant formula rebates see the march 2006 government accountability office gao report gao06380 entitled food assistance fns could take additional steps to contain wic infant formula costs 28 states also pursue other initiatives to control food costs including use of leastcost brands and economic package sizes 29 also see the discussion of fresh fruit and vegetables in the section of this report devoted to the school lunch program 30 money for research studies and evaluations is not included in the funding tables at the end of this report crs16 funding of about 250000 year special fns projects team nutrition nutrition education projects food safety project technical assistance to program operators food service training grants aid with electronic food service resource systems program integrity initiatives are aimed at helping schools and other providers with nutrition education materials assisting them to improve their meal service operations and the quality of meals and ensuring federal support is spent correctly they are typically funded at about 1020 million year in addition to the abovenoted ongoing projects and activities the 2004 child nutrition and wic reauthorization act pl 108265 added new mostly onetime mandatory spending to assist states and schools in improving administration of their school meal programs especially determination of eligibility for free and reducedprice meals gave money to the fns to help local schools develop wellness policies outlined in the school lunch section of this report and provided onetime funding for specific pilot projects related to expanding summer food service it also extended expanded and provided new money later increased for free fresh fruit and vegetable program in selected schools discussed under the description of the school lunch program31 funding for child nutrition and wic programs federal support for child nutrition and wic programs is derived from funding provided out of 1 annual agriculture department appropriations 2 permanent appropriations not included in the annual appropriations laws eg money directly appropriated for the food service management institute under its authorizing law and other spending mandated by law 3 unused money available carried over from prior years appropriations transferred from other agriculture department appropriations accounts or recovered from states and operators and 4 funds paid for child nutrition initiatives from budget accounts separate from appropriations to the child nutrition and wic accounts eg large share of commodity assistance actual spending for most child nutrition programs but not wic programs normally is dictated by the demand for federal dollars called for by the number and type of subsidized meals snacks or halfpints of milk served not the funding made available annually appropriated or otherwise these programs are mandatory entitlements wic and wic farmers market spending on the other hand is discretionary and dictated by the dollar amounts available from current and prior year carriedover or recovered unused appropriations state wic agencies serve as many persons as they can within their respective allocations of appropriated funds supplemented by carryovers and recoveries and not all eligibles may be served if funds run short individual programs within the child nutrition budget account eg the school lunch and breakfast programs do not receive specific lineitem appropriations and thus funding may be shifted among the various child nutrition 31 the largest share of these new costs occurs in fy2006 for description of the new initiatives see crs report rl33299 child nutrition and wic legislation in the 108th and 109th congresses by joe richardson crs17 programs as needed so long as total spending stays within the overall amount available from new appropriations and other sources as result readily identifiable annual congressional appropriations typically divided into two major accounts child nutrition account and wic program account do not provide clear or complete picture of total federal support for child nutrition and wic programs in given year32 rather spending figures normally higher than appropriations shown in this reports second table typically obligations give much better overview than appropriations amounts

commodity holdings eg 120 million in fy2005 c unlike other numbers in this table figures for the free fresh fruit and vegetable program in schools represent funding made available for each year not actual spending because of uncertainty about spending amounts actual spending figures are likely to be substantially lower than the amounts shown the table allocates to fy2004 3 million of the 6 million provided by the 2002 farm bill pl 107171 for fy2003 and fy2004 the 9 million shown for fy2005 is the amount mandated by the 2004 child nutrition reauthorization law pl 108265 for each year beginning with fy2005 the 15 million shown for fy2006 includes the 9 million mandate from the child nutrition reauthorization law plus 6 million appropriated by the fy2006 appropriations measure the administrations request for fy2007 includes only the 9 million mandated amount the house 25 million figure is discretionary appropriation that assumes suspension of the 9millionayear mandate the

nutrition food safety education several program integritytechnical assistance initiatives undertaken by the administration or directed by the 2004 child nutrition reauthorization law an information

directives in the 2004 child nutrition reauthorization law pl 108265 the fy2007 administration request for the wic program is predicated on enactment of recommendation to limit wic nutrition services and administration nsa support to 25 of state grants an estimated savings of 152 million in fy2007 the house and senate figures reject the proposed nsa limits they also reflect major changes in assumptions as to food costs participation and the availability of prioryear funds as estimated by the food and nutrition service after passage of the house bill and before reporting of the senate bill wic farmers market figures represent spending from amounts available from new annual appropriations plus money recovered or carried over from prior years they reflect substantial amount of unused funding in fy2004 later made available and obligated in fy2005 and they assume significant although shrinking recoveriescarryovers decrease in unused money in fy2005 fy2006 and fy2007 annual appropriations were 229 million in fy2004 198 million in fy2005 and 198 million in fy2006 198 million appropriation is requested for fy2007 in effect the drop in appropriations beginning with fy2005 does not show in spending totals until fy2006 because unspent funds from earlier years were available however the fy2005 spending figure may be revised downward by as much as 2 million when all unused money is recovered and the fy2006 and fy2007 amounts may be revised upward to the extent recoveries from fy2005 are made available as grants the fy2007 figure for the house and senate bills reflects
