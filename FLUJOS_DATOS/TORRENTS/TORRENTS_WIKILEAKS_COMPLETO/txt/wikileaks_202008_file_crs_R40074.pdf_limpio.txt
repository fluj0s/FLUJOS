plata argentina taking place less than four months after his inauguration the summit could set the tone for hemispheric relations during the early stages of the new administration there have been four summits of the americas two special summits of the americas and number of ministeriallevel summits held since 1994 past summits have led to number of successful initiatives in the region including the creation of the interamerican democratic charter reductions in the cost of remittance transfers and increased provision of antiretroviral therapy to victims of hivaids although some view the most recent summit as failure because of its divisiveness it too produced number of important initiatives including support for haitis democracy improved infrastructure and reductions in child labor despite these accomplishments many observers have criticized the summits of the americas civil society representatives contend that the summits lack transparency and believe their organizations should play larger roles in the summit process some observers have questioned the summits effectiveness drawing attention to the fact that the majority of summit goals have never been met other analysts doubt the summits ability to advance us interests and argue that the united states should pursue its own priorities outside of the summit process the theme for the port of spain summit is securing our citizens future by promoting human prosperity energy security and environmental sustainability summit organizers have stressed the need to refocus the hemispheres priorities set achievable goals and create the institutions necessary to hold countries accountable for implementing the summits mandates as result the draft declaration of commitment of the summit focuses on areas of consensus in the hemisphere such as promoting human prosperity promoting energy security and environmental sustainability and strengthening public security and democratic governance the draft declaration also sets measurable goals and seeks to strengthen the followup mechanisms of the summit process congress may be particularly interested in number of initiatives concerning energy the environment and social justice which coincide with proposals of the obama administration since it may be asked to commit us resources to projects in the region this report will be updated as events warrant

34 of the 35 governments in the region were elected civilian democracies likewise most of the countries in the region discarded statist economic policies in favor of economic liberalization in order to build on these values shared by the united states and latin america as well as develop an agenda for the hemispheres future president clinton organized the first modern summit of the americas held in miami in 1994 the summit was the first meeting of the regions leaders since 1967 and was attended by all 34 democratically elected heads of government in the region excluding only fidel castro of cuba after much discussion the regions leaders approved comprehensive plan of action with 23 separate initiatives under four major themes preserving and strengthening the community of democracies of the americas promoting prosperity through economic integration and free trade eradicating poverty and discrimination in the hemisphere and guaranteeing sustainable development and conserving the natural environment for future generations one of the most important initiatives to emerge from the miami summit was the agreement to work towards the creation of free trade area of the americas ftaa which was to be completed by january 1 2005 1 since the 1994 miami summit there have been three summits of the americas and two special summits of the americas each introducing new initiatives and producing extensive plans of action in 1996 special summit on sustainable development was held in santa cruz bolivia focusing on environmental issues in the hemisphere in 1998 santiago chile hosted the second summit of the americas the santiago summit focused on education but also marked the initiation of negotiations for the ftaa quebec city canada hosted the third summit of the americas in 2001 the quebec city summit produced commitment to democracy led to the creation of the interamerican democratic charter and generated preliminary draft of the ftaa another special summit of the americas was held in monterrey mexico in 2004 the monterrey summit produced the declaration of nuevo león which reaffirmed the regions commitment to implementing the quebec city plan of action 2 these summits have been complemented by regular meetings of the ministers of defense education finance justice labor and trade of the countries of the region the most recent summit of the americas was held in mar plata argentina in november 2005 although the theme of the summit was creating jobs to fight poverty and strengthen democratic governance debate largely centered around the bush administrations

of the common market of the south mercosur also opposed the resumption of talks on the ftaa3 the mercosur countries opposed the continuation of us agricultural subsidies and argued that talks should not resume until after conclusion of the world trade organizations wto doha development round when there may be greater possibility of achieving what they would consider balanced and equitable agreement despite consensus among 29 of the 34 democratic leaders that ftaa talks should resume the economic weight of the dissenting countries led to the adoption of the first summit declaration to

g18g152g149g146g157g146g140g138g149g561 according to some observers one of the greatest political accomplishments of the summit process has been the interamerican democratic charter in the declaration of quebec city the leaders of the americas committed to democracy clause which led to the creation of the inter american democratic charter in september 2001 the charter affirms the peoples of the americas universal right to democracy and asserts that the governments of the region have an obligation to promote and defend democracy though it has produced somewhat mixed results the interamerican democratic charter has been invoked on several occasions following challenges to democratic institutions in the region such as the attempted coup against president hugo chávez of venezuela in 2002 and the removal of president lucio guttierez from office by ecuadors congress in 2005 5 the plan of action adopted at the most recent summit of the americas in mar plata argentina in 2005 called on the countries of the region to act in solidarity with the haitian people to improve democratic institutions since the summit the organization of american states oas special mission for strengthening

nuevo león the leaders of the hemisphere committed to reducing the average cost of remittance transfers by at least 50 by 2008 between 2000 and 2006 transaction costs to send remittances were reduced from 15 to 56 allowing 5 billion more to reach recipient families 9 the united states has played large role in reducing the transaction costs of remittances by encouraging competition eliminating excess regulations and promoting the use of new technology the cost of sending remittances through some corridors between the united states and mexico has fallen by 50 and the united states has begun to partner with other countries like guatemala in hopes of achieving similar cost reductions 10 the mar plata plan of action states that countries should promote investment in infrastructure president bush proposed the infrastructure facility of the americas ifa at the summit which encourages private sector investment by reducing the cost of identifying worthy projects through the establishment of fund for feasibility assessments the us trade and development agency invested 104 million in 2006 to support infrastructure development in 14 countries in the region the funds supported variety of projects including road pavement in paraguay water reuse in brazil and refinery expansion in colombia 11 g21g152g140g146g138g149g561 in addition to political and economic initiatives the summits of

the summits lack openness and transparency these groups argue that important discussions that affect the welfare of all people in the region should not be held behind closed doors and that the summits should be open to civil society representatives the exclusivity of the summits and the large role that negotiations over the ftaa have played at each of the summits have led some civil society groups to assert that the summits promote the expansion of corporate power while ignoring social welfare environmental protection and citizens rights 16 although the countries of the region agreed in the declaration of quebec city that the summits must be open transparent and include civil society many civil society groups contend that little has been done to increase their participation17

implementation of those initiatives that are measurable furthermore many countries lack the organizational capacity political will or financial resources to implement the summits mandates as result most summit commitments have never been met19 the failure of many countries to implement the summits mandates has cast doubt upon the effectiveness of the summit process and called into question the credibility of the summits of the americas as an institution for achieving tangible results in the hemisphere

countries of the region have begun to question whether the summit of the americas process is worth continuing whereas the summit process was initiated in spirit of cooperation by likeminded leaders in miami in 1994 the hemisphere is now more divided than at any time since the cold war the dismissal of the bush administrations proposal to resume talks on the ftaa at the mar plata summit was clear manifestation of the increasing number of leaders and countries in the region that reject neoliberal economic policies indeed the most recent latinobarómetro survey found that while 56 of latin americans agree that market economy is the only path to development only 32 are satisfied with services that have been privatized and majorities in every latin american nation believe their countries should rely more on state solutions than market solutions to resolve societal problems 20 given these economic divisions and the movement of the summit agenda away from the ftaa and toward statebased development programs some analysts believe the interests of the united states would be better served by focusing instead on finalizing bilateral and multilateral agreements with those countries that still share the us commitment to free trade21 g344g342g342g351g561g18g152g155g157g561g152g143g561g21g153g138g146g151g561g21g158g150g150g146g157g561 the fifth summit of the americas is scheduled to be
