the two before it is expected to consider proposals to control emissions of multiple pollutants from electric power plants the bills include an administrationbased proposal the clear skies act s 131 which would control emissions of sulfur dioxide so2 nitrogen oxides nox and mercury and other bills that would control the three pollu tants plus the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide much of the debate surrounding the ad ministrations clear skies proposal has focused on its capandtrade implementation scheme but in some ways the proposals capandtrade provisions are its l east significant aspects in terms of the proposals interaction with the structure of the clean air act epa has already promulgated regulations using regiona l capandtrade program to control nox emissions over the eastern united states the nox sip call under existing clean air act authority and has proposed other capandtrade regulations to achieve clear skies level of reducti ons over 28 eastern states and the district of columbia for both so2 and nox in the clean air interstate ru in addition epa has proposed cap andtrade regulations to achieve mercury reductions similar to those in clear skies although the legality of these re gulations is more questionable critical to the fabric of the clean air act are the various provisions in clear skies to alter or to delete existing sections of the act with respect to both electric generating units egus and industrial sources that choose to opt into the program the administration has made it clear that with clear skies comprehensive approach to egus and optins it believes certain caa provisions need longer apply to them in some cases permanently in others for as long as 20 years or under certain conditions these include most statutory requirements for prevention of significant deterioration and ttainment of national ambient air quality standards under title i of the act as well as most controls on hazardous air pollutants as they apply to egus and optins these changes would diminish the suite of options states currently have to achieve compliance with air quality standards in july 2001 testimony thenepa admin istrator whitman identified the central issue in clear skies interaction with current law are the emission reduction targets stringent enough to permit the relaxing or removal of current provisions of the clean air act designed to achieve the same thing with respect to electric utilities epas analysis indicates that clear skies will not achieve either the 8hour ozone or the fine particulate ambient air quality standards th at the agency recently implemented within current caa compliance deadlines some nonattainment areas w ill need additional controls and time to reach ttainment clear skies addre sses these issues in part by providing 5 to 15 years of additional time while effectively removing additional electric utility control from the suite of options available to states to achieve the standards similarly with mercury clear skies proposes relatively modest controls on electric utilities and as currently draf ted would effectivel remove additional electric utility controls from the suite of options available to the states the ability of industrial sources to opt into clear sk ies could further reduce state control options for both mercury and criteria pollutant s this report will not be

wwwwhitehousegovnewsreleases200202climatechange html for the climate change initiative 2 the second proposal for which legislation has been introduced initiates new voluntary greenhouse gas reduction program similar to ones introduced by the earlier george h w bush and clinton administra tions developed in response to the us ratification of the 1992 unfccc these previous plans projected us compliance or near compliance with the unfccc goal of stab ilizing greenhouse gas emissions at their 1990 levels by the year 2000 through voluntary asures the new proposal introduced by the bush administration does not make that clai m only projecting 100 million metric ton reduction in emissions from what would occur otherwise in the year 2012 instead the plan focuses on improving the carbon efficiency of the economy reducing current emissions of 183 metric tons per million dollars of gdp to 151 metric tons per million dollars of gdp in 2012 it proposes several voluntary initiatives along with increased spending and tax incentives to achieve this goal the admini stration notes that the new initiatives would achieve about onequarter of the objective wh ile threequarters of the projected reduction would occur through alread existing efforts underway 3 for more specifics see crs report rl32755 air quality multipollutant legislation in the 109th congress by larry parkerclear skies and the clean air act whats the difference introduction in february 2002 the bush administra tion announced two air quality proposals to address the control of emi ssions of sulfur dioxide so2 nitrogen oxides nox mercury hg and carbon dioxide co21 the first proposal called clear skies would amend the clean air act caa to place emission caps on electric utility emissions of so2 nox and hg implemented th rough tradeable allowance program the emissions caps would be im posed in two phases 2010 2008 in the case of nox and 2018 as part of complete re write of title iv of the clean air act clear skies was introduced in the 108th congress on february 27 2003 as hr 999 and s 4852 in the 109th congress modified version of clear skies s 131 has been introduced by senator inhofe and has become the focus of congressional hearings and potential markup3 much of the debate surrounding the ad ministrations clear skies proposal has focused on its capandtrade implementation scheme for example epa states the clear skies approach would deliver gu aranteed emissions reductions of so2 nox and mercury at fraction of command and control costs increasing certainty forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32782crs2 4 from

itizens4 in some ways the proposals cap andtrade provisions are its least signif icant aspects in terms of the proposals interaction with the structure of the clean air act epa has already promulgated regulations using regional capandtrade program to control nox emissions over the eastern united states called the nox sip call under existing clean air act authority and has proposed other capandtr ade regulations to achieve clear skies level of reductions over 28 eas tern states and the district of columbia for both so2 and nox5 in addition epa has proposed othe r capandtrade regulations to achieve similar clear skies mercury reductions although their legality has been subject to some question6 far more important to the fabric of th clean air act are the various provisions in clear skies to alter delete or hold in abeyance for some time existing sections of the clean air act with respect to affected electric generating units and industrial sources that choose to opt into the prog ram the administration has made it clear that with clear skies it believes certain caa provisions are longer necessary as stated by thenepa administrator whitman before the senate environment and public works committee as epa was developing clear skies legislation well it is our feeling that right now that depending on where you set the targets that new source review is certainly one of those regulatory aspects that would longer be necessary the regional haze the bart as i mentioned before the mact standards the nox sip call the 126 rule acid rain all of those could be eliminated and combined into one regulatory process under new piece of legislation that would be vastly simp lified it depends where they go on those for utilities we are talking for utilities now as far as most of those are concerned but where you go depends on what level is set in the final legislation how far you can go to eliminate the additional regulations that we have in place now7 this report examines the potential impact clear skies legislation would have on the structure of the clean air act with respect to electric generating units and other industrial sources that c hoose to opt into the program title i of the clean air act many of the changes in the clean air act proposed by clear skies would occur with respect to title i within its general regulatory structure several distinctions arise that affect utility planning and operations for example whether the facilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32782crs3 8 criteria pollutants defined in section 108 of the act are pollutants in ambient air that endanger public health or welfare and are emitted from numerous or diverse mobile or stationary sources the term criteria refers to the sections requirement that the epa administrator issue criteria for such pollu tants within 12 months of listing them 9 secondary naaqs also nationwide standards protect welfare values such as visibility and agricultural productivity there is specific deadline for achieving secondary naaqs 10 for further discussion of naaqs standa rdsetting see crs report 97722 enr air quality st andards the decisionmaking process by john blodgett larry parker and james mccarthy 11 offset rules require that new major sour ces of pollution reduce emissions from existing facilities in nonattainment area by more than the emissions they will generateis located in clean or dirty air areas whether facility is existing or new and what fuel it burns and while the underlying regu latory structure generally applies to so2 nox and particulate matter pm the specific requirements for each differ despite changes made in the 1990 clean air act amendments specifically the addition of capandtrade program to control so2 emissions title iv the basic structure designed in 1970 and expanded in 1977 re mains the backbone of the act the addition of title iv in 1990 did not change any of the basic requirements of the act title iv was supplemental provision not substitute for existing provisions background regulating criteria air pollutants under title i national ambient air quality sta ndards new source performance standards lowest achievable emissions rate as enacted in 1970 the caa established twopronged approach to protect and enhance the quality of the nations air first the act established national ambient air quality standards naaqs which set limits on th level of specified air pollutants in ambient air second the act required nati onal emission limits to be t for major new polluting facilities these are called new source performance standards nsps naaqs have been established for six criteria pollutants including so2 nox and pm8 under the law epa sets primary naaqs9 to protect the public health with an adequate margin of safety10 epa periodically reviews naaqs to take into account the most recent health data naaqs are federally enforceable with specific deadlines for complia nce but states are primarily responsible for actually implementing the standards through velopment and enforcement of state implementation plans sips in genera l these plans focus on reducing emissions from existing facilities to the extent necessa ry to ensure that ambient levels of pollution do not exceed the naaqs for areas not in attainment with one or more of these naaqs the 1970 caa mandates states to require new sources to install lowest achievable emissions rate laer technology along with offset rules11 laer ensures that overall emissions do not increase as result of new plants operation laer is based on the most stringent emission rate of any state implementation plan or achieved inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32782crs4 12 laer may not be less string ent than nsps described below 13 the federal focus on new facilities arose from several factors first it is generally less expensive to design into new construction nece ssary control features than to retrofit those features on existing facilities not designed to incorporate them second uniform standards for new construction ensures that individua l states will not be tempted to slacken environmental control requirements to compete for new industrypractice without regard to cost or energy use12 existing sources in nonattainment area are required to install less stringen t reasonably available control technology ract state determination based on federal guidelines the 1970 caa also established new source performance standards nsps which are emission limitations imposed on designated categories of major new or substantially modified stationary sources of air pollution for fossil fuelfired electric generating facilities epa has set nsps for so2 nox and pm10 particles smaller than 10 microns and is required by the act to review the standards every eight years new source is subject to nsps regardless of its location or ambient air conditions recognizing that pollutants are resp ecters of state boundaries the caa has established several mechanisms for addressing interstate pollution that may contribute to noncompliance with naaqs these mechanisms include regional commissions such as the ozone transpor t commission state petitions under section 126 and other provisions for regional gr oups the largest of these interstate regulatory regimes is the nox sip call which controls nox emissions from 20 states and the district of columbia under the nox sip call the affected states are given emission budgets that they can ach ieve in whatever manner they choose noting the regional nature of the ozone problem in the eastern united states epa successfully encouraged states to impleme nt the rule through an epacoordinated capandtrade program in summary under this overall regulatory regimen existing sources in nonattainment areas are subject to controls determined by the state as necessary to meet naaqs existing sources in attainment areas are essentially free from controls and major new sources including fossil fuelfired electric generating facilities are subject to nsps as the minimum requirement anywhere13 prevention of significant deterioration new source review best available control technology the 1977 caa broadened the air quality control regimen with the addition of the prevention of significant deterioration psd and visibility impairment provisions the psd program part c of title i of the caa focuses on ambient concentrations of so2 nox and pm in clean air areas of the country ie areas where ai r quality is better than the naaqs the provision allows some increase in clean areas pollution concentrations depending on their classification in general histor ic or recreation areas eg national parks are classified class i with very little degradation allowed while most other areas are classified class ii with moderate degr adation allowed states are allowed tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32782crs5 14 none have been reclassified to class iii however 15 see crs report rl32483 visibility regional haze and the clean air act status of implementation by larry parker and john blodgettreclassify class ii areas to class iii areas which would be per mitted to degrade up to the naaqs14 new sources in psd areas must underg preconstruction review called new source review or nsr and must install best available control technology bact as the minimum level of control state permitting agencies determine bact on casebycase basis taking into account energy environmental and economic impacts bact cannot be less stringent than the federal nsps but it can be more so more stringent controls can be re quired if modeling indicates that bact is insufficient to avoid violating psd emission limitations or the naaqs itself complement to the psd program for existing sources is the regional haze program section 169a of the act which fo cuses on prevention of any future and the remedying of any existing impairment of visibility resulting from manmade air pollution in national park s and wilderness areas15 among the pollutants that impair visibility are sulfates organic matter nd nitrates sources built between 1962 and 1977 are required to install best availabl retrofit technology bart in 1999 the epa promulgated regional haze prog ram which would entail more stringent controls on nox and so2 table 1 summarizes the current air quality control requirements imposed on fossil fuelfired electric generating facilities by title i background regulating mercury under title i separate from the title i re quirements for criteria pollu tants section 112 of the act establishes twophase federal regulatory program for 188 hazardous air pollutants haps listed in the act among the haps is mercury in the first phase maximum achievable control technology mact standards are to be promulgated for all major sources of the pollutants mact is determined by the epa administrator but it must be at least as stringent as the best controlled similar source for new sources or with some exceptions the average of the best performing 12 for existing sources in the second phase eight years after promulgation of mact additi onal regulations may be pr omulgated to address any residual risks from haps after the implementation of mact electric utilities were given special tr eatment under section 112 in section 112n the act required that epa report to congress on th hazards to public health from electric generating units emissions of haps and make an affirmative finding that regulation under section 112 is appropriate and necessa ry for such units before proceeding to issue mact standards ep made this finding in december 2000 but in january 2004 it proposed to rescind its conclusion that the mact standard was necessary instead proposing capand trade program under section 111 as its

wi sconsin have already done so table 2 summarizes the current requireme nts imposed on fossil fuelfired electric generating facilities by section 112 changes proposed by clear skies16 clear skies would change numerous provisi ons of current law some of these changes add new authorities or programs for example the establishment of national capandtrade programs for utility emissions of nox and mercury and the extension and revision of the title iv capandtrade program for so2 other changes remove existing authority eg the hazar dous air pollutant provisions of section 112 as they relate to mercury emissions from utilities and from optin facilities in other industries and other changes modify and or hold in abeyance certain provisions for several years eg bart section 126 conformityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32782crs8 list of the additional authorities would include 1 the capandtrade programs for so2 nox and hg 2 statutory nationa l emission standards for new and reconstructed electric generating units egus 3 authority for sources in other industries to opt into the capandtrade prog ram and 4 establishment of an optional transitional area category in place of the traditional nonattainment area designations under sections 107 and 110 list of the authorities removed or limited in new ways would include 1 provisions for major sources ie affect ed egus and optin units would longer be considered major sources 2 change s to the hazardous air pollutant provisions of section 112 removing utilities and opti n units from the sources whose mercury emissions can be controlled under max imum achievable control technology mact and residual risk provisions 3 changes to section 126 establishing moratorium on the use of petitions to contro l interstate air pollution and establishing substantially more stringen t requirements for acceptance of such petitions after the moratorium 4 reduction of the nonc ompliance penalties under the new so2 cap andtrade program 5 effective preemption of more stringent state requirements for nox and mercury 6 elimination of ne w source review nsr for modifications of major sources 7 elimination of be st available

extension of deadlines for meeting the ozone and pm25 naaqs 11 facto moratorium on the provisions of subpart 2 dealing with ozone nonattainment in most areas and 12 facto moratorium on the conformity requirements for highways and other projects under section 176 in most ozone and pm25 nonattainment areas new authorities 1 cap and trade program for so2 nox and mercury much of clear skies consists of tailed provisions that would replace title iv of the clean air act the acid precipitation title with revised and expanded version establishing multi pollutant capandtrade program th proposal would place caps on emissions of so2 nox and hg in two phases and woul d set up trading programs to provide flexibility in meeting the three caps for the version introduced as s 131 phase 1 would establish caps for egus of 219 million tons of nox in 2008 45 million tons of so2 in 2010 and 34 tons of mercury in 2010 the s 131 phase 2 caps which woul d take effect in 2018 are set at 179 million tons of nox 30 million tons of so2 and httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32782crs9 17 the extent to which these caps would reduce emissions is difficult to estimate some estimates compare the caps to actual emission levels generally using as baseline 2000 data for so2 and nox and 1999 latest data available for mercury emissions of all three pollutants are likely to be lower at present th an they were in 1999 or 2000 particularly nox for which major new regulatory program the nox sip call took effect in 2004 with so2 there is the further question of whether the bills caps should be compared to actual emissions 114 million tons in 2000 or the existing so2 cap under the current title iv 895 million tons in 2000 emi ssions in 2000 and subsequent years have exceeded the cap as utilities used up prior year banked allowances mercury reduction estimates are complicated by the fact that units emitting 50 pounds or less annually would be exempt from the cap in s 131 as introduced while detailed monitoring data are unavailable about half the egus would be exempt from the cap unde r this provision thus comparison of s 131s caps to 1999 emissions from all egus overst ates the percentage reduction that would be achieved 18 epa proposed 10 lbmwh standard the sa as that in clear skies under current authority on february 22 200515 tons of mercury17 the allowance trading program provisions are generally similar to those of the existing title iv program as specified under s 131 allowances would be allocated free to egus based on historic fuel usage for the new nox and hg programs the allocation would be adjusted by factors specified in the bill eg egus fueled by lignite would receive three times as many hg allowances as would comparable egus fueled by bituminous coal unlike the existing program small pool 7 of the so2 and 5 of the nox and hg allowan ces would be set aside for new units 2 national emission standards for so2 nox and hg emissions from new and rec onstructed egus clear skies would establish statutory standards for emissions of so2 nox and hg from new and reconstructed egus the standards are generally more stringent than current nsps eg for nox the standard would be 10 lbmwh for coalfired egus versus the current nsps of 16 lbmwh18 for particulate matter the standa rd would be 020 lbmwh about one third less than the current nsps the hg standard 0015 lbgwh is more stringent than the proposed mact for subbituminous lignite and igcc units especially the lignite units but it would allow two and half times as much emissions as the proposed mact for bituminousfired egus compared to the current nsps the national emission standards would apply to fewer units as discussed furthe r in item 6 under authorities removed or limited below the nati onal emission standards w ould be reviewed and if appropriate revised at leas t every eight years following their promulgation the same as the requirement for existing nsps 3 authority for nonutility sources to opt into the capandtrade program s 131 would allow units that are not affected egus and whose emissions of so2 nox and hg are vented only through stack or duct to opt into the capandtrade program the proposal establishes alte rnative methods of determining allowances for these units ba sed on units heat input or product output and its emissions during one of several optional ba periods in the case of s 131httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32782crs10 19 the deadline for compliance would otherwise generally be 2007 2010 20 see crs report rl32345 implementation of epas 8hour ozone standard p 6 and crs report rl32431 particulate matter pm25 nati onal ambient air quality standards naaqs implementation pp 1011a unit would receive allocations equal to 70 of its baseline so2 and nox emissions beginning in 2010 and 50 beginning in 2018 mercury alloca tions beginning in 2010 would be equal to the missions allowed under federa l or state hazardous air pollutant standards generally the standards for industrial boilers and process heaters promulgated by epa in september 2004 in return for opting into the capandtrad program units would be exempt from compliance deadlines for all hazardous ai r pollutants under four broad categories of regulations industrial boilers process heaters combustion engines and turbines and plywood as soon as they apply for acceptance19 and would be permanently exempt from the regulations if epa accepts their application to opt in in addition units that opt in would longer be considered major source or major emitting facility or major stationary source for purposes of part c psd and part d nonattainment of the act for 20 ears as discussed later see item 1 under authorities removed or limited below this would exempt optin units from several requirements provided the ownerope rator properly operated maintained and repaired the units pollution control equipment to limit particulate emissions and used good combustion practices to minimize carbon monoxide emissions 4 establishment of an optiona l transitional area category in place of nonattainment designations clear skies would amend section 107 of the clean air act to allow areas to be designated transitional rather than nonattainment for the new 8hour ozone and pm25 standards if epa or state modeling demonstrate that the area will ttain the new standards by december 31 2015 epa modeling demonstrates that 88 of the ozone and about twothirds of the pm25 nonattainment counties would qualify for this transitional status20 other areas could qualify by adopting additional local controls the effects of this change as discussed in more tail in items 10 11 and 12 under authorities removed or limited are to extend the deadlines for reaching attainment and remove numerous statutory requirements for nonattainme nt areas under part d until after 2017 authorities removed or limited 1 exemption from major source requirements under parts c and d clear skies would provide that affected units including both egus and facilities in other industries that opt into the capa ndtrade program would not be considered major emitting facilities or major stationary sources of air pollution for purposes of parts c psd provisions nd d nonattainment provisions of title i of the clean air act for period of 20 years after th date of enactment for the psd program this would exempt them from the requireme nts of nsr and bart as well as bact unless an affected unit was located within 50 km of class i areas 158 designated national parks and wilderness areas it w ould not be subject to the ambient air protections ie increments of the psd pr ogram if the unit is located within 50 kmhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32782crs11 21 in addition clear skies would require st ate implementation plans sips to include requirements that prior to the commencement of construction of an affected unit in an attainment or unclassifiable area eg psd class ii area the owner or operator must demonstrate that the emissions increase fro m construction or operation will not cause or contribute to air pollution in excess of any national ambient air qua lity standa rd naaqs less stringent requirement than current law in areas designated nonattainment the state must determine that construction or operation will not interfere with any program to assure that the naaqs are achieved interference will be deemed not to occur if for three years prior to the date complete permit applica tion is submitted the area was in full compliance with all requirements of the clean air ac t including the requirements for sipsof class i area however it would remain subject to the psd requirements in part c of title i21 see further discussion under items 7 8 and 9 below for nonattainment areas clear skies would exempt affected units from nonattainment nsr laer and offset re quirements this would limit the ability of nonattainment areas to impos additional controls on existing egus and optin facilities under their state implementation plans to qualify for the exemptions an existin g affected unit or optin unit as noted above must show that it operates mainta ins and repairs pollution control equipment to limit emissions of particulate matter and uses good combustion practices to minimize emissions of carbon m onoxide within three years of the date of enactment 2 changes to the hazardous air pollutant provisions of section 112 clear skies would revise section 112 of the clean air act to preclude regulation of any hazardous air pollutants emitted by electric utility steam generating units through either mact or residual risk standards with the following exception the administrator would retain the aut hority to address an nonmercury hazardous air pollutants from egus provided that any determination to do so is based on public health concerns and on an individual source basis considers the effects of emission controls installed or anticipated in or der to meet 2018 emi ssion requirements under the capandtrade program determina tion to impose such controls would also need to be based on peerreviewed study with notice and opportunity to comment to be completed not before january 2015 any such standards could not take effect before january 1 2018 as noted earlier s 131 as introduced also exempts units that opt into the cap andtrade program from compliance deadlin under four sets of hazardous air pollutant regulations already promulgate d under section 112 once the units apply to opt in it would permanently exempt them from compliance with the four mact standards if epa accepts their application 3 changes to section 126 petitions clear skies would add new section 110q to the clean air act estab lishing moratorium on the use of petitions to control interstate air pollution from ffected units under section 126 of the act and establishing more stringent requireme nts for acceptance of such petitions after the moratorium under current law s ection 126 authorizes downwind states or political subdivisions to petition the administrator to find that certain upwindhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32782crs12 sources emit air pollutants in amounts that contribute significantly to the petitioners nonattainment if the administrator grants the finding the upwind sources must either shut down or impleme nt controls that the administrator may mandate within specified period but later than three years from the date of the finding the amendment would provide that the administr ator may not require submission of sips subjecting affected units to section 126 requi rements with an eff ective date prior to december 31 2014 in reviewing petition under section 126 the administrator would have to consider among other factors any emissi ons reductions required to occur by the applicable attainment dates of any relevant nonatt ainment areas in addition as conditions for making finding concerning affected units the administrator would have to determine that the required emi ssion reductions from the affected units 1 are at least as costeffective as emission reductions from each other principal category of sources in areas upwind of th petitioner including onroad and offroad mobile sources and 2 will improve ai r quality in the pe titioners nonattainment areas at least as costeff ectively as other emission re ductions if methodology is reasonably available to ma ke such determinations 4 change in noncomplian ce penalties under title iv clear skies would replace the clean air acts existing section 411 beginning in 2008 effectively reducing the pena lties for noncompliance with the sulfur dioxide capand trade program provided in current law under current law noncompliance penalties were set at 2000 per ton of excess emissions in 1990 the amount is adjusted for inflation in 2004 the adjusted amount would have been 289059 according to the bureau of labor statistics section 406 of the bill would set the penalties at 2000 with further inflation adjustments t hus cutting the penalty by about onethird initially and more in subsequent years 5 preemption of state requirements like current law clear skies states that it does not preempt the right of any state or political subdivision thereof to adopt or enforce limits more stringent th an those provided in the bill under the capandtrade programs however notwithstanding any other provision of this act states and their political s ubdivisions would be prohibite d from interfering with the transfer sale or purchase of allowances the net effect of these provisions would be to allow increased emissions in anothe r jurisdiction by an amount equal to any reduction achieved in more stringent state for each of the three covered pollutants since the bill also limits the ability to file section 126 petitions to control outofstate pollution more stringent standard enact ed by state might have effect on national levels of pollutant but woul d burden states economy with additional control costs 6 elimination of new source revi ew for modifications of egus as noted earlier clear skies would exempt egus and optin facilities from nsr for period of 20 years the bill does however establish national emission standards for new egus also described above these new standards would not apply to modified units but would apply to r econstructed units reconstruction is defined as the replacement of components to such an extent that the fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50 of th fixed capital cost to construct comparable new unit also the standard s would not apply to reconstructed units unless it is technologically and economically feasible to meet the standards httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32782crs13 22 for additional discussion see crs report rs21608 clean

httpwwwepagovoaroaqpsgreenbkgnchtml all pm25 areas have an initial deadline of 2010 under current law and subs equent regulation there is specific cost criterion for what qualifies as modi fication requiring an affect ed source to undergo nsr but it is considered to be well below 50 threshold epas october 2003 attempt to establish 20 threshold was criticized as exempting virtually every plant modification from the existing requirement and was stayed by the us court of appeals for the dc circuit on december 24 200322 7 elimination of best availa ble retrofit technology bart requirements under section 169a of part c of the clean air act major sources that were in operation between 1962 nd 1977 are subject to bart bart is intended to assure reasonable progress toward the goal of visibility protection in class i national park and w ilderness areas clear skies would exempt egus and opt in facilities from bart for period of 20 years after enactment 8 class i psd areas as noted above s 131 as introduced provides that an affected unit to be located within 50 km of class i area on which construction or reconstruction begins after the date of enactment would remain subject to psd requirements psd currently requires that all major new and modified sources with the potential to affect air quality in class i area obtain new source permit that assures adverse impact on the areas visibility the statute does not specify specific distance limit but the regulations require permit applicants to identify class i areas within 100 km of the units location23 9 class ii psd areas under the psd program areas classified as class ii are permitted to increase moderately ambient concentrations of so2 nox and pm by statutorily determined increment regulatorily determined in the case of nox clear skies would exempt affected units located in class ii areas from having to offset or otherwise further control their emissions in order to maintain ambient air quality within the class ii increments 10 extension of deadlines for the ozone and pm25 naaqs under current law nonattainment areas must genera lly demonstrate that they will attain the new standards for ozone and fine particles pm25 by 2007 2009 or 2010 depending on epas classification scheme24 as noted earlier clear skies would create new transitional area classification in pl ace of nonattainment for areas that can demonstrate through modeling that they will attain the standards by december 2015 until that date transitional areas would not incur penalties or face additional requirements beyond those identified in th epa or state modeling generally the clear skies controls and already promulga ted federal standards for mobile sources after 2015 if an area failed to achieve the standard it would be designated nonattainment by june 2017 nd would then have to impose controls to r eachhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32782crs14 25 personal communication office of air qua lity planning and standards february 10 2005attainment by 2022 meanwhile until 2017 the ozone transitional areas would be exempt from statutory requirements spelled out in subpart 2 of part d of the act described below 11 elimination of the provisions of subpart 2 for ozone nonattainment subpart 2 sections 181 and 182 of the clean air act spells out numerous specific requirements for areas that are classified in marginal moderate serious severe or extreme ozone nona ttainment these can include laer standards and offset requirements for ne w stationary sources imposition of ract on existing stationary sources inspecti on and maintenance programs for motor vehicles vapor recovery at gas stations use of reformulated gasoline and 5000 per ton penalties on some emissions if an area ultimately fails to meet the standard epa has proposed to keep these requirements in place for areas that have failed to meet the 1hour ozone standard but it would appear that such areas might be able to qualify as transitiona l under clear skies25 transitional areas would not be considered in nonattainment if the areas do qualify as transitional they would appear to be able to roll back statutory requirements to which they are now subject provided that they can dem onstrate attainment by 2015 12 elimination of the conformity requirements under section 176 of the clean air act ozone and pm25 nonattainment areas are required to demonstrate that new federally funded proj ects eg for highways tran sit or airports conform to the areas sip for clean air failure to demonstrate transportation conformity can lead to suspension of federal transporta tion funds until conformity is demonstrated by reclassifying most ozone and pm25 nonattainment areas transitional clear skies would eliminate the application of conformity in those areas until 2018 impact of clear skies impact on regulating criteria air pollutants proposed clear skies legislation would ma ke numerous changes to the structure of title i with respect to electric gene rating units egus covered by the proposed legislation and those industrial sources that choose to opt into the proposed program table 3 attempts to provide an overview of what title i would look like under clear skies with respect to egus and industrial sources that chose to opt in the most significant structural change would be the elimination of location as variable for controlling egus unless within 50 km of psd class i area the emission limitations envisioned under clear skies are not based on whether an egu is in an attainment or nonattain ment area this situation ex tends to the allowance system which is allowed to operate regardless of an egus location or state or local governments desires to restrict trading in order to help the area come into compliance with naaqs because egus w ould longer be major sources under the meaning of part c and part d states ability to set stringent laer or offset rules on egus in nonattainment ar eas would be

statute those standards would not be completely controlling by preventing states from restricting allowan ce trading any extra reductions achieved by state legislation designed to help achieve attainment or protect local habitat or scenic areas under part c would create dditional allowances that the utility could sell to upwind utilities not cove red by the states legisla tion the state could neither prevent the sale nor obtain relief under section 126 petition forcing the neighboring utilities to reduce emissions until after 2014 under strict conditions for the 8hour ozone and pm25 naaqs clear skies attempts to eliminate the need for stronger state and local standards at least the need in regulatory sense in most cases by establishing new tra nsitional designation for areas that do not currently meet ambient air quality standards areas would be designated transitional if epa or state modeling showed that clear skies and other measures such as the recently promulgated controls on mobile sources would bring an area into attainment by december 2015 transitional areas would not be considered nonattainment in regulatory or legal sense obviating the n eed and the statutory pretext for additional controls with respect to psd clear skies attempts to protect class i areas by providing for part c requirements for facilities within 50 km of an class i area whether this is sufficient is debatable in terms of protecting areas that states deem worthy of protection but that do not meet clear skies class i requirement states and localities are basically in the same situation as w ith respect to nonattainment that is they are severely constrained in being able to meet requirements by the inability to impose additional controls on egus and optins the distinction that has been the source of the most substan tial controversy over the years egu age is not fully resolved by clear skies both title i and title iv of the caa place the most stringent requirements on new sources allowing existing sources to operate with fe wer controls clear skies would reduce this disparity by setting up allowance reserves for new sour ces however alt hough all allowances would be allocated free the allocation fo rmulas for existing sources would be more generous than for new sources in add ition the allowances for new sources are on firstcome firstserve basis once the reserve is exhausted further allowances are available and existing allocations may be reassigned by epa to future new sources commencing operation thus existin g units would continue to have an advantage over new facilities which would receive either fewer allowances than existing sources or none at all httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32782crs17 table 4 control of mercury and other haps from

analysis section b human health and environmental benefits available at httpepagovaircle arskies03technical_package_sectionbpdf 27 administration analyses indicate that b ecause of credits for early reductions the 29 reduction in mercury envisioned for clear skies first phase will not be achieved until 2013 and the 70 reduction for phase 2 not until after 2026 28 for list of the major sources of mercury and the degree of control required see crs report rl31881 mercury emissions to the air re gulatory and legisl ative proposals table 1 29 see epas clear skies website at httpepagovairclearskiesbasichtmlconclusion in some ways former administrator whitman has identified the central issue in clear skies interaction with the clean air act are the targets stringent enough to permit the relaxing or removal of some provisions of the clean air act designed to achieve the same thing with respect to electric utilities in terms of utility controls designed to achieve the naaqs it must be stated that clear skies will not achieve eith er the 8hour ozone naaqs or the fine particulate naaqs within the current caa compliance deadlines neither in terms of the reductions necessary to achieve those standards nor the timing of the reductions clear skies w ould achieve epas analysis indicates that some nonattainment areas will need additional controls and time to reach attainment26 clear skies as currently drafted would effectively remove additional electric utility control from the suite of options available to states to achieve that additional level of control in addition the optin provisi on means that the reach of clear skies is unclear in some areas the removal of an industrial source from part c or part d could greatly reduce the options state and local authorities would have to achieve naaqs attainment or to ma intain psd increments similar problems are anticipated for clear skies mercury controls at present 45 states have issued fish consumption advisories because of mercury contamination in about half the cases the advisories ffect every water body in the state clear skies proposes relatively modest c ontrols on mercury from electric util ities27 and most other sources of mercury are already subject to more stringent controls28 as currently drafted clear skies would effectively remove additional electric utility controls from the suite of options available to the states to further reduce mercury emissions the ability of industrial sources to opt into the clear skies program would further reduce state mercury control options the response of the administration is to argue that reductions will be achieved sooner and less expensively under clear skies than under the clean air act29 even though clear skies would extend compliance deadlines 5 to 15 years for states to achieve air quality standards the record of title iv suggests that substantial overcontrol may be achieved in the early years of marketbased capandtrade program however as the program also illustrates over the pa st couple of years those early reductions can be used later to increase emissions in given year over thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32782crs19 30 for history of emission reductions under title iv see httpwwwepagovairmarketscmprptarp03summaryhtmlmandated cap30 thus achieving reductions ear ly under capandtrade program does not mean achieving more reductions ove r the longer term for state and local authorities this additional flexibility allowing sources to use banked allowances can further complicate compliance strategies
