1167 classified by robert pollard ministercounselor for economic affai rs for reasons 14 bd 1 u this is an action request 2 c embassy berlin strongly recommends that the washington terrorist finance tracking program tftp and data privacy experts currently scheduled to visit brussels next week also visit berlin to discuss tftp and us data privacy policy with german officials germany is critical to the debate on data protection issues within the eu and we need to engage german government interlocutors parliamentarians and opinion makers the exaggerated data privacy views of the current minority governing partner the free democratic party fdp have contributed to domestic discussion that distorts us policy and is negativelyinfluencing the european debate embassy believes we will be most successful if we address german data privacy concerns in comprehensive way including various information sharing programs such as hspd6 tftp and passenger name records 3 c germany has become difficult partner with regards to securityrelated information sharing initiatives following the september 27 national elections which brought the fdp into the governing coalition the fdp sees themselves as defenders of citizens privacy rights and these views have led the fdp to oppose many of germanys post911 counterterrorism legislative proposals see reftels at times the fdps fixation on data privacy and protection issues looks to have come at the expense of the party forming responsible views on counterterrorism policy 4 c over the past months ambassador murphy the dcm and other embassy staff have engaged german government interlocutors influential parliamentarians and law enforcement officials to stress the importance of securityrelated information sharing initiatives such as tftp however in these meetings our german counterparts consistently raise concerns about us data protection measures and policy furthermore the german views often distort and misrepresent us policy for example current federal justice minister sabine leutheusserschnarrenberger fdp who has considerable influence is particularly outspoken and does not appear to have or perhaps want an informed view of usg data privacy practices it is critical that we aggressively and vocally counter these misrepresentations of us policy 5 c embassy staff raised the prospect of an interagency experts group visiting berlin with xxxxx xxxxx who is strong supporter of close usgerman counterterrorism cooperation and information sharing welcomed the proposal and believed that skeptics of us policy in other ministries and bundestag parliamentarians would benefit from comprehensive and factual discussion of the details of us data protection policy 6 c in addition to our request that the treasury visitors to brussels add berlinstop we strongly recommend that an interagency data privacy experts delegation visit berlin to discuss overall us data privacy policy with german officials the fdp returned to power after tenyear foray in the opposition and key leaders lack experience in the practical matters of tackling realworld security issues in the internet age in our meetings we have made the point that countering terrorism in globalized world where terrorists and their supporters use open borders and information technology to quickly move people and financing requires robust international data sharing we need to also berlin 00000128 002 of 002 demonstrate that the us has strong data privacy measures in place so that robust data sharing comes with robust data protections murphy
