severe acute respiratory syndrome sars the international response summary severe acute respiratory syndrome sars new highly infectious disease was first identified by the world health organization who in february 2003 while the overall number of confirmed cases is not high by comparison with statistics for other infectious diseases the distance and speed with which sars spread raised an alarm over the potential risks to international public health containment appears to be working however there are fears that another sars outbreak could take place during the regular influenza season later in 2003 the united states was instrumental in the global effort to contain the spread of sars affected countries responded in different ways singapore and taiwan acted quickly and encouraged international support in curbing the spread of the virus china on the other hand has been criticized for downplaying the magnitude of the problem particularly in the early phase of the disease this some analysts contend ultimately enabled the virus to cross borders and in the case of canada hemispheres this report takes retrospective look at the global response by who and by those countries most affected it reveals some of the challenges that may lie ahead for the global health community such as global interdependence and transparency surge capacity management of public fear and information

infectious viral disease was first identified by the world health organization who in february 2003 it is believed to have had its beginnings in chinas guangdong province in november 2002 respiratory disease that causes flulike symptoms which may progress to pneumonia sars has an average fatality rate of 15 between november 2002 and july 2003 total of 8437 cases and 813 deaths were reported in 31 countries1 while the overall numbers are not high by comparison with other serious infectious diseases the speed and distance with which sars spread raised an alarm over the potential risks to international public health containment appears to be working however there are fears that another sars outbreak might take place during the regular influenza season later in 2003 this report reviews the global response by who and those countries most affected it also examines the challenges that may lie ahead should another outbreak of sars or another unknown infectious disease occur2 international response since late february when who first identified the outbreak of what later became known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars it has played key role in the global response to the disease sars is striking example of the risks to international public health posed by such infectious diseases it also highlights the need for appropriate mechanisms of containment particularly as global travel has become the primary means of spreading the disease around the world following its initial assessment who made containment of sars its main goal despite the lack of understanding about the disease its cause and future 1 for full discussion of the medical background to sars and the us response see crs report rl31937 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars public health situation and us response 2 other sources are examining the sars outbreak for example jm drazen sars looking back over the first 100 days the new england journal of medicine july 24 2003 crs2 evolution the need was great to introduce series of emergency measures to contain sars outbreaks in the affected areas and prevent further international spread thus reducing opportunities for the new disease to establish itself3 although whos representative in china henk bekedam reportedly said on june 5 2003 that the outbreak of sars had reached its peak worldwide4 who continues to stress the importance of sustaining international public health measures against sars and working towards eliminating it as public health threat the sars outbreak may reveal valuable lessons about the effectiveness of whos surveillance and response systems and its capacity to respond to similar outbreaks in the future examining the evolution of sars also demonstrates the chains of transmission and role of the who in responding to unfolding events although who led an unprecedented global collaborative effort to contain sars the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc also played key role in the global partnership for more information on the role of the cdc in relation to sars see crs report rl31937 sars public health situation and us response overview of the role of the world health organization the world health organization who established in 1948 is the systems authority on international public health issues it assists governments in improving national health services and in establishing worldwide standards for foods chemicals and biological and pharmaceutical products who concentrates on preventive rather than curative programs including efforts to eradicate endemic and other widespread diseases stabilize population growth improve nutrition sanitation and maternal and child care who works through contracts with other agencies and private voluntary organizations the united states has been member of who since 1948 the who policy making body is the world health assembly composed of all 192member states it meets annually in may to decide the overall direction of the organization and the general program for specific period and to adopt the twoyear budget decisions are made by majority vote except for decisions on the budget that require twothirds vote there is veto provision the assembly elects the director general as well as the 32 member states who designate persons to serve on the executive board the executive board meets twice year to review the work of who in more detail and prepares issues for consideration by the assembly ten to twelve members of the board are replaced every year the united states has been member on the executive board three out

established the global outbreak alert and response network goarn which brought together 112 institutions and networks of people and technical resources to respond to disease outbreaks of international concern this global health security network provides not only an operational framework drawing on data expertise and skill but also aims to standardize the international response5 it relies on its partners and agreed standards of practice in responding to potential threats which may include emerging diseases and the intentional use of biological agents in four years between january 1998 and march 2002 goarn examined 538 such cases in 132 countries6 the global public health intelligence network gphin who also relies on the global public health intelligence network gphin which is customized search engine that tracks internet communications this system proved to be very useful in picking up telecommunicated alerts in china the system is also useful to who in clarifying or refuting information that may create disruption or panic other tools include geographical mapping technology and an event management and tracking system that provides an overview of operations the global threat of sars it was clear that sars presented serious global threat lack of information about the cause and evolution of the new disease made its potential impact unknown who concluded that the virus comes from strain likely to include frequent mutations and links to animal species with implications for the likelihood of establishing endemicity and underlining the importance of finding the means to control or contain it several factors were deemed critical in this analysis the symptoms are nonspecific and common the symptoms can be severe and some patients require intensive care for respiratory failure the disease spreads easily from one location to another via air travel as demonstrated in transmission patterns from the initial outbreak in asia to other regions such as north america and europe there is vaccine or treatment yet available and diagnostics tests are of limited use number of antivirals are not effective the causative agent is not well understood so the potential for continued spread remains certain cases may contribute to the rapid spread of infection hospital staff who are vital link to the control of infection are disproportionately affected as are other close contacts of the patients 5 for more information on the global outbreak alert and response network see httpwwwwhointcsroutbreaknetwork 6 who severe acute respiratory syndrome sars

sars except in the case of hivaids other new diseases that have emerged in the last few decades have not presented the same combination of factors that pose such heavy global risk to international health some of these diseases have not sustained strong humantohuman transmission others have relied on food or vector such as mosquitos for transmission and still others have had an identifiable often containable geographic location whos response to sars once the severity of the disease was recognized in february and march 2003 who took aggressive action examining the factors outlined above and the chronology of events unfolding in china hong kong vietnam and toronto it identified international travel as primary means of spreading the virus it also concluded at the time that some people might be highly infectious or super spreaders identifying these individuals could be critical to the control of the disease8 on march 15 2003 who issued emergency travel recommendations as global alert and response to international travelers health care professionals and border authorities later in march it recommended screening passengers at airports coming from areas with recent local transmission and gave advice to airlines on appropriate procedures if case was suspected during flight in april and may on several occasions the who issued its most stringent travel advisories recommending the postponement of all but essential travel to areas considered high risk for sars9 who also quickly moved to set up systems for and increase awareness of the need for immediate isolation and quarantine of those with or suspected of having sars in addition it began the detailed work of contact tracing to find the source of the spread these procedures along with simple diagnostics and screening all contributed to the ongoing containment effort the response to sars placed heavy demands on who and its goarn partners time was very much of the essence who pulled together comprehensive network including mobilizing response on the ground providing resources and supplies monitoring and reporting and establishing scientific and medical collaboration the who issued travel procedures to prevent and manage probable cases of sars10 it established collaborative multicenter research project 7 the eight bullet points are drawn from discussion in severe acute

case management laboratories biosafety blood safety epidemiology mass gatherings and goods and animals from sarsaffected areas12 an urgent plan for the operational response to sars was developed and implemented this included providing expertise and supplies in sarsaffected areas and hospitals and in the air through technology to bring the best minds to the collaboration required this plan resulted in global alert rapid case identification global reporting system and verification regular updates and advice international field support and logistics coordination epidemiological and clinical networking laboratory network13 through this network and daily conference calls epidemiologists were able to discuss cases refine their definitions examine chains of transmission track progress and increase their understanding of what worked best where similarly individuals working in the clinical network were able to share experiences with different forms of treatment examine the possible reasons for the range of individual responses to the disease and develop guidelines for infection control the network of the laboratories enabled many scientists to work together to come up with the identification of the sars virus scientists have much to learn about sars including understanding the evolution of the disease designing early detection prevention and treatment strategies and establishing effective surveillance systems until then containment may remain the most effective control tool if sars becomes endemic the who may find the application of models of response for other infectious diseases such as malaria meningitis and yellow fever useful in combating the disease and developing therapies and vaccines14 who has issued an appeal for funding to support its surveillance and monitoring activities in asia it hopes to help those hardest hit by the disease economically to continue with their efforts to control sars and ultimately to 11 for more information

the who has an annual budget of nearly 850 million it relies heavily on its 192 member states for resources and teams of experts16 sars and international health regulations the outbreak of sars has raised many public health questions including the application of international law according to david p fidler professor of law at indiana school of law in bloomington the legal implications affect three main areas international health regulations ihr public health measures and civil and political rights and principles of state responsibility in responding to sars17 this section will focus on the ihr because of its relevance to who overview of the international health regulations in 1951 under article 21 of the who constitution member states adopted the international sanitary regulations which in 1969 became known as the international health regulations ihr amendments were made in 1973 and 1981 the main purpose was to control the spread of diseases with minimum impact on world traffic through the development of global surveillance system the use of procedures at ports and airports and the creation of diseasespecific provisions some argue that the regulations have not been effective in ensuring protection against diseases in world of increasing trade and travel experts maintain that key reason for ineffectiveness lies in the limited number of diseases to which the ihr applies originally the regulation covered six diseases smallpox relapsing fever typhus cholera plague and yellow fever18 today the ihr applies only to the last three diseases smallpox is considered to have been eradicated some years ago relapsing fever and typhus had been so successfully controlled that they were longer considered public health threat the ihr do not apply to more recent infectious diseases such as hivaids and sars member states were therefore under obligation to report the outbreak of new infectious disease nor were they required to restrict trade or travel even if it would benefit containment19 in the 1990s the who initiated revision of the ihr to address the limited scope of the diseases covered increase its relevance to the kinds of infectious disease 15 the

health security with reference to epidemics in 2002 another resolution made the response more specific and included health risks related not only to natural occurrence but to accidental or deliberate use of biological and chemical agents21 the sars outbreak added momentum to discussions about revising the ihl that were already well under way as recently as january 2003 the 192 member states had been discussing the details of the new framework with resolution for completing the revised regulations although the ihr were recognized as being outdated the case of sars highlighted the problems of transparency china denied the problem existed for months and the information provided from toronto was criticized by some as incomplete and not timely enough the fiftysixth world health assembly fidler argues that the sars epidemic may encourage who member states to accept more robust international legal framework for global infectious disease control than has existed historically22 at the fiftysixth world health assembly in may 2003 the member states adopted two resolutions relevant to the sars outbreak one specifically on sars the other on the revision of ihl23 the sars resolution focuses on eleven recommendations to who member states in addressing the sars outbreak it also requests the who director general to take specific actions none of these are new obligations or binding on member states as earlier press reports might have suggested rather they build on the role of the who and highlight the need for information sharing and international cooperation in combating an

monitoring and responding to infectious diseases although the sars outbreak highlighted the strong need for revision of the ihl then who director general gro harlem brundtland also pointed out the difficult balance to be struck in revising the regulations such as state obligations to report sensitive health information protection of human rights and civil liberties in light of an international health threat and the impact on immigration policies and decisions25 the ihl resolution does not give who significant increase in authority in terms of intervention during potential public health threat nor does it give who the power to reprimand state that does not comply26 however the ihl resolution lays the political groundwork for states to respond appropriately much of the encouragement to comply will likely come from international pressure as the sars case demonstrated27 the ihl resolution was adopted as an interim measure until the ihl revisions are finalized in 2005 the who opted for this twostep process rather than insisting that members immediately approve the incorporation of the resolution into the ihl28 some experts suggest that this resolution will encourage who collaboration within countries and also provide momentum for implementation of the measures outlined in the resolution29 the us delegation initially asked for postponement of action on the proposed resolution hoping to include it in broader discussion but later conceded when it did not enlist member support30 others suggested that this was negotiating tactic used to avoid too early commitment by

learning to segment their large campuses into smaller sections to reduce movement across the campus and to facilitate contact tracing singapore required all students and households to have thermometers by june 2003 other steps taken to prevent the spread of sars included directing all sars cases to one hospital installing video cameras in the homes of all quarantined individuals

underscored the importance of establishing database system that would allow rapid and accurate information sharing on emergent infectious diseases the senate fy2004 labor health and human services hhs and education appropriations bill provides over 370 billion for infectious disease control at cdc including 25 million for sars research prevention and control it also includes 50 million to develop global disease detection system at the cdc that would enable the united states to effectively respond to global infectious disease threat the senate bill also increases nih funding for emerging infectious disease from nearly 600 million in fy2003 to 17 billion capacity building congress has also recognized the need to strengthen state and local capacity to respond to bioterrorist attack or infectious disease outbreak the senate bill proposes that cdc funds for that purpose be maintained at fy2003 levels 940 million part of strengthening state and local capacity includes the support of the health alert network han prior to han onehalf of local public health departments did not have email the han system has been used to share information about sars forty million us dollars have been reserved for this purpose in the senate version of the fy2004 labor hhs and education appropriations bill 87 the washington post sars takes toll on nurses june 12 2003 httpwwwwashingtonpostcom 88 who

hhs and education appropriations bill increases funding for those efforts to 1275 million in fy2004 the cdc epidemic and response program provides resources and scientific expertise for operating and evaluating surveillance systems develops and refines research methods and strategies for public health practitioners and trains public health professionals who respond to public health emergencies and outbreaks the senate version also directs over 578 million to the health resources and services administration hrsa to combat bioterrorism89 future challenges the sars outbreak has provided lessons that may have future application the whocdc intervention greatly increased the effectiveness of the global response number of factors influenced the outcome such as the system of global alerts and awareness and access to immediate highlevel research and scientific collaboration coordinated efforts through the whocdc national governments and the public health professionals also led to positive results as in the case of vietnam dr julie gerberding director of the centers for disease control and prevention had high praise for whos leadership during the crisis and emphasized communication and transparency as key to responding to international health crises areas in which improvements have been called for in the global response to infectious disease threats include global interdependence and transparency lack of transparency in promptly reporting and monitoring sars outbreaks directly contributed to the spread of the disease worldwide and had wideranging impacts beyond the obvious health factors the case of sars demonstrated that state responsibility within globalized world does not end at its borders and that future containment relies on openness and cooperation in the interests of all populations 89 for more information on congressional efforts to combat sars see crs report rl31937 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars public health situation and us response crs20 developing surge capacity the ability of public health systems and the availability of resources to deal with threat like sars were clearly inadequate addressing the need and ability to mobilize additional resources both within the country itself and through the who network during an emergency would improve the response to similar challenges in the future some have expressed concern about the impact sars could have had if the outbreak had reached developing countries with minimal health care infrastructures particularly those already weakened by hivaids others have argued that sars has underscored the importance of boosting aid efforts that offer structural support such as aiding in the training of health care professionals donating medical supplies and equipment upgrading health technologies and ensuring universal inoculation against resurgent diseases such as tuberculosis public fear and information disclosure the who had to strike balance on the one hand it was pressed to give information and use aggressive tactics of containment on the other hand the information about sars may have contributed to public panic and anxiety discrimination in some cases and other impacts such as economic losses some argue that the who did not take into account the impact of its decisionmaking concerning travel advisories and global alert warnings and that the sars risk sometimes did not demonstrate the need for such response90 some governments in the future may be hesitant rapidly and openly to share outbreak information because they may want to avoid potential negative economic impacts such as job losses hotel closures and flight cancellations as occurred at the height of the sars crisis for example 60000 restaurant and hotel workers in hong kong lost their jobs or were placed on unpaid leave during the sars outbreak91 in singapore yearby year comparisons showed that tourist arrivals fell 15 in march 2003 and 67 in april 2003 and hotels reported occupancy rates of only 10 to 30 compared to usual occupancy rates of 70 or more during the first quarter of the year 92 national response the weakness of national surveillance systems and health networks within any one country can dramatically affect the area and rate at which disease spreads if the sars virus had spread more rapidly and extensively throughout the affected countries and for sustained period it could have had significant impact on the health care systems and other systems those in need of health care such as those with cancer requiring surgery or those requiring immediate medical attention may not have been able to receive care in order to contain the sars virus hospital wards and at times entire hospitals were shut down for weeks at time to 90 far eastern economic review sars whoinduced panic
