congress introduced over two dozen measures to address various concerns with foreign investment that arose from the proposed purchase of the britishowned po ports by dubai ports world in early 2006 of the measures that were introduced hr 5337 and s 3549 from the house and senate respectively garnered significant support and passed their respective bodies on july 26 2006 the 109th congress ended before conference committee was convened on hr 5337 or s 3549 and both measures lapsed so far in the 110th congress congresswoman maloney introduced hr 556 the national security foreign investment reform and strengthened transparency act of 2007 on january 18 2007 the measure was approved by the house financial services committee on february 13 2007 with amendments and was approved with amendments by the full house on february 28 2007 by vote of 423 to 0 this measure is similar to many of the provisions of hr 5337 from the 109th congress the measure attempts to address six perceived problems with the current statutes that members identified during the 109th congress 1 that the principal members of the interagency committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius at times seem not to be well informed of the outcomes of reviews and investigations regarding proposed or pending investment transactions 2 that cfius has interpreted incorrectly the requirements under current statutes for investigations of transactions that involve firms that are owned or controlled by foreign government 3 that reporting requirements under current statutes do not provide congress with enough information about the operations and actions of cfius for members to fulfill their oversight responsibilities 4 that cfius exercises too much discretion in its ability to choose which transactions it investigates 5 that the definition of national security used by cfius is longer adequate in post september 11th world and 6 that deadlines placed on cfius to complete reviews and investigations of investment transactions do not provide adequate time in some instances for the committee to complete its reviews and investigations this report provides background information on the committee on foreign investment in the united states and on the exonflorio provision in addition the report provides an overview of hr 556 this report will be updated as warranted by events contents

foreign investment that arose from the proposed purchase of the britishowned po ports1 by dubai ports world2 in early 20063 in particular the transaction spurred some members to question the effectiveness of the relatively obscure interagency group the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius the group has been charged with developing and implementing the administrations policy on foreign investment and with conducting national security reviews under the exonflorio provision of the defense production act 50 usc sec 2170 of the measures that were introduced hr 5337 and s 3549 from the house and senate respectively garnered significant support and passed their respective bodies on july 26 2006 the 109th congress ended before conference committee was convened on hr 5337 or s 3549 and both measures lapsed so far in the 110th congress congresswoman maloney has introduced hr 556 the national security foreign investment reform and strengthened transparency act of 2007 which was adopted by the full house on february 28 2007 the bill contains many provisions that are similar to hr 5337 from the 109th congress hr 556 represents an effort to correct perceived problems with the current process that arose during consideration of the dubai ports world transaction in particular members generally expressed concerns about six areas first members were concerned that the principal members of cfius at times seem not to be well informed of the outcomes of reviews and investigations made by cfius regarding proposed or pending investment transactions because the duty for reviewing such transactions has been delegated in most agencies to lowerlevel personnel second some members argued that cfius was interpreting incorrectly the requirements 1 peninsular and oriental steam company is leading ports operator and transport company with operations in ports ferries and property development it operates container terminals and logistics operations in over 100 ports and has presence in 18 countries 2 dubai ports world was created in november 2005 by integrating dubai ports authority and dubai ports international it is one of the largest commercial port operators in the world with operations in the middle east india europe asia latin america the carribean and north america 3 for additional information see crs report rl33614 exonflorio foreign

statutes for investigations of transactions that involve firms that are owned or controlled by foreign government third many members argued that the current statutes do not provide congress with enough information about the operations and actions of cfius for them to fulfill their oversight responsibilities fourth some members argued that cfius exercises too much discretion in its ability to choose which transactions it investigates and that it needs to be held more accountable to congress for its decisions regarding reviews and investigations of investment transactions fifth some members questioned the definition of national security used by the committee as being too narrowly interpreted and out of sync with the post september 11th view of national security last some members expressed their concerns that the time constraints placed on cfius to complete reviews and investigations of investment transactions does not provide adequate time in some instances for the committee to complete its reviews and investigations the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius is an interagency committee that serves the president in overseeing the national security implications of foreign investment in the economy cfius was established by an executive order of president ford in 1975 with broad responsibilities and few specific powers4 the committee is housed in the department of the treasury and has generally operated in relative obscurity initially cfius was established with six members but the membership has been expanded over time to twelve through various executive orders the twelve members include the secretaries of state the treasury defense homeland security and commerce the united states trade representative the chairman of the council of economic advisers the attorney general the director of the office of management and budget the director of the office of science and technology policy the assistant to the president for national security affairs and the assistant to the president for economic policy5 the exonflorio provision the exonflorio provision section 2170 of

pending foreign acquisitions mergers or takeovers of persons engaged in interstate commerce in the united states which threaten to impair the national security the statute indicates that the president may make an investigation to determine the effects on national security of such investments most importantly however congress directed that the president can exercise this discretionary authority only if he determines that two conditions exist 1 other us laws are inadequate or inappropriate to protect the national security and 2 that he must have credible evidence that the foreign investment will impair the national security for the purposes of this legislation congress purposely did not define national security but intended to have the term interpreted broadly without limitation to particular industry6 in 1988 congress approved the exonflorio provision as part of the omnibus trade act7 through executive order 12661 president reagan implemented provisions of the omnibus trade act and he delegated his authority to administer the exonflorio provision to cfius8 particularly to conduct reviews of foreign investment to undertake investigations and to make recommendations although the statute itself does not specifically mention cfius as result of president reagans action cfius was transformed from purely administrative body with limited authority to review and analyze data on foreign investment to one with broad mandate and significant authority to advise the president on foreign investment transactions and to recommend that some transactions be suspended or prohibited the committee has 30 days to decide whether to investigate case and an additional 45 days to make its recommendation once the recommendation is made the president has 15 days to act regulations developed by the treasury department in november 1991 implemented the exonflorio provision9 these regulations created system of voluntary notification by the parties to an investment transaction and they allow for notices of acquisitions by agencies that are members of cfius despite the voluntary nature of the notification firms largely comply with these provisions because the regulations stipulate that foreign acquisitions that are governed by the exonflorio review process but that do not notify the committee remain subject indefinitely to divestment or other appropriate actions by the president this process has become one in number of regulatory steps that firms consider as they undertake merger acquisition or takeover the byrd amendment in 1992 congress amended the exonflorio statute through section 837a of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1993 known as the byrd 6 congressional record daily edition vol 134 april 20 1988 p h2118 7 pl 100418 title v subtitle part ii or 50 usc app 2170 8 executive order 12661 of december 27 1988 54 fr 779 9 regulations pertaining to mergers acquisitions and takeovers by foreign persons 31 cfr part 800 crs4 amendment after the amendments sponsor the provision requires cfius to investigate proposed mergers acquisitions or takeovers in cases where 1 the acquirer is controlled by or acting on behalf of foreign government and 2 the acquisition results in control of person engaged in interstate commerce in the united states that could affect the national security of the united states10 this amendment came under particularly intense scrutiny by the 109th congress as result of the dp world transaction many members of congress and others believed that this amendment required cfius to undertake full 45day investigation of the transaction because dp world was controlled by or acting on behalf of foreign government the dp world acquisition however exposed sharp rift between what some members apparently believed the amendment directed cfius to do and how the members of cfius were interpreting the amendment in particular some members of congress apparently interpreted the amendment to require cfius to conduct mandatory 45day investigation without exception if the foreign firm involved in transaction is owned or controlled by foreign government representatives of cfius however argued that there were two factors that controlled their decision not to conduct 45day investigation of the transaction first they argued that the requirements of the exonflorio provision itself precluded them from engaging in 45day investigation because their initial review did not find credible evidence that the transaction would impair national security basic threshold for cfius to meet in order to invoke the exonflorio provision secondly representatives indicated that they interpret the amendment to mean that 45day investigation is discretionary and not mandatory again because of the requirement that transaction must be found to cause an impairment to national security before the exonflorio provision can be invoked cfius representatives also argued that their decision not to launch full 45day investigation of the dp world was the result of an extensive informal review of the transaction prior to the case being officially filed with cfius and as result of formal 30day review during these two reviews cfius members believed that all concerns that had been expressed by members of cfius had been adequately resolved so that by the time of the review member of cfius had any unresolved concerns about the impact of the transaction on national security they conceded that the case met the first criterion under the byrd amendment because dp world was controlled by foreign government but that it did not meet the second part of the requirement because cfius had concluded during the 30day review that the transaction could not affect the national security11 10 pl 102484 october 23 1992 11 briefing on the dubai ports world deal before the senate armed services committee february 23 2006 crs5 as result of the attention by both the public and congress dp world officials indicated that they would sell off the us port operations to an american owner12 on december 11 2006 dp world officials announced that unit of aig global investment group new yorkbased asset management company with 683 billion in assets but experience in port operations would acquire the us port operations for an undisclosed amount13 through the exonflorio provision congress directed that the president or his designee may consider short list of factors in deciding whether to block foreign acquisition merger or takeover again the president has broad discretion under the current statute to decide the basis on which he determines whether transaction might impair the national security this list includes the following factors 1 domestic production needed for projected national defense requirements 2 the capability and capacity of domestic industries to meet national defense requirements including the availability of human resources products technology materials and other supplies and services 3 the control of domestic industries and commercial activity by foreign citizens as it affects the capability and capacity of the us to meet the requirements of national security 4 the potential effects of the transactions on the sales of military goods equipment or technology to country that supports terrorism or proliferates missile technology or chemical and biological weapons and 5 the potential effects of the transaction on us technological leadership in areas affecting us national security part of congresss motivation in adopting the exonflorio provision apparently arose from concerns that foreign takeovers of us firms could not be stopped unless the president declared national emergency or regulators invoked federal antitrust environmental or securities laws through the exonflorio provision congress attempted to strengthen the presidents hand in conducting foreign investment policy while providing cursory role for itself as means of emphasizing that as much as possible the commercial nature of investment transactions should be free from political considerations congress also attempted to balance public concerns about the economic impact of certain types of foreign investment with the nations long standing international commitment to maintain an open and receptive environment for foreign investment furthermore congress did not intend to have the exonflorio provision alter the generally open foreign investment climate of the country or to have it inhibit 12 weisman jonathan and bradley graham dubai firm to sell us port operations the washington post march 10 2006 p a1 13 king neil jr and greg hitt dubai ports world sells us assets aig buys operations that ignited controversy as democrats plan changes the wall street journal december 12 2006 p a1 crs6 foreign direct investments in industries that could not be considered to be of national security interest the basic approach of the provision therefore was to presume that foreign investment generally has positive effect on the economy and that it should be encouraged and restricted only in those cases in which specific transaction had met burden of proof that the proposed investor might take action that threatens to impair the national security at the time the exonflorio provision was adopted some analysts believed the provision could potentially widen the scope of industries that fell under the national security rubric cfius however is not free to establish an independent approach to reviewing foreign investment transactions but operates under the authority of the president and reflects his attitudes and policies as result the discretion cfius uses to review and to investigate foreign investment cases reflects policy guidance from the president in addition congress did not adopt specific definition of national security when it approved the exonflorio provision instead during review or investigation of foreign investment each member of cfius is expected to apply that definition of national security that is consistent with the legislative mandate of the cfius member as result the cfius process relies on each member applying their own particular definition of national security and making any concerns that arise from such review known to the other members of cfius foreign investors are also constrained by legislation that bars foreign direct investment in such industries as maritime operations aircraft banking resources and power14 generally these sectors were closed to foreign investors primarily for national defense purposes prior to passage of the exonflorio provision to prevent these areas from being subject to foreign control exonflorio provision after september 11 2001 arguably the events of september 11 2001 have reshaped congressional attitudes toward the exonflorio provision and the manner in which it should be used during discussion about the exonflorio provision prior to its passage in 1988 the reagan administration opposed definition of national security that included essential commerce and national security because the administration argued that the definition was too broad ultimately the reagan administration succeeded in getting the term essential commerce dropped from the provision after the september 11th terrorist attacks however congress passed and president bush signed the usa patriot act of 2001 uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism15 in this act congress provided for special support for critical industries which it defined as systems and assets whether physical or virtual so vital to the united states that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have debilitating 14 crs report rl33103 foreign investment in the united states major federal restrictions by michael v seitzinger 15 pl 10756 title x sec 1014 october 26 2001 42 usc sec 5195ce crs7 impact on security national economic security national public health or safety or any combination of those matters16 this broad definition is enhanced to some degree by other provisions of the act which specifically identify certain sectors of the economy therefore as likely candidates for consideration as critical infrastructure including telecommunications energy financial services water transportation sectors17 and the cyber and physical infrastructure services critical to maintaining the national defense continuity of government economic prosperity and quality of life in the united states18 the following year congress adopted the language in the patriot act on critical infrastructure into the homeland security act of 200219 by adopting the terms critical infrastructure and homeland security following the events of september 11 2001 congress demonstrated that the attacks fundamentally altered the way many members of congress and many in the public view the concept of national security as result many in congress and in the public have come to believe that economic activities are separately identifiable component of national security in addition many in congress and elsewhere apparently perceive greater risks to the economy arising from foreign investments in which the foreign investor is owned or controlled by foreign governments as result of the terrorist attacks the dubai ports world case in particular demonstrated that there was difference between the postseptember 11 expectations held by many in congress about the role of foreign investment in the economy and of economic infrastructure issues as component of national security and the operations of cfius for some members of congress cfius seemed to be out of touch with the postseptember 11 2001 view of national security because it remains founded in the late 1980s orientation of the exonflorio provision which views national security primarily in terms of national defense and downplays or even excludes broader notion of economic national security activity within congress and the intense public and congressional reaction that arose from the proposed dubai ports world acquisition spurred the bush administration in late 2006 to make an important administrative change in the way cfius reviews foreign investment transactions cfius and president bush approved the acquisition of lucent technologies inc by the frenchbased alcatel sa which was completed on december 1 2006 before the transaction was approved by cfius however alcatellucent was required to agree to national security arrangement known as special security arrangement or ssa that restricts alcatels access to sensitive work done by lucents research arm bell labs and the communications infrastructure in the united states the most controversial feature of this arrangement is that it allows cfius to reopen review of the deal and to overturn its approval at any time if cfius believes 16 ibid 17 42 usc sec 5195cb2 18 42 usc sec 5195cb3 19 6 usc sec 1014 crs8 the companies materially fail to comply with the terms of the arrangement this marks significant change in the cfius process prior to this transaction cfius reviews and investigations had been portrayed and had been considered to be final as result firms were willing to subject themselves voluntarily to cfius review because they believed that once an investment transaction was scrutinized and approved by the members of cfius the firms could be assured that the investment transaction would be exempt from any future reviews or actions this administrative change however means that cfius determination may longer be final decision and it adds new level of uncertainty to foreign investors seeking to acquire us firms broad range of us and international business groups are objecting to this change in the administrations policy20 overview of hr 556 hr 556 was approved by the house financial services committee on february 13 2007 with amendments the amendment offered by committee chairman frank and representative price included six changes to the bill as it was introduced on january 18 2007 these changes responded to concerns that were expressed by the bush administration that some of the procedures that would have been established under hr 556 would have created new levels of bureaucracy and administrative bottlenecks that potentially could have delayed and discouraged foreign investment the changes would 1 allow deputy secretary of an undersecretary of an agency to approve an investment transaction on behalf of the respective agency instead of requiring the secretary to approve the transaction 2 require the deputy secretary of an agency to certify investment transactions by companies that are owned by foreign government 3 give the director of national intelligence adequate time to consider national security implications instead of requiring minimum of 30 days to examine security implications 4 clarify that agencies act on behalf of cfius in administering agreements to mitigate security concerns that are raised about foreign investor during cfius review 5 strike provision that would have allowed cfius to reopen approvals and would have required the attorney general to report to congress21 on february 28 2007 hr 556 was approved with amendments by the full house the three amendments that were adopted clarified the language of the measure in some cases and added number of new sections in particular the measure added new factor that requires cfius and the president to consider the impact of an investment transaction on us efforts to curtail human smuggling in approving transaction another change would require cfius to notify senators and members of congress if the committee determines that the areas represented by the senator or member would be significantly affected by an investment transaction 20 kirchgaessner stephanie us threat to reopen terms of lucent and alcatel deal mergers financial times december 1 2006 p

trade daily february 14 207 crs9 hr 556 attempts to address congressional concerns by establishing cfius by statutory authority thereby giving congress direct role in determining the makeup and operations of the committee the measure would have the secretary of the treasury continue to serve as the chairman of cfius despite the misgivings of some members and the secretary homeland security and the secretary of defense serve as vice chairmen in other respects the bill retains the basic structure of the committee as it presently exists except that it would add the secretary of energy as permanent member of cfius according to the measure the committee would operate under the same time frame that currently exists with 30 days allotted for review 45 days for an investigation and 15 days for the president to make his determination the president would retain his authority as the only officer with the authority to suspend or prohibit certain types of foreign investments the measure would also place additional requirements on firms that resubmitted filing after previously withdrawing filing before full review is completed in hr 556 review or investigation would be considered to be complete until it had been approved by majority of the members of cfius and signed by the secretary of the treasury and the secretary of homeland security to insure that principal members of cfius were aware of all reviews and investigations completed by cfius the bill would require cfius to review all covered foreign investment transactions to determine whether transaction threatens to impair the national security covered foreign investment transaction is defined as any merger acquisition or takeover which results in foreign control of any person engaged in interstate commerce in the united states the measure places increased requirements on cfius to review investment transactions in which the foreign person is owned or controlled by foreign government it is unclear however to what extent the bill would alter the current process the measure would explicitly require cfius to review all investment transactions in which the foreign person is owned or controlled by foreign government but the measure does not amend or alter the current statute in the area that has been the source of recent differences between cfius and congress in particular the current statute states that the president and through him cfius can use the exonflorio process only if he finds that there is credible evidence that foreign investment will impair national security as result cfius has determined as was the case in the dubai ports transaction that if the committee does not have credible evidence that an investment will impair the national security that it is not required to undertake full 45day investigation it is possible that cfius could continue to operate in this manner regardless of the passage of the measure in addition if cfius does act to investigate all foreign investment transactions in which the foreign person is owned or controlled by foreign government foreign investors may well regard it as an important policy change by the united states toward foreign investment as previously stated the current system presumes that foreign investment transactions are acceptable and provide positive contribution to the economy as result the burden is on the members of cfius to prove that particular transaction is threat to national security hr 556 however might be crs10 interpreted to presume that investment transactions in which the foreign person is owned or controlled by foreign government are threat to the nations security simply because of the relationship to the foreign government and therefore might require the firms to prove that they are not threat although the number of investment transactions year in which the foreign investor is associated with foreign government is small compared with the total number of foreign investment transactions foreign investors and foreign governments likely will view this as significant change in the traditional us approach to foreign investment the bill attempts to increase the role of congressional oversight by requiring greater reporting by cfius on its actions either during or after it completes reviews and investigations and by increasing reporting requirements on cfius hr 556 would require the secretary of the treasury the secretary of homeland security and the secretary of commerce to sign and approve any review or investigation in those cases in which the foreign person involved in an investment transaction is owned or controlled by foreign government majority of the members of cfius would be required to approve the transaction and the president and the chair and vice chairs of cfius would be required to sign off on investments in which at least one member of cfius did not agree with the decision of the majority to approve the transaction the measure would require cfius to provide congress with greater amount of detailed information about its operations hr 556 would require cfius to notify specified members at the conclusion of any investment investigation and to report annually to congress hr 556 also would provide for greater reporting on and increased authority for cfius to negotiate provisions with the foreign firms involved in investment transactions to mitigate the impact of the transaction under current statutes cfius has authority to negotiate such agreements with firms and it is not clear that it has any authority to enforce such agreements hr 556 provides for process to track the agreements and to report the progress of such agreements and any changes to the agreements to the members of cfius and to the president the measure also would amend the current statute regarding the meaning of national security and would place additional requirements on cfius regarding national security reviews the bill would explicitly require the director of national intelligence to conduct reviews of any investment that posed threat to the national security the bill also provides for additional factors the president and cfius would be required to use in assessing foreign investments in particular the bill would add implications for the nations critical infrastructure as factor for reviewing or investigating an investment transaction cfius national security investigations according to the exonflorio provision and subsequent regulations issued by the treasury department cfius has 30 days after it receives the initial formal notification by the parties to merger acquisition or takeover to decide whether to investigate case as result of its determination that the investment threatens to impair the national security of the united states if during this 30day period all the members of cfius conclude that the investment does not threaten to impair the national security or if the concerns of any member are resolved the review is terminated if however at least one member of the committee determines that the crs11 investment does threaten to impair the national security and if these concerns are not resolved cfius can proceed to 45day investigation at the conclusion of the investigation or the 45day review period whichever comes first the committee can decide to offer recommendation or it can recommend that the president suspend or prohibit the investment the president is under obligation to follow the recommendation of the committee to suspend or prohibit an investment in subsequent amendment the byrd amendment cfius is required to conduct 45day investigation of transaction in any instance in which the foreign entity is controlled by or acting on behalf of foreign government which could result in the foreign entity gaining control of the us entity and that could affect the national security of the united states such an investigation is required to begin later than 30 days after cfius receives written notice of the proposed or pending merger acquisition or takeover and be completed in more than 45 days hr 556 would establish the committee on foreign investment in the united states as matter of statute and would amend the current procedures for cfius review and investigation the measure would strike out the first two sections of the current statute that deal with investigations and replace them with provisions that would provide for the same 30day review and 45day investigation stages that exist under the current provision but would alter the provision in number of ways first the measure would explicitly indicate that the investigation would be conducted by the committee on foreign investment in the united states which is referred to only as the presidents designee in the current statute next the measure would amend and broaden the language in the current statute regarding national security by indicating that national security for this provision would be construed so as to include those issues relating to homeland security including its application to critical infrastructure the measure would provide fornational security reviews and investigations which are not part of the current cfius process although the director of national intelligence is often asked to participate in cfius reviews and investigations in an important departure from the current procedure cfius would be required to shall review any merger acquisition or takeover to determine the effects of the transaction on the national security of the united states in addition cfius would be required to shall conduct an investigation of transaction if the committee determines that the transaction would result in foreign control of any person engaged in interstate commerce in the united states currently cfius has broad discretion to determine which cases it reviews and investigates since its directive states that it may review or investigate transaction once review has been initiated firm cannot withdraw its notice unless it provides written request for such withdrawal and the request is approved in writing by the chairperson in consultation with the vice chairpersons of the committee in addition to any entity that is party to merger acquisition or takeover being able to initiate review the president the committee or any member of the committee also could request that cfius review transaction this authority could not be delegated by any member of cfius to any person other than to an appropriate deputy secretary under secretary or the equivalent these individuals would be able to review transaction that previously had been reviewed and approved under crs12 certain circumstances 1 if it was later discovered that false or misleading material information had been submitted to cfius 2 if material information including documents had been omitted from information submitted to cfius or 3 if party to transaction had intentionally failed to adhere to any mitigating agreements or conditions upon which the original approval had been granted and other remedy or enforcement tool was available to address such breach of the mitigating agreement the measure also would require the president acting through cfius to conduct national security investigation of the effects of transaction on the national security of the united states and to take any necessary actions in connection with the transaction to protect the national security of the united states under certain conditions these conditions would be 1 as result of review of the transaction cfius determined that the transactions threatened to impair the national security of the united states and that the threat had not been mitigated during or prior to review of the transaction or the foreign person was controlled by foreign government 2 during roll call vote of the members of cfius at least one member voted against approving the transaction 3 the director of national intelligence had identified particularly complex national security or intelligence issues that threaten to impair the national security of the united states and cfius members had not been able to develop and agree on measures to mitigate the threat during review the investigation would be required to be completed within 45 days but the measure would provide for an extension of the deadline of up to an additional 45 days if the extension had been requested by the president or by roll call vote of twothirds of the cfius members during the markup session on the measure the house committee on financial services provided an important exception to the requirement that cfius conduct an investigation of transaction if it determines during review that party to transaction is owned or controlled by foreign government instead the measure would not require such an investigation even if cfius had determined during review that the party to transaction was controlled by foreign government if 1 it also determined that the transaction will not affect the national security of the united states and 2 agreement or condition was required relative to the transaction to mitigate any threat to the national security also the measure would require the approval of majority of the members of cfius and the approval of and signed determination by the secretary of the treasury the secretary of homeland security and the secretary of commerce on any review or investigation in order for the cfius process to be considered final or complete for those cases in which the foreign entity was determined to be controlled by foreign government and at least one member of cfius did not vote in favor of approval the cfius investigation process would not be considered to be complete until the president and the chairperson and the vice chairperson of the committee signed the committee report to indicate their approval in an other important change during the markup session the house committee added the requirement that action by the president is required in certain cases specifically the measure would require the president to approve and sign his approval of an investment transaction in which the party to the transaction is person crs13 or country that has been determined by the secretary of state under the export administration act or other provisions of law repeatedly to have provided support for acts of terrorism the bill would grant the director of national intelligence adequate time to carry out thorough analysis of any threat to the national security of the united states of any merger acquisition or takeover this analysis specifically would include request for information be made from the department of the treasurys director of the office of foreign assets control and the director of the financial crimes enforcement network in addition the director of national intelligence would be required to seek and to incorporate the views of all affected or appropriate intelligence agencies the director of national intelligence however would maintain role that is independent from cfius by not serving as an official member of cfius and would not serve in policy role other than to provide analysis in connection with an investment transaction firms would not be prohibited under this measure from submitting additional information or modifying any agreement in connection with transaction while the transaction was being reviewed or investigated composition of cfius the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius was created by executive order of president ford in 197522 to serve the president in overseeing the national security implications of foreign investment in the economy president fords 1975 executive order established the basic structure of cfius and directed that the representative23 of the secretary of the treasury be the chairman of the committee the executive order also stipulated that the committee would have the primary continuing responsibility within the executive branch for monitoring the impact of foreign investment in the united states both direct and portfolio and for coordinating the implementation of united states policy on such investment24 presently the committee consists of twelve members including the secretaries of state the treasury defense homeland security and commerce the united states trade representative the chairman of the council of economic advisers the attorney general the director of the office of management and budget the director of the office of science and technology policy the assistant to the president for national security affairs and the assistant to the president for economic policy25 22 executive order 11858 b may 7 1975 40 fr 20263 23 the term representative was dropped by executive

2 1980 45 fr 969 added the united states trade representative and substituted the chairman of the council of economic advisors for the executive director of the council on international economic continued crs14 the measure would establish the members of cfius as matter of statute compared with the present situation in which cfius is creation of various presidential orders cfius would include the same twelve members that currently constitute the committee but the measure would also add the secretary of energy to cfius the secretary of the treasury would continue to serve as the chairperson of the committee but new vice chairperson position would be created and held by the secretary of homeland security and the secretary of commerce the committee would be empowered to take such testimony receive such evidence administer such oaths in order to carry out review or investigation the committee also would be able to require the attendance and testimony of such witnesses and production of such books records correspondence memoranda papers and documents as the chairperson of the committee determines to be advisable presidential actions hr 556 would leave unaltered the current exonflorio provision which grants the president the authority to take such action for such time as the president considers appropriate to suspend or prohibit any acquisition merger or takeover by foreign entity of persons engaged in interstate commerce in the united states that threaten to impair the national security the president is required to announce his decision within 15 days after cfius completes its investigation of proposed transaction the president also has the authority to direct the attorney general to seek appropriate relief including divestment relief in the district courts of the united states in order to implement and enforce this decision by the president findings hr 556 also would leave unchanged the current exonflorio provision which grants the president the authority to block proposed or pending foreign acquisitions of persons engaged in interstate commerce in the united states that threaten to impair the national security congress directed however that before the president can invoke this authority he must believe that the case meets two tests or findings first he must believe that other us laws are inadequate or inappropriate to protect the national security secondly he must have credible evidence that the foreign investment will impair the national security factors used in findings as it is currently written the exonflorio provision includes list of five factors the president may consider in deciding to block foreign acquisition these factors 25 continued policy executive order 12661 december 27 1988 54 fr 779 added the attorney general and the director of the office of management and budget executive order 12860 september 3 1993 58 fr 47201 added the director of the office of science and technology policy the assistant to the president for national security affairs and the assistant to the president for economic policy executive order 13286 section 57 february 28 2003 added the secretary of homeland security crs15 are also considered by the individual members of cfius as part of their own review process to determine if particular transaction threatens to impair the national security this list includes the following elements 1 domestic production needed for projected national defense requirements 2 the capability and capacity of domestic industries to meet national defense requirements including the availability of human resources products technology materials and other supplies and services 3 the control of domestic industries and commercial activity by foreign citizens as it affects the capability and capacity of the us to meet the requirements of national security 4 the potential effects of the transactions on the sales of military goods equipment or technology to country that supports terrorism or proliferates missile technology or chemical and biological weapons and 5 the potential effects of the transaction on us technological leadership in areas affecting us national security hr 556 would amend the current factors the president and the committee use to evaluate mergers acquisitions or takeovers in particular the statute would change the status of the factors to be considered from being discretionary may to being required shall in evaluating transaction also this measure would add four more factors to the five that currently exist these new factors are 1 whether the transaction has securityrelated impact on critical infrastructure in the united states 2 the potential effects of the transaction on the efforts of the united states to curtail human smuggling and to curtail drug smuggling 3 whether the entity involved is being controlled by foreign government and 4 such other factors as the president or his designee may determine to be appropriate generally or in connection with specific review or transaction the bill would make the united states immune from any liability for any losses or expenses incurred by the parties to an investment transaction as result of actions taken by cfius if the entities did not submit written notification to cfius or if the transaction was completed prior to the completion of cfius review or investigation confidentiality the exonflorio provision codified confidentiality requirements that are similar to those that appeared in executive order 11858 by stating that any information or documentary material filed under the provision may not be made public except as crs16 may be relevant to any administrative or judicial action or proceeding26 the provision does state however that this confidentiality provision shall not be construed to prevent disclosure to either house of congress or to any duly authorized committee or subcommittee of the congress the exonflorio provision requires the president to provide written report to the secretary of the senate and the clerk of the house detailing his decision and his actions relevant to any transaction that was subject to 45day investigation27 as presently written there is requirement for cfius or the president to notify or otherwise inform congress of cases it reviews or of the outcome of any investigation hr 556 would provide for the release of proprietary information which can be associated with particular party to committees only with assurances that the information would remain confidential members of congress and their staff members would be accountable under current provisions of law governing the release of certain types of information mitigation and tracking since the implementation of the exonflorio provision cfius has developed several practices that likely were not envisioned when the statute was drafted for instance members of cfius negotiate conditions with firms at times either to mitigate or to remove matters that raise national security concerns among the members of cfius such agreements often are informal arrangements that have an uncertain basis in statute and have not been tested in court these arrangements have been negotiated during the formal 30day review period or even during an informal process prior to the formal filing of notice of an investment transaction hr 556 would address one concern about cfiuss actions by granting cfius or any agency designated by the chairperson and vice chairperson of cfius the authority to negotiate impose or enforce any agreement or condition with the parties to transaction in order to mitigate any threat to the national security of the united states such agreements would be based on riskbased analysis of the threat posed by the transaction also if notification of transaction is withdrawn before any review or investigation by cfius can be completed the measure grants the committee the authority to take number of actions in particular the committee would be able to develop 1 interim protections to address specific concerns about the transaction pending resubmission of notice by the parties 2 specific time frames for resubmitting the notice and 3 process for tracking any actions taken by any party to the transaction cfius also would be granted the authority to designate one or more appropriate federal departments or agencies to negotiate modify monitor and enforce agreements in order to mitigate any threat to national security the agencies or departments would be required to provide reports on halfyearly basis to cfius and the parties to an agreement would be required to report on the implementation of any 26 50 usc appendix sec 2170c 27 50 usc appendix sec 2170g crs17 material change in circumstances furthermore the federal entity or entities would be required to report to cfius on any modification to any agreement or condition that had been imposed and to ensure that any significant modification is reported to the director of national intelligence and to any other federal department or agency that may have material interest in such modification in addition cfius would be required to develop method for evaluating the compliance of firms that had entered into mitigation agreement or condition that was imposed as requirement for approval of the investment transaction such measures however would be required to be developed in such way that they would allow cfius to determine that compliance is taking place without also 1 unnecessarily diverting cfius resources from assessing any new covered transaction for which written notice had been filed and 2 placing unnecessary burdens on party to investment transaction congressional oversight in hearings that were held after the dubai ports world transaction became public various members expressed concern that they were provided so little information under the current statutes that their ability to fulfill their oversight responsibilities was hampered in addition some members apparently believed that the current requirements do not provide members with enough information to address public concerns that occasionally arise concerning particular investment transactions such as the dubai ports world transaction currently the president is required to report to congress on his determination to take action on proposed investment transaction after cfius has completed 30day review and 45day investigation of the transaction the presidents report is required to contain detailed explanation of the findings and of the factors the president used to make his determination the president is also required to provide an assessment of the risk of diversion of defense critical technology posed by an investment transaction if such an assessment is performed and that the assessment be provided to any other individual responsible for reviewing or investigating investment transactions under the exon florio provision in addition the president is required to provide congress with quadrennial report which evaluates two issues 1 whether there is credible evidence of coordinated strategy by one or more countries or companies to acquire us companies involved in research development or production of critical technologies for which the united states is leading producer and 2 whether there are industrial espionage activities directed or directly assisted by foreign governments against private us companies aimed at obtaining commercial secrets related to critical technologies hr 556 would increase oversight by the congress not later than five days after cfius completed an investigation or 15 days after the end of an investigation if the president had determined to take actions under the exonflorio provision the committee would be required to provide written report to leaders in both houses of congress and to the chairman and ranking member of committees in both houses with jurisdiction over any aspect of the transaction and its possible effects on national security specifically at minimum the committee on foreign affairs the crs18 committee on financial services and the committee on energy and commerce in the house cfius also would be required to brief certain congressional leaders if they requested such briefing members of congress and their staff would be subject to disclosure limitations and proprietary information would be shared with congressional committees only under conditions that would assure the confidentiality of the information under hr 556 cfius would be required to report annually to congress on any reviews or investigations that it had conducted during the prior year each report would include list of all reviews and investigations that had been conducted information on the nature of the business activities of the parties involved in an investment transaction information about the status of the review or investigation and information on any withdrawal from the process any roll call votes by the committee any extension of time for any investigation and any presidential decision or action taken under the exonflorio provision in addition cfius would be required to report on trend information on the number of filings investigations withdrawals and presidential decisions or actions that were taken the report also would include cumulative information on the business sectors involved in filings and the countries from which the investments originated information on the status of the investments of companies that withdrew notices and the types of security arrangements and conditions cfius used to mitigate national security concerns the methods the committee used to determine that firms were complying with mitigation agreements or conditions and detailed discussion of all perceived adverse effects of investment transactions on the national security or critical infrastructure of the united states relative to critical technologies the annual cfius report would be required to include an evaluation of any credible evidence of coordinated strategy by one or more countries or companies to acquire us companies involved in research development or production of critical technologies in which the united states is leading producer the report also would include an evaluation of possible industrial espionage activities directed or directly assisted by foreign governments against private us companies aimed at obtaining commercial secrets related to critical technologies for the purposes of this section critical technologies would be defined as technology defined in the national science and technology policy organization and priorities act of 197628 or other critical technology critical components or critical technology items essential to national defense of national security the measure also would require the inspector general of the department of the treasury to investigate any failure of cfius to comply with requirements for reporting that were imposed prior to the passage of this measure and to report the findings of this report to the congress in particular the report would be required to 28 pl 94282 may 11 1976 which states that the priority needs of the nation relative to investment in science and technology are 1 promoting conservation and efficient utilization of natural and human resources 2 protecting the oceans and coastal zones 3 strengthening the economy and promoting full employment 4 assuring adequate supplies of food materials and energy 5 improving the quality of health care and 6 improving the nations housing transportation and communication systems crs19 be sent to the chairman and ranking member of each committee of the house and the senate with jurisdiction over any aspect of the report including the committee on international relations the committee on financial services and the committee on energy and commerce of the house in addition the measure would require the secretary of the treasury in consultation with the secretary of state and the secretary of commerce to conduct study on investment in the united states particularly in critical infrastructure and industries affecting national security by 1 foreign governments entities controlled by or acting on behalf of foreign government or persons of foreign countries which comply with any boycott of israel 2 foreign governments entities controlled by or acting on behalf of foreign government or persons of foreign countries which do not ban organizations designated by the secretary of state as foreign terrorist organizations the measure would require the chief executive officer of any party to merger acquisition or takeover to certify in writing that the information contained in the written notification to cfius fully complied with the requirements of the exon florio provision and that the information was accurate and complete this written notification would also include any mitigation agreement or condition that was part of cfius approval conclusions the proposed dp world acquisition of po while arguably of little economic impact on the us economy could affect public policy on foreign investment that relates to issues of corporate ownership foreign investment and national security in the us economy the transaction revealed significant differences between congress and the administration over the operations of cfius and over the objectives the committee should be pursuing in addition the transaction demonstrated that neither congress nor the administration has been able so far to define clearly the national security implications of foreign direct investment this issue likely reflects differing assessments of the economic impact of foreign investment on the us economy and differing political and philosophical convictions among members and between the congress and the administration the incident also focused attention on the informal process firms use to have their investment transactions reviewed by cfius prior to formal review according to anecdotal evidence some firms apparently believe that the cfius process is not market neutral but that it adds to market uncertainty that can negatively affect firms stock price and lead to economic behavior by some firms that is not optimal for the economy as whole such behavior might involve firms expending considerable amount of resources to avoid cfius investigation or deciding to terminate transaction that would improve the optimal performance of the economy in order to avoid cfius investigation while such anecdotal evidence may not serve as the basis for developing public policy it does raise number of concerns about the possible impact of the cfius process on the market and the crs20 potential costs of redefining the concept of national security relative to foreign investment the recent focus by congress on the committee has also shown that the dp world transaction in combination with other recent unpopular foreign investment transactions has exacerbated dissatisfaction among some members of congress over the operations of cfius in particular some members are displeased with the way the committee uses its discretionary authority under the exonflorio provision to investigate certain foreign investment transactions as result congress could make number of changes to the cfius process through legislation that has been proposed in the 1st session of the 110th congress the changes could mandate more frequent contact between the committee which generally operates without much public or congressional attention and the congress and enhance congresss oversight role over the committee the dp world transaction also revealed that the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks may have fundamentally altered the viewpoint of some members of congress regarding the role of foreign investment in the economy and over the impact of such investment on the national security framework these observers argue that this change requires reassessment of the role of foreign investment in the economy and of the implications of corporate ownership of activities that fall under the rubric of critical infrastructure as result some members of congress are looking to amend the cfius process to enhance congresss oversight role while reducing somewhat the discretion of cfius to review and investigate foreign investment transactions in order to have cfius investigate larger number of foreign investment cases in addition the dp world transaction has focused attention on longunresolved issues concerning the role of foreign investment in the nations overall security framework and the methods that are being used to assess the impact of foreign investment on the nations defense industrial base and homeland security most economists agree that there is little economic evidence to conclude that foreign ownership whether by private entity or by an entity that is owned or controlled by foreign government has measurable impact on the us economy as whole others may argue on noneconomic grounds that such firms pose risk to national security or to homeland security similar issues concerning corporate ownership were raised during the late 1980s and early 1990s when foreign investment in the us economy increased rapidly there are little new data however to alter the conclusion reached at that time that there is definitive way to assess the economic impact of foreign ownership or of foreign investment on the economy although some observers have expressed concerns about foreign investors who are owned or controlled by foreign governments acquiring us firms there is little confirmed evidence that such distinction in corporate ownership has any measurable effect on the economy as whole for most economists the distinction between domestic and foreignowned firms whether the foreign firms are privately owned or controlled by foreign government is sufficiently small that they would argue that it does not warrant placing restrictions on the inflow of foreign investment nevertheless foreign direct crs21 investment does entail various economic costs and benefits on the benefit side such investments bring added capital into the economy and potentially could add to productivity growth and innovation such investment also represents one repercussion of the us trade deficit the deficit transfers dollardenominated assets to foreign investors who then decide how to hold those assets by choosing among various investment vehicles including direct investment foreign investment also removes stream of monetary benefits from the economy in the form of repatriated capital and profits that reduces the total amount of capital in the economy such costs and benefits likely occur whether the foreign owner is private entity or foreign government for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33856
