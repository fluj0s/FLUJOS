and is held primarily in corporate securities it is managed by private moneymanagers it is nonbudgetary account meaning it is not found on the balance sheet of the federal government the revolving fund is budgetary account and is held exclusively in federal securities its gross outlays include pbgc benefit payments and administrative expenses its receipts include premiums paid interest on federal securities and reimbursements from the trust fund as of september 30 2006 the trust fund balance was 440 billion and the revolving fund balance was 152 billion figure 1 depicts the flow of

september 2005 p 9 2 operational cash flows represent one facet of the pbgcs finances in its 2006 annual report the pbgc reported an 189 billion deficit based on assets of 611 billion and liabilities of 800 billion accrual accounting measures such as these gauge the agencys ability to cover benefit payments that will be made over the next few decades accrual accounting is the norm in the pension industry but it is not recognized by the federal budget for more information on the longterm financial outlook for the pbgc see crs report rl33937 the financial health of the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc by william klunk 3 technically the pbgc controls the operations of seven funds but each individual fund is part of either the revolving fund or the trust fund crs3 the annual cash flows of the pbgcs revolving fund as depicted in figure 1 are synonymous with the pbgcs budgetary cash flows as reflected in the federal budget in the appendix to the presidents budget for fy2008 omb reports the actual fy2006 amounts for the pbgc as follows premiums paid by employers 165 billion interest on federal securities 390 billion and reimbursements from the trust fund 151 billion produced total receipts of 706 billion benefit payments and associated expenses constituted gross outlays of 444 billion thus net revenue for fy2006 was 262 billion4 these budget numbers are provided annually to the omb by the pbgc although some of the budget numbers premiums benefits administrative expense can be traced to values in the pbgcs annual report other values reimbursements from the trust fund interest income on federal securities are more difficult to ascertain5 the level of reimbursements from the trust fund to the revolving fund is based on the ratio of assets to liabilities for all plans taken over by the pbgc6 interest on federal securities includes gains or losses realized due to the sale of securities7 the impact of the pension protection act on the federal budget8 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22650 the ppa overhauled pension funding rules which has implications for projected spending and revenue of the federal budget the congressional budget office cbo projects that over the 10year period from 2007 to 2016 the ppa will decrease spending by 55 billion and increase revenue by 24 billion some of the changes in the ppa take effect or are phased in beginning in 2008 so their impact on the budget is not immediate 4 us office of management and budget budget of the united states government fy2008 public budget database at httpwwwwhitehousegovombbudgetfy2008dbhtml 5 the budget uses cash accounting which reflects for example actual premium received during the fiscal year the annual report uses accrual accounting which reflects premium earned ie premium that was due during the fiscal year 6 generally the ratio of assets to liabilities ie the funding ratio for all plans taken over by the pbgc determines the trust fund reimbursement amount as follows the reimbursement amount equals the total benefit payments due in the year times the funding ratio the balance of the benefit payments are made directly from the revolving fund 7 the pbgc adopted new investment policy in 2004 aimed at improving the dollar duration match of invested assets to future benefit liabilities to that end the pbgc lengthened the duration of its portfolio by exchanging significant portion of its treasury bond portfolio the voluminous sales and purchases resulted in significant gains that were included in fy2006s 39 billion interest income on federal securities in fy2004 and fy2005 actual interest income on federal securities totaled 121 billion and 958 million respectively in fy2007 and fy2008 interest income on federal securities is projected to be 725 million and 691 million respectively 8 the ppa includes changes that impact the federal budget but are not directly related to the pbgc in addition to the pbgcrelated changes outlined in this report the ppa is expected to increase spending by 04 billion over 20072016 and decrease revenue by 705 billion over 20072016 description of these broader changes is beyond the scope of this report for more information on the ppa see crs report rl33703 summary of the pension protection act of 2006 by patrick purcell for more information on the ppas impact on the federal budget see congressional budget office cost estimate for hr 4 pension protection act of 2006 august 16 2006 crs4 impact on federal spending the cbo estimates that the ppa will reduce spending by 19 billion over 20072011 and by 55 billion over 20072016 table 1 shows details of the cbos estimates of the ppa on the pbgcs budgetary cash flows and equivalently on federal spending table 1 the ppas

to rounding the net impact of the ppa on the pbgcs budgetary cash flows is confined to the spending side of the federal budget while the pbgc is said to generate revenue its revenue is accounted for within the revolving fund which is spending account9 for example negative values in table 1 represent expected decreases in spending these can be either decreases in direct outlays eg decreases in benefits or equivalently increases in receipts also known as offsets to outlays eg increases in premiums variable rate premiums underfunded plans must pay variable rate premiums vrps to the pbgc equal to 9 per 1000 of plan underfunding the ppa increased funding thresholds and removed provisions that exempted many plans from paying vrps this is expected to increase both the number of plans paying vrps and the level of premiums that they pay starting in fy2008 vrp income was 550 million in fy200610 9 the revolving fund balance serves as buffer between the pbgcs budgetary cash flows and direct federal spending although pbgc outlays are counted in the federal budget they flow through the revolving fund which had balance of 152 billion as of september 30 2006 in addition the revolving fund is partially reimbursed for benefit payments by the trust fund which had balance of 440 billion as of september 30 2006 even though net outlays are projected for fy2007 and fy2008 the balances in these funds enable the pbgc to meet its obligations for number of years pbgc annual management report 2006 p3 10 pbgc annual management report 2006 p 10 crs5 cbo estimates that premium income will increase by 18 billion over 20072011 and by 50 billion over 2007201611 termination premiums plan sponsors that terminate their plans while under chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization and then later emerge from reorganization must pay termination premiums to the pbgc the premium is 1250 per participant per year payable for three years this provision was enacted under the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 and contained december 31 2010 sunset date which the ppa removes12 cbo estimates that collections from termination premiums will increase pbgcs premium revenue by 23 million in 2011 and by 411 million over 2007201613 special funding relief for commercial airlines prior to the enactment of the ppa airlines were required to follow the same rules as other plan sponsors with the exception that they were provided temporary relief from deficitreduction contribution requirements in 2004 and 200514 the ppa allows airlines to choose special funding rules for airlines that will significantly reduce or possibly eliminate their required contributions over the next 17 years airlines that choose the special funding rules must freeze benefit accruals in their plans and will incur higher termination premiums 2500 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22650 instead of 1250 if they subsequently terminate plans within five years of choosing the special funding rules although cbo assumes that airlines that choose the special funding rules will incur the higher termination premium charges they do expect underfunding for these airlines to increase which would result in increased vrp payments to the pbgc cbo estimates that these provisions will increase vrps by 115 million over 20072011 and by 399 million over 20072016 net benefit payments the ppa contains several changes that affect plan funding liability calculations and how much plan sponsors will contribute to their plans the cbo expects that these changes will increase plan underfunding among plans that terminate in the next 10 years which equates to higher outlays by the pbgc cbo estimates that benefit payments will increase by 53 million over 20072011 and by 274 million over 2007201615 other provisions the ppa contains other provisions that are expected to increase spending these provisions include authorization for the pbgc to pay interest to plans for premium overpayments special funding rules for certain government contractors and cap on vrps for small plans those with 25 or fewer employees cbo 11 cbo hr 4 pension protection act of 2006 p 5 12 the pension protection act of 2006 law explanation and analysis cch editorial staff publications p 205 13 cbo hr 4 pension protection act of 2006 p 5 14 for more information see crs report rl32991 defined benefit pension reform for singleemployer plans by neela k ranade and paul j graney 15 cbo hr 4 pension protection act of 2006 p 7 crs6 expects these provisions to increase spending by 22 million over 20072011 and by 48 million over 2007201616 the impact of the ppa on federal revenue unlike the ppas impact on the pbgcs budgetary cash flows and consequently on federal spending its impact on federal revenue is indirect the ppa affects corporate profits by raising or lowering the contributions that plan sponsors must make to their defined benefit pension plans in turn the impact on corporate profits is reflected in revenues collected by the government in the form of corporate taxes the ppa imposes more stringent funding requirements on many plans but the impact on the budget is not immediate due to phasedin or delayed effective dates therefore the expectation is that the ppa will decrease revenue in the near term and increase revenue in the longterm the joint committee on taxation jct estimates that the ppa will increase revenue by 48 billion over 20072011 and reduce revenue by 24 billion over 2007201617 the impact of the presidents federal budget proposal on the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22650 budget projections the presidents budget for fy2008 projects net outlays ie outlays exceed receipts for the pbgc of 316 million and 11 billion for fy2007 and fy2008 respectively in fy2006 the pbgc net generated revenue of 26 billion since 1975 the pbgcs operations have generated net outlays in only two years if the current budget projections prove true that total will increase to four years in 2008 the presidents budget proposes provisions that would increase premium revenue for the pbgc beginning in 2009 currently underfunded plans pay 9 per 1000 of underfunding to the pbgc in variable rate premiums vrps the current vrp rate was set by the deficit reduction act of 2005 congressional action would be required to change it the fy2008 federal budget indicates that the administration will propose to authorize pbgcs board of directors to set the variable premium rate and extend the variable rate premium to plans nonvested as well as its vested liabilities18 this change is projected to decrease spending by 55 billion over 20082012 and by 106 billion over 2008201719 16 cbo hr 4 pension protection act of 2006 p 6 17 cbo hr 4 pension protection act of 2006 p 13 18 us office of management and budget appendix of the budget of the united
