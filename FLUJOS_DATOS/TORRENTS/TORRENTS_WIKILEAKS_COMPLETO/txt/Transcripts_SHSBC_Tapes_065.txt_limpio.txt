shsbc 65 the prior confusion lecture given on 3 october 1961 thank you okay this is one of those days whats the date third of october audience thats right yes and my watch stopped last night how would i know and 1961 special briefing course saint hill now suzies been giving you an explanation up here as to the prior confusion and id better give you some material on this and some other things i could give you lecture on brandnew series of discoveries but you havent caught up with these ill mention these in passing just to get them as matter of record however there is great deal to be known about mutual motion mutual motion is terribly interesting subject its the motion of two generating sources this has something to do with problems and mutual motion runs with great rapidity and so on theres lot more about that but i just wanted to get this little slight note on record youre interested in the prior confusion the hidden standard because this puts into your hands what the hakim the witch doctor the bone rattler the medical doctor and all such ilk have been trying to do something with here now for good many thousands of years this puts something into your hands and if you grasp this youve grasped something and if you havent grasped it youre stuck in one chronic somatic is stuck moment on time track which is the stable datum of prior confusion hidden standard is the stable datum of prior confusion prior confusion now in trying to explain this to you you take look at chronic somatic you try to look at the prior confusion and you swing back up into the chronic somatic again and you dont even know that you looked at the prior confusion this is very very easy one to forget its very easy one to slip on because it is actually the basic anatomy of how pictures and illnesses and concepts of one kind or another get very very stuck now the way they get stuck is the confusion and the stable datum now that confusion and the stable datum has been known to us for many many years and what weve done to it is add time to the span the confusion is in one place and the stable datum at later place so in all time track plotting you get the confusion and then you get after that the stable datum so actually theyre linear in time in other words you dont have the stable datum and the confusion occurring necessarily and certainly not very aberratedly you dont have these two things occurring simultaneously in time in other words the stable datum and the confusion do not occur in time if theyre going to become aberrative which is the same time you dont have the stable datum and the confusion in the same instant of time now by that we mean twelve oclock second of october 1961 theres confusion while person is sitting at table well the confusion doesnt make the person necessarily sit more solidly at the table thats not the kind of stuck that were mixed up with this is the way we get the person if the person is going to be stuck at the table at eleven oclock there was hell of confusion and the person had an upset and had an upset stomach and so on at twelve oclock and sat down in the table at the table to ease their upset stomach and somehow or another it didnt ease well there was confusion at twelve oclock the confusion was at eleven oclock just an hour before do you see this now in other words the confusion is at an earlier instant of time than the stable datum that the person adopted afterwards but we find that the stable datum which is adopted afterwards is the sticker of course you can always adopt stable datum in the middle of confusion this is it but that isnt the one that sticks the one that sticks is where you have stable datum adopted after the fact of the confusion the united states goes to war with japan nothing much occurs as result of the war perhaps and then we all of sudden have president eisenhower talking about loss of face well its very interesting to have an american president use japanese term we give the wehrmacht hell of shellacking and during the war nobody is being the wehrmacht thats for sure the 88s are going on one side and the 22s are going on the other side and we have good solid flatout knockdowndragout war and nothing happens during this period of time that is at all upsetting except people getting killed and buildings blown down and so forth but everybody is too interested to have any stable data to amount to anything and then after the war theres discussion about should american troops goosestep there was you know now we add in world war i to it and we find american troops wearing german helmets its fascinating this gets more and more fascinating now we can understand the confederacy all wearing federal uniforms during the civil war because they didnt have any but there were lots of federal dead to take them off of that wasnt much of stable datum but today we find the confederacy is very stuck in the confederacy now we think that something happened like the assassination of lincoln or something and all of this well we certainly know all about lincolns assassination well how about lot of the other people who got assassinated by bullets in that war you see were not worried about them that stable datum isnt sticking but something that happened after the action is sticking like mad this is peculiarity and its not necessarily sensible it doesnt necessarily follow any logic this is an empirical fact by empirical fact i mean one that is established by observation not established by theory or reason this is true only because its observed to be true now you can develop lot of theories about why water doesnt flow uphill there could be lots of theories developed about it but you stand alongside of river and then you go find another river and then you go find another river and then you go find another river and you observe all of these rivers and you find out finally that the common denominator of all rivers was that water was flowing downhill the points downstream are at less altitude than the points upstream and we establish the fact then that water flows downhill we dont have to have the theory of gravity we dont have to have any other theory connected with it at all all we have to have is the observation that all rivers we are able to contact are flowing downhill thats an empirical datum all right now this prior confusion is an empirical datum and that is all it is its empirical its just observed that this is the case that the person is not stuck in the marriage that they are complaining about but are stuck in the marriage because of the confusion that existed before the marriage theyre not stuck in the marriage because of the confusion of the marriage now youve always been assuming that the marriage got stuck because of the confusion of the marriage all right now lets get down to workability solid sound workability how many marriages have you squared up by knocking all the confusion out of the marriage well its sort of lot of little failed lines on that weve straightened up lot about marriages and so forth by knocking out their confusion weve done lot about marriages by knocking out the confusion of the marriage but the reason we couldnt do it rapidly and the reason we got bored stiff trying to do something about it is if person is stuck on the subject of marriage the reason they are stuck has nothing to do with that period of time but has to do with the prior period of time that predated the marriage and if you free up that prior period of time to the marriage the difficulties of the marriage blow now this is an empirical oddity an oddity of magnitude weve got somebody who has got to have their liver operated on something wrong with their liver we find them stuck in an operation on liver theyve got to have another operation on liver they know its their liver their attention is stuck solidly on the liver and so we go ahead and process the liver but we never find the basicbasic on the chain of when their attention got stuck on the liver when did their attention get stuck on the liver actually it got stuck on the liver immediately after confusion immediately after confusion so the way to blow this operation on the liver is to blow the confusion which preceded the difficulty with the liver its so peculiar its sufficiently peculiar that this occurs when you try to learn it you immediately think of your own chronic somatic you try to swing your attention before you had the chronic somatic and you wind up with the chronic somatic and you say well there is the chronic somatic and of course that is all there is to it and then one tells you again right away now look lets look before you had that chronic somatic and you say yes chronic somatic its just as though were trying to put your attention on top of spring and as you put your attention on the spring it rebounds and blows you back into the chronic somatic do you see and your attention just doesnt go on to the prior confusion its quite remarkable you say to somebody all right youll do this as an auditor now many times youll say put your attention now on the period or what happened you say in some other fashion what happened just before you got all upset with this marriage and they say well i got all upset with the marriage and you say well what happened just before you met this person and so forth oh well just before i met this person um yeah well we certainly had hell of time in that marriage and you say well now lookahere were talking about just before you met the person what was the date before you met the person well theyre liable to do something like well i had an awful lot of trouble when i was little child and you say yeah but just before this marriage just before the marriage and they say yeah well i had an awful lot of trouble in that marriage whats happening is is the pcs attention bounces to later periods of time chronic somatics are always the result and solution of an unconfrontable disturbance which occurred immediately before them hidden standards and present time problems are always the result of confusion which immediately preceded the difficulty and when you get the pc to put his attention on the confusion you are asking him to do what he couldnt do and why he pinned his attention just after the confusion you see he looks at the confusion and then his attention without his recognizing anything bounces straight into the stable datum man has broken leg and this broken leg has just been going on and on and on for years and years and years he doesnt recognize it as broken leg the medicos say its tibiosis of the filamoriasis and that hes suffering from decay of the tendon well he busted his leg sometime or another lets get it down to simple language us folks can understand and you see if you dont know anything about subject you can get awfully fancy as matter of fact the more fanciness and the more oddball opinion and crosscurrent of opinion you find in subject you can assume that that is in direct relation to the amount known about the subject the more confusion in the subject the more crisscross the more learnedness the more pretended knowingness there is in the subject the less is actually known about it you can get terribly complicated idea about life and the mind from fields where it isnt known you understand theres lot of invented pretended knowingness on the thing for instance i dont know how many medical terms there are for leg and yet this leg wont heal and they cant make it heal fast but they can sure call it by lots of names and have lots of opinions on it dont you see well theyre sort of bouncing off the confusion all right so the persons got busted leg well the leg should have healed up in five or six weeks and that should have been all there was to it and thats it finished but it isnt seven years later like the childrens doctor the fellow is still limping i think two years ago he kids every time he sees you know he comes in limp limp masking the limp very consciously as soon as hes on the premises trying very hard not to limp he was in skiing accident couple of years ago and i told him i was going to process him and it scared him within an inch of his life and so he always has some kidding remark to make to when he comes in to look at the childrens tongues about whether or not im going to process him but look its been two years and hes still limping ah well then this isnt just skiing accident because theres nothing really in bad shape about the bones they were all put together by the very best orthopaedic surgeons he had the best of care hes doctor so what must have happened well he busted his leg in skiing accident and two years later it has yet to heal really oh well the bones are grown together and it isnt bleeding anymore but it isnt operating all right now lets take look at that was it the instant of the accident ah well we know more about the mind than they do we know very well that before some fellow does practiced action if hes in smooth frame of mind hes used to doing this action he goes down the slope and slaloms like mad and everything is just dandy and he winds up at the bottom upright and saying whee but if fellow is in disturbed frame of mind and his attention is on many other things he just received letter from his wife or his girl saying well ive just gone out again with pete dont you see and theres nothing he can do anything to but himself he cant do anything to anybody but himself theres nobody else around or hes powerless or something like that then this practiced skier starts at the top of the slope and he goes halfway down and he says this is good place and wraps himself around tree then they put him pathetically in the hospital and bring him home by ambulance plane and so on and it goes on for years dont you see so the high probability is that the accident had nothing to do with the motions of skiing skiing probably has nothing to do with the confusion which resulted in broken leg mentally because we have to ask the question how did he get himself bunged up and why now fellow doesnt get himself bunged up by accident see its not by accident thats the first thing you have to recognize that theres some kind of postulate in there to bung himself up and hell manage it every time all right so this medico all right we ask him now what happened just before you broke your leg and hell say well the snow was flying all around and the wind was going whee and so forth and then there was this condemned switzerland pine tree and it pulled itself up by the roots and moved over in the middle of the ski track and you say good and we keep on running this and at the end of many hours we actually do get the thing to remove to marked degree we get an abatement of the chronic somatic yes we can do that we have done that many times well how would you like to see that chronic somatic vanish well that would be much better procedure and much faster than that ah well wed have to find out what went on before he went skiing that day well he was on vacation we know and we know that he felt he needed vacation why did he feel he needed vacation an odd thing to need particularly i never get one so i dont dare need one he needed vacation well what was the randomity that preceded that what was his mail like while he was on vacation lets search in this area lets find out anywhere in the last six months what had been going on and all of sudden we wind up with the damnedest knockdowndragout confusion if it was enough to make him break his leg it will be sufficient to bar out his inspection of it and at first he wont be able to inspect the prior confusion it takes an auditor sitting across from him to chunk his attention into that period and do an assessment of it and all of sudden he finds out that he thought the broken leg happened last year when it happened two years ago and hes completely forgotten that he broke the same leg when he was five and all kinds of oddball forgettingnesses turn up now what causes forgettingness its the inability to confront motion the inability to confront motion brings about an occlusion of that area of time now youve got postulate the first second third fourthpostulate theory the first postulate is notknow the second postulate is know all right so youve got big notknow you see he had big lot of mysteries and lot of confusions he couldnt confront and nothing he could do anything about of any kind whatsoever and he got himself know which immediately succeeded it in time in other words this notknow area this confusion area is followed by know area later in time now this is quite interesting because he follows notknow by know and the know might be quite stupid and it might be quite painful and it might be quite destructive but nevertheless its knowingness some fellow who is gimping around with bad leg certainly knows something he knows hes got bad leg you might say all psychosomatics and hidden standards are cures for mystery they give themself knowingness following period of notknowingness now people can get stuck in relief and very often when your pc feels better he will feel better momentarily and quite artificially and not feel better at all now for instance supposing we were all sitting here and we heard high whine and dull thud out in the park and an airplane full of screaming passengers had apparently just crashed you know and we could hear the whole works sitting here and so we in big flurry crowd out the door and rush outside to see this airplane thats crashed and so on and its just peter left one of his record players on see quite feeling of relief but the relief followed period of confusion now im not saying this is very aberrative this would be so light that its very easy to face indeed then you see wed have little period of relief and it actually would stick slightly on the track see its period of relief its period of know now you see at the moment we heard it crash we didnt know what was happening so weve got notknow and then we go out and we find out what happened we find out nothing happened and that its all all right so we know you get this this is just in vignette what im talking about is not at all aberrative it takes much greater volume of magnitude to make one of these things all right now lets go into what mary sue was showing you here just before i came in and we have ourselves period there which we see as big white chalk mark up at the top and then theres little chalk mark down the line and weve got vertical time track here and its got big blob of white chalk at the up part and little blob and then below that big blob and then below that little blob and some more little blobs all right now im not making fun of her cartooning here but anyway taking look at this now we see the time track plots linearly now shes got herself plotted from zero at the top to 1961 at the bottom well all right well take it that way because time tracks dont run in any direction all right now we take that little tiny last bottom white blob and thats chronic somatic the person has chest wheeze and every time you process them they look at their chest to find out if theyre still wheezing and they know the auditing command worked because the wheeze is less or they think the auditing command didnt work because the wheeze is more this is how they know you see this is how they know well isnt it interesting that this know would occur in connection with chronic somatic now person must have hell of an avidity for knowingness if they have to find out if their backs still broke or their chest is still caved in or if their rib cage is squashed what kind of knowingness is this well it must have followed one godawful confusion man if thats the acceptable level of knowingness wow what must have happened before that so we take this pc and we say to this pc pointing to that last white blob there well what was going on in your life immediately before you noticed this difficulty with your chest and your first usual immediate response if this is hot subject is well my chest has always hurt itll be something intelligible like this they havent answered the question at all you say just before you noticed this before you noticed this what happened in your life and they say well urn i dont know thats right there you got it hot thats hot and heavy and boy they never spake more sooth than that they were spaking sooth with all front teeth they didnt know thats for sure or they wouldnt have this chest difficulty all right so we punch it little harder you see its the auditor compelling the pcs attention into that area and we say well when did it turn on what period of time was it when it turned on well he said well it must have been must have been the summer of 59 or something like that i know i had it then you see they havent said anything before yet you see they know they had it in the summer of 59 you say now thats good now just what happened just before the summer of 59 well i had it in the spring of 59 too see they havent answered your question yet you know all right but you see whats happening here youre plowing their attention back toward an unconfrontable area so you say well all right what happened before that well what was going on before you noticed this chest somatic and so forth and they say well oh well uh yeah well it uh and we notice this little upper white blob here see they say yeah well it turned off for long time havent answered your question yet see its off from the first white blob to the second white blob see well its off yeah well i wasnt troubled with it then and uh i remember oh yes yes thats right i recall in 56 i had medical treatment for this see theyve told you nothing about before yet but theyve got it stretched back in time and then all of sudden theyll come up and say well lets see 56 and well call that earlier blob there 1956 theyll say well lets see you say what were you doing in 55 well i 55 that was when i was down at camp in cornwall come to think about it that was 52 and theyre liable to come up with the adjudication that they dont know what happened from 1952 to 1956 this is curious blank period and they figure it all out and they say well it must have been this and it must have been that and it might have been this and might have been that and then all of sudden they say well the truth of the matter is i was well im not sure im not sure but do you know i had this when i was child see way back now way way back boom yes i had this when i was child they thought that i had consumption and so forth and i actually i hadnt remembered that but i had lot of consumption and i remember i was living with my grandmother and so forth and they they had to the doctor lot of times and that sort of thing and i just had overlooked this fact now were up at the first white blob up there see you say well what happened just before you were living with your grandmother well i wouldnt know i was awfully young i was eleven well yeah well where were your parents at that time well lets see and brother weve got another blank spot and weve got nice big juicy blank spot now we keep plowing into this blank spot and we finally find out that mother and father had agreed to separate just before this and there had been lot of domestic difficulties and we think weve got it now and were trying to really pin it down we think weve got it and they were trying to separate and this was happening and that was happening it was all very clouded up and it was all very this and that and were just about to get touching short story about this whole thing when suddenly the pc remembers that he burned down the house and that will be the end of that chronic somatic just by assessment only see thats just by assessment but your assessment is doggedly to find out what happened before they noticed this now perhaps its bad thing to say for the first time because this is always lie one of the stable data of auditing is always make your auditing question as truthful and as factual as possible dont make auditing questions that are nonfactual so you say well what is the first time you remembered this or what is the first time you noticed this of course the pc cannot answer this because hes going to give you fifty more first times after hes given you the first time so its much cleverer to say what is time that you noticed this when did you notice this what happened before you noticed this and then just keep chugging it in now its not repetitive command and this is actually getting rid of chronic somatics by assessment if you are very clever at assessing you can just go on and assess and assess and assess and you finally find out the confusion and you pin the confusion down to such degree that youve made the pc confront the confusion the confusion will asis right there bang and everything else will blow after it and that is it you can do it by assessment only with an emeter that requires rather clever auditor to do the whole job by assessment only now heres an easier way to do it we finally spot the area of confusion by assessment and then we put together security checks to fit that area we find out that this person had this when they were eleven well its some kind of childhood activity that is all messed up well you can actually take the childs security check and bend it around one way or the other question by question and add your own questions to it and so on and youre going to get yourself some interesting data that this pc has never seen before and youre going to blow out those zones of confusion and youre going to find the dissipation of the hidden standard of the chronic somatic that is more standardized method of going about one of these things all right lets take another example this girl finds that she has headaches she finds she has lots of headaches and in auditing shes always sort of aware of this headache and she knows the auditing process is working because the headache turns on or turns off and if nothing affects the headache she of course doesnt think the auditing process is working thats her hidden standard thats by which she finds out whether or not auditing is working that is the definition of hidden standard well naturally your rudiments are out as long as the pc has this condition why well the pc is viaing the auditing command now in all cases where pc is not making progress on routine 3 you can bet your bottom peseta that the pc has not and is not doing the auditing command they might be doing the auditing command plus plus plus see or they might not be doing it at all i do remember back in wichita long long ago pc coming around to after twentyfive hour intensive and bragging to that they had succeeded in not answering an auditing command once and they thought this was awfully clever of them yes sir the pc was really bragging about it what was the matter with the auditor that he didnt find it out now here is the more usual thing the pc does the auditing command and applies it to certain area of the mind or body in order to find out if it has affected something else and they do the auditing command by applying the auditing command to something in the mind and then they look over here to see what is going on and if anything happened and they do this continually theyre not just doing the auditing command they are doing something else now they know they did the auditing command right or they know they did it wrong or they know the command is right or wrong in direct comparison to how much happens to alleviate this difficulty you are auditing pc who has an attention fixed not on the bank in general but on some particular peculiar activity and theyre doing something peculiar with every auditing command you feed them the auditing command they do something peculiar with it even though they verbally answer it and so on and apparently have executed it they do something else with it and when pc is not making progress you can say his attention is stuck someplace well thats shortened form of saying the rudiments are out one of the rudiments are out the pc is not really insession the pc is on auto the pc is not under the auditing control the pc is under his own control hes under his own control to this degree you say something then the pc takes over as auditor and executes the auditing command and then gives the session back to you and you ask the next question and when you ask the question then the pc takes the auditing command goes on auto audits the auditing command on himself and then gives the auditing session back to you have you got the idea and the pc during the entire period of execution of the auditing command is not insession any pc who hasnt gone clear in 150 hours is doing it pc has got hidden standard what is this hidden standard maybe hes got six hidden standards well every one of those hidden standards is totally this stable datum stuck after the fact of the confusion they all have the same anatomy pc takes the session away from you does the auditing command finds out whether or not it moves this electronic then sees whether or not the electronic is affecting whether or not hes boy or girl thats right that was how we moved into this with just that action on the part of pc we knew about this for long time but weve never really seen it in action to this flagrant degree this pc had been audited for about thousand hours and had applied every single auditing command ever given to the pc to the resolution of an electronic incident which the pc was convinced if it were run out he would turn from man to woman thousand hours progress well why the pc was never insession so the rudiments are out the basic rudiment that is out is present time problem of long duration where you have hidden standard all right very good now if we take ourselves pc and we audit along with routine 3 we can find the pcs goal we can find the pcs terminal oh yes with some difficulty but we can find them in relatively short order certainly under twentyfive hours of auditing if were really in there we keep the most flagrant rudiments in dont you see but we havent noticed this hidden standard yet and then we assess the pc on the prehav scale and we run the pc on the prehav scale and we run the pc and we run the pc and we run the pc and nothing happens well theres where itll show up see we can do the action of finding goal because the pcs attentions are very very solidly on goals we can certainly find the action of terminal we can find this terminal because we actually havent really asked the pc to do an auditing command its all between you and the meter see we can find the assessed level of the prehav scale very easily but now we go into the repetitive auditing command and the pc goes on auto why does the pc go on auto well the pcs got hidden standard the pc is auditing himself on making his nose well pc is not running not at all running the terminal of railroad engineer hes running nose and so he doesnt go clear now very often in worse cases the pc will be very resistive toward an auditors inquiring questions the auditor says what are you doing what did you do with that auditing command youve all of sudden got knockdowndragout fight on your hands pc does not like you inquiring into it the first time you ever notice anything like that you say to yourself this pc has hidden standard lets find out what it is now although you can find the persons goal terminal and level you actually cant run the pc on that in the presence of hidden standards it is waste of time now theres one earlier action that can be taken with the pc that the pc will do and that will produce results but there is only one earlier action can be taken before routine 3 assessment and that is security check this can be done without knowing the pcs terminal and will produce lasting excellent results there is other process now we have all the facts in over the years will produce easy and lasting gains on pc other process will produce easy good solid lasting positive gains on pc you have security check and youve got the assessment and youve got the running of the assessment so this leaves us with security check as very powerful auditing weapon because it will operate whether youre running the goals terminal or not the security check will operate and those gains you make with security check will be lasting gains hence we divide up auditors into class i run any process on which they have certainty this will probably be some kind of control process by the way itll be some cousin to the cchs if the auditor is wise because that at least works out the control factors of the pc and you do make sort of gain youre running in order and something is going to happen with this pc and it doesnt come under the heading however of fast easy gain it is not fast easy gain it is lasting gain but it is hard long gain and thats all you can say for it thats the cchs scs all these various things they are long hard arduous things to handle and they do produce lasting gain but at what cost so it doesnt come under the heading of nice easy stable gain achieved by the auditor at all but class i auditors had better be employed even though it is very hard to achieve long lasting proposition matter how arduously they had better be put to work doing some auditing because any auditing is better than auditing and this type of gain will be quite beneficial in the long run and so forth and this argues that class i auditor is doing something as long as hes doing one of these types of processes all right we move up to class ii auditor and class ii auditor can security check all right security checking produces lasting gain and it is very easy it is very easy to do it is very nice it is very very fast and it is lasting result so we have the class ii auditor doing security checks and actually when were talking about the hidden standard and that sort of thing we can envision that class ii auditor would have set up pc on the basis of having gotten rid of all of his hidden standards and thats what we look to class ii auditor to do not just to sit there and prate off sec check 3 were asking him to do something else were asking him to sec check in the direction of getting rid of all of the stuck points in this lifetime were asking him to get rid of the confusions of the first second third fourth fifth and sixth marriages were asking all of the were asking him to get rid of that crooked neck were asking him to get rid of the odd habit he has that every time you say something to him he goes drvvvvvkh it seems rather odd this person would do that you know because you havent asked him to smell thing in other words these things all surrender to security checking all of them now the lot but what kind of security checking does it take well it takes standard security check that is always good thing to bang into case the first and foremost thing you do thats good thing just go on and pick out the probable security check lets take an oldtime auditor hes been knocking around and into god knows what well the first security check we want to shove into him is the last two pages of sec 3 plus sec check 6 theres reason to do the first many many pages of 3 or do anything very fancy because hes not going to get any benefit of something that he has overts on and so on so lets get that out of the road and now having done this let us get clever and apply this data about the stable datum and the prior confusion now this is different than the stable datum and the confusion the idea that we get all of the stable we get all the confusions off the case and we will of course knock out at once all of the persons activities and so forth isnt quite true we have to knock them out selectively has to be very selective so after you got the last two pages of form 3 and all of 6 done you should roll up your sleeves at about that point and lets go for the hidden standards lets find out if theres anything by which this person measures gain or gain what would have to happen for you to know that scientology works thats the clue question and you get these things and sometimes these things are detached things sometime these things are well my mother would have to get well well he doesnt really mean perhaps he does but he really probably doesnt mean that his mother would have to be sold on scientology and brought to an auditor the auditing command which he is doing if applied to himself would have to cure his mother you see he often means that too so this idea this he says well my mother would have to get well well this is marvelous it means his mother is stuck stuck chronic somatic now the way you would have handled this in the past the way you would have handled this in the past is not the fastest way to handle it you could have handled it in the past and it would have worked out all right in the past but that is not the fastest way to handle it im just giving you much faster method when did this occur that mother became stable datum and what confusion preceded it ahhh in other words we dont run ow on mama and we dont security check mama and we dont have very much to do with mama we want to find out what happened before mama became chronic somatic because mama is stable datum for confusion before the fact of accepting mama as stable datum theres some confusion prior remember its always prior lets reorient your thinking on this now the fellow says well uhhh i just have to get over hating my father thats what would have to happen yes sir to know scientology worked id have to get over hating my father well you say thats good so obviously you can do something about that you do security check about his father thats obvious isnt it this is past thinking on it and you get all of his overts against his father and all of his withholds from his father and you clean up father and what do you know you could do it too i mean you could have gotten long way in this direction ahha theres much faster method lets find out what happened before hating father became his stable data in life hating father must be an activity he can confront as retreat from earlier activities he cant confront and they probably have nothing to do with his father hatred of father was much more acceptable to him than the tremendous confusion he had with who knows probably not father who knows who it is lord knows so what do you do you assess and you find the area of prior confusion to the hatred of father now at first the pc is going to tell you its something that father did and its something that had to do with father but remember it cant have anything to do with father if father is the stuck somatic cant have anything to do with father you see if father is the stuck personnel if father is the broken leg on this case it hasnt anything to do with father because he can confront father well if he can confront father and hes spent all these years confronting father and so forth it hasnt got him well why do you in an auditing session put in more hours confronting father waste of time see lets find out what happened before this occurred so youd want to know when did you notice that you hated your father and what happened before that first answer well inevitably my father did this my father did that and you say good fine give him cheery old acknowledgment and then find out what happened before that with other people oh you find out his old man hasnt been anybody man his old man has been nobody in this fellows life there is some kind of person on broomstick that has been flying around in this persons belfry you know as child why this person would see well maybe it was his fathers mother or something you know and the child would see her sitting there quietly knitting and rocking in the rocking chair or something and he absolutely just couldnt resist you see spilling the cat on her or you know or pulling up the ball of yarn or somehow or another stealing all of the bread dough or putting salt in the plum pudding just anything see anything and youll find that these are overts but they wont come through that way at all he will finally recover the character on the broomstick see total occlusion recover this character on the broomstick and you will try to do security check on this and she beat and she socked and she used to hold over the well and say she was going to drop and hell just go motivator motivator motivator motivator motivator see of course why because he can observe the inflow but he cant observe his outflow yeah but what did he do thats whats getting interesting here what did he do did he steal her broom because youll find inevitably that this is what happened so you make up some kind of roster of the personnel involved prior to the stuck personnel and you make roster of the missing persons bureau and your little list is missing persons bureau and boy youre really going to find missing people pc doesnt even know they exist theres going to be sections out of his life he dont know are gone and youre going to find those sections and find out who is in them and then write up security check any old kind of security check to find out what he did to them these other people not father skip father he was confrontable character why bother with father just waste of time thats what the pc is complaining about now whatever the pc complains about do something earlier there is your stable datum whatever the pc complains about you do something earlier and dont pay any attention to handling the object about which he is complaining you pay attention to his complaint but if you continue to handle the object about which hes complaining such as his big ears why youre not going to get anyplace hes complaining about big ears well im seeing every time i you find out every time he answers an auditing command that he finds out if his ears shrunk youll find stuff weird like this man well did his ears shrink okay now when is the first time you ever notice oh par that would be wrong when did you notice that you had big ears when did you notice this oh well i have had big ears for some time you see thats your inevitable reply now if you get reply of this character which is non sequitur you know you are on to hot area of disturbance because the pcs attention went onto it and then flick came right up the track to the big ears your effort to put his attention on the area of confusion results in putting his area on the object whenever you try to put his area on the confusion and then you only succeed in putting his area attention on the object you know youve got it made you know youre looking at one godawful area of occlusion you say to him when did you first notice that you had big ears now what happened before you first noticed you had big ears any such question and he says well ive just worried about it for years my big ears well now you see the mechanism at work you asked him about time before big ears and he answered big ears so its obvious that his attention deflected from the area you tried to put his attention on you have located hidden springboard he doesnt know its there but you now do he coasts right up the track to it every time you put that hull in the water it goes straight to that particular dock with crash it wont head out to sea it wont go anyplace you see you just put it in the water and it hits this dock father or ears or something see bang and there it is you say well now in your in your early life what went on there what went on in your early life now this would be just asking for whole bunch of balderdash now itd take an awful lot of millions of words for the pc to tell you every single horrible thing thats been done to him in his early life theres sense in having much of synopsis on it its up to the auditor to continue to direct the pcs attention where he wants the pcs attention directed not to listen to recount blowbyblow recount of all the beatings the dock gave him see thats silly because thats all hes going to tell you he hates his father this is his hidden standard he doesnt feel better yet about his father so not feeling better yet about his father he knows the auditing isnt working and you say well tell about your early life so he says well my father and he used to take out in the woodshed and then he did this to and he did that to and he did this and he did that and my father this and my father that well are you doing anything for this pc youre not doing anything for him at all because youre leaving his attention stuck on refuge any chronic somatic any stuck personnel anything of that nature is refuge on which the pc can put his attention and you are not doing your job as an auditor unless you get his attention eased over onto what makes him stick his attention on it and you do that by gradient scale and the pc can get very restive if you jump your gradient too hard so you say all right big ears now lets see what happened just before you noticed that or when did you notice that you had big ears tell time you noticed you had big ears whats some early period when you noticed that and the pc says well uh well uh well uh well uh well well i was working in london for an attorneys firm i used to notice it good you say is there any earlier time than that oh well in the attorneys firm oh well hell you got his attention stuck there and you say earlier earlier than the attorneys firm whatd you do earlier than that oh oh well what did i do earlier than that uh i dont know what did i do ear lets see now i went to prep school and then i went to college and then so on and that was 1952 and i got out of there and then 52 and then 1955 1955 and i went to work yes it must have been 55 i went to work i remember that yes it was 55 went to work for the attorneys firm in 1955 and i got out of college in 1952 good you say well what did you do between 52 and 55 i just dont know now lets see what did i do i i met girl ah yes i remember now i met girl and she uh yeah i met this girl and she had boyfriend and we had an awful that was 58 let see i ill get it in minute its 1952 1955 now theres period of three years now lets see after i got out of college i must have gone home for little while and then i must have done this and then i must have done that and i must have done something or other probably yeah im sure i must have done something like this because you see you just wouldnt ordinarily just go from college to an attorneys firm now let see oh i know i had an awful fight with fellow yeah oh that was pretty terrible we met down in this bar and he had some kind of criticism of one way or the other and we had this hor that was 57 that wasnt 55 that was 57 and thats the way hell go on you understand and you say well what happened in this period of anything that might have occurred between 1952 and 1955 oh uhhuh nih ruh ruh ruhruh nih ruhr well did you ever think about big ears before 1952 i didnt think about that before 1952 and so forth well did you you think about big ears after 1955 well yes oh yes oh yes all the time used to sit there at my desk with ink all over and i used to sometimes get it on my ears and they used to call ink ears sometimes and so on that was probably it actually the firm really hated and the senior partners this and that you say thats good thanks good good good fine thank you thanks good all right now good now we want 52 to 55 now who did you know in that period well i must have known my father and mother all right well who introduced you to get work at the attorneys firm ah must have been some connection with my father and you know youre liable to find some damnfool thing like marriage youre liable to man youre liable to find anything but you will find something and itll be period there of total occlusion what youre trying to do is not necessarily solve the big mystery of it all if you were very clever you could do the whole thing by assessment on the meter one of the ways you do it by assessment is well 54 did you have long vacation there after you left college was it two years one year six months oh i went to work something of the sort i was doing something im sure i was doing something i must have been doing something over period of three years young man doesnt do anything you see and i went up im sure yes yeah im absolutely sure you finally dredge up name agnes ohhhh agnes ahhhh all right now in essence as much as you can find out about agnes you just do it on an interrogation basis and assess the worst confusion you ever had with agnes when is the worst time you ever had with agnes and so forth and this finally peters out and you find agnes is just red herring shes hardly girl at all and in actual fact it was isabel isabel turns up along about this time and now we have got honey by the ear and we find out that she used to stand there constantly and say what she said and she used to do this and do that and she was the one who got him arrested arrested where where where the hell did this come from dont you see we dont find out usually anything about big ears agnes never said anything about big ears nothing of this sort but she went off with boy who had big ears and isabel isabel she went off with boy who had big ears something stupid like this so big ears got to be something in here and in some of the wild devious way that all of sudden works out and becomes completely sensible we find out how he wound up with stable datum of big ears this person says well i have ball of light and it is just back of my eyeballs and when the ball of light glows then i know the auditing question worked and when it doesnt glow it didnt work you want to find out when did you notice this and then you want to find out what happened before that now what happened before that and the person said i well i havent got the faintest idea im lets see now what happened before that and we run into some kind of blank period then all of sudden marvel of marvels we find out that between 1945 and 1948 the person was deeply immersed in the temple of black magic someplace or another and all this seems to have dropped out of sight and what they did really there was see the light and hes been seeing the light ever since but it was one awful confusion because after the police raided the joint you see it wasnt so much that it was being sued for being the father of the child that was what got him but all of this has been fantastically occluded you see and all of these stable data that the person has lead back to prior unknown and its just the notknow followed by the know its the confusion followed by the stillness the confusion then the stillness all right now ill give you something ive got some kind of reality on it works like this you find the bird this works out on broader track basis you find this pc standing on rock in the middle of the sea waiting for somebody to pick him up and he has this pain in his stomach and he had that pain in his stomach for many lifetimes many many lifetimes hes had the pain in his stomach and you say all right lets run this out so we run him standing on the rock in the middle of the sea and we i guarantee you we can run it and we can run it and we can run it and we can run it and we can run it and he will still have pain in his stomach and still be standing on rock in the middle of the sea and this is the old engram that wouldnt resolve and this is why finding the earlier on the chain resolved the later engrams the engrams that wouldnt erase becausee of course in finding the earlier engram you accidentally went across the confusion and you got the confusion knocked out well theres nothing precedes that incident thats hardly worth recounting except mutiny shipwreck sudden disaster halfdrowning seven times and theres something kind of strange and spooky about the whole thing and then we finally find out that hes standing on the rock without body and hasnt noticed hes dead and this finally resolves the whole thing up to that time he knew all about it but trying to get his attention immediately before the incident when this occurred will be one of the tougher jobs because you say all right how did you get on the rock and he says i was just standing there well i must have gotten there some way uh oh i get picture now of the surf i must have come to the rock through the surf well any fool could tell that man he didnt land there by helicopter thats for sure but hell make these suppositional actions now person trying to do this all by himself begins after while to appreciate an auditor because his attention is pinned in certain category and as it tries to go back to areas that are unknown to him it of course deflects onto the chronic somatics so he tries to put his attention back on this and then comes up into the chronic somatic and then hes stuck with the chronic somatic his attention is on it so he starts auditing the chronic somatic and he never does put his attention back on the earlier incident see so he leaves himself stuck with chronic somatics see his attention goes back up and he needs an auditor sitting there to tell him to put his attention back again you know what happened before that whats the worst kind of motion you possibly could experience on ship well it wouldnt be ship itd be submarine i dont know why i said that well whats the worse kind of motion you could experience on ship well being torpedoed by submarine lets see or torpedoing ship by submarine being torpedoed by submarine lets see torpedoing ship or ship torpedoing you ship wouldnt torpedo you you see and the ship its the worst kind of motion worst kind of motion be standing on rock waiting for ship to come in thats exactly where the attention goes then hell get all interested in the thing worst kind of motion lets see well what might have preceded that must be some kind of bad motion what kind of bad action could person perform that that would pay for you know asking him for direct overt just suppositional oh oh oh well youve really asked one now you know i get picture of foredeck of galley and all the galley slaves are there and theyre all chained and their blood is running down underneath the fetters and the overseers walk up and down the ramp and the whips go wham you see and so forth and in battle in battle when they start throwing greek fire in amongst the galley slaves that was much earlier that isnt the same period at all i got that that was much earlier much earlier and you say well how much earlier was that well that was another lifetime thats completely different lifetime i dont know what i was doing in this thing it just seems kind of blank the whole thing seems sort of blank theres this sailing ship you see and its sailing along and i think i actually stood on the rock and i managed to coerce ship to come in and wreck itself on the rocks or maybe or maybe and we finally find out that it wasnt very dramatic he just got dead drunk as captain of ship and ran it square aground on the rocks and killed off all the crew and they all died in the jagged reef and they were all screaming around him and so forth but it wasnt so much that he had stolen the ship and was guilty of barratry oh were getting someplace now yes actually he had murdered the owners agent the second day out of port now were getting someplace and the next thing you know he isnt standing on the rock anymore see what happens you get the overts and that sort of thing off on the prior confusion and it blows and that is the end of standing on the rock but the more you qanda with the pc and let him stand there on the rock the less youre going to get done it get pretty obvious the less youre going to get done now you can keep chasing pcs attention back back back back back back back and wind him up at the beginning of track probably of course thats kind of q and too because thats method of not confronting he puts his attention on an incident much earlier that he can confront rather than confront the incident immediately before were much more interested in that span of time just before that seems so mysterious and that keeps landing him back on the rock thats the period were interested in were not necessarily interested in his whole career as space commander were not interested in that period because space commanders very seldom take ships to sea all right so what were interested in is the period which we have encountered now youre going to find this technique very interesting in the handling of engrams just to branch off on to something else youre going to find this very very interesting when youve got persons hidden standards and hes been running well and hes running his goals terminal on the prehav scale and you get up to class ivtype auditing and youre going to run some engrams you find these are usually very easy engrams and you havent got to resort to very much trickery to run them because the pc with the rudiments in hes in valence hes already contacted these pictures many times as he runs up and down the track and you find out they kind of run like hot butter take about half an hour to run one of the things an hour and half three hours is the longest ive had so far and they run very easily but lets suppose in some peculiar way that we didnt really get this thing wheeling and the person seems to be stuck in it and theres hell of burp someplace in this engram were running you see and the person goes every time they go through this area they go burp and every time they go through the area they go burp and were having trouble running the engram we should assume that something confusing happened just before that and try to get that up rather than try to knock the burp out get the incident just before and he will blow whatever is hanging now of course the whole engram is hanging up isnt it now how does person get stuck on the track in the first place oh lets ask much more important question than that how does person get on time track in the first place and what are you doing on the time track in this universe thats an interesting question why are you plodding along the time track with such orderliness could it be that theres confusion at the beginning of track that you cant face i find that very fascinating question i wont bother to give you any answers to that particularly but what is time time very possibly could be retreat from confusion we cared not to confront so we retreated masse and have been going ever since but that gives you now basic rundown on the prior confusion trying to find the prior confusion to find the stuck datum persons ability to confront confusions improved of course will blow lot of chronic somatics but i wouldnt count on it i wouldnt count on just improving their ability to confront and then having it all work out magically i would much rather that you just sawed into it from the word go and picked up these things and blew them selectively one by one and very intelligently because goals terminal run on the prehav scale will give them lots of confrontingness and itll give them lots of changes and that sort of thing and youre much more interested in that trying to run person though with present time problem of long duration one special kind of which is hidden standard trying to run person on the prehav scale with five sixway brackets and that sort of thing is highly profitless because the pc never does the auditing command when analyzing whether or not case is running look to find out whether or not the pc is materially advancing the sensitivity is coming down and the needle is getting progressively looser all right that all betokens advance of the case now we go just little bit further than that and we say if the case has not gone clear in 150 hours of routine 3 which includes of course security checks and assessment and runs wed better say to ourselves right about there this case has never done an auditing command this case has done something else too or has done something else or has not done it at all and before that time that would be the ne plus ultra of being kind of stupid to wait that long now that we know this but if it did reach that time then we would say well theres hidden standards here and we would determine what they are and determining what they are we would get rid of them on this basis of prior confusion or any refinement thereof wed blow these hidden standards wed straighten out these things we return to goals run if the case still hung up we would suspect another hidden standard we would blow that and go on so it might be very good idea to blow all the hidden standards that you could blow on case before you do very much worrying about the case getting on the way with goals run in other words by all means get their goal by all means get their terminal by all means assess level on the prehav scale by all means give them some running on this sort of thing but on security check angle first lets get off those last two pages of form 3 and lets get off all of form 6 on an old auditor on new people lets straighten up security check in general lets get this pretty well ironed out and then lets find out if the person has any hidden standards and then lets undercut those by finding the prior confusions lets fill in these blank spots at least in this lifetime lets get them sailing so that they can actually do straight auditing command and then doing that youll find you make very rapid progress with clearing all summer and all last spring ive just been working on speed of clearing that is all ive been working on and this is another sevenleagueboot stride in that particular direction thank you
