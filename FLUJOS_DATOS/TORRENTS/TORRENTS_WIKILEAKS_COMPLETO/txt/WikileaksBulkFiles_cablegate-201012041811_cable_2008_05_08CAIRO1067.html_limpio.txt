subject codel baird meets with egyptian leaders on margins of wef classified by dcm stuart jones for reasons 14 b and d 1 c summary codel baird discussed egyptian and regional issues with egypts political and business leaders on the margins of the may 18 20 world economic forum wef in sharm sheikh egypt president mubarak intelligence chief omar soliman and presidential gamal mubarak focused on the need for deep engagement to resolve the israelipalestinian crisis and to hinder irans growing influence in the region on iraq mubarak said you cannot leave but advised strengthening the military and allowing fair dictator to come to power via coup forget democracy he opined the iraqis are too tough by nature on the economic side egypts business leaders regretted the lack of usegypt free trade agreement and asked the us to push egypt harder on good governance and democratic reform codel baird consisted of representatives brian baird dwa christopher shays rct peter defazio dor jeff fortenberry rne and jim cooper dtn representative jane harman dca joined the codel briefly on may 18 end summary president mubarak 2 c the codel began by thanking mubarak for his positive leadership on regional issues mubarak said that he had advised vice president cheney and other us officials not to invade iraq and that one listened but that now it would be mistake to withdraw forces immediately because it would further open the door for iran asked about usegypt relations mubarak confirmed that we have very good relations with the us but your administration is not wellinformed however i am patient by nature he said in apparent reference to us criticisms over human rights and democratization congressman shays encouraged mubarak to engage with iraq as much as possible and asked if egypt would send an ambassador to which mubarak replied i cannot do it when there is stability i am willing but i cannot force civilians to go 3 c asked about egypts reaction if iran developed nuclear weapons capability mubarak said that none will accept nuclear iran we are all terrified mubarak said that when he spoke with former iranian president khatami he told him to tell current president ahmedinejad not to provoke the americans on the nuclear issue so that the us is not forced to strike mubarak said that egypt might be forced to begin its own nuclear weapons program if iran succeeds in those efforts 4 c asked about whether the us should set timeline for withdrawal from iraq mubarak said you cannot leave because you would leave iran in control mubarak explained his recipe for way forward strengthen the armed forces relax your hold and then you will have coup then we will have dictator but fair one forget democracy the iraqis are by their nature too tough omar soliman 5 c egyptian general intelligence service egis chief omar soliman gave the codel an expansive evaluation of the key issues in the region he focused on irans growing influence in iraq with hamas with hizballah in lebanon and with shia communities in the gulf to solve regional problems egypt is working on three tracks palestine lebanon and iraq 6 c egypt hopes to achieve something soon on the palestinian track he said but neither side is ready to stop the vicious circle of violence although most on both sides want quiet solimans job now he said is to bridge the gaps on specific issues like border crossings prisoner exchange and bringing hamas and the pa back together he hoped to see an agreement on borders for palestinian state by the end of 2008 and noted that as practical matter very few palestinian refugees would seek right of return 7 c on lebanon speaking week before the doha agreement was penned soliman said the three problems are syrias large influence lack of power of the majority over militia forces and weak arab support for the government syria is seeking deal with israel and the us over returning the golan and canceling the hariri tribunal to lessen its meddling and lebanon needs strong nationalist army soliman bemoaned that the arab states have too poor relations with syria to cairo 00001067 002 of 002 push them effectively 8 c on iraq egypt meets regularly with jordan saudi arabia uae kuwait and turkey to discuss reducing iranian influence the goi must understand it has support from the arabs and the us not just iran he said soliman advocated making iran suffer economically to be too busy with its people to make problems in iraq reducing iranian influence will help the iraqi government become one and not competition between sunni and shia he said 9 c asked about the consequences of any us strike on iranian nuclear capabilities soliman said such an attack would not destroy irans nuclear capabilities and would only unite iranians with their leadership and against the us he repeated the need to make iran busy with its people by effective sanctions citing the successful example of libya asked about sudan he said that egypt is still working to make northsouth unity attractive and to encourage talks between the gos and rebels and between bashir and deby 10 c asked what it means when arabs say that the us should listen to us soliman gave the example that president mubarak warned vice president cheney about the consequences of the us invading iraq additionally your unilateral positions on economic aid are difficult however soliman emphasized that egypt is keen to continue to have very close relationship with the us gamal mubarak 11 c gamal opined that the battle lines are clearer for egypt than ever before on regional issues the region will not realize its full potential as long as geopolitical problems continue he said with the israelipalestinian problem in particular we are racing against time gamal advocated close engagement by the us egypt and other countries nfi in order to make practical improvements in the every day lives of palestinians and develop framework for final deal with borders as the key issue other regional issues such as iran and lebanon are much more complicated he said the picture is not that rosy 12 c representative baird raised the issue of usaid efforts to assist conservation of red sea reefs which gamal agreed was an important issue representative shays asked gamals opinion of syria president bashar assad to which gamal replied that he understands the world better than his father but that he is worried that opening up politically or economically could result in loss of control 13 c representative harman asked for egypt to do more to fight smuggling to gaza through tunnels perhaps by setting up roadblocks few miles before the border to intercept contraband gamal said that the border is shared concern and egypt is doing what it can to address smuggling 14 c representative fortenberry asked about how to counter developing iranian nuclear program egypt and saudi arabia as well as jordan are the heavyweights that can counter iran gamal said but he advocated movement on the israelipalestinian track to remove prime issue that iran can use as pretext american chamber of commerce in egypt 15 sbu the amcham group led by president omar mohanna suez cement lamented that the lack of usegypt fta continues to push egypts trade towards europe and away from the us they praised the qualified industrial zones qiz program and advocated expanding it to upper egypt though they acknowledged that increasing egyptian textile exports to the us would be sensitive issue in the us textile lobby karim ramadan microsoft praised the historic role of usaid in egypt
