tips on running r3r lecture given on 16 july 1963 okay this is saint hill special briefing course 16 july 18ad 13 thank you all right now i really ought toi really ought to give you some good dope here today on the subject of auditing engrams and gpms and although i havent particularly organized this material or separated them out there are few things that you could profit by knowing in these two departments this is strange new world to lot of people and actually is stranger world to some oldtime auditors than they think it is yet some people havent realized that weve made tremendous forward start in the running of engrams and theyre still staying with the idea of this that and the other thing and are doing strange and unexpected things in the middles of sessions and so forth you know and i know the impulse because i myself can run into block of some kind or another in the thing and not be able to sort something out and say all right when i snap my fingers the item will flash see sometimes it works but its very upsetting to the pc now auditing here has stretched out into very fine neat package where the whole track is concerned you must realize that this doesnt invalidate the auditing you know how to do doesnt invalidate yesterdays auditing and so forth those techniques are themselves they stay themselves and theyre still useful as matter of fact in very short order you and other auditors in the world will be receiving questionnaire from on research not for testimonials but research to put together the whole field of healing anything that you have ever healed with what or anything youve ever had cured on yourself with what because the ama has raised its ugly head and the only way that you can really get in trouble in this universe is neglect an area of responsibilityand weve neglected that area of responsibility too long and sure enough its the only avenue through which were being attacked theres comedy team called keatonyou remember buster keaton and fieldsyou remember wc fields you know well this isnt the same pair of comedians but this fellow keaton at the ama and this fellow field at the ama are the sole authors of bad publicity for scientology in the world we have finally walked them carefully down and were looking right down the throats of couple of mangy polecats now i know i could be sued for this because i have inferred they were human beings and i could be sued for it by the human race but the pointthe point im making is weve neglected that zone of responsibility and we can heal things and so forth and without immediately stating that all auditors are in the field of healing i think it would be very good idea to gather all the materials of healing and publish them in popular book as process day keeps the doctor away so we have tremendous amount of valid material in the past and this is not discounted as matter of fact if you wanted to make somebody very very happy that you grabbed in off the streets totally raw meat why just do some of the old 212 212a something like that and they get fantastic results what is this stuff you know and so forth on the other hand it does not particularly land them on the high road to running gpms finding goals and doing other things that it should do and on the other hand if you carry it forward and do too much of it on pc without departing on to the whole track you can get the fellow in the soup it has to be classified as limited process and as long as you remember that its limited process and you dont do more than four oppositions on one item or something like thisget one ri and do two or three oppositions on it see anything you get and be happy you see be happy leave it alone after that you see youve shot your bolt as far as this pc is concerned on 212 but youve done some remarkable things to him you might very well have brought him out of great deal of insanity and upset and worries of one kind or another and remember he doesnt haveyoure different than he ishe doesnt have your breadth of comprehension of the situation he doesnt have any forward look to attainable states he doesnt have lot of things and he thinks that if he could just get this pain in his rib shiftedit doesnt even have to be gone seebut if it would just shift little bit why hes made remarkable progress or it isnt any longer in his rib then thats fine see thats marvelous thats marvelous youre wizard well now when youwhen you deal with these lowlevel attainments and apply scientology to obtain these lowlevel attainments you see such as well im not so mad at my daughter now you know thats fine hes worried about the fact that he gets angry at the child and so forth and youve done something about that why he becomes very happy with auditing and youre dealingyoure dealing definitely in humanoid level of expectancy character is beaten down by his experience on the whole track and he realizes that nothing good can possibly happen in the universe and when tiny little goodness occurs and so forth its almost too good to be true dont you see and he can hardly have it at all and its very miraculous that this occurred now lets take look at that as very low level of expectancy very low level of attainment now lets move over into an entirely different zone and area and lets move over into the zone of clearing clears and ots see ah well now heres an entirely different zone of expectancy and this is so tremendously beyond the humanoid reach that if you were to just talk towell if you were to talk to people about ots and try to hand this out to them and so forth they wouldnt think you were mad because they would they would try to do something about it they would try to tell you this was awfully dangerous they would try to sort of try to key you in they would go into nyaaah state and they would try to ridicule you while believing you you see and all kinds of weird mental currents would set up because youve struck at the very core of their own basic unrest and you have stimulated bypassed charge see promptly and they can be very cross with you now these are your approaches and in all auditingnow there is rulethere is rule now in all auditingis dont stir up more charge than you can handle now thats rule in auditing now if you apply that rule to any process you run or any programming you do on case you will always have happy pcs and that is the monitoring factor in programming which says which process you run but you can take the processes which lead to ot and you can misuse these things by disobeying that rule now the worse off case is the more you walk on eggs in other words the less you stir up the worse off the case the less you want to stir up you got it see this is subsidiary to this other rule dont stir up any more charge than you can handle and the subsidiary rule to that that fits right below it is the worse off the case why the more careful you have to be now this goes directly in the teeth of q and here is homicidal maniac screaming around and walking on the walls you see so the q and of pasthatorture sciences mental sciences of yesteryear the kind that really get the appropriation are q and desperate cure for desperate state now the effect scale goes directly in reverse the more desperate the state the more featherweight the cure got that now thats dictated sensibly by the effect scale because the person cannot have much of an effect see they cannot receive much of an effect so you have to featherweight the effect and the more desperate condition the person is in why the more featherweight your approach should be you yourself should get good reality on this youve got this boy whos tough you know hes tough going to chew you to pieces you know and yeah hes going torowl and so on and so on you better not talk to him that way you know this kind of character and im talking now practically institutional type action you see and you say hello lrh whispers hello god you might have shot him with bullet you know and hell look at you hell puzzle this out hell consider that whereas actually you probably could take megaphone and scream atat uncounted numbers of decibels and hed never receive it he might spin in but hed never receive it you get this now that old effect scale is terribly important when applied to processing if you want to get an effect on pc then the worse off the pc the lighter the process now weve already turned loose some technology now in the preliminary assessment step which takes r3r and lowers the level on which it will be effective now that bypasses the ordinary defenses of the mind and that means that when you do an assessment the rule ive just given you of dont kick up more charge than you can handle flagrantly and definitely applies when you are using r3r on case at level 7 6 or 5 this person does not easily run engrams you have actually forced this person into the only tiny little channel by an assessment that the person can find some reality on the time track on oh yes they can run engrams on that little tiny narrow channel thats quite remarkable the development of the process has been on this basis that in all cases there is some little tiny channel that can be approached and on which you will not find dubin understand now you take case level 3you can enter the case on almost any assessment that you dream up youll find sonic visio you can run any engram you think of anyplace on any chain now on that case also you could misdate you could misduration you could abandon chains you could skip around like cat on stove and youre not going to damage the case any now lets compare this to case level 6 dubin of dub now instead of looking at the wide atlantic which you can travel across at any direction you care to you are now looking at barge canal which is one sixteenth of an inch wider than the barge youre trying to get through it and which is very curvaceous and which is full of roots mud sandbanks and old stoves and somehow or another you can navigate it with r3r now its good thing that channel exists on that channel there is dubin of dub there is dubin and actually if youve got the correct date and the correct duration you will have visio and you will have perception now do you see this as narrowing aspect of case level 3 oh take any kind of motorboat ship sailing ship head it in any direction and you will be able to make the other side down to this narrow tortuous difficult passage and thats quite remarkable but because you can do this gives you certain responsibility if youve got bargecanal case and youre just able to push things through boy that case really has to be carefully handled really carefully carefully handled on this ruledont stir up more charge than you can handle because remember you wont be able to handle any of the charge you stir up off that barge canal you wont be able to handle any of it at all with anything there will be process which knocks it back into place now do you get the idea so man you navigate that one on tiptoe carefully you dont suddenly go crashing back there bang bang bang you dont expect this chain is going to survive either now the lower the level of the case the less incidents you will find per preliminary step one two three and thats about it or one one incident thats your chain and after thatafter that your level and your item dont read now if your level and itemyouve run one engram and that was yesterday and you ran it with full sonic and visio and it was dropping fork at breakfast and with tremendous relief and case gain and tone arm motion you erased it and the name of the chain was frightened of having trouble at the table now you mock it up in your headyoure going to go back there to childhood youre going to go back there to the days of cannibalism youre going to go back there to the sacrificial altars of the aztec civilization youre going to have ball see its an incident of dropping fork at the table and feeling embarrassed and you ran it and you erased it now you can almost diagnose this on the basis of the wilder they sound on the assessmentthe weirder they sound on the assessment the more offbeat on the assessment the narrower the channel and the less incidents will be on it perfectly all right to have not wanting to be upset about my aunt mary and the chain is two engrams long being spanked by aunt mary and hiding aunt marys pills thats that now after youve got this chain after youve run an incidentnow this is part of your r3r seeafter youve run an incident test your level does it read pc had any cognition about it if it doesnt read and pcs had some kind of cognition about it you cant get any response out of this level this is not the time to go back and find an incident eight hundred trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion years ago of destroying the physical universebecause aunt mary might be in it because listen having stirred up that charge you wont be able to handle it it doesnt necessarily mean that these charges are all close up to pt youll be very surprised sometime to take case thats got one incident to run theres one incident and that finishes the chain you have assessed so painfully and that incident lies at eightyfive trillion trillion years ago and the incident is two and half days in duration and you ran it and flattened it and the pc had bit of cognition and the level wont read anymore and the item level question doesnt readthats it you ask for any more incidents on this chain you get read well this is not the time to roll up your sleeve and start sweating to find an imaginary incident by arc breaking the pc so that he will read on protest when you say incident see thats time to be knucklehead see pcs real happy theyve run this incidentdoesnt matter where it was you understandtheyve run this incident maybe two incidents maybe three incidents something like that the tone arm action suddenly ceases your tone arm goes up there at five now what now what do we do well we had better find if we flattened the incident if there was gpm in the incident if we had the right date and the right duration if our assessment was right and if all of those things squared around still dont remedy this ta at four and half or whatever it is youve got another assessment coming up right now youve had your chain now of course youre thinking basically on the theoretical of course the theoretical as aimed at 4 or 3 case level that theoretical is very simple the chain ought to run back to basic and basic ought to be quite ways back and when you run basic then the later incidents vanish and so forth all these mechanics are true of the lower case levels now misassessment even on higher case level is liable to give you dead end or culdesac it behaves in the same way and you straighten it out consider that youve run the basic on it and unload get out of there youre trying to flatten the chain and the clue to it is tone arm action its not number of incidents its not how basicbasic looks its not this its not that its not the other thing none of these things none of these things at all its did you run the tone arm action out of it and to find out if youve run the tone arm action out of something you then have to find out make sure that the tone arm action didnt cease because of one of three things wrong date wrong duration had gpm in it tone arm action ceased all right if the dates right if the durations right theres gpm in it or if there was it was flattened and the tone arm is still high and your tone arm action has ceased then that chains flat other criteria you dont have to think yourself to death trying to figure out is chain flat now lets say youve had five incidents the way to verify flattened chain is to make sure that all of the dates you have found were the correct dates all the durations youve found are the correct durations the level longer reads and theres tone arm action and one other thing is you dont get any reaction on asking for another type of incident which of course is the same thing as checking your level item and thats flattened chain and thats the only criteria there is to flattened chain there is other criteria at all i consider that elementary thats very elementary and it happens to be very sweepingly true if you go into this more positively and more analytically you can say tone arm action ceased as opposed to tone arm action well tone arm action ceased implies there has been some tone arm action well if you havent had anything that you could call tone arm actionyou know you only had an eighth of division or something like that of shift when the pc threw the cans down you got an eighth of division shift something like thisthen you assume these things that tone arm action wasnt present wrong assessment which consists of wrong level or wrong item wrong date or wrong duration or you collided headon with gpm and were too knuckleheaded to ask if it was one and youve been trying to scan this poor pc through doublefiring items and that will make tone arm go up and stick every time and thats the extent of it you frankly cant arc break pc hard enough to cause cessation of tone arm action isnt that interesting actually an auditor auditing pcyou know the auditor as pc then becoming pccannot have become sufficiently keyedin or arc broke enough to have stopped tone arm action i think thats an interesting thing to know ive seen lot of this in other words tone arm action doesnt stop for other reasons tone arm action wont even stop because of an arc break now i have seen tone arm action stop by trying to run the pattern of the helatrobus implants in the gorilla implants but what is that that breaks down to wrong date doesnt it and ive seen tone arm action come to sudden and horrendous halt at 50 you get down to the level of where the goal appears as an oppterm in the helatrobus implant pattern and ive seen the tone arm go straight up to 50bang from very good tone arm action just stop right there up to that time why there was enough charge on the gpm to actually run that wrong line plot your 17 april 63 bulletin the line plot it gives goes waaaay back and lot of those goals reappear in the helatrobus implants and if youve got wrong date and youve actually got an earlier goals series youve got different pattern well you mistake the date you mistake the date you say well you get there youre so sure its helatrobus implantits to be alone you see or something like that youre sure its helatrobus implant so you date it crosseyed fashion and you get fortythree trillion years ago you say obviously its helatrobus implant so you get this to be alone all right lets get the top oppterm funny enough the thing will run itll run pair after pair you get some little fire off of them some kind of fire the pc is kind of nattery and arc breaky you have to scream at the pc every once in while to get them to random list or something like this to get something you can work at it awfully hard you know and youre getting down the line here and you may not find it out until you get the goal as an oppterm all of sudden your tone arm will go zzzzzuuuclank you can almost hear it settle on 50 or something like that theres now going to be rr theres not going to be anything and you say what do i do well this is not the time to turn in your thetan this is time to look for wrong date wrong duration whether or not gpm existed in the incident see now ifif during this entire month i could only beat persuade whisper cajole these two datai mean thisthese two data at you and get you to accept them i would consider it very wellspent month very well spent and that is the worse off the case is the easier you take it and high tone arm in running the track results from wrong assessment wrong date wrong duration or gpm present where you suspected none ive actually said the lot you understand any other data that i can now give you is actually so junior to these screaming truths you see that its something like there is the sun dont you see and now somebody brings out small flashlight which you get at the dime store and turns it on and says now do you see the difference you see that this light is the same as sunlight and it is as bright as sunlight this would be an outright lie dont you see this is big stuff that im giving you these two departments are the only departments that are going to get you into any real trouble and theyre going to get you into plenty of trouble if you dont know these things let give you an idea youre running this person and so help pete theyve had an enormous win theyve run this engram out at eight trillion years ago and its an engram of being executed in some weird way itllpardon thats too simple itll be if its this kind of caseyou can tell the kind of case because the morethe worse off case is the more outrageous the assessments look to you the weirder the assessments look this guythis guy for instance hashe isyou cant find him on the prehav scale you see you have to do your own and so on and you finally get leery see leery as the level and then you get the item leery of chocolate served at 2 oclock in the morning in sweden you can absolutely count on the fact that youve got case level 7 well look at the finite time subject matter see its even got the location in itit must spot it down on time track so there cant be more than one or two incidents on this subject you understand but it doesnt mean that theyre necessarily present time dont get the idea fixed in your head that because pcs having hard time to run or is having hard time running that they only run in modern time see now comes the dangerous part of it you do your ordinary magnitude of how long ago this incident is and you turn up something that has horrendous magnitude see its long time ago and you find this incident and you run this incident and thats it the incident flattens and so forth and it has some esoteric aspect see like leery of stepping on cats tails and the incident took place hundred billion trillion years ago and we find some witchcraft society or something as we would suspect dont you see and its something involved and fantasticor very ordinary but there it is and we clean it up and we have some tone arm action while were cleaning it up see and we dont have any tone arm action tone arm isnt free or anything see but we just dont have any more tone arm action and we cantbangfind another incident just like that dont you see the dating on it oh manif you did find another incident it would just be is it more than trillion years ago i have to repeat that that was equivocal more than trillion years ago sorry turn this thing up to 128 is it more than trillion years go yeah is it lessless than hundred trillion years ago well i didnt get any read there when you find yourself doing that kind of dating youre mixed up with gpms which of course are timeless thats one of the things but youre also off the heavy reading chain of the individual and that youre goiyou could get tone arm action going on with this dont you see but its hard fight all the way youve already gone by lot of charge and so forth in running case level 3 you can do this very easily you can getyou can get tremendous quantity of charge bypassed case is still making progress see case is still sweating it out youre having arc breaks and that sort of thing but the case is still pressing on and so forth and your dating just becomes very microscopic its huuh so theres tremendous opportunity to make wrong dates well youve just gone too far up chains without cutting any of the unburdening charge off see youve gone by and by and by and it wont be secret that youve gone by things dont interpret that that its secret its neither unknown to you or the pc you have just passed by eighteen series trying to get to the first series of these gpms see well dont blame yourself if you find your meter very difficult to read at that point why is it so difficult to read one youre handling gpms and they are timeless and so are very hard to date anyway and the other is youve left so much charge on the confounded thing youve bypassed so much in the interest of economy of auditing time that youve actually built yourself up big problem and that problem is is the pc can probably get to it the pc can probably run it but the pc is staying in it just about the way marble would do if put down on the top of sphere he just feels that way he vauh heuh dontnobody breathe in the session and hell be able to hold his position on the time track see if you breathe out of the wrong nostril bang youll bypass some charge dont you see and this is queasy stuff see well youre already running somebody that isis being pressed too hard well theres particular reason why you shouldnt on case level 3 or somebody that doesnt have too much trouble im not saying you mustnt do it on your upperlevel cases but by god you do it on your lowerlevel cases and you will be in trouble you will never get the pc out of you understand so you see if it can happen in cases that run well and easilyand good test of the case does it run easily does he rr all over the place do you get three or four rrs nice great big crashing rrs bang bang bang bang off gpm item see that case is running like flying bird see next item bang bang bang bang bang see next item bong bong see case is running poorly or offchain or misassessed or something like thatall right give the next item absolutably implanted well lets see give some variations on the item all right anything there been suppressed well lets random list this for little while ah theres the rr half dial whew made it all right repeat the item all right give the next item case is running implants that way boy watch out thats all ive got to say you watch out what charge you stir up on that case without doing anything about it you watch it first place you havent got the case running in the area of the track the case can run theres lot of things wrong with this now of course you say to somebody arbitrarily run the goal to forget out of the helatrobus implants and to hell with the assessment or anything else all right so he can run it and they make it by the skin of their teeth and so forth and it isnt rring well and they have an awful time getting the next goal and so forth case is still making progress case is still making progress now you assess the case youre liable to find its another area that is hot on this case see there is case running badly by gross assessment see why heavy gross assessment youve seen all this all right now that youve got preliminary step theres another way to find gpms did you know that most of your preliminary steps on case thats at all advanced on case level 4 or 3 your preliminary steps lead inevitably to gpm in fact the preliminary step is about the fastest way to find goal you ever heard of marvelous method of finding goal you get afraid of or something like that as your level you see afraid of other people and something like that and everything that this guyeverything this guys saying the next session is rocket reading he says well i had lunchrocket read youll see this occasionally you just do it just routinelyyoure not looking for gpm and you just date this thing back and you all of sudden find yourself with the goal to be alone what else and there it is and you say does this thing contain gpm i dont know why youd say that but you doand all right lets talk about the way of running these later the interchangeability of thisill mention this in moment but you get the items out of the thing and so forth and that level is flatter than flounder gone doesnt read now get the idea itll take it back to the goal which is ready to be run all too many times see thats in case that isnt running badly at all they go back to it and some cases that are running rather difficulty they go sailing right straight back to certain series of implants and run specific goal out of chain when you get back there youve got your choice are you going to do that whole series or are you just going to kick out there itll very greatly depend on the kind ofthe difficulty you had running the case if the case was running very easily youd amputate the whole series right there the devil with it so it was to be alone well the adjacent ones are probably just as important and so just run it all the way through and back get the first goal of the series to the last goal of the series and just cut that section of time track right therebang but if this case was having very hard time in running im afraid we would just stay with the assessment and we now test it we say all right fear of being together with other people you know read thats it tone arm action has disappeared everything else do new assessment youre liable to find yourself with another goal somewhere handiest little goal finder you ever heard of in your life happens to be that if goal is ready to be run and if it is goal necessary to resolve the case the preliminary step of r3r will find that goal without you doing anything about it at all all you do is do the ordinary preliminary step you get the assessment ask for the first incident to be run on it well maybe you find the first incident and you run that and thats all fine and you ask the next incident to be run and bang youre sitting right in the middle of gpm that was it thats the one and you run it and you maybe can find another one thats an earlier gpm same gpm repeated earlier run it out again find out if theres another one you cant get anything to read lets get new assessment see how you tackle the thing you can be far more complicated far far far more complicated in auditing on these upperlevel processes you can just work yourself into fit and then youll drop it back to some idiotic simplicity the reason youre having trouble running case and the reason case arc breaks and all of that sort of thing all comes down to wrong assessment wrong date wrong duration or gpm in the incident youre trying to run and its as simple as that simple as that and you can catalog the case out now you understand that wrong assessment includes somethingrunning something that hasnt been assessed see so that makes wrong assessment now lets say you were able to run out two incidentsyou were able to run out couple of incidents thats fine the level longer reads particularly so forth and then you go chasing down the track to somewhere else just for the hell of it one way or the other you decide to see if theres an earlier incident and the pc protestsyoure trying to find an earlier incident or something so you start getting reads in other words youre being awful complicated you werent happy to have flattened the chain now youre going to find some more on this chain in other words youre now from that point on running on wrong assessment because you flattened the assessment youve got and they sometimes flatten with the most fantastic rapidity sometimes they run long time session after session after session after session after session if the case is doing pretty well they will the case that isnt doing well they run very briefly you almost spend twice as much time assessing in the early stages of case as you do auditing engrams doesnt take any time to run the engram after youve got it assessed pc ran it like startled bird there was nothing to it it assessed back to goal in the bear implants of all places thats where you landed to postulate and you ran it and boy you just never saw such rrs flying tone arm and everything is going down you finish up with that and complete the thing and thats it level is flat tone arm action rather tamed down nothing left on the thing now you decide to see if you cant find an earlier mention of postulate oh blow your brains out man its much less painful in other words youve exceededyouve exceeded your assessment so youre now running on wrong assessment and the worse off case is the more deadly this action is you run case level 3 you wouldnt even think theres any deadliness to it at all you can run all over the confounded track dont you see but you take somebody that you verrry verrry carefully had to run and you flattened the level the pc was on and you got rid of the gpm and you got everything all squared around and everything was fine and all was well you shouldnt repeat that goal to postulateits pretty early anyway you got all the way back to whatever you got and that was the end of the chain now it never occurs to you to test the level look at your ta to find out if its going to run and you run two engrams further with ta action gain of case tremendous difficulty in dating fantastic difficulty in getting the right duration well my god you have enough trouble getting the right duration without trying to get the duration of chain that isnt available to be run from there on you see youre just manufacturing trouble for yourself and theres more and more and more trouble now you see in the first place youre trying to shoot the moon well the moon the devilyoure trying to shoot this universe with the pc as far as this of course you know you canyou can do other things with these routines on runofthemill pc in fact thats very fine this pcs got sciatica and you want to do something about their sciatica or something like that you run these processes youll see something very interesting youll see their sciatica disappear one chain later or something like that then have enough sense to get out of it because his level was sciatica he doesnt have any desire of attainment beyond this particular point and although he will swing around into it he can get awfully drowned trying to readjust his sights maybe hes trying awfully hard to be normal and you tell him youre going to make superman out of him see i m afraid this is not very agreeable he knows thats dangerous well youre just running bypassed charge like crazy you see so that doesnt say that you shouldnt run gpms and r3r on cases that want only limited gains but its saying you can use them to attain limited gains remember there particularly it applies when you flatten the chain consider you flattened the chain dont go ramming on around all over the place and boomitybang up one side and down the other tearing all over the track and getting the chain going and its still hotter than pistol and abandoning it and going on to something else well all this is all nonsense to handle case in that particular fashion but the worse off case is why the more it moves from nonsense to murder case is in real rough shape cant run very much why man youre muddying up that one little tiny silver thread that you could get through the mess and it has to be done accordingly and the pc says oh i think theres bunch of stuff here at hundred skillion billion quadrillion years yes i heard this date its times ten to the nth is the proper date and so forth and we really ought to run that because thats very interesting im sure because i was god then and i theres one question you should ask is it on your assessed chain its perfectly all right for you to indicate it or date it for the pc or something like that but even that gets very queasy because they dont date or duration well and you just added an ample opportunity to make wrong date and wrong duration havent you so im afraid id sit and listen to all that and give him cheery aye aye and id follow it carefully and when i wasnt getting tone arm action on the chain when i wasnt easily able to ask the question and get response all right is there another incident on this chain and we get reaction and so forth well im afraid that i would not run the risk oh if this pc could run everything likefrom one end of the track to the other with only mild level of agony or something like that but your meter was reading you had trouble getting ta action and so forth and he said theres an incident sitting back here at eighty skrillion skrillion brillion years and so forth and im looking straight at it and it has something to do with the chain that we were running but i dont think it has very much and id like to run this im afraid i might be very guilty of q and aing with him and let him run it i might not do anything more than that you understand because i know it isnt going to damage him it isnt going to spoil his case it isnt going to upset anything but little girl im auditing trying to get over her blind staggers that she gets every once in while and she has an awful lot of trouble sitting in session or holding the cans or has an awful lot of trouble concentrating and difficultdoesnt answer auditing questions well tone arm actions sort of minimaland probably ought to be on the cchs anyway im running an engram on this character and ive got chain and ive flattened this chain i cant get any response from the level or the item now person starts giving big sales talk about being the princess zazu in the lower archipelagian peninsula eight lives ago im afraid i would give them an awful cheery aye aye and assess new chain i just would not take the chance i just wouldnt take the chance thats all and when i cant find an incident easily and i cant find duration easily then im very careful to get the proper date of what i am looking for even though its impossible you understand and im awfully careful to get the right duration to what im looking for all the time cursing to myself that i ever asked the ruddy question in the first place see ive got an incident halffound and i cant really date it cant really duration i know now whats happened i havent departed from the chain theres esoteric weird or strange or exotic reasons the chain is flat i am looking in completely clean ballpark for nonexistent baseball theres none there and thats why im having lot of trouble i can get vaguely associated things see vaguely connected things very tiny connections yeah i can get them to read i can make meter talk i can get the pc interested and i can get him restimulated i can run something of the sort but inevitably after ive gone to all this work and so forth my tone arm continues to sit there at four and half and doesnt move and i shouldnt have been there in the first place the way you create work for yourself as an auditor is doing things you shouldnt be doing and if you persist in this course you will be very hardworked worried auditor i can guarantee that the labor that you will go to is utter slavery youre always doing things that you shouldnt have been doing in the first place then you will always have things to do that nobody can do and you just cut yourself out the most clutteredup career you ever heard of now when youre shooting anything like r3r 3n youre shooting the whole track and brother that is the whole track now theres good news on this i actually was able to attain period on the whole track for half an hour or something like this where there was total cutout of all mass of all gpms which followed after in other words i did complete thing i was sitting there for about half an hour or something like that with gpm mass of any kind whatsoever thats rather fantastic in that theres several thousand gpms see we had wrong date and wrong duration and i skidded on the track shortly after that we got wrong date and wrong duration on something or other accidentally by mixing 3n and r3r now in the middle of 3n you give an r3r command i can tell you that it is dynamite these are two separate processes and the commands of 3n are quite different from the commands of r3r but the two processes mix they mix this isntit sounds to like i ran into catastrophe i didnt run into any catastrophe im just saying i slid back down the track after while but it was rather remarkable feeling to have gpm mass of any kind whatsoever you know and all you had to do was put your foot against the back of your head and if you gave push youd probably not only knock your body through the wall in front of you yousee but youd probably knock down the wall back of you ive had some interesting experiences recently as pc exterior or cleared up along certain channels these are quite interesting experiences rather rough on this body but im not worried about that mock myself up another one shortly anyway the point im making here is that there is point on the track unbelievable though it may seem where you can actually get back of and find the basic of all gpms ive hit that point i havent got it so i can hold it steady because theres too many gpms following it but by discharging those gpms which have been bypassed and straightened up and so forth and getting those things shucked off got there by the way by keying out i found little trick method of keying out whole gpms when i approached the area and i could hear the distant firing of items why i just ran those distant firing of items and it keyed off that see so therefore i had the earlier gpm and then id pick out of it the distant firing of items the moment when i would first approach the area and could hear those items firing id say oh its this again and the very fact that i was saying again keyed up to the point that i already had an incident on it so you see id find in that incident the distant firing of items all of sudden found myself sitting at the beginning of all gpms and then of course having reached it in that illegal fashion dont consider it strange that about half an hour later with slightjust slight auditing error why the roof fell in but its easy to get back there again theres nothing to that all we got to do is discharge some of those things that i carefully keyed out very trick method ive had an awful time recently working out the most vicious series of gpms on the track and theyre way back and theyve got an invisible picturetheyve got five pictures but one of the pictures isthe first one is invisible so that you get twenty items firing at you there are four different items they fire twenty times the group of four fires five times as group which gives you twenty ris and then you get twenty ris with picture one twenty rissame oneswith picture two twenty ris with picture three twenty ris with picture four twenty ris with picture five you see very simple theres goal connected with them back earlier than when somebody dreamed up the idea of goal see and justtheyre just opposing items in dichotomy positive negative and dichotomy see like wake and sleep see wakenever wake sleepnever sleep that makes you dichotomy dont you see but also makes you positivenegative nice package well that fires five times in row for each picture this thing was driving batty i just couldnt figure this thing out and i hadran into myself on the track trying to figure this out and i had given up ages and ages ago i had given up trying to figure this thing out i just finally went smack smacked them all together and hoped i wouldnt be bothered with it you know and then got caught in the mass of the smack anyway this took us two sessions to get these things unwound and we had to run enough of them and get them enough discharged and so forth and i finally got the thing unwound and the first pictures invisible its picture but its picture of invisibility so of course you always afterwards tried to put picture there and there are twenty firing items that could never be run and you could think you could run it out dont you see but you cant run it out because the first picture is always missing and thats the basic on it so the rest of the fires are therefore reinforced by the presence of the basic and they wont discharge either theyll just charge up again it makes vacuum you try to put pictures there and your whole bank starts pouring into this and this is why gpm afterwards tends to accumulate pictures even simple gpm tries to accumulate pictures after that because you get in the habit of it youve got this missing picture whats there see whats there and you just get pictures pictures pictures pictures bah went through about two sessions trying to unsnarl this thing finally oh my god of course its an invisible picture that was it followed by four very nice pictures you see and the trick isand the reason the gpms wouldnt discharge fullyis because of those twenty ris sitting in front of that invisible picture right up to the front of the parade see if you cant get the basic off the items why what can you do and i finally couldnt figure out which is the first pair how do you get the first two firings because all the rest of them are supported on these two firings on each new goal cor each new gpm combination see and i finally found that there was click in the floor occurred as they stopped you to get the business in other words there was little dog on the track so when they moved you into position for the first picture you got that click see and i could perceive the click and id get the instant of the click and then of course give the first two and then the next two very rapidly and move myself back and move up to the click see and then get the first and second two all of sudden the whole lot fell apart got basic off of it by reason of the fact that there was an additional different sound invisible picture or invisible picture there was just that tiny difference outstanding so you could find the first two items very rough very rough youve heard about vacuums well this is the vacuum that was the vacuum and thatsholds the whole bank together and i could see my bank shred way out lightyear or two you see just start going off in shreds pieces of it could suddenly longer support themselvesyou know just going just disappearing because this is fundamental on the install type gpms you see even though i hadnt run the first of the chain it was falling apart when i ran this one last night i could hear the items releasing all the way toward present time see i could hear these items going on and gpms coming apart you see every place i had found basic pair why through the gpm series you could hear these things go off seeno longer supporting i mean everythings getting sort ofwell you know like kleenex its all tearing apart up to that time its the difference between kleenex and solid steel nothing could dent it up to then rather remarkable experience well now of course im actually to some degree running over my head doing this sort of thing by skipping series of sixtya series of sixtynot sixty gpms but sixty serieses of gpms you seewithout touching any part of them and then cutting in ahead of this and then just cutting enough off of that you see to make it possible to go little bit earlier and of course the moment thatmoment pin dropped why you can expect that bypassed charge to hit you with thud but its all right i can take it you do this thing to somebody that you dont get any tone arm action on something like that you dont clean up where you were going you dont straighten up what youve got youre not very thorough and very workmanlike on the thing hed just spin man hed just spin right where he sits take this little girl and shes totally capable of running time when she stuck her tongue out at her teacher and you say well weve gone that far lets run out her past death oh well yes you can get the past death on the meter but you havent assessed for it you can get little vague tick and you follow this down you very very carefully date it you cant read the meter but you date it somehow or another the next thing you know why youve got her right in the middle of roaring brimstone your technology has been able totally to overthrow or overwhelm the pc youre good enough so that you can turn his bank loose on him or turn her bank loose on her shell just practically spin baww key out in four or five days we hope what have you done you see here was case that couldnt runcouldnt run anything little straightwire or something like that about all the case can stand and you slammed him in on big charge well because the casesuch case is always in desperate condition some auditors unfortunately will qanda and get the idea that youd better find desperate engram these desperate conditions are very hard to remain as desperate conditions sometimes you can straightwire them right out of existence desperate conditions are very easy to handle i know weve got couple of boys in class here that have been in mental hospitals handling people and that sort of thing and theyve always seen this q and patient is being desperate so you do something desperate see well theres wins along that line the only thing you can do is knock the guy down into apathy see its therapy comparable to hitting somebody in the jaw because they are too excited see if it were only that light that would be all right but they cut out their prefrontal lobes and do other interesting things to these people but the pointthe point im making here is is if you could get one of those desperate people to get just one origin on your part like hello and they really heard it and really saw you or if you could get them to find one real object in the room that desperate condition tends to evaporate its very hard to maintain this desperate condition and its little feather touches that knocks it apart similarly in handling r3r and 3n you have got to pay attention to the fact that youre using tools that are capable of just jack hammering their way through solid concrete forty feet thick dont you see take it easytake it easy now you see that your pc is arc breaking heavily and hard and that sort of thing always assume that youve gone just little bit too steep regardless of the fact that you can find the arc break youve run your r3r too steep or youve run your 3n too steep youve bypassed too many goals dont you see you knew you were bypassing some but youve just bypassed too many you havent unburdened the track you know that youve got several halfdischarged gpms scattered up and down the track that you just left or something like this well take it easy man go back and finish those things up see pc is just going ylaahh you know youve stretched it too thin its always all right to push pc little bit heavier than they can go you understand but you can also push them at acceleration of the speed of light dont you see its just little bit faster than anything could go and the worse off case is the more they can be pushed in over their heads youve got to be careful about this arc break is marvelous method of handling this arc break is marvelous test pc is arc breaking consistently and continually in spite of careful auditing so dont blame yourself as an auditor all the time you know youre not all that bad the only thing that youre bad about is you dontyou dont make careful appreciation of your cases the only other thing thats been poor is not all the technology has been in your hands so that you could but the point im making here is the arc break is wonderful test not if the pc arc breaks once or the pc arc breaks twice or something like that so that doesnt mean anything carry on see theres lot of time being spent on arc breaks and theres lot of upset because of arc breaks and that sort of thing it doesnt necessarily mean youre running too high process dont always translate it into that but it means youre running the process youre running too doggone steep thats all that means youre trying to run helatrobus implants on this person and theyre arc breaking all over the place well obviously there must be chain there of not unburdened gpms or incidents of some kind or another that lead to the helatrobus implants you must be running helatrobus implants at point they cant be run not necessarily that youve got to run stuff later on the track or earlier on the track you understand but there is material there that should be unburdened before you come near the helatrobus implants so youre obviously going past charge different than bypassing charge youre leaving known charge someplace else youre not finishing up something or charge exists someplace else because otherwise look it wouldnt go into restimulation if it didnt exist and if the pc wasnt to some degree trying to run it it wouldnt go into restimulation right and if the pcs bonging around on the time track like pingpong ball and so forth somethings pushing him well whats pushing him too much charge of course so the thing to dothe thing to do if youre running pc on arbitrary actions like 3n helatrobus implants pc arc breaking heavily rr very hard to getthe thing to do is to do preliminarystep assessment it may lead you to an entirely different gpm or it might lead you to specific gpm in the helatrobus implants that youve missed or it might lead you much earlier on the track or it might lead you much later on the track or it might lead you to dental operation in this life that looked just like the helatrobus implants youre not quite sure what itll lead you to but it will for sure give you what should be unburdened so the pc will run well and there is really excuse for running pc not well let interpret that again there is excuse for running pc poorly or having an awful hard time running pc see theres real excuse for this i let you do it its good for you you run pc the hard way youll sure be able to run one the easy way but you set pc into channel for which the pc has tolerance and the pcll run like doll buggy any pc will run well providing you run the pc on the available channel but the worse off pc is is the less available channels they are and the trickier it is to find the available channel you got that and then the less careless you can be in running that channel its actually quite joy to run r3r and 3n there is real difficulty running them right up to the moment when youre handling somebody just little bit too far little bit too rough its just little bit beyond them all right the way to compensate for that thing is by careful and continuous assessment and watch it when youve gotthe ta suddenly goes motionlessyou ran one engram ta went motionless all right thats good lets make sure that you had the right assessment well thats beyond the point now its too late isnt it youve already run an engram did you have the right date is the final duration correct this is all all right was there gpm in it theres gpm in it well what have you got left youve got new assessment now alsoalso pcs who peel off into special categories or arent easy to assess on the standard scale and so forth well you can always get them to do scale dont you see and assess them on that scale in other words you complete the prehav scale and youll get the pcs level very often it isnt just necessarily low case you have to do this with you sometimes have to do it with other cases too pc wouldnt think of these levels by the way is why you have that scale at all but if they dont obviously live at some level on that scale sweat to find it dont you see if they dont obviously live somewhere on that for instance the tape you heard last week was in actual fact research tape to establish this point how hard could you work to make level stay in dont you see and they dont stay in thats all theyre gone so youll have to do yourself anotheranother list because you didnt have any level the pc could be found on so if the level isnt obvious if the pc doesnt cognite if the tone arm doesnt blow down if this isnt godawful wonderful level why are you straining at it get the pc to add to the prehav scale and assess him on that level got the notion on the thing and youll get these things youll see level there pc says oh you know my god how did i ever miss that man youll see the tone arm go down youll also see very successful chain come off of it and so forth all of these things add up to the fact that auditing is as easytype of auditing you are doing is as easy as you assess as easy as you prepare case auditing is as easy to do as it is real to the pc and you run types of auditing which is unreal to the pc youre going to be in trouble all the way all the way okay ive talked to you for long time but i considered the subject was fairly important thank you very much
