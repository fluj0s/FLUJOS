administration designated improving financial performance as one of five governmentwide initiatives in the presidents management agenda pma the establishm ent of baseline on the extent of erroneous improper payments in majo r federal benefit programs was key component of the financial management initiative5 agencies were to include available information on erroneous payment rates for benefit and assistance programs over 2 billion as part of their fy2003 budget submissions in july 2001 revisions to omb circular a11 in section 57 implemented this objective requiri ng 15 federal agencies to include improper payment information with their initial fy2003 budget materials to omb enactment of the ipia extended improper payment reporting requirements to all executive branch departments and agencies lowered the threshold from 2 billion to 10 million and designated congress as well as omb to receive the annual agency reportshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22587crs4 6 omb improper payments

improper payments information act remains incomplete dec 2006 pp 4145in may 2003 omb distributed guide to in struct agencies on the implementation of the ipia6 the guide provided detailed defin itions of imprope r or erroneous payments and of program and activity and then outlined four steps to be taken by the agencies first agencies were required to review systematically all their programs and activities and identify those which are susceptible to significant erroneous payments defined as annual erroneous payments in the program exceeding both 25 of the program payments and 10 milli on second agencies were to determine an annual estimated amount of erroneous payments made in those pr ograms and activities found susceptible to significant errors this calcu lation was to be base d on statistical random sample sufficiently large to yield an estimate with 90 percent confidence interval within 5 precision the third step was to determine why the par ticular programs were at risk and then put in place plan to reduce the erroneous payments the last step was agency reporting to the president via omb and congress on the timates of the annual amount of erroneous payments in its progra ms and activities and on progress in reducing them there has been criticism of ombs guidance to the agencies for implementing the ipia particularly regarding the definition of significant emphasis added improper payments in addition to the 10 million threshold in estimate d improper spending established by the statute om b required that the payment repr esent at least 25 of total program payments the chairman and ranking minority member of the house subcommittee on government efficiency and financial management representative todd platts and representativ marsha blackburn sent tter to omb in august 2003 questioning the 25 minimum threshold likewise according to news article senators charles grassley and max baucus the chai rman and ranking minority member of the senate finance committee stated in ja nuary 9 2004 letter to omb director joshua bolten that omb should not have establishe d the 25 threshold and should have simply required that agencies report all programs generating estimated improper payments of more than 10 million the senators re portedly observed that by adding the 25 threshold the improper payments figures th at will eventually be reported to the public will look better and feel bette r than they really are7 gao has also argued that the 25 threshol d could mask the extent of the improper payments problem in recent report gao identified many examples of agency programs with estimated imp roper payments over 10 million that were not included in the agencys improper payments estimate becau they did not meet the 25 threshold8 for example gao said that the department of education did not report on three programs that each had estimated impr oper payments exceeding 10 million 155 million in total because in each case thos payments represented less than 25 of program outlays p 44 if the 25 crite rion were applied to large programs gao concluded billions of dollars in improper payments could go unreported p 54

2004 has defended the 25 threshold stating it was established to ensure that agencies were focusing their resources on programs with the highest levels of risk for improper payments9 as noted above omb require s estimates of improper pa yments to be provided by agencies in their annual pars not all hi ghrisk programs and activities however had estimates in place by the time agencies submitted their fy2005 pars agencies conducted ri sk assessment of all federal spending 25 trillion in fy2005 and concluded that 60 of governme nt outlays 15 trillion were at risk for significant levels of improper payments10 agencies reported error rate s for 47 programs in their fy2005 pars encompassing 13 trillion or 85 of the outlays identified as highrisk11 number of major programs including medi caid national school lunchbreakfast and the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children wic were among those lacking estimates omb controller linda combs in testimony before the house subcommittee on government mana gement finance and accountability on april 5 2006 said the difficulty in developing error rates in these cases lay in the size and complexity of the programs many of which are administered by state governments12 combs also said that omb is working with states to collect the information necessary to produce valid estimates for these programs in the next two years in 2004 the bush administration design ated eliminating improper payments as separate program initiative under the pma13 fifteen agencies have been graded at the end of each quarter by omb on their efforts to identify eliminate and recover improper payments the most recent scorecard showed that four agencies were green in status indicating full compliance with ombs improper payments standards eight agencies were yellow meaning they were actively puttin g the tools in place to achieve green and three agencies were red reflectin g noncompliance in one or more areas14 in the initial

payments16 the data also reflect decline in the governmentwide improper payments rate from 39 in fy2004 to 31 in fy2005 although there is disagreement as to why this occurred omb has stated that the decrease was the result of corrective actions taken by agencies while gao attribut ed it primarily to change in the way hhs estimated improper paym ents under medicare17 an upward trend in the scope of ipia coverage is evident as well in fy2004 agen cies had established improper payment rates for programs that accounted for approximate ly 80 of risksusceptible dollars and in fy2005 as agencies developed error rate s for 17 additional programs that figure increased to 85 further analysis of these trends will be possible following the release of ombs report on governmentwide improper payment activities during fy2006 meanwhile several oversight hearings on implementation of the ipia have been held the house subcommittee on government efficiency and financial management held oversight hearings on improper paymen ts in may and july 2003 as did the house subcommittee on government manage ment finance and accountabi lity in july 2005 and april 200618 in the senate the subcommittee on federal financial management government information and in ternational security held imp roper payments hearings in july 2005 and in march and december 200619 congressional interest in reducing the number and amount of improper paym ents seems likely to continue
