appropriations by program the programs appropriated for juvenile justice have varied somewhat from year to year for example the 21st century department of justice reauthorizati on act of 2002 pl 107273 among other things repealed number of preexisting grant programs and consolidated many of their purpose areas within the juvenile justice and delinquency prevention block grant14 as t he table shows however this block grant has not been appropriated since its inception instead the appropriators have continued to fund some of the preexisting grant programs chiefly the victims of child abuse gangfree schools and communities grant and juvenile mentoring programs grants either as separate lineitems or as carveouts within the title v community prevention grants additionally some funding administered by ojjdp is appropriated in other accounts within doj including funding for the safe start program appropriated within the office for violence against women table 1 also shows that appropriations for specific programs can vary from year to year and that some programs are specifically appropriated in one year but may not be specifically identified in other years such as project sentry and project child safe 15 which have received standalone appropriations some fiscal years and have been carvedout from the title v grant program in other years some programs are carved out of larger accounts for example ojjdps enforcing underage drinking laws16 has received an annual carveout of 25 million from the title v grant program every year since fy1999 the program does not appear on the table because it has never received standalone appropriation 12 us department of justice department of justice fy2009 congressional budget justification p ojp107 hereafter referred to as doj
