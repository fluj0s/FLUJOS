liability for defective medical products including drugs it would not however preempt any state law that imposes greater procedural or substantive protections for health care providers and health care organizations from liability in medical malpractice and defective medical products suits hr 5 would among other things place caps on noneconomic and punitive damages but only in states that have not

108th congress which were both passed by the house those two bills were identic to each other except for one nonsubstantive word change hr 5 109th congress is similar to but has several substantive differences from s 354 109th congress for information on s 354 see crs report rs22075 medical malpractice liability reform s 354 109th congress by henry cohen 2 the phrase medical malpractice in this

lawyers contingent fees enact federal statute of limitations and provide for periodic paymen t of future damages preemption of state laws medical malpractice suits are governed by state law but because they affect interstate commerce the us constitution would permit congress to regulate them and to preempt state laws that regulate them hr 5 109th congress the help efficient accessible lowcost timely healthcare health act of 2005 would impose federal standards on some aspects of medical malpr actice suits but would leave other aspects to continue to be governed by state law1 actually hr 5 would apply to all health care liability claims which it defines to include not only medical malpractice suits but product liability suits that allege injuries resulting from defec tive medical products2httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22054crs2 2 continued read to include all health care liability claims 3 crs report rl31692 medical malpractice liability re form legal issues and fiftystate survey of caps on punitive damages and noneconomic damages by henry cohen 4 this provision does not mention sellers of dical products but it seems likely that the bill is intended to preempt state law in suits alleging an injury caused by defective medical product 5 this provision raises the question whether st ate that wishes to have cap may enact cap that is so high say 1 billion that it is effectively cap and thereby not be subject to the bills cap 6 hr 5 4c provides that for purpos of applying the 250000 cap future noneconomic damages shall not be discounted to present value this apparently means that if jury awards say 260000 in future noneconomic damages and such amount could be paid in the form of an annuity that costs 240000 the higher figure would control and the future noneconomic damages would be reduced to 250000 not to 240000this report will summarize the main provisi ons of hr 5 and will do so not in the order of the bills sections but in the order of the following subjects that the bill addresses 1 cap on noneconomic damages 2 standard for and cap on punitive damages 3 limiting joint and several liability 4 modifying the collateral source rule 5 limiting lawyers contingent fees 6 creating federal statute of limitations and 7 periodic payment of future damages anot her crs report without making reference to any particular legislation disc usses these same subjects in th same order explaining the legal concepts each involves in greater dept h than the present report does and offering pros and cons of each3 even with respect to those aspects of medical malpractice suits on which hr 5 would impose federal standards hr 5 would not preempt ev ery state law it would not preempt any state law that imposes greater procedural or substantive protections for health care providers and health care organizations from liability loss or damages than those provided by this act or cr eate cause of action 11b4 it would also not preempt any state law whether effective before on or after th date of enactment of this act that specifies particul ar monetary amount of compen satory or punitive damages or the total amount of damages th at may be awarded in hea lth care lawsuit regardless of whether such monetary amount is greater or sser than is provided for under this act 11c5 1 cap on noneconomic damages hr 5 4b would impose 250000 cap on noneconomic damages in any health care lawsuit regardless of the num ber of parties against whom the action is brought or the number of sepa rate claims or actions brought with respect to the same injury as noted above this cap would pply only in states that have cap before enactment of hr 5 and that do not enact one subsequently6 economic damages refer to monetary losses that result from an injury such as medical expenses lost wages and rehab ilitation costs hr 5 would not cap economic damages noneconomic damage s consist primarily of dama ges for pain and sufferinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22054crs3 7 see crs report rl31721 punitive damages in medical malp ractice actions burden of proof and standards for awards in the fifty states by henry cohen and ta ra alexandria rainson 8 21 cfr 31480bc 31481b2both economic and noneconomic damages are compensatory damages as opposed to punitive damages 2 standard for and ca p on punitive damages hr 5 7a provides that punitive damages may be awarded if otherwise permitted by state law if th claimant proves by clear nd convincing evidence that the defendant acted with malicious intent to injure the claimant or deliberately failed to avoid unnecessary injury that the defendant knew the claima nt was substantially certain to suffer hr 5 would thus preempt st ate law regarding the burden of proof and standard for awarding punitive damages except in states that provide greater protection for defendants7 hr 5 7b2 would also impose cap on punitive damages of 250000 or two times the amount of economic not of all compensatory damages awarded whichever is greater as with hr 5s cap on noneconomic damages the cap on punitive damages would apply only in states that have cap before enactment of hr 5 and that do not enact one subsequently hr 5 7c1 would provide that punitive damages may be awarded against the manufacturer or distributor of medical product or supplier of any component or raw material of such medical product if the produc t has been approved by the food and drug administration or is ge nerally recognized as safe and effective under fda regulations this prohibition of punitive damages would not apply however if person 1 knowingly misrepresented to or withheld from the food and drug administration information that is required to be submitted that is causally related to the harm which the claimant allegedly suffered or 2 made an illegal payment to an official of the food and drug administra tion for the purpose of either securing or maintaining approval clearance or licensure of such medical product fda regulations require that even after drug is appr oved drug companies report to the fda new information they obtain about adverse drug experiences8 therefore company that fails to do so could under the bill apparently be subject to pun itive damages state law permitting 3 limiting joint and several liability hr 5 4d would elimin ate joint and several liability in medical malpractice suits joint and several liability is the commonlaw rule that if more than one defendant is found liable for plaintiffs injuries th each defendant may be held 100 percent liable with joint and several liability the plaintiff may not recover more than once but may recover all his or her damages from fewer than all liable defendants with any defendant who pays more than its share of the damages entitled to seek contribution from other liable defendantshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22054crs4 the main argument for eliminating joint and several liability is that it allows plaintiff to recover his entire damage aw ard from deep pocket defendant who was only minimally liable the main argument for retaining joint and several liability is that it is preferable for wrongdoer to pay more than its share of the damages than for an injured plaintiff to recover less than the full compensation to which he is entitled 4 modifying the collateral source rule the collateral source rule is the commonlaw rule that allows an injured party to recover damages from the defenda nt even if he is also entitled to receive them from third party collateral source such as health insurance company an employer or the government to abolish the collateral sour ce rule would be to re quire courts to reduce damages by amounts plaintiff receives or is entitled to receive from collateral sources often collateral source such as health insurer or the government has right of subrogation against the tortfeasor the person responsible for the injury this means that the collateral source takes over the injured partys right to sue the tortfeasor for up to the amount the collateral source owes or has paid the injured pa rty though the collateral source rule may enable the plaintiff to r ecover from both his insu rer and the defendant the plaintiff if there is subrogation must reimburse his insurer the amount it paid him if the collateral source rule were eliminated then the defendant would not have to pay the portion of damages covered by collatera l source and the collateral source would apparently not be able throug h subrogation to recover the am ount it paid the plaintiff in the medical malpractice context therefore eliminating the collateral source rule would benefit liability insurers at the expense of health insurers and other collaterals sources hr 5 6 would provide that in any h ealth care lawsuit any party usually the defendant may introduce evidence of collate ral source benefits and the opposing party usually the plaintiff may introduce evidence of amounts paid to secure those benefits eg health insurance premiums hr 5 does not state that colla teral source benefits minus amounts paid to secure such benef its would have to be deducted from damage awards hr 5 would also eliminate the right of s ubrogation in cases in which collateral source benefits are deducted from damage awards the plaintiff would not recover any money from the defendant against which th collateral source would have right of subrogation even if hr 5 did not eliminate th right of subrogation in cases in which collateral source benefits are not deducted the plaintiff c ould apparently recover from both the defendant and the collateral source 5 limiting lawyers contingent fees contingent fee is one in which lawyer instead of charging an hourly fee for his services agrees in exchange for represen ting plaintiff in tort suit to accept percentage of the recovery if the plaintiff wi ns or settles but to receive nothing if the plaintiff loses payment is thus contingent upon there being recovery plaintiffs agree to this arrangement in order to afford repr esentation without having to pay anything out ofpocket lawyers agree to it despite the risk of not being compensated because thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22054crs5 9 hrept 10832 part 2 mar 11 2003 at 28percentage they receive if they win or settle usually from 33 to 40 percent generally amounts to more than an hourly fee would hr 5 5 would impose cap with s liding scale in medical malpractice cases 40 of the first 50000 the plaintiff recovered 33 of the next 50000 25 of the next 500000 and 15 of any additional amount 6 creating federal statute of limitations the statute of limitations the period within which lawsuit must be filed for medical malpractice suits under state law is ty pically two or three years starting on the date of injury sometimes however the symptoms of an injury do not appear immediately or even for years after malpractice occurs many states therefore have adopted discovery rule under which the st atute of limitations starts to run only when the plaintiff discovers or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered his injury or sometimes his injury and its cause hr 5 3 provides the time for the commencement of health ca re lawsuit shall be three years after the date of manifestation of injury or one year after the claimant discovers or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered the injury whichever occurs first in event shall the time for commencement of health care lawsuit exceed three years after the date of manifestation of in jury unless tolled ie the three years does not start to run for any of the following 1 upon proof of fraud 2 intentional concealment or 3 the presence of foreign body which has therapeutic or diagnostic purpose or effect in the person of the injured person this provision rather than imposing time limitation that begi ns on the date of injury or on the date of discovery of the injury would cut off the right to sue upon the earlier of two different periods three years and one year that begin respectively on the date of manifestation of injury and disc overy of the injury hr 5 defines neither term but in its report on the 108th congresss identical bill the house committee on energy and commerce explained the former term the term manifestation of injury means the injury has become reasonably evid ent thus if someone unknowingly receives tainted blood manifestation of injury is not the date of receiving the blood instead it is the date on which adverse symp toms become reasonably evident9 the discovery of the injury then would pparently occur on the date that the patient learns that his blood is tainted which date may not occur until after manifestation of injury ppose that medical sts reveal the tainted blood one year after the plaintiff experienced his first symptoms there would still be two years to run on the threeyear manifestation period but the pl aintiff would apparently have to sue within one year of discovering that his blood is tainted even if it takes more than one year to learn that his blood is tainted as result of transfusion patient could also pparently discover his injury perhaps through routine medical st before symptoms become manifest and again the oneyear discovery pe riod would apparently applyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22054crs6 10 see eg federal rule of civil procedure 8c 11 annotation propriety and effect of structured settlements whereby damages are paid in installments over period of time and atto rneys fees arrangements in relation thereto 31 alr4th 95 96 12 victor schwartz doctors delight attorneys dilemma legal times healthcare law supplement feb 28 1994 at 30it is not clear whether this provision is strictly speaking statute of limitations hr 5 does not call it that statute of limitations is typically an affirmative defense which means that the defendant must raise it if the defendant fails to raise it then the plaintiff may sue regardless of how much time has passed10 hr 5 by contrast could be interpreted to place the burden of proof on the plaintiff to show that his injury occurred within the time period allowed 7 periodic payment of future damages traditionally damages are paid in lump sum even if they are for future medical care or future lost wages in recent years however attorneys for both parties in damages actions have occasionally foregone lump sum settlements in favor of structured settlements which give the plaintiff steady series of payments over period of time through the purchase of an annuity or through selffunding by an institutional defendant11 hr 5 8 provides in any health care lawsuit if an award of future damages without reduction to present value equaling or exceeding 50000 is made against party with sufficient insurance or other assets to fund periodic payment of such judgment the court shall at the request of any party enter judgment ordering that the future damages be paid by periodic payments in any health care lawsuit the court may be guided by the uniform periodic payment of judgme nts act promulgated by the national conference of commissioners on uniform state law though this provision states that an awar d of future damages shall not be reduced to present value to determine whet her it equals or exceeds the 50000 minimum necessary for party to require the court to order periodic payments it does not state whether the amount of the award of future da mages would be converted to present value not to require such conversion could be very major change significantly reducing awards if it is intended to allow defendant to pay for example 1 million award over 10year period at 100000 year on the othe r hand if it requires the jury award to be converted into present value terms an nnuity with present value of 1 million the reform doesnt mean that much as practical matter the defendant would be paying the same amount as before12 the defendant that is would have to spend 1 million for an annuity that as it earned interest over the year s of its distribution would yield the plaintiff more than 1 million had the defendant paid the plaintiff lump sum of 1 million then the plaintiff could have pur chased that same annuity
