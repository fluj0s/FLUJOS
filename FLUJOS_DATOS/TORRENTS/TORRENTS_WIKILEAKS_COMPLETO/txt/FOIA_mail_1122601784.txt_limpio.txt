into account suggestions from david and bette the text is now 15 pages ie just slightly above target the entire box should now fit on less than 1 ipcc page assigned 075 page i am willing to take the next effort to shorten when the review comments of the fod are in with best regards fortunat quoting fortunat joos joosclimateunibech hi peck and eystein here my general comment on the introduction and specific comments on section 621 and 641 61 and 621 well done 1 perhaps words such as significant and other value judgment terms could be used somewhat less eg with proper care current methodologies alloww more accurate age models more accurate than what we always hope that things are done with proper care 2 the following sentence must in my opinion be deleted but also note that new work reveals that cosmogenincisotopederived estimates of solar forcing for the holocene are not likely as wellconstrained as commonly thought this is very sweeping statement that is not backed up by the chapter text it is also very policy sensitive statement we are either able to firmly support that or to drop it i suspect that the paleo community would be divided about this scott lehmann has just shown plot with really nice correlatin between d18o in npachy in the norhtatlatnic and sunspots over the past 400 years yes there appears to be link i also doubt that some of the existing work eg fleitman etc can be dismissed so easily section 641 3 i also think that the holocene text on solar needs some readjustments linking the studies suggesting solar changes and those with nadw variations seems somewhat improper comparison the present text reads based on the correlation between changes in atmospheric concentrations of cosmogenic isotopes 10be or 14c and climate proxy records some authors argue that solar activity may be the driver for an organised centennial to millennial scale variability eg bond et 2001 fleitmann et 2003 karlen 1996 wang et 2005b whereas others point to modes of variability driven by processes within the climate system for instance related to the deep ocean circulation bianchi and mccave 1999 duplessy et 2001 oppo et 2003 marchal et 2002 i suggest to change it to something along the following line based on the correlation between changes in atmospheric concentrations of cosmogenic isotopes 10be or 14c and climate proxy records many studies suggest that solar activity may be driver for centennial to millennial scale variability eg bond et 2001 fleitmann et 2003 karlen 1996 wang et 2005b the importance of forced or unforced modes of variability within the climate system for instance related to the deep ocean circulation has been pointed out bianchi and mccave 1999 duplessy et 2001 oppo et 2003 marchal et 2002 with best regards fortunat quoting fortunat joos joosclimateunibech hi stefan peck and all here an update on the abrupt event figure and the figure caption there were some lost lines in the one send yesterday please delete i have now also numbered some of the do events and the a1 to a4 events the purpose of the figure is to demonstrate the asynchrounous evolution of nh and sh temperatuere and the magnitude of the ghg changes during abrupt events clearly it would be great if the figure could be amended by other information eg from the land or sediment records we may also think about indicating the local greenland temperatre change for the bigger events any ideas suggestions comments are welcomed peck please include eric monnin as contributing author eric has synchronized the taylor dome and dome c data on the grip time scale and helped greatly to put toghether the records for the abrupt event and for the lgmbox figures with best regards fortunat quoting fortunat joos joosclimateunibech hi here finally the abrupt event figure plus an update of the lgmbox figure will provide figure caption section 66 text and shortened lgmbox tomorrow with best regards fortunat email joosclimateunibech until november 23
