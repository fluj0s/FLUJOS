in gross income in the year the distribution occurs and income taxes must be paid on the taxable portion of the distribution section 1201 of the pension protection act of 2006 pl 109 280 allows individuals aged 70½ and older to exclude from gross income distributions from individual retirement accounts iras if they are made to qualified charity1 this provision for qualified charitable distributions qcds had expired on december 31 2007 pl 110343 extended this provision until december 31 2009 the features of the qcd are contributions must be from traditional or roth iras qcds cannot be made from employersponsored iras simplified employee pensions sepiras and savings incentive match plan for employees simpleiras or from defined contribution retirement plans for exam ple 401k plans or 403b plans individuals must be older than 70½ when the qcd is made charities must be eligible to receive taxdeductible charitable contributions the maximum qcd is 100000 although spouse can also make 100000 qcd if the couple files joint income tax return the 100000 maximum qcd does not apply to the overall charitable deduction limit thus individuals may make charitable contributions in excess of 50 of adjusted gross income the distribution must be trusteetotrustee transfer that is direct transfer from the ira to the charity and the distribution first comes from taxable funds then from any nondeductible ira contributions previously distributions would have been allocated proportionately between deductible and nondeductible contributions the qcd allows taxpayers aged 70½ or older to exclude from their gross income ira distributions that are transferred directly to charity absent the qcd some taxpayers could achieve the same result by including the ira distribution in gross income donating the distribution to charity and taking tax deduction for the donation however taxpayers who do not itemize their tax deductions or whose charitable contributions exceed 50 of their gross income would not benefit as they do from the qcd g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g152g151g561g146g151g561g157g145g142g561g343g343g342g157g145g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g561 the following law
