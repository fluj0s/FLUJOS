assessment oios assessed the unhcr operation in kenya as above average overall it was well run and although some weaknesses in the application of internal controls were identified the weaknesses concerned were not sufficiently critical to compromise the overall system of internal control programme management for the eight partners reviewed reasonable assuran ce could be taken that unhcr funds were properly accounted for and disbursed in accordance with the subagreements project financial and performance monitoring was ad equately performed although suboffice so kakuma could improve the internal controls reporting and monitoring pro cedures of the microcredit scheme managed by the partner don bosco needed to be improved with the appointment of unv micro finance officer the representation expects the sit uation to improve supply management the procurement function was assessed as satisfacto ry however internal controls over procurements at the sos needed to be improved nu mber of large purchases were made but were not being approved by the local contracts comm ittee if such an approval is to be delegated to the sos proper authority needs to be stablished the representation is taking action asset management continues to be concern with int ernal controls assessed as less than satisfactory physical inventory had been carrie d out since 2002 and the values of assets were not correctly recorded on assettrak also ei ght pieces of vhf equipment was recorded with an acquisition value of about us 62 million instead of us 40000 overstating the value of assets

administration in the areas of administration and finance the unh cr representation in nairobi generally complied with unhcrs regulations rules policies and procedures and controls were operating effectively during the period under revie w at the sos however internal controls over financial and cash management needed to be str engthened corrective action was promptly initiated for staff provided with accommodation in dadaab fr om january 2002 until may 2003 deduction of only 125 per cent was made instead of 25 per cent from their solar payments dhrm approved this on the basis that the accommodat ion was substandard and shared although this has now been corrected it is not cle ar why dhrm approved this when the instructions are clear and explicit staff member accompanying her spouse on medical vacuation medevac received both solar and dsa even though the absence from the spec ial operations area was charged to annual leave while this is in compliance with the present instructions in oios opinion this does not seem correct dhrm have referred this matter to the policy sectio n for clarification oios intends to review the rules and procedures for medevac in 2005 some errors and misinterpretations of the rules and procedures of the medical insurance plan mip were noted also the representation was unab to enforce the principle of reimbursement on the basis of reasonable and custom ary fees as the standard price lists available did not realistically reflect the actual costs incurred by staff members the representation is communicating with the joint medi cal service at unon to resolve the issue and obtain price list that reflects standard medi cal fees and other costs in kenya november 2004 table of contents chapter paragraphs i introduction 14 ii

internal controls over financial and asset management be strengthened also program management required to be strengthened the distribution of cash allowances f nearly us 400000 was not properly planned and supervised difficulties were encounter ed in retrieving basic programme documents and project financial monitoring was weak 3 the refugee operation in kenya consists mai nly of refugees from somalia sudan and ethiopia the two main camps are at dadaab and kaku ma situated near the somalia and sudan borders respectively refugees are assisted u nder care and maintenance projects with essential services provided such as water sanitati on health shelter and education in addition assistance is provided to refugees in urb an areas and needy asylum seekers awaiting decision on their

lwf expenditure of us 28 million medecins sans front iers belgique msf expenditure of 2 us 17 million gtz expenditure of us 29 milli on and international rescue committee irc expenditure of us 12 million we also re viewed activities directly implemented by unhcr with expenditure of us 8 million 7 the audit reviewed the administration of th representation at nairobi and sos dadaab and kakuma with administrative budgets total ling us 47 million for 2002 and 2003 and assets with an acquisition value of us 154 llion and current value of us 650000 the number of staff working for the unhcr operation in kenya was 153 this included staff on regular posts united nations volunteers nd project staff 8 the audit followed up on long standing recommenda tion made in the 2001 oios audit with regard to payments made to staff of the government of kenya for registration and screening exercise for which adequate supportin g documents were not available at that point in time this issue has now been satisfactor ily closed 9 the audit activities included review and assessment of internal control systems interviews with staff analysis of applicable data and review of the available documents and other relevant records iv audit findings and recommendations review of implementing partners 10 for the eight partners reviewed reasonabl assurance could be taken that unhcr funds were properly accounted for and disbursed in accordance with the subagreements 11 audit certificates had been received for 2 002 subprojects for all partners for 2003 subprojects with the exception of four partners gtz care wvk and the national refugee secretariat all certificates were received and unqualified opinions were expressed the closure of subproject 03sbkencm234c was dependent on an amicable resolution of differences between unhcr and wvk over the acces s road construction which is outlined in more detail below gtz 12 since 2002 gtz had used the accounting so ftware winpaccs while the system was assessed as generally satisfactory for unhcr re porting purposes some problems were experienced in the migration of data from winpaccs to the ams system dosbased integrated module in winpaccs for tracking unhcr pr oject expenditure the replication under subproject 03abkencm201 g resulted in duplication of some transactions overstating expenditures by us 14300 the representation has formally requested gtz to refund us 14300 13 under subproject 03abkencm201 g gt z recorded disbursements of about euro 29500 us 35400 under the salary budget li ne the nature of the charges could not be ascertained or explained the amounts related to expenditure recorded by gtzs headquarters but there were documents supportin g the charges at the local level these expenses resulted in budgetary overrun of some us 20000 for the salary budget line the representation has requested gtz to substantiate th disbursements 3 recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in kenya should request gt z to refund some us 49700 this relates to an overchar ge of us 14300 resulting from duplication of expenditure tr ansactions during the migration process from winpaccs to the ms and from unsubstantiated amounts totalling euro 29534 us 35400 which were charged to subproject 03abkencm201 g for expenses incurred at gtz headquarters but could t be supported or explained by gtz kenya rec 01 14 oios assessed that the staffing resources allocated by gtz for procurement activities were insufficient only one individual was vested w ith the responsibility of the procurement process ie preparing quotation requests receiv ing proposals selecting and awarding the contracts signingissuing of purchase orders rece iving goods etc although the finance manager approved the purchase order the lack of gregation of responsibilities highlighted potential risk and was serious weakness in intern control moreover oios noted that competitive purchasing was not always undertaken f or example truck costing us 35000 was not competitively procured and proper supportin g documentation such as purchase order and invoice were not available oios recomm ended that appropriate action be taken to strengthen internal controls and to ensure goods are procured competitively the representation took action and advised gtz to stren gthen internal controls and ensure procurement is undertaken competitively 15 in july 2003 gtz received an invoice from action contre faim acf of nearly us 22700 for the purchase of milk the invoice in cluded compulsory bond of us 5657 which represented an advance to the kenyan customs this amount is reimbursable once the goods are cleared through customs due to an overs ight gtz has still not recovered the amount or credited it to the subproject the representation has requested gtz to pursue the recovery b care kenya 16 care charged some us 6800 for the years 2002 and 2003 for part of the cost of installing their standard international accounting software also oios understands that care intends to impose similar annual charge unti l the cost of the software is fully amortised oios considers that these costs should b covered under the 5 per cent headquarters support costs and recommended recove ry the representation agreed with oios and has already requested care to refund the mount 17 care charged over ksh 41 million us 51 000 to the 2003 subproject for staff benefits such as pension severance pay and life in surance which were additional to those normally paid under kenyan labour law such benefit s were not paid by other implementing partners also the accrued severance payments were subsequently disbursed as an additional payment equivalent to onemonths salary to employe at the end of the year oios questioned why unhcr provided budget for this expenditure as it did not relate to true termination benefits and other partners were not provided with such budget provision in oios view if partner wants to provide additional benefits to its staff then the cost should be funded from their sources the representation agreed and assured oios that for 2005 unhcrs contribution towards salaries and benefits will be in compliance with the kenya labour law 4 c world vision kenya 18 wvk were responsible for implementing two subprojects for which most of the expenditure was for infrastructure construction for the camps in kakuma angelina jolie school cost of implementation us 230000 19 prior to initiating the contracting proces s cost estimates had been prepared against which the bids received could be assessed and evalu ated therefore there were benchmarks to allow wvk and unhcr to negotiate the most advantageous terms the bids received ranged from ksh 185 million us 230000 to ksh 542 million us 678000 and the completion period from 34 to 108 weeks the contract was eventually signed in december 2003 with the lowest bidder at the reques t of wvk the contractor agreed to reduce the construction period from 34 weeks to 16 weeks this was unrealistic and the building was only completed in september 2004 some five months after the due date penalty was imposed as the delay was not entirely attributable to the contractor access road for kakuma camp cost of implementatio n us 250000 20 in may 2003 wvk prepared the bill of quan tities boq for 58 km access road according to wvk the boq prepared by them remained with the representation for some four months without any positive action being take n to implement the project the representation had initially decided to directly im plement the project but the competitive bidding exercise was unsuccessful and it was decide d that responsibility for the project revert back to wvk separately the kenyan ministry of roa ds public works and housing was requested to prepare an estimate based on the boq and they calculated the cost at ksh 154 million us 193000 despite this benchmark c ontract was awarded by wvk albeit the lowest offer received to company for ksh 20 mil lion us 250000 the contract was signed in december 2003 with works to be completed within 16 weeks wvk was fully aware of the cost differential but made attempt to question the overall cost or of some of its components for example the ministrys quotati on for small drift on the fuji academy road was ksh 14 million us 17500 against that offered of ksh 39 million us 49000 by the successful supplier an increase of 278 per cent 21 the boq prepared by wvk contained numerous errors that went undetected even though technically qualified persons in unhcr the ministry and wvk had reviewed them the main error was regarding the extent of the back fill for the excavation done at the site which was only detected by the contractor when the works started as unhcr were present at the meetings with the contractor where this prob lem was discussed wvk understood that they had unhcrs approval to remedy the shortcoming s in the boq wvk therefore verbally authorized the contractor to do the variat ion works at cost of ksh 41 million us 51000 written contract or formal variation or der was issued as result of this and as written approval was sought from unhcr the repr esentation has refused to accept the additional work as legitimate project expenditure the representation requested refund of ksh 44 million us 55000 the cost of the work s it was clear that some errors in judgement were made wvk should not have authorized the substantial increase contract value contract without formal approval from unhcr also considering the value involved wvk should have formally documented the substantial variation on the other hand unhcr were kept fully informed of the situation bu t did not act proactively or effectively 5 when the problems were brought to their attention so kakuma in particular failed to provide adequate levels of supervision and monitori ng of wvks work to ensure that problems were promptly dealt with and satisfactoril resolved 22 the representation engaged societe general surveillance sgs to review and estimate the work done unfortunately the results were not satisfactory and the estimates provided were unreliable technical joint unhcrw vk assessment has just recently been completed and the results drafted by unhcr the ass essment has yet to be endorsed by wvk oios understands that in the meantime the co ntractor has taken legal action with regard to the work done which has not been paid for this is therefore very contentious issue that needs to be urgently resolved 23 wvk made the decision to authorise the va riation works in good faith and if the additional works had not been done the road would have become impassable during the rainy season and hence been poor investment by unhcr i n oios opinion little purpose would be served by unnecessarily prolonging the matter an d protracted legal problems could adversely affect unhcrs relations with its partner action is now required to resolve the issue amicably as there was fault and miscommunicat ion on both sides b other programme issues 24 oios assessed that project financial and p erformance monitoring at the representation was competently performed though th is function required improvement so kakuma 25 the microcredit scheme managed by the par tner don bosco required closer monitoring and supervision oios calculated that fr om the first 128 loans issued only 33 had been fully repaid and repayments of some ksh 800 000 us 10000 were outstanding on the balance of the loans the rate of repayment was poor and given this and the low internal generation of funds the scheme is unlikely to beco selfsustaining and will be dependent on fresh injection of capital internal controls ver the management and monitoring of the scheme were assessed as weak separate bank accou nt for the scheme had not been opened and consequently funds were intermingled with other project funds which meant that the value of the revolving fund was not known 26 standard reports for monitoring the scheme had not been properly designed to ensure accountability the reports submitted lacked transp arency and did not adequately reflect the activities being undertaken moreover don bosco wa s unable to provide key information such as the number and volume of nonperforming act ivities proper monitoring and verification procedures had not been implemented an d there was lack of information on the beneficiaries of the scheme some of them had absco nded after receiving loans oios appreciates that follow up visits were being undert aken but these were not sufficiently effective to ensure the loans were repaid the app licable interest rate was some 3 per cent per month applying the reducing balance method this wa s an exceptionally high rate of interest and in oios view this needs to be reviewed the representation stated that the reporting and monitoring formats have improved since new crofinance officer has been assigned and that it was expected that systems and procedure s would be further enhanced closer attention would be given to selecting beneficiaries and the high interest rate would be reviewed 6 c supply management procurement 27 during 2003 and 2004 till july the repre sentation carried out procurements valued at some us 484 million the procurement activitie s by the representation were assessed as satisfactory however internal controls over the p rocurement activities of the sos required to be improved although the policy was that procureme nt was centralised in nairobi oios noted that sos were undertaking significant purchas without any authority or proper approval procedures oios recommended to consider d elegating some of the procurement activities to the sos and to clarify the delegation and the applicable purchasing thresholds the representation accepted oios recommendation to request the controller to establish local contracts committee at the so level with appropriate delegated authorit and financial responsibility c fuel management 28 from january 2003 till july 2004 the repre sentation purchased fuel valued at some us 12 million fuel management at the sos was gen erally satisfactory but there was scope for improvement 29 the underground tanks at so dadaab had not been correctly installed and were tilted to one side therefore it was not possible to accu rately measure the quantities of fuel available regular discrepancies of up to 1000 lit res were noted between the quantities reported in the ledger and the quantity in hand per the dipstick oios recommended that the matter be resolved so that fuel can be adequately m onitored and controlled the representation agreed to take action 30 at so kakuma there were persistent reports of short deliveries that apparently resulted due to the use of defective dipstick th is has now been replaced oios recommended that for enhancing controls fuel flow meter be used to record deliveries this has now been implemented monthly reports on fuel usage were prepared and regularly sent to nairobi nonetheless the reports were not effec tively used to identify any unusual trends or discrepancies that required followup d warehouse management 31 oios assessed that adequate procedures wer established over inventory and warehouse activities the average volume of stock i n the warehouse had been significantly reduced 67 per cent due to concerted efforts in m id2004 to dispose of old and obsolete items nonetheless the exercise should have been i nitiated earlier and if this had been done it could have resulted in annual savings of about us 8000 the representation will continue the disposal of old stock and will transfer empty c ontainers to locations where they can be put to gainful use 32 five new vehicles were parked in the wareh ouse compound three of them had been there for more than 18 months awaiting transfer to the government of kenya gok the delay resulted as the tax authorities were insistin g on payment of duty even though the police department would use the vehicles the matte r has since been sorted out and the vehicles will be transferred shortly to gok also two land cruisers acquired in early 2004 7 will be transferred to the partner before the end f the year d asset management 33 asset management continues to be concern with internal controls assessed as less than satisfactory physical inventory had been c arried out since 2002 but recently initiated and the values of assets were not correc tly recorded on assettrak also six pieces of vfh equipment was recorded with an acquisition v alue of us 999999 instead of the correct value of about us 5000 each two codan re ceivers were shown with an acquisition value of us 99999 each for these eight items alo ne the asset acquisition value was overstated by some us 62 million such major disc repancies involve the risk of distorting unhcrs financial statements the representation stated that physical verificatio n of assets was initiated in july 2004 and that the time consum ing process of correcting values and data on assettrak had started recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in nairobi should complete the physical inventory of assets started in july 2004 and should verify and correct as required assettrak data to ensure asset values are not grossly over or und erstated rec 02 d security and safety 34 security and safety arrangements at the hcr offices in kenya appeared in line with current procedures all unhcr staff in kenya had completed the basic security training and several other trainings had been carri ed out in 2003 shatter resistant film has been installed and other measures such as radio equ ipment perimeter security and mailpackage scanner have been put in place furthe r improvements will be implemented with the installation of cctv cameras protective l ighting and antiramming barriers administration financial management 35 the representation generally complied with unhcrs regulations rules policies and procedures and controls were operating effectively during the period under review at so dadaab the delegation of authority charts had not been updated since february 2001 with staff members wrongly exercising financial signing authority also internal controls over financial and cash management needed to be strength ened the representation has improved internal controls and the delegation of authority c harts are being updated for so kakuma advances were not timely cleared with operational advances of ksh 4 million us 51420 taken in may 2004 but still recorded as receivabl in september 2004 cash payments exceeded the threshold authority on numerous occasi ons the representation stated that the receivables were being reviewed for clearance and t hat the petty cash limit would be respected b solar payments 36 solar payments for international staff wer inconsistently applied and were non compliant with unhcr rules and procedures for staf f provided with accommodation in 8 dadaab from january 2002 until may 2003 deducti on of only 125 per cent of the solar rate was made instead of 25 per cent this was don on the approval of dhrm at headquarters as the accommodation was substandard and shared the decision was taken in june 2002 and retroactively applied from 1 january 2002 in oios opinion such decision was incorrect and the representation and dhrm wrong ly interpreted the rules oios is aware of the poor living conditions in dabaab but solar is living allowance and not hardship allowance and should have been treated as such the representation stated that they had reverted to deduction of 25 per cent as soon as they realized the mistake oios is not insisting on recovery at this stage but the matt er has been raised again with dhrm at headquarters to ascertain the reasons why entitleme nts were favourably interpreted to the advantage of some staff even though the instruction s are explicit c solar and dsa during medevac 37 oios noted that staff member who accompa nied her spouse on two medevacs lasting 15 days and 22 days respectively was in rec eipt of both solar and dsa even though the absence from the soa was charged to annual leav while this is in compliance with the present instructions it does not seem correct that staff member on annual leave can receive both solar and dsa in oios view only one entitlem ent ie dsa or solar should be paid the representation concurred with oios view as bei ng prima facie reasonable and agreed to take up the matter with dhrm dhrm have s ince referred this matter to the policy section for clarification oios intends to review the rules and procedures of medevac in 2005 d payment of dsa for incountry medevacs 38 oios noted that dsa payments to locally re cruited staff under medevac were not consistently applied when local staff are medicall evacuated within the country of recruitment only actual hotel expenses can be reimb ursed up to 50 per cent of applicable dsa in the absence of hotel receipts dsa payme nts can be made oios noted two overpayments of some ksh 212080 us 2650 in ne case hotel receipts were provided and in the other dsa was not restricted to the actu amount paid to the hotel oios is not insisting on recovery of the overpayments since the were authorized by the representation but recommended that responsible staff is made full aware of unhcrs rules and procedures with regard to medevac so that errors do not continue the representation agreed to apply the correct rates with immediate ef fect medical insurance plan 39 oios assessed that the processing of mip c laims were generally in compliance with unhcrs procedures and mip guidelines although som errors were noted and some amounts reimbursed were at the incorrect rate howe ver internal controls over the reimbursement of claims to ensure they were reasona ble and customary for the duty station needed to be strengthened there was standard li st of hospitals pharmacies and doctors to where mip participants were recommended to seek tre atment or standard prices against which to assess the reasonableness of the claims 40 the representation did have copy of fe guidelines for medicaldental practitioners released in april 2004 by the medi cal practitioners and dentists board this contained comprehensive list of charges for vario us ailments and procedures which in 9 oios opinion would serve as good benchmark for r eimbursement of claims oios observed however that amounts reimbursed were not in line with the estimated fees sometimes almost 100 per cent more effort was m ade to apply the guidelines and as some claims did not clearly indicate the medical pr ocedure undertaken it was difficult to assess if the amount paid was reasonable and custom ary according to the representation the medical practitioners and dentists board guidelin have been repudiated as unrealistically low by two leading health service p roviders namely the nairobi and aga khan hospitals until the matter is resolved the representation pr oposes to continue with the practice of reimbursing actual costs 41 oios discussed this issue with the chief f the joint medical service at unon and learnt that they too faced similar problem and w ere consulting headquarters on the matter the unon joint medical service estimated th at staff are routinely charged 24 times the normal fees by most doctors and that the two main hospitals nairobi and aga khan because of their prominence and dominant posi tion had considerable power in influencing key decisions the agencies are grea tly dependent on services provided by these hospitals it was unons view that common stand among agencies was required to ensure that favourable financial arrangements we re made the concept of reasonable and customary costs is an important benchmark in decidi ng eligible reimbursements and therefore it is important that standard fee guidel ines are established recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in nairobi should work clo sely with the joint medical service at unon and other agen cies in obtaining and applying consistent and standard fee guidelines so that the concept of reasonable and customary reimbu rsements can be enforced rec 03 g administrative procedures at so kakuma 42 overtime payments were not always in accor dance with unhcr rules and procedures prior approval was not always obtained there were frequent inaccuracies in its calculation and inconsistencies in the rate payable in comparison to overtime payments at nairobi therefore within the same country operati on divergent practices were followed the representation agreed that overtime would be re gulated in accordance with the rules and procedures 43 the logbooks maintained for administration vehicles were not reliable the mileage and destinations were not clearly recorded numerou s alterations were made details of fuel consumption was documented and carry forward balan ces were incorrectly stated the number of inaccuracies was substantial and oios was concerned that supervisory review was conducted oios noted that over 30000 kms run by various vehicles were not recorded which included for one vehicle an unexplained diffe rence of 20000 kms the representation will undertake periodic reviews to ensure integrity of the logbooks 10 v acknowledgement 44 i wish to express my appreciation for the assistance
