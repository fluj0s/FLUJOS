year research project to develop and integrate informati on technologies into prototype system for use by the intelligence counterintelligen ce and law enforcement communities intends to exploit rd efforts that have been underway for several years in darpa and elsewhere as well as private sector data mining technology6 darpa envisions database of an unpreced ented scale that will most likely be distributed must be capable of bein g continuously updated and must support both autonomous and semiautomated analysis7 extensive existing databases from both private and public sector information holdings will be used to obtain transactional and biometric data8 transactional data for the tia database could in clude financial eg banks credit cards and money transmitters casinos and brokerage firms educational travel eg airlines rail rental car dical veterinary country entry placeevent entry transportation housing critical resources government and communications eg cell landline internet data biometric data for the database could include face finger prints gait and iris data9 the tia system could seek access to databases to discove r connections between pass ports visas work permits drivers license credit card airline tickets rental cars gun purchases chemical purchases and events such as arrest or suspicious activities and so forth10 data mining key component of the tia program is the deployment of data mining technologies to sift through data and transactions to fi nd patterns and associations to discover and track terrorists11 the idea is that if terrorist organizations are going to plan and execute attacks against the united states their people must engage in transactions and they will leave signat ures in this information space 12

attacks data mining is the search for significant patterns and trends in large databases using sophisticated sta tistical techniques and software13 the widespread use of computers and the large amount

in numerous databases14 data mining technolog ies facilitate the use of information data mining technologies are currently used by federal agencies for various purposes and plans exist for considerable expansion of this technology for example the department of justice is engaged in data mining projects that utilize computer technology to analyz information to reveal patte rns of behavior consistent with terrorist activities utilizing law enforcement and intelligence information as well as public source data the foreign rrorist tracking task force employs risk modeling algorithms link analysis historic review of past patte rns of behavior and other factors to distinguish persons who ma pose risk of terrorism from those who do not15 the transportation security

related information from the databases of all government agencies responsible for homeland security under this initiative the department of homeland security department of justice fbi and numerous state and local law enforcement agencies would have access to information analysis using advanced datamining techniques to reveal patterns of criminal behavior and detain suspected terrorists before

build centralized database to detect and deter against terrorist threats and attacks this section of the report describes existing legal safeguards for the protection of personal in formation it covers applicable federal laws discussion of state laws is beyond its scope in the united states there is omnibus statute or constitutional provision that provides comprehensive legal protection for the privacy of personal inform ation but rather an assortment of laws regulate information deemed to be of sufficient importance to be afforded some level of protection the us constitution federa l statutes and regulations and state law combine to govern the collection use and disclosure of information the constitution provides certain privacy protections but does not explicitly protect information privacy22 its protections extend only to the protection of the individual against government intrusions and its gu arantees are not applicable unless state action has taken place in other words its guarantees extend to government intrusions rather than private sector abuses the fourth amendment searchand seizure provision protects right of privacy by requiring warrants before government may invade ones internal space or by requiring that warrantless invasions be reasonable23 that amendment protects individua l privacy against certain kinds of governmental intrusion the supreme c ourt has interpreted this language as imposing warrant requirement on all s earches and seizures predicated upon governmental authority and has ruled that violations of this standard will result in the suppression in any criminal proceeding of any material or information derived therefrom the court has also recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement finally an individual has fourth amendm ent rights with respect to information held by third parties24 there is comprehensive federal statut that protects the privacy of personal information held by the public sector and the private sector instead federal law tends to employ sectoral approach to the regulation of persona l information historically the individuals privacy in terests have been balan ced with the governments information needs25 examples of this balancin g of personal and governmental interests can be found in the numerous priv acyrelated enactments of the past twenty five years federal laws protect gove
