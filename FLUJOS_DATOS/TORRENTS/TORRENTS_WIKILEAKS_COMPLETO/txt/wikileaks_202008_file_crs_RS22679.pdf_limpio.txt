coming under scrutiny due to their rapid growth lack of oversight high risk and recent fund losses and failure s pension funds have increased their allocation of assets to hedge funds in recent years

hedge funds and the am ount of assets associated with them it is estimated that in 2006 there were approx imately 8800 hedge funds ma naging about 12 trillion in assets which represents 3000 increase in assets over 16 years5 hedge fund oversight because hedge funds are not re quired to register with the securities and exchange commission sec they are exempt from standardized reporting requirements and from examinati on by the sec the sec claims these exemptions deny investors material information from which to make informed decisions and hamper their ability to detect hedge fund fraud6 riskiness hedge funds can be characterized as highrisk highreturn operations they pursue high returns by taking risks often they seek what is called alpha return that is returns uncorrelated to market performan ce that means that hedge funds can be profitable when the market in general is not for that reason successful hedge funds provide not only high returns to their invest ors they contribute to

recent fund losses and failures in 1998 longterm ca pital managements ltcms capital shrank from 4 billion to 360 million in matter of weeks which led to bailout engineered by the federal rese rve bank of new york the bailout was based on the belief that the funds fa ilure might have caused widesp read disruption in financial markets because of the funds size it held 125 billion in assets nearly four times the amount of the next largest fund its high ly leveraged position ssets to capital ratio greater than 25to1 and the large size of its investments in certain markets eg ltcms position represented more than 5 of the open interest in number of futures markets11 regardless the feds intervention was unusual and triggered concerns that funds would take greater risks on the assumpti on that the fed was there to bail them out in september 2006 amaranth advisors fund lost 64 billi on from peak of 9 billion amaranths losses were attributed to illtimed speculation in natural gas prices the losses did not affect the overall market as was feared with ltcm and did not trigger action by the fed12 in the period between ltcm and amaranth the industry saw several major hedge fund losses nd

alternative investments including private equity real estate and hedge funds from 2 to 1416 pension funds increased interest in hedg funds coupled with the concerns listed above have led some to question the appropria teness of pension funds investing in hedge funds in addressing this question however it is important to distinguish between the riskiness of single investment and the risk to portfolio individual hedge fund investors seek high returns but they risk losing their entire investment and the ltcm and amaranth collapses show that this can happen in short period of time as part of portfolio though hedge f und investments can mitigate risk due in part to their noncorrelation to traditional st ock markets hedge funds are powerful tools for portfolio diversification and he lp to enhance returns reduce vola tility and increase riskadjusted returns especi ally during bear markets17 during the first quarter of 2001 when the sp 500 index experienced its wo rst quarter since

crs report rl33937 the financial health of the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc by william klunkexisting forms of regulation pension funds are not prohibited from investing in hedge funds the employee retirement in come security act erisa codifies the legal requirements for defi ned benefit pension plans although it provides few restrictions on the investment of pension funds it does requi re that pension funds must be managed in accordance with fiduciary re sponsibilities which incl ude acting solely in the interest of plan participants defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan diversifying investments so as to minimize the risk of large losses21 accordingly the protection of pension plan participants from hedge fund losses falls to pension fund investment fiduciaries the pension protection act of 2006 pl 109280 or ppa modified the rules under which hedge funds become fiduciaries of pension funds the ppa provides that investment funds and limited partnerships including he dge funds will not be treated as plan fiduciaries under erisa if investments by erisacovered plans account for less than 25 of assets of the investment fund or limited partnership investments of governmental and foreign plans which are not subject to erisa will not be taken into account in this calculation as they were under prior law in 2004 the securities and exchange co mmission issued rule requiring many hedge fund advisers to register as investment advisers under the investment advisers act the rule took effect in february 2006 and so basic information on registering hedge funds appeared on the sec website in j une 2006 however an appeals court found that the rule was arbitrary and not compatible with the plain language of the investment advisers act and vacated it in december 2006 the sec proposed regu lation that would raise the accredited investor threshold from 1 million to 25 million in assets if dopted the rule would significantly reduce the pool of potential hedg fund investors but would not be expected to have strong impact on the largest funds which rely more on institutional investors and qualified purchasers22 policy considerations corporate pension funds are backed by the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc w holly owned government entity although it receives appropriations some fear that its failure c ould

grassley question he dge fund investments for american workers pension plans march 1 2007committing their funds24 he believes that these character istics will be embraced by hedge funds as they seek to attract pension funds dollars i think it is safe to say that as pensions continue to invest in hedge funds the industry will further adjust and further impose upon itself risk management st rategy which should at some level mitigate risk25 the presidents working group on financial markets which was formed in 1999 in the aftermath of the ltcm failure recently noted that in our marketbased economy market discipline of risktaking is the rule and government regulation is the exception26 senators baucus and grassley have expre ssed interest in learning whether hedge funds pose threat to workers retirement security27 the senators have asked the government accountability office gao to inve stigate the benefits and risks that hedge funds pose to pension funds and their participants erisa does not currently require pensi on plan sponsors to report the number of hedge funds they use or the amount of m oney invested in them some say this information could enable policymakers to quan tify the portion of pens ion assets that are being invested in hedge funds it could th ey say also help distinguish pension funds whose hedge fund investments are concentrated in one or two funds versus those more diversified that is spread over larger number of hedge funds
