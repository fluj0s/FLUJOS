paris daily siprnet report for january 13 b 2008 summary 1 u in this annual new years message to the diplomatic corps on delivered on january 18 president sarkozy laid out theoretical justification for recasting frances role on the international scene in the twin challenges before the international community climate change and the return of the religious extremism as factor in international politics sarkozy called for four innovations to prevail over these challenges 1 returning france to the heart of the occidental family 2 dedicating france to diplomacy of reconciliation 3 affirming diversity while demanding its corollary reciprocity and 4 working towards the construction of world order adapted to the emergence of new powers and therefore capable of dealing effectively with the challenges of the 21st century the specific initiatives sarkozy said france would be pursuing during the coming year from reform of the unsc to pressing for continued sanctions against iran from expansion of the g8 to the hosting of an afghanistan donors conference all link to sarkozys projected role for france as leading the way towards the international unity needed to meet the environmental challenge to humanity from global warming and the political challenge to secular democracy from religious fundamentalists end summary new years best wishes to the diplomatic corps 2 u president nicolas sarkozy delivered the french presidents annual new years best wishes to the diplomatic corps on the afternoon of january 18 ambassador stapleton and dcm pekala attended the event remarks followed by reception at the elysee palace traditionally french presidents have used these events to review administration achievements and to unveil or reiterate upcoming foreign policy initiatives true to form sarkozy went beyond review of achievements and listing of initiatives and laid out the justification for his projected reform of frances role on the international scene sarkozy began by pointing out as he does in connection with nearly every area of public policy i was not elected to accept things as they are i was elected to reform france through continuous process of profound reform he also underlined that frances foreign policy had to stem from lucid analysis realistic about frances place in the world as the world is today two great challenges and the need for unity 3 u sarkozys analysis of the state of the world today posits two great challenges climate change and religious fundamentalism sarkozy said that global warmings menace to humanity and the intention of certain groups to impose fundamentalist hegemonic and intolerant religiosity would restructure international society in the 21st century possibly more than ideologies did in the 20th sarkozy then argued that these challenges could be successfully met only on one condition finding the unity necessary for concerted effective international action the four major innovations in frances international affairs posture that sarkozy then claimed he had or was putting in place and the range of specific initiatives that he said france would be pursuing in the coming year link directly in sarkozys view to fostering the international unity necessary for taking effective action against these two challenges comment in his presentation to the members of the diplomatic corps sarkozy projected as candidate on the campaign trail working hard to win over his listeners to his way of looking at things as he has always done in connection with his domestic reform campaigns sarkozy sets great store in bringing people around to share his diagnosis of the situation from which follow the courses of action he proposes end comment four innovations 4 u the four foreign policy innovations sarkozy claimed to be implementing are 1 returning france to the heart of her occidental family 2 pursuing diplomacy of paris 00000130 0026 of 003 c r r c t d c p added tags conciliation 3 affirming diversity while demanding that its corollary reciprocity be honored by others and 4 advocating reformed international institutional order adapted to the emergence of new powers and therefore capable of dealing effectively with the challenges of the 21st century while he rejected previous governments use of the word hyperpower to describe the us he did describe multipolar worldview with europe become one of the active poles 5 in connection with the first he evoked frances newfound closeness to the us sarkozy underlined that france was voluntary partner of the us and an independent ally and friend while clearly implying that france for the sake of its own effectiveness and credibility was right to abandon its pretensions to representing an alternative to us leadership sarkozy also underlined inqnection with frances getting back in step with the major western democracies that doing so was key to advancing frances leadership role in the eu he said that it was frances ambition to see the eu emerge as an important global actor in the 21st century and that that required the development of an effective european defense capability esdp independent of nato he stressed that in the face of todays range of threats and crises nato and esdp were complimentary spans of single security and defense architecture for europe he said that frances newfound unity with the us and newfound unity with its eu partners had reinforced frances leadership credibility both internally among the western democracies and externally throughout the rest of the world 6 u sarkozy argued that frances diplomacy of conciliation worked to attenuate differences and by implication promote the unity necessary for effective international action sarkozy justified his recent dealings with qadhafi and hugo chavez in terms of this constructive engagement frenchstyle that he calls diplomacy of conciliation he went on to say that frances foreign policies would henceforth be anchored in the affirmation of diversity and its corollary reciprocity he justified the elevation of diversity to guiding principle for foreign policies as follows even more than the fight for democracy it seems to that the fight for diversity for openness tolerance acceptance of others in all their difference is fundamental it is in way the precondition for extending liberty and durably implanting democracy lastly sarkozy claimed the innovation of advocating reformed system of multilateral institutions and again justified these proposals as necessary for achieving needed unity in the face of global challenges specific initiatives 7 u once he had dispatched the carefully constructed theoretical underpinnings of his framework for frances foreign policy sarkozy took up the range of specific initiatives that france would be pursuing in the coming year note sarkozys speech in its entirety is available in english on the elysee website at wwwelyseefr in addition post has reported separately ref on the outlook for frances africa policy as reflected in the speech furthermore french policy under sarkozy in the critical areas of iran afghanistan natoesdp and middle east peace have the subject of extensive and regular reporting end note among the most salient of sarkozys specific initiatives aimed at reforming international institutions are enlarging the security council in its two categories of members and enlarging the g8 to include progressively china india brazil mexico and south africa in addition sarkozy called for reform of the imf calling on it to become more inclusive of emerging economic powers and to develop way of engaging the large international oil and other similarly profitable global companies in financing the alleviation of poverty he also said that all must be done to produce an agreement by 2009 up to the colossal challenge of global warming via the bali process 8 u he reiterated frances commitment to continuing sanctions against iran while aiming to return iran to full respectability once it respects international law sarkozy paris 00000130 0032 of 003 confirmed that france would host the next afghanistan donors conference he said france would support the process envisaged at annapolis to result in the creation of palestinian state sidebyside to the state of israel he reviewed frances priorities for its upcoming presidency of the eu the lisbon treaty the environment and energy immigration agriculture and implementing esdp and he recommitted to launching that important civilizational project the mediterranean union comment 9 u in this speech sarkozy did not unveil any new or unexpected initiatives but he did attempt to link frances foreign policy initiatives to pressing international problems without referring to frances glory or frances history and civilization sarkozy nevertheless articulated an ambitious foreign policy framework that should help guide our understand of the french approach over the coming months including during its presidency of the european union that begins in july end comment
