nakamura analyst in foreign affairs foreign affairs defense and trade division proposals for new foreign service compensation system in the 110th congress summary proponents of revisions in the foreign service compensation system point out that as increasing numbers of foreign service personnel are going to posts of increased hardship and danger foreign service personnel serving abroad receive 2089 less than their colleagues who are posted in washington dc due to the loss of locality pay when serving abroad these proponents of revision maintain that this difference negatively impacts morale and assignment considerations and eventually retention also both the 109th and 110th congresses have considered proposals to eliminate this pay difference the american foreign service association afsa has been working for several years with congressional supporters to change the compensation system since fy2007 the george w bush administration has requested funds to create new performancebased compensation system for the foreign service and eliminate the pay differential for fy2009 the administration requested 347 million for the first stage of transition to pay equity the senate appropriations committee provided sufficient funding to meet the administrations request in its appropriations bill s 3288 reported on july 18 2008 the foreign service overseas pay equity act of 2008 hr 3202 as amended would eliminate the pay differences over three years this bill was referred to both the house committee on foreign affairs hcfa and the house committee on oversight and government reform hogr hcfa reported the bill on july 16 2008 an identical bill was introduced in the senate s 3426 on august 1 2008 and was referred to the senate committee on foreign relations sfrc the sfrc reported the bill without amendments on september 23 2008 the major difference between the administrations proposal and the current legislation is that the administration while proposing to eliminate the pay difference over two years also seeks to develop new performancebased worldwide compensation system for the foreign service hr 3202 and s 3426 would eliminate the pay differences over three years without reference to developing new performancebased system afsa states that the foreign service personnel system is already performancebased and the pay adjustment proposals eliminate an unintended inequity others with concerns about the legislation however state this is basically pay increase for the foreign service and question whether increases are needed because of the benefits and allowances foreign service personnel generally receive when posted abroad this report discusses 1 the legislative background leading to proposal to change the compensation system 2 the current foreign service personnel system and why the foreign service views it as already performancebased 3 an examination of why the foreign service and the administration are both requesting that congress

recent legislative developments the foreign service overseas pay equity act of 2008 hr 3202 as amended would eliminate over three years the pay difference between those foreign service personnel serving in washington dc and those serving abroad who are not eligible for locality pay adjustment this bill was referred to both the house committee on foreign affairs hcfa and the house committee on oversight and government reform hogr on july 16 2008 hcfa favorably reported the bill by voice vote on august 1 2008 an identical companion bill was introduced in the senate s 3426 and referred to the

of state foreign operations and related programs appropriations bill s 3288 in its bill the senate appropriations committee met the administrations request for funding needed to eliminate the existing 2089 pay differential over two years introduction at time when 55 of us foreign service personnel are serving at hardship andor danger post the 110th congress in its closing days may choose whether and how to address an issue that both the department of state and the foreign service consider to be high priority personnel issue the elimination of 2089 pay difference between service in the washington dc and service abroad for the vast majority of the members of the foreign service below the senior foreign service level the pay difference is the result of federal locality pay laws not covering the salary of federal employees posted abroad while opponents question the need for change in the compensation system because of the other allowances and benefits that foreign service often get when serving abroad proponents for the elimination of the pay difference contend that the disparity has negative implications on the morale of the foreign service considerations about overseas assignments and possibly eventually on retention both the department of state and the american foreign service association afsa the professional association and the recognized crs2 bargaining agent for the foreign service said the elimination of this pay disparity is very important to them1 legislative background in the 109th and 110th congresses during the 109th congress republican and democratic leadership of both the house committee on international relations and the senate committee on foreign relations worked to resolve this pay differential issue by developing proposal called the foreign service compensation reform the administration had agreed to the creation of new foreign service pay compensation system if it were performancebased this proposal developed through negotiations among the house and senate committees the administration and afsa would have 1 placed the foreign service compensation system on payforperformance pfp basis with pay adjustments made only on the basis of performance and not longevity and 2 eliminated the current pay difference by creating new worldwide pay structure at the washington dc salary level over two years2 however reportedly due to concerns among the house floor managers as to whether there was sufficient support for passage3 this proposal was not included in the final version of hr 6060 the department of state authorities act of 2006 which was originally intended to carry the foreign service compensation reform proposal and few other provisions hr 6060 was passed by the house and senate and enacted as pl 109472 for the 110th congress the administration in its fy2009 budget request urged the enactment of legislation creating new performancebased compensation system for the foreign service along the lines of the 109th congress pfp compromise and requested the appropriation of 359 million to implement the first of two phases of the new compensation system on july 16 2008 the senate appropriations committee reported its fy2009 state departmentforeign operations and related programs appropriations legislation s 3288 this bill provided sufficient funding levels to meet the administrations request on the same day the house committee on foreign affairs hcfa favorably reported the foreign service overseas pay equity act of 2008 hr 3202 as amended which without providing for performancebased pay system would eliminate the pay disparity over three years this bill which was introduced by representative chris smith and has 29 cosponsors was referred to both hcfa and 1 steve kashkett afsa state

sfrc on september 23 2008 the sfrc considered and reported s 3426 without amendments foreign service personnel system4 the foreign service personnel system like the civil service system has salary ranges associated with various ranks and within those ranges there are step increases in salary that person can receive over time even without promotion while the administration is seeking changes to the personnel system to make it performancebased foreign service personnel believe that its personnel system is already performancebased system members of the foreign service point to elements of their personnel system such as annual promotion reviews by independent promotion panels instead of by ones supervisor an uporout system with specific time limits for promotions and mandatory five percent low ranking requirement that can lead to separation from the service that they believe makes it performance based former afsa president ambassador j anthony holmes said the reality is that the present fs personnel system with its rankinperson not injob annual evaluations and competitive uporout system is inherently pfp already5 background the foreign service personnel system which is separate and quite different from the civil service system was created under the authorities provided by the foreign service act of 1980 pl 96465 22 usc 3901 et seq in 2008 there are currently about 11500 state department foreign service officers and specialists6 with twothirds of them serving abroad at over 260 posts and 4 the discussion of the foreign service personnel system is basically discussion of the state departments system because most of the foreign service personnel are from the state department all foreign service personnel are covered under the foreign service act of 1980 pl 96465 22 usc 3901 et seq sec 203 of the act compatibility among agencies utilizing the foreign service act personnel system states that agencies utilizing the personnel system established by the act shall administer their personnel system to the extent practicable in manner that will assure maximum compatibility among the agencies 5 j anthony holmes amb presidents views the payforperformanceocp overseas comparability pay tradeoff poisoned chalice or winwin foreign service journal april 2006 p 5 6 at the department of state there are approximately 11500 foreign service officers and specialists of these approximately 6600 are foreign service generalist officers and about 4900 are foreign service specialists foreign service specialists provide wide range of serves from medical support to computer and communications service at us posts and missions abroad there are approximately another 1500 foreign service personnel serving in washington dc and abroad from foreign affairs agencies other than the state department foreign service officers and specialists in the united states agency for international development usaid foreign commercial service fcs officers at the department of commerce foreign agricultural service fas officers with the department of agriculture and those with the broadcasting board of governors because these foreign service personnel from other foreign affairs agencies are also affected by the limitations of locality pay adjustments they too experience the pay difference between service in washington dc and service abroad legislation that would adjust this situation are aimed continued crs4 missions at any one time the remaining third is generally posted in washington dc typically members of the foreign service spend twothirds of their careers abroad serving at each post for one to three years before being assigned elsewhere in the world currently about 55 of foreign service personnel are serving in posts designated as hardship andor danger posts members of the foreign service cannot spend more than six years at time serving in domestic assignments the director general of the foreign service on casebycase basis may provide waiver of up to two years if member of the service seeks to extend his or her stay in the continental united states beyond six years ranks and functions foreign service personnel carry their rankinperson as opposed to rankinposition as the civil service generally does thus member of the foreign service can advance in rank on the merits of his or her performance while member of the civil service often can only advance beyond the rank designated for position by successfully competing for an open position at higher rank grades or ranks within the foreign service are divided into two major categories the senior foreign service sfs of which there are about 600 individuals and the regular service which is comprised of about 10500 officers and specialists the sfs is divided into five pay categories and like the civil service senior executive service ses requires presidential appointment into the senior service the regular foreign service is divided into nine ranks or grades with the 01 level the highest most foreign service officers enter the foreign service at the 05 or 06 levels while some specialists may enter at lower grades generally entering officers serve for four to five years before being tenured and fully commissioned as foreign service officers usually at the 04 rank generalist foreign service officers are assigned to one of five cones upon entry into the foreign service political economic public diplomacy management and consular however during their career they will do assignments outside of their cone promotion system the personnel system for the foreign service is basically an uporout system that reviews the members of the foreign service annually for promotion unless they have been promoted within the previous year promotion panels each usually consisting of four or five higher grade officers and public panelist are formed each year to consider the members of the foreign service at ranks of 04 and above for promotion those foreign service personnel below the 04 rank who are neither tenured nor commissioned receive administrative promotions at the discretion of the director general promotion panels are generally organized to compare individuals in the same rank and cone for instance one promotion panel reviewed 02 political officers and management officers 160 management and 240 political officers7 criteria or precepts for promotion are negotiated between the department and the american foreign service association afsa currently the recognized bargaining agent for the foreign service 6 continued at amending the foreign service act of 1980 and so would eliminate the pay difference for them also 7 david t jones and stephen t smith preparing for promotion panel season foreign service journal may 2004 pp 6164 crs5 promotion panels begin by reviewing the employee evaluation report files which can go back five years or to the previous promotion in most cases there are fewer available open positions than there are individuals determined to be promotable by the panel the panel then rank orders those promotable to fill the slots accordingly after making its promotion decisions the panel makes its recommendations to the secretary of state who reviews and forwards them to the senate the senate has the responsibility of approving the promotion lists developed by the promotion panels and recommended by the secretary of state promotion panels are also required to lowrank five percent of those reviewed for promotion the panel then recommends to the secretary of state whether those individuals should be referred to the performance standards review board for possible separation from the service or should be provided letter for the individuals file instructing the individual to take career counseling8 the personnel system has promotionrequired timeinclass tic limitation of more than 10 to 15 years at one grade without promotion for fs01 through 04 depending upon the grade and seven years limitation at each senior rank for members of the sfs there is also timeinservice tis limitation of 27 years for appointments to the senior foreign service if person exceeds these tic and tis limitations the individual is separated from the foreign service9 because of this system most members of the foreign service leave the service in their mid50s at an 01 or 02 rank after full and distinguished career impact of locality pay law on overseas federal service the federal pay comparability act of 1990 excludes federal employees posted outside the continental united states from receiving locality pay adjustments10 locality pay is designed to create pay comparability between federal employees and nonfederal workers doing the same levels of work within specific geographic locality in the continental united states11 there is basis for comparison of foreign service personnel posted abroad to nonfederal workers in the united states as result foreign service personnel who spend about twothirds of their careers posted abroad receive less salary when they are posted abroad and less of career total than their civil service counterparts who spend career in the united states 8 see sec 231b expedited separation out of the foreign relations authorization act 1998 and 1999 pl 105277 112 stat 2681826 9 see tic and tis rules 3 fam 621333 through 621335 62134 and 62135

compares the rates of pay under the general schedulewith the rates of pay generally paid to nonfederal workers for the same levels of work within each pay locality as determined on the basis of appropriate surveys that shall be conducted by the bureau of labor statistics crs6 each year since 1990 the difference has increased every year and by 2008 an individuals salary was 2089 higher if heshe served in washington dc as opposed to serving abroad proponents of revision to the foreign service system indicated that the gap impacts negatively on morale and the assignments system by providing disincentives for overseas tours they assert that the intent of pay adjustments such as the hardship and danger pay differentials are nullified when locality pay is not counted they point out that if person were to go to 15 hardship post from washington dc assignment heshe would experience 589 decrease in salary why change the compensation system both the administration and the foreign service seek to remove the pay difference issue but they are also motivated by different considerations foreign service perspective to eliminate major pay difference affecting the majority of the foreign service according to 2008 afsa survey the top legislative issue for members of the foreign service is the elimination of the pay disparity that exists between service abroad and service in washington dc which is where most foreign service personnel are domestically assigned12 from the perspective of many in the foreign service it is matter of equity and of recognition of their work as they serve abroad often in difficult and dangerous conditions in 2005 as members of the senior foreign service were reaching retirement statistics showed they were trying to serve in assignments in the continental united states instead of serving abroad and suffering the loss of pay which could affect their retirement savings thus in 2005 the pay difference was eliminated for those in the senior foreign service the compensation system for the senior foreign service changed to formalized payforperformance system with adjustments to salary based solely on performance and the pay levels were brought to the washington dc salary level regardless of where they were posted13 supporters of changing the pay system to cover the entire foreign service and the administration both argue that the pay disparity created an increasing pay disincentive to overseas service as it did for the senior foreign service prior to 200514 further even among the foreign service serving at the same post only mid and juniorranked personnel would suffer the pay gap while those in the senior foreign service and those detailed to an embassy would not because the pay difference exists for only those foreign service personnel posted abroad who are at the rank of 01 and below 12 steve kashkett afsa opinion poll results op cit 13 sec 402a salaries of senior foreign service members of pl 96465 the foreign

midlevel officers to hardship posts also noted the impact of the pay difference as deterrent to bidding for hardship assignments officers and state personnel we interviewed both at hardship posts and in washington dc consistently cited the lack of locality pay as deterrent to bidding at hardship positions in 2002 we reported that the differences in the statutes governing domestic locality pay and differential pay for overseas service had created gap in compensation penalizing overseas employees this gap grows every year as domestic locality pay rates increase creating an ever increasing financial disincentive for overseas employees to bid on hardship posts after accounting for domestic locality pay for washington dc 25 percent hardship post differential is eroded to approximately 8 percent as estimated in our 2002 report differential pay incentives for the 15 percent differential hardship posts are now less than the locality pay for washington dc which is currently 17 percent and can be expected to soon surpass the 20 percent differential hardship posts15 administration perspective to correct the pay difference and move another element of the federal service to full payforperformance personnel system the george w bush administration in its fy2009 budget requested 359 million for the department of state to fund the first step of transition to performancebased system and global rate of pay for foreign service personnel at grades of 01 and below the administration seeks to have these changes made in manner agreed upon during the 109th congress the foreign service compensation reform proposal16 the administration has made such funding requests since fy2007 to eliminate longevitybased pay increases and institute strictly payfor performance system similar to that instituted for the senior foreign service in pl 10844717 the proposal would equalize the proposed global rate with equivalent salary levels in washington dc which includes locality pay over the past few years the bush administration contended that the current gs pay framework is failure it maintained that the one size fits all approach of the gs pay schedule can mask dramatic disparities in the market value of different federal jobs and uses onthejob longevity as substitute for performance18 the administration had once proposed repealing the current gs schedule by 2010 and replacing it with system of occupational pay groups pay bands within those 15 us government accountability office department of state staffing and foreign language shortfalls persist despite initiatives to

dhs21 these personnel systems were challenged in the courts by federal employee unions and now the changes are currently being made in only parts of the dod thus while agreeing that the foreign service pay difference should be eliminated the administration continues to urge that these changes should be made in the context of payforperformance basis that would replace the current longevitybased system22 because of the changes in the congress following the 2006 elections the drive to move the civil service system and the foreign service system to being performancebased as envisioned by the administration did not achieve majority support in the congress foreign service overseas pay equity act of 2008 summary of hr 3202 as amended and s 3426 foreign service overseas pay

relations authorization act fiscal year 2003 congress established system of computing the annuity of foreign service personnel serving abroad to be as if heshe were serving in washington dc this system commonly referred to as virtual locality pay was developed so that the individual would not be negatively affected in the annuity computation because of lower salary that did not include locality pay however because the individual serving overseas would have the those years computed as if heshe were serving in washington that individuals contribution to the foreign service retirement system also would have to be at level as if the individual were serving in washington24 the conforming amendments of section 2 make adjustments to the foreign service retirement systems by eliminating the virtual locality pay system when the foreign service overseas salary level reached the washington dc level with locality pay the virtual locality pay system would not be required the virtual locality paysystem was instituted because as the locality pay disparity became larger it created an incentive for foreign service personnel approaching retirement to seek assignment to washington dc as opposed to going abroad as person approached retirement the lower salary levels received because of the pay disparity for service abroad would negatively affect annuity computations at time when person would want to have the highest salary levels possible for the foreign service these levels would be achieved by serving in washington dc an examination of assignment bids among those approaching retirement at that time showed that this was in fact happening the conference report accompanying the legislation explains foreign service officers serving overseas do not receive locality pay thus as they near retirement they have significant financial incentive to seek assignment to washington dc this often deprives overseas posts of the more experienced officers under this section an officer while serving overseas will have his or her annuity calculated as if he or she were actually receiving locality pay25 sec 3 death gratuity the foreign service act of 1980 currently authorizes the secretary of state to provide at the secretarys discretion death gratuity to the survivors of any foreign service employee who dies as result of injuries sustained in the performance of the employees duty abroad the amount of the death gratuity is equal to the employees annual salary at the time of death this section amends the current death gratuity provision in two ways the death

september 17 2008 the congressional budget office cbo issued cost estimate for the foreign service overseas pay equity act of 2008 hr 3202s 342628 the administration in its february 2008 budget requested funds to eliminate the pay disparity in two steps instead of three as proposed by hr 3202 and s 3426 the administration estimates that it would cost about 359 million in the first year and 1529 million budget authority ba to fully eliminate the pay difference29 the cbo estimates that the direct cost of adjusting the pay difference as proposed by hr 3202s 3426 would be 148 million in ba or 126 million in outlays o30 because the adjustment would be accomplished over three years the estimated cost for fy2009 would be 49 million ba or 42 million which is onethird of the estimated total

embassy in nairobi kenya was bombed in 1998 more than 220 people were killed among those killed were 12 american us government employees and family members and 32 kenyan national employees of the us

have sought to change the compensation system of the regular nonsenior foreign service personnel to eliminate the pay disparity between service abroad and service in washington dc some members congressional staff and others engaged in this discussion also are aware that foreign service personnel serving abroad often get allowances and benefits for being abroad for example if member of the foreign service were to serve in mexico city mexico the person would receive hardship differential of 15 of base salary 20 cost of living allowance 20 of an amount determined by mexico city shopping basket an annual education allowance for each child and quarters allowance to cover rent and utilities the amount for the allowance is based upon the grade of the foreign service member these allowances and benefits can change from posttopost even within the same country34 further if the member of the foreign service for personal reasons goes to the post by himherself the family will receive separate maintenance allowance these economic questions as well as the questions of equity recognition of the work of the foreign service impact upon the morale assignments process and possibly retention are often weighed against each other as members and their staff consider this issue is this pay raise many view this proposed compensation system as pay raise for the foreign service and ask why salaries should be increased when foreign service personnel already receive so many benefits supporters for the change state that this is not pay raise but rather correction of 14 years of unintended inequity that is growing every year in the overseas compensation for the foreign service they argue that ending this pay difference 32 ibid pp 23 33 ibid p 3 cbo estimates one year total in death gratuities of 500000 and five year total from fy2009fy2013 of 1 million these number could suggest higher five year total than the 1 million in the report 34 see the office of allowances website department of state washington dc httpaopralsstategovweb920location_actionaspmenuhide1countrycode1059 crs12 would help validate the work the foreign service does including the significant efforts and sacrifices that they and their families make in service to the united states35 is locality pay justified since foreign service already receive many benefits while serving overseas in many posts abroad foreign service personnel receive posthardship differential of 5 35 of base pay costofliving allowance an education allowance for their children and housing allowance these can add significantly to the base salary level providing locality pay for those serving abroad would increase the compensation levels the lack of locality pay is longer matter of retirement benefits because the virtual locality pay for retirement computation in current law already takes care of the impact on an annuity those who question the need for this change argue that the foreign service is already well taken care of when they serve abroad those who support eliminating the pay differential contend that the allowances exist to address specific costs and hardships unique to working for long years overseas danger pay compensates for the extreme risks of living in country wracked by war terrorism political violence or endemic lawlessness education allowances make it possible for foreign service members to cover their childrens education when viable public schools are available costofliving allowances help defray the cost of food and other daily needs of life in countries where those things are vastly more expensive than in the united states these were never meant to obviate the need for the basic locality pay adjustment that all other federal employees get36 since the foreign service receives free housing when serving abroad and they often own home in the united states which they can rent and build equity should they also get locality pay equivalent because one of the biggest benefits that members of the foreign service receive is free housing when posted abroad many believe that this should compensate for any loss derived from the lack of locality pay these critics point out that if foreign service personnel own home in the united states they would be able to rent it out while they are gone and build equity while the government takes care of their living quarters for free they ask if the locality pay adjustment is really necessary 35 the american foreign service association creating pay equity q discussion piece 2008 36 steve
