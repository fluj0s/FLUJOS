implementation updated september 19 2006 curtis w copeland specialist in american national government government and finance division congressional research service the library of congress the information quality act ombs guidance and initial implementation summary the information quality act iqa sometimes referred to as the data quality act was enacted in december 2000 as section 515 of the treasury and general government appropriations act for fiscal year 2001 pl 106554 the act required the office of management and budget omb to issue guidance to federal agencies designed to ensure the quality objectivity utility and integrity of information disseminated to the public it also required agencies to issue their own information quality guidelines and to establish administrative mechanisms that allow affected persons to seek correction of information maintained and disseminated by the agencies that does not comply with the omb guidance although some observers said the iqa would improve the quality of agency information others viewed the act as tool by which regulated parties could slow or even stop new health safety and environmental standards because of the scant legislative history of the iqa and its lack of detail ombs guidance interpreting key provisions in the act has major effect on its implementation in those guidelines omb noted that the act applies to virtually all federal agencies and established the broad scope of the guidelines by defining information as any communication or representation of knowledge such as facts or data in any medium or form similarly the guidelines define dissemination as any agency initiated or sponsored distribution of information to the public omb indicated that quality encompasses elements of utility objectivity and integrity and said agencies can generally presume that data are objective if they have been subject to an independent peer review process in december 2005 omb provided congress with report on the implementation of the iqa during fy2003 and fy2004 the report said the agencies received only 85 substantive iqarelated correction requests during those two fiscal years but noted that the agencies received many other requests that were similar to those received before the iqa of the 85 requests 45 were initially denied by the agencies of these 28 were subsequently appealed with 13 of those appeals denied by the end of fy2004 in august 2006 the government accountability office gao reported that better oversight and guidance by omb were needed gaos comments as well as comments from omb and others suggest several possible areas for improvement of the iqas implementation major test of the iqa may be whether agencies denials of information correction requests are subject to judicial review in march 2006 the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit ruled that the act does not permit judicial review two district courts had previously reached similar conclusion and the department of justice issued brief stating that the iqa does not permit judicial review this report will be updated in the event of significant developments in the administration judicial interpretation or

observations 21 possible improvements and modifications 22 the iqa and peer review 23 the information quality act ombs guidance and initial implementation in recent years both the volume and the types of information that federal agencies disseminate to the public have increased dramatically some forms of information dissemination are direct agencies provide the public with data on such issues as agricultural production labor trends population changes criminal justice activities and environmental emissions other forms of information dissemination are more indirect in that the information forms the basis of agencies regulations or other policies for example on the basis of information derived from scientific research regulatory agencies may decide to permit or ban the introduction of new drug reduce the levels of exposure to particular pesticide or change the way that automobiles are manufactured in both forms of dissemination it is important that the underlying data be of sufficient quality to ensure accurate information and to support sound decision making in december 2000 congress passed and the president signed the treasury and general government appropriations act for fiscal year 2001 pl 106554 section 515 of that more than 700page bill has subsequently been referred to as the data quality act or the information quality act iqa codified at 44 usc 3504d1 and 3516 although little noticed at the time the iqa has subsequently been the subject of intense debate and controversy the act required the office of management and budget omb to issue guidance to federal agencies designed to ensure the quality objectivity utility and integrity of information disseminated to the public it also required agencies to issue their own information quality guidelines and to establish administrative mechanisms that allow affected persons to seek correction of information maintained and disseminated by the agencies that does not comply with the omb guidance this report describes the iqa and ombs and the agencies information quality guidelines noting how several key terms are defined how riskrelated information is to be treated and how agencies correction processes should be established the report also reviews ombs report on the first year of the iqas implementation focusing on the correction requests received during that period and how they were resolved it also describes critical comment on that report by nongovernmental organization finally this report examines the issue of judicial review and the iqa and explores some suggested improvements and modifications to the acts implementation the act and related issues the iqa amended the paperwork reduction act pra of 1995 44 usc chapter 35 which already required omb to develop and oversee the crs2 implementation of policies principles standards and guidelines to apply to federal agency dissemination of public information the pra also required agencies to manage their information resources to improve the integrity quality and utility of information to all users within and outside the agency1 also already in place were variety of nonstatutory requirements related to information dissemination eg omb circular a130 on management of federal information resources therefore the iqa can be seen as an extension of these previous statutory and nonstatutory requirements representative jo ann emerson is generally regarded as the primary sponsor of the iqa2 the act in its entirety reads as follows in general the director of the office of management and budget shall by not later than september 30 2001 and with public and federal agency involvement issue guidelines under sections 3504d1 and 3516 of title 44 united states code that provide policy and procedural guidance to federal agencies for ensuring and maximizing the quality objectivity utility and integrity of information including statistical information disseminated by federal agencies in fulfillment of the purposes and provisions of chapter 35 of title 44 united states code commonly referred to as the paperwork reduction act b content of guidelines the guidelines under subsection shall 1 apply to the sharing by federal agencies of and access to information disseminated by federal agencies and 2 require that each federal agency to which the guidelines apply issue guidelines ensuring and maximizing the quality objectivity utility and integrity of information including statistical information disseminated by the agency by not later than 1 year after the date of issuance of the guidelines under subsection b establish administrative mechanisms allowing affected persons to seek and obtain correction of information maintained and disseminated by the agency that does not comply with the guidelines issued under subsection and c report periodically to the director i the number and nature of complaints received by the agency regarding the accuracy of information disseminated by the agency and ii how such complaints were handled as noted previously these provisions were inserted as section 515 of the more than 700page treasury and general government appropriations act for fiscal year 2001 there were hearings or debates specifically on these provisions and committee reports were filed however omb had previously been urged by individual members or committees to develop similar guidance on several previous 1 44 usc 3506b1c 2 some press reports attribute the iqa to jim tozzi former omb official who is currently head of the center for regulatory effectiveness the center describes itself on its website as receiving financial support services in kind and work product from trade associations and private firms and says its primary goals are to ensure that 1 the public has access to information used to develop federal regulations and 2 information that federal agencies disseminate to the public is of the highest quality see httpwwwthecrecom crs3 occasions3 in response to these suggestions in april 2000 omb said that its circular a130 already established complaint resolution procedures and also said the following at the present time omb is not convinced that new onesizefitsall rules will add much to the existing omb guidance and oversight activity and the procedures followed by individual agencies we are reluctant to issue more regulations without clear sense that they would be useful in promoting data quality we are also concerned that new regulations might prove counterproductive to the goal of increasing data quality in that the administrative requirements could consume significant agency resources4 however with the passage of the iqa in december 2000 omb was obligated to develop the required information quality guidance5 initial assessments of the iqa supporters of the iqa many of whom represent businesses and other regulated parties considered it an extremely important tool to oversee the work of rulemaking agencies in fact the us chamber of commerce6 said the act was the most significant change to the federal rulemaking process since the administrative procedure act was enacted more than 50 years ago and said it would have revolutionary impact on the regulatory process these supporters contended that the iqa and the resultant omb and agency guidelines would improve the quality of agency science and regulation and force agencies to regulate based on the best science available some of these proponents also maintained that the act would help agencies defend their regulations against lawsuits and would reduce the number of lawsuits filed critics of the iqa and the guidelines including many environmental and public interest groups such as omb watch7 and public citizen8 said the law was tool by which regulated parties can slow and possibly stop new health safety and environmental standards and that could lead to the revision or elimination of existing 3 see for example the house report on the treasury postal service and general government appropriations bill 1999 hrept 105592 p 49 4 letter from john t spotilla administrator of oira to the honorable jo ann emerson april 18 2000 available at httpthecrecomquality20041012_letterhtm 5 omb representatives told crs on dec 9 2004 that the agency could have issued guidelines on information quality even if the iqa had not been enacted 6 the chamber of commerce describes itself on its website as the worlds largest notfor profit business federation see httpwwwuschamberorg 7 omb watch describes itself on its website as nonprofit research and advocacy organization dedicated to promoting government accountability and citizen participation in public policy decisions see httpwwwombwatchorg 8 public citizen describes itself on its website as national nonprofit consumer advocacy organization founded in 1971 to represent consumer interests in congress the executive branch and the courts see httpwwwcitizenorg crs4 standards they contended that the act could have chilling effect on agency distribution and use of scientific information these critics foresaw flood of data quality challenges correction requests and court suits on wide range of scientific issues which could tie up agency resources and significantly delay health safety and environmental regulations critics have also noted that since quality is subjective term and some regulations are based on best available data regulations could be arbitrarily rejected under the iqa or may never be developed at all because of concerns about running afoul of the act9 the iqa and the shelby amendment the iqa should not be confused with an earlier provision popularly known as the shelby amendment which was twosentence rider attached to the treasury and postal section of the omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act for fy1999 pl 105277 enacted on october 21 1998 the shelby amendment was the culmination of twoyear effort to make federally funded research data which are often used to develop new regulations accessible to the public the provision directed omb to amend omb circular a110 to require federal awarding agencies to ensure that all data produced under an award will be made available to the public through the procedures established under the freedom of information act foia codified at 5 usc 552 ombs revisions to the circular took effect in november 199910 as result of the changes in response to covered foia request agencies are required to obtain certain types of research data from grantees and provide the requester access to the data11 omb views the shelby amendment and the iqa as compatible and mutually enforcing in that they promote public access to quality government information ombs information quality guidelines because of the scant legislative history of the iqa and its lack of detail ombs guidance interpreting key provisions in the act has major effect on its implementation omb published proposed governmentwide iqa guidelines in the federal register on june 28 2001 66 federal register 34489 and published final guidelines with request for further comments on certain points on september 28 2001 66 federal register 49718 omb later republished the guidelines after making changes pursuant to public comments on february 22 2002 67 federal 9 for discussion of this issue see rick weiss data quality law is nemesis of regulation washington post aug 16 2004 p a1 10 office of management and budget omb circular a110 uniform administrative requirements for grants and agreements with institutions of higher education hospitals and other nonprofit organizations 64 federal register 54926 oct 8 1999 11 for thorough discussion of the shelby amendment and omb circular a110 see crs report rl30376 public access to data from federally funded research omb circular a110 and issues for congress by eric fischer and genevieve j knezo crs5 register 845212 omb noted that the guidelines apply to all federal agencies that are subject to the paperwork reduction act cabinet departments independent regulatory agencies eg the federal communications commission and other independent agencies eg the environmental protection agency or epa agencies not subject to the pra and therefore not covered by the iqa or ombs guidelines are the government accountability office gao the federal election commission and governmentowned contractoroperated facilities eg laboratories engaged in national defense research and production activities general requirements the omb guidelines describe omb and agency responsibilities under the act including agency reporting requirements for example the guidelines note that the iqa essentially requires covered agencies to do three things 1 issue their own guidelines by october 1 2002 2 establish administrative mechanisms allowing affected persons to seek correction of information that they believe does not comply with these guidelines and 3 report periodically to omb on the number and nature of the complaints that the agencies received the guidelines also require the agencies to designate the chief information officer or some other official to be responsible for agency compliance and required them to develop agencyspecific guidelines and administrative correction mechanisms omb said the agencies must permit the public to comment on their guidelines and correction mechanisms and then must submit them to omb for review before publishing them in final form omb also said the report on the number and nature of complaints received should be done on fiscal year basis with the first such report due to omb on january 1 2004 definition of key terms the omb guidelines also define number of key terms that are undefined in the iqa and those definitions have had significant effect on how the act is implemented omb said quality encompasses elements of utility objectivity and integrity the definitions of some of these and other terms are relatively straightforward and noncontroversial for example omb defined utility as the usefulness of the information to its intended users and said integrity refers to the security of information protection of the information from unauthorized access or revision to ensure that the information is not compromised through corruption or falsification the definitions of other terms such as information dissemination and objectivity have proven to be much more controversial because they establish the scope and applicability of the guidelines stricter quality standards apply to influential information so the definition of that term is also important information omb established the broad scope of the act by defining information in the guidelines as any communication or representation of knowledge such as facts or data in any medium or form omb went on to say that the definition includes information that the agency disseminates through its web page but does not include hyperlinks to information that other organizations 12 for copy of the omb guidelines see httpwwwwhitehousegovombfedreg reproducible2pdf crs6 disseminate neither does covered information include individuals opinions that the agency makes clear are neither factual nor the agencys views dissemination the iqa only applies to information that is disseminated by federal agencies so the definition of that word also has major effect on the acts scope of coverage the omb guidelines define dissemination as agency initiated or sponsored distribution of information to the public therefore to understand dissemination one must understand the terms agency initiated and agency sponsored agency initiated the guidelines make it clear that an agency can initiate the distribution of information either directly or indirectly cited as examples of agency initiated disseminations are 1 risk assessment prepared by the agency to inform the agencys formulation of possible regulatory or other action and 2 information prepared by an outside party and disseminated by an agency in manner that reasonably suggests that the agency agrees with the information in this regard omb said that thirdparty study used by an agency in support of notice of proposed rulemaking is also covered by the iqa others contend however that this position runs counter to the approach taken in the pra which the iqa amends which suggests that information in notice of proposed rulemaking is information that is used or accessed by the public not information that is disseminated by an agency and therefore would not be covered by the iqa agency sponsored omb said an agency has sponsored an information dissemination if it directs third party to distribute information or if an agency has the authority to review and approve it before it is distributed the guidelines go on to say however that dissemination does not include distributions that are limited to government employees contractors or grantees interagency or intraagency use or sharing of government information responses to requests for information under foia the privacy act or the federal advisory committee act or correspondence with individuals press releases or public filings objectivity the omb guidelines state that objectivity is function of both presentation ie whether the information is presented in an accurate clear complete and unbiased manner and substance ie whether the information is accurate reliable and unbiased omb indicated that agencies can presume that data are sufficiently objective if they have been subject to an independent peer review process eg as used by scientific journals but member of the public can rebut this presumption based on persuasive showing by the petitioner in particular instance influential information additional iqa obligations apply to scientific financial or statistical information that is influential omb representatives told crs during the preparation of this report that agencies were given substantial discretion in how this term is defined because onesizefitsall approach would have been inappropriate13 for example the guidelines define the word influential 13 meeting with representatives of ombs office of information and regulatory affairs continued crs7 in this context as information that the agency can reasonably determine will have or does have clear and substantial impact on important public policies or important private sector decisions when disseminated to the public omb authorized the covered agencies to define influential in ways appropriate for them but indicated that the data and analytic results related to influential information should meet certain reproducibility and transparency standards specifically omb said that agency guidelines should generally require sufficient transparency about data and methods that an independent reanalysis could be undertaken by qualified member of the public and would generate similar results critics however have questioned how agencies are to know in advance of dissemination when information will be influential or what constitutes an important public policy risk information when agencies disseminate information related to the analysis of risks to human health safety and the environment the omb guidelines require agencies to adopt or adapt the quality principles that congress established in the safe drinking water act amendments of 1996 42 usc 300g1b3a and b when basing actions under this act on science the amendments require epa to use the best available peerreviewed science and supporting studies conducted in accordance with sound and objective scientific practices and to use data collected by accepted methods or best available methods when presenting risk information to the public concerning safe drinking water the amendments also require epa where practicable to identify central estimate of risk for specific populations upper bound and lowerbound estimates of risk and each significant uncertainty identified in the process of the assessment omb said that through these amendments congress adopted basic quality standard for the dissemination of public information about risks of adverse health effects however critics have questioned whether it is appropriate for ombs guidelines to export risk analysis principles established for the safe drinking water act to agency actions under other environmental health and safety statutes correction mechanisms ombs data quality guidelines also generally describe the administrative mechanisms that agencies are required to establish to allow affected persons to seek and obtain correction of information maintained and disseminated by the agency that does not comply with the guidelines specifically the guidelines state that the mechanisms should be flexible appropriate to the nature and timeliness of the disseminated information and incorporated into agency information resources management and administrative practices they go on to say that the agencies must make decisions within appropriate time periods and must notify the affected persons of any corrections made agencies also must establish an administrative appeal process to review the agencies initial decisions and must specify appropriate time limits for the resolution of requests for reconsideration the preamble to the guidelines indicates that to ensure objectivity the office that 13 continued dec 9 2004 crs8 originally disseminates the information should not have responsibility for both the initial response and resolution of disagreement correction requests and the apa differences of opinion exist regarding the relation of these administrative mechanisms and the commenting process under the administrative procedure act apa14 some contend that the apa process already provides mechanism by which the affected public can seek correction of information relied on in rulemaking so additional correction process is needed others believe that the mechanisms contemplated in the iqa are in addition to the apa commenting process omb representatives told crs during this review that agencies should handle correction requests submitted during the public comment period for rule through the apa commenting process15 after the comment period is over though omb said that members of the affected public who were dissatisfied with how their correction requests were handled through the apa process could appeal the agencys decision through the agencys iqa administrative appeal process posting of correction requests on august 30 2004 omb instructed agencies to post their information quality correction requests for fy2004 and for subsequent years on publiclyavailable web pages16 specifically omb said agencies should include copy of each correction request the agencys formal responses and any communications regarding appeals in addition for each request omb recommended that agencies provide few sentences describing the request and any subsequent response omb said the information should be disclosed by december 1 2004 agency guidelines as noted previously the iqa required each covered agency to issue its own information quality guidelines within one year of the issuance of the omb guidelines to develop their guidelines the agencies reportedly used the omb guidelines as starting point obtained comments from the public on their proposed guidelines and submitted the draft final guidelines to omb for review and comment on october 4 2002 omb indicated that it had completed its review of agencies draft information quality guidelines and laid out series of steps designed to guide 14 the apa 5 usc 551 et seq is the most longstanding and broadly applicable set of rulemaking requirements the act generally requires agencies to publish notice of proposed rulemaking in the federal register allow public comments and after considering the comments publish final rule 15 meetings with representatives from ombs office of information and regulatory affairs sept 15 2004 and dec 9 2004 the omb representatives said that correction requests submitted during other types of comment periods should be handled the same way 16 for copy of this memorandum see httpwwwwhitehousegovombinforeg info_quality_posting_083004pdf omb said it hoped agencies would eventually post information quality correspondence for fy2003 as well crs9 and oversee agencies implementation of their guidelines17 for example omb requested that the agencies provide the office with copies of certain types of complaints eg those involving major policy questions that are likely to be of interest to more than one agency and asked to be invited to any meetings with outside parties concerning those complaints omb has published agencies guidelines on its website although it cautioned the public that the list is not complete and will be updated as more guidelines are posted online18 in that listing cabinet departments often provided overall guidelines as well as guidelines for major subunits within the departments for example the department of agriculture provided guidelines for all of the department as well as guidelines for the agricultural research service the food safety and inspection service the forest service and six other agencies or offices within the department however separate iqa guidelines are not listed for some major agencies within cabinet departments for example separate guidelines are not listed for some major regulatory agencies within the department of labor eg the occupational safety and health administration and the mine safety and health administration or the department of transportation eg the federal highway administration or the national highway traffic safety administration omb representatives said that it was up to the departments and agencies to determine how their guidelines would be presented on this website19 concerns have also been raised regarding certain agencies iqa guidelines in november 2004 gao reported that the census bureau had issued information quality guidelines that contain general quality goals and principles and had also issued new standard that allows individuals to request corrections20 however with the exception of this standard gao said that the bureau did not provide specific guidelines or procedures on the implementation of the general principles articulated in the information quality guidelines gao recommended that the bureau accelerate its efforts to establish comprehensive data quality standards and include the implementation of those standards in its plans for the 2010 census also in an august 2006 report gao reported that the department of homeland security dhs did not have departmentlevel guidelines covering its 22 component agencies and that 44 of 86 independent agencies had not posted guidelines on their websites and may not have them in place21 as result gao said users of 17 for copy of this memo see httpwwwwhitehousegovombinforegpmc_graham_ 100402pdf 18 for copies of the agencies information quality guidelines see httpwwwwhitehouse govombinforegagency_info_quality_linkshtml 19 meeting with representatives from ombs office of information and regulatory affairs sept 15 2004 20 us government accountability office data quality census bureau needs to accelerate efforts to develop and implement data quality review standards gao0586 washington nov 17 2004 21 us government accountability office information quality act expanded oversight continued crs10 information from these agencies may not know whether agencies have guidelines or know how to request correction of information also of the 19 cabinet departments and agencies that had guidelines in 15 of the agencies the online information was difficult to locate gao recommended that omb work with dhs and other agencies without guidelines to ensure that they fulfill their iqa responsibilities and clarify its guidance to agencies on improving the publics access to iqa information ombs 2004 report on iqa implementation the iqa required agencies to report periodically to omb on the information quality complaints they received but the act did not require that omb report to congress on its implementation subsequently though reporting requirement was established the conference report on hr 2673 the consolidated appropriations act of 2004 indicated that the conferees were concerned that agencies are not complying fully with the requirements of the iqa and directed omb to submit report to the house and senate committees on appropriations by june 1 2004 on whether agencies had been properly responsive to public requests for correction of information pursuant to the iqa22 the conference report also said that omb should suggest changes to the act or to ombs guidelines to improve the accuracy and transparency of agency science on april 30 2004 omb provided report to congress on the implementation of the iqa during fy2003 omb said the report was based on two types of information 1 the reports that the act required agencies to provide to omb by january 1 2004 on the correction requests that they received and 2 the experiences and insights from omb staff who have worked with the agencies overall omb said the number of substantive correction requests that the agencies responded to were relatively small and said it was premature to make broad statements about both the impact of the correction request process and the overall responsiveness of the agencies omb also said that it was not prepared to make suggestions for legislative changes at this point in time but did make several recommendations to improve the administration of the act specifically omb said that agencies should 1 consider putting their correction requests on publicly available web pages as some agencies have already done 2 work harder to improve the timeliness of their responses 3 ensure that they have sufficient scientific and technical staff to respond to the requests 4 consult with omb earlier in the response process and 5 work on guidance that they can use to determine which requests are influential 21 continued and clearer guidance by the office of management and budget could improve agencies implementation of the act gao06765 aug 23 2006 22 implementation of the federal data quality act congressional record daily edition vol 149 nov 25 2003 p h12699 crs11 preconceptions omb said that several of the preconceptions regarding the acts implementation did not appear to be correct23 for example omb said that although some assumed that certain agencies would be overwhelmed by the volume of iqa correction requests only about 35 substantive requests appeared to have been stimulated by the act during its first year of implementation of these 35 requests more than half were received by epa the department of health and human services and the department of the interior omb said the agencies classified eight of the requests as influential 15 as noninfluential and 12 as undetermined24 many other information correction requests that the agencies had commonly received before the iqa was enacted were received via the agencies iqa websites and email addresses and handled through the iqa process for example omb said that of the 24618 requests received governmentwide the federal emergency management agency received 24433 requests to correct maps used in the flood insurance program and the department of transportation received 89 requests to correct individual data items on the federal motor carrier safety administration reports omb said that although some expected the information quality correction process to be used only by industry the requests during the first year of implementation came from all segments of society eg private citizens corporations farm groups and liberal and conservative nongovernmental organizations however omb did not provide any summary data regarding the number of requests by source25 omb representatives told crs during the preparation of this report that some public interest groups made conscious decision not to submit correction requests26 omb said other preimplementation concerns were that the iqa would slow down the rulemaking process and reduce the issuance of agency information the report said however that there was evidence that the act had affected either the pace or length of 23 for copy of this report see httpwwwwhitehousegovombinforegfy03_info_ quality_rptpdf 24 omb some agencies were reluctant to classify requests as influential because of concerns from legal staff lack of clarity regarding how the word is defined and the potential implications of classifying correction request as influential 25 ombs report did contain an appendix listing the correction requests that the agencies received including the names of the requesters therefore readers could use this raw data to determine the most frequent types of requesters 26 meeting with representatives from ombs office of information and regulatory affairs dec 9 2004 crs12 rulemaking or that agencies information dissemination had diminished omb said it was relying on its own perceptions of these issues and did not indicate that it had attempted to systematically collect those data also omb said that agencies discovered that it took longer than expected to respond to correction requests and to implement the appeals process in particular omb noted that some of the larger agencies found it difficult to locate the correct specialist and ensure that heshe has enough time to devote to the request finally omb said that although the expectation was that the iqa was aimed primarily at federal rulemaking most of the correction requests received during fy2003 were directed at reports notices and agency web pages not regulations omb also noted though that these disseminations may ultimately lead to federal state or local rules complications on the other hand omb also said that the implementation of the iqa had some complications in particular omb said that it discovered that the notion of what constitutes dissemination is not straightforward for example the report indicated that agencies have had to determine whether regional office employee making an oral statement at public meeting or responding to citizen via email constituted dissemination of information in some cases requests for correction were denied because of how the term was defined for example in correction request to the forest service within the department of agriculture the complainant requested correction of document entitled guidance criteria for determining the effects of ongoing grazing and issuing term grazing permits on selected threatened and endangered species and species proposed for listing and proposed and designated critical habitat specifically the complainant contended that certain information in that guidance did not incorporate other information published by the forest service thereby rendering it inaccurate and incomplete the forest service denied the request stating that the data did not meet the definition of disseminated under either the department of agriculture or the omb data quality guidelines27 omb also said that correction requests often hinge on the interpretations of science or analyses and that several reasonable inferences could be drawn when dealing with uncertain scientific issues the report noted that most nonfrivolous correction requests had been denied because the agencies interpretations were defended as reasonable and said the requests might have been better focused if they had addressed the inadequate treatment of uncertainty rather than the accuracy of information 27 although not presented in the omb report the forest services response to this correction request indicated that the guidance was primarily intended for internal and interagency use and had only been sent to few members of the public crs13 finally omb said that although most of the agency guidelines indicate that correction requests will typically be responded to within 60 to 90 days many of the agencies eg epa and the departments of agriculture health and human services and transportation were taking significantly longer to respond in particular omb said it took the agencies more than five months to respond to eight of the requests omb said that it expected future requests to be processed and responded to more quickly now that the agencies have processed their first data quality requests disposition of requests omb said that 16 of the 35 substantive requests for correction were appealed and six of those appeals were still pending at the end of fy2003 although many of the requests for correction were initially denied by the agencies eg because the agencies believed the information already met the acts requirements or because the agencies said the information subject to the complaint was not covered by the iqa many of these and other requests resulted in full or partial corrective actions by the agencies for example the chemical products corporation cpc requested that an abstract of draft technical report be removed from national toxicology program ntp website because sample tested in the studies included in the report contained contaminant that rendered the report invalid28 ntp initially added information about the contaminant to the website but on appeal the agency decided to remove the abstract entirely the response to the appeal also indicated that additional information from ongoing work would eventually be incorporated into revised abstract and technical report which would be submitted for peer review and subsequent publication cpc also asked epa to reconsider the oral reference dose for barium because it believed an objective scientific evaluation would determine different critical effect epa initially rejected the request but later decided to revise the information for barium to include more explicit and transparent analysis of data from animals and to conduct an independent peer review of the revision an attorney asked epa to stop disseminating the 1986 guidance for preventing asbestos disease among auto mechanics commonly called the gold book and to post statement on the agencys website that the guidance is longer scientifically current or to update the gold book the agency said that it was in the process of updating the gold book and would include note in both hard copy and electronic versions of the current document that the update was underway 28 the ntp within the department of health and human services is an interagency program headquartered at the national institutes of healths national institute of environmental health sciences in research triangle park north carolina crs14 maritime industry consultant requested that the maritime administration within the department of transportation either correct or remove study showing the mileage of inland barges or provide supporting documentation the maritime administration decided to remove the study from its website and recognized that more uptodate study was needed several environmental groups requested that the forest service reopen the comment period for december 2002 proposed rule on national forest system land and resource management planning because the review that the service conducted was not readily available to the public in an understandable format the forest service provided the groups with the requested information and made it available to the public on its website and said the agency was still in the process of considering comments on the rule in one case an aquaculture business asked the department of commerces national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa to correct its and the department of the interiors fish and wildlife services reliance on studies used to specify conditions under which permits would be issued for aquaculture projects engaged in the rearing of salmon although the correction request and initial appeals were denied the requesters ultimately indicated they would not continue to appeal because their concerns had been addressed the omb report indicated that the business viewed this outcome as mutually beneficial and said the company appreciated the agencies responsiveness requests on minor issues as omb mentioned in its report many of the iqa correction requests listed in the offices report for fy2003 involved relatively minor information quality issues that the agencies easily addressed for example request to the department of labors occupational safety and health administration osha asked that the name of trade association be corrected from american dental hygiene association to the american dental hygienists association other oshadirected requests were to correct reference to table number in its regulations to add text and figures to another rule to correct the standard industrial classification code for company and to correct the date of publication of an epa pamphlet request to the civil rights division of the department of justice noted that the character set used for the vietnamese translation of brochure on voting rights was incorrect request to the centers for disease control and prevention within the department of health and human services asked for redirection of link on the cdc website to general rather than technical information on gonorrhea crs15 many of the requests to the national archives and records administration nara were to correct minor errors such as 1 misidentification of individuals in photograph of president nixon and elvis presley 2 incorrect identification of the name of john glenns spacecraft and 3 the wrong birthday for 19th century west point cadet although determining whether requested correction is minor is inherently subjective nearly half of the correction requests listed in ombs report appeared to be of this nature for some of the agencies eg osha and nara virtually all of their correction requests appeared to be minor other iqa requests several of the correction requests included in the omb report did not appear to be handled by the agencies in the same manner or did not appear to be the types of requests that the omb guidelines seemed to have contemplated for example in some cases the agencies treated requests for the addition of information as data quality request with the agencies sometimes acceding to those requests and other times denying them for example the american heart association asked that osha add paragraph to its guidelines for first aid programs mentioning that the association provides training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the use of automated external defibrillators osha agreed to do so in another case the chamber of commerce requested that epa revise the minutes of an october 2002 meeting of the executive committee of the science advisory board to include comment made by the chairman of the committee epa denied the request stating that documents generated and published by federal advisory committee act committees are not considered epa information disseminations and are therefore not subject to the iqa correction request process in this epa science advisory board case and several other cases agencies denied correction requests as being outside of the scope of the iqa but nevertheless included those requests and denials in their iqa reports for example the competitive enterprise institute requested that noaa within the department of commerce should cease dissemination of the national assessment on climate change because of fatal data flaws noaa denied the request because the agency said it did not involve information that is disseminated pursuant to noaas information quality guidelines but included the request in its iqa report to omb in still other cases agencies considered comments received from the public regarding proposed rules as iqa correction requests for example contractor association filed correction request indicating that proposed rule issued by the fish and wildlife service within the department of the interior did not adequately consider economic impacts and used erroneous assumptions and inappropriate measurements in its analysis of boat speed zones and their effect on manatees the service said it reviewed the comments submitted concerning the proposed rule within the context of the rulemaking process and that further action was necessary in another case epa said it also considers requests for correction on proposed rule during the public commenting process however in yet another case the consumer crs16 product safety commission indicated that under its information quality guidelines the administrative correction mechanism does not apply to information disseminated by the cpsc through comprehensive public comment process omb watchs view of the omb report although various organizations have expressed concerns about the iqa ombs guidelines and the way the statute has been implemented comments from omb watch nonprofit public interest group tend to exemplify many of those concerns in july 2004 omb watch published report entitled the reality of data quality acts first year correction of ombs report to congress29 omb watch said that ombs iqa report was seriously flawed because it was biased and contained inaccurate data and misleading information specifically the organization said that ombs report understated the number of information quality challenges omb watch said there were 98 challenges instead of the 35 that omb reported overstated the extent to which iqa challenges that were denied were appealed omb watch said it was 28 not most as omb said failed to disclose that nearly threequarters of the iqa challenges were from industry provided data to support its claims that the iqa had not slowed down agency rulemaking or dissemination activities did not cover such issues as the judicial reviewability of the information quality guidelines the scope of ombs oversight and authority and the burden that agencies bear in implementing the iqa in summary omb watch said that ombs report to congress contains so many problems that it would not meet the standards established under the agencys own information quality guidelines nevertheless omb watch said it was clear that the iqa has had significant impact on government operations and said congress should hold hearings on the act to determine if modifications are needed ombs 2005 report on iqa implementation in december 2005 as part of its annual report on the costs and benefits of federal regulations omb updated its 2004 report on iqa implementation30 the 29 for copy of this report see httpwwwombwatchorginfodataqualityreportpdf 30 office of management and budget office of information and regulatory affairs validating regulatory analysis 2005 report to congress on the costs and benefits of continued crs17 report provided information on correction requests received in 2003 and 2004 repeated many of the observations included in the earlier report about iqa implementation and offered several helpful tips for stakeholders interested in writing an effective correction request omb noted that agencies interpretation of what qualifies as an iqa correction request has not been consistent with some counting requests that were similar to those previously received and that did not appear to be generated by the act and others not counting those requests therefore omb cautioned readers against drawing any conclusions about trends or yeartoyear comparisons31 in its report omb decided to include some correction requests despite the fact that some arguably are not generated by the act therefore omb revised the number of correction requests received in fy2003 from 35 to 48 omb said it considered only 37 requests to be generated by the iqa during fy2004 therefore omb included total of 85 correction requests for both years 48 plus 37 omb reported that 10 of those 85 requests led to the correction or partial correction of information many of which omb said were without significant policy implications 13 were resolved through other processes eg treated as comments on proposed rules 17 were pending at the end of fy2004 and 45 had been denied of the 45 denied requests which omb characterized as more substantive in nature 28 had been appealed and 13 had been denied again by the end of the fiscal year because so few substantive correction requests had been received by the agencies 85 in two years compared to more than 3 million freedom of information act requests during fy2003 omb said it was still not prepared to make suggestions for legislative changes to the iqa however omb pointed out that it had issued memorandum to the presidents management council requesting that agencies post all iqa correspondence on their websites by december 1 2004 and noted that many agencies had done so as it did in its earlier report omb noted that the number of substantive iqa requests received had been fewer than some had anticipated that the correction request process had been used by virtually all sectors of society and that to our knowledge the act has not affected the pace or length of rulemakings32 omb also again noted that it had learned that what constitutes dissemination is not straightforward and also said that most nonfrivolous requests were denied because reasonable scientist could interpret the available information the way the agency 30 continued federal regulations and unfunded mandates on state local and tribal entities dec 2005 pp 5577 31 ibid p 58 32 ibid p 65 crs18 had meaning it is possible for neither the agency nor the requestor to be incorrect33 finally omb included section in its 2005 report on the iqa that listed tips that will bolster the quality of correction requests and make them easier for agencies to address in rigorous and timely fashion34 for example omb said the public should 1 submit correction requests as part of the traditional comment process when the information is under public review eg when rules are out for public comment 2 provide agencies with peerreviewed references to scientific sources that support their viewpoint 3 be as specific as possible and suggest specific changes that need to be made and 4 request withdrawal of dissemination only as last resort gaos 2006 report on iqa implementation as noted previously in this report gao reported in august 2006 on agencies implementation of the iqa concluding that dhs and number of independent agencies did not have guidelines covering their information and those agencies that had iqa guidelines often did not make that information easy for the public to locate35 as result gao recommended that omb work with dhs and other agencies without guidelines to ensure that they fulfill their iqa responsibilities and clarify its guidance to agencies on improving the publics access to iqa information gao also said that the significant decline in iqarelated requests from fy2003 to fy2004 was caused by changes in the way that fema and other agencies treated correction requests and that more than half of the substantive requests that agencies received during these two years came from businesses trade groups or other profit oriented organizations gao reported that the impact of the iqa on agencies operations could not be determined because neither the agencies nor omb have mechanisms needed to determine those impacts nevertheless gao analysis of requests indicated that they can take from month to more than two years to resolve and that certain program staff or units have seen their workloads increase without an increase in resources finally gao said that 16 correction requests related to rulemaking had been handled under the administrative procedure act not the iqa the iqa and judicial review some observers see judicial review as the crucial test of the acts future effectiveness if judicial review is permitted agencies may find themselves subject to potentially endless legal challenges to their regulations and other types of information disseminations which could make them less likely to issue similar regulations in the future on the other hand the absence of judicial review may 33 ibid p 63 34 ibid p 70 35 us government accountability office information quality act gao06765 op cit crs19 encourage agencies to pay less attention to the iqa and make them more subject to administrative directives provided by omb law journal articles do not convey any consensus in the legal community as to whether an agencys response to data quality challenge is subject to judicial review or whether court in reviewing regulation might be influenced by data quality challenge to the underlying data however recent decisions by two district courts and circuit court suggest that judicial review is not available under the act district court actions the first lawsuit alleging failure to comply with the act was filed in august 2003 competitive enterprise institute v bush ddc 031670 and involved the white house office of science and technology policys report to the president and congress on climate change the lawsuit argued that models used in the climate change assessment were not peer reviewed and produced erroneous predictions and asserted that agency actions were judicially reviewable under the iqa however in november 2003 both parties agreed to dismiss the lawsuit because the white house science office offered to issue disclaimer stating that the national assessment had not been subject to review under the offices data quality standards in the first iqarelated case to be addressed by court on june 21 2004 us district court ruled that the act does not permit judicial review regarding an agencys compliance with its provisions36 in that case involving the missouri river the court first noted that the iqa does not specifically provide for private cause of action the court then noted that judicial review was generally available under the administrative procedure act but not if the agency is acting within the discretion provided by congress that discretion is generally considered to have been provided if the statute at issue is written in such broad terms that there is law to apply37 in this case the court said that such terms as quality objectivity utility and integrity are not defined in the iqa and the history of the legislation does not provide any indication as to the scope of these terms therefore absent any meaningful standard against which to evaluate the agencys discretion the court finds that congress did not intend the iqa to provide private cause of action in an article on the case omb watch noted that the court did not address whether the apa permits judicial review of an agencys failure to comply with the omb guidelines interpreting the iqa or an agencys compliance with its own guidelines38 also given the limited discussion of the iqa in this case omb watch said it is most likely not the last word from the courts on the iqa on june 25 2004 four days after the above court decision the department of justice doj filed brief recommending the dismissal of lawsuit filed under the iqa by the chamber of commerce and the salt institute against the national heart lung and blood institute nhlbi within the national institutes of health the 36 in re operation of the missouri river sys litig 03md1555 at 49 d minn june 21 2004 order granting motions for summary judgment 37 heckler v chaney 470 us 821 830 105 sct 1649 84 led2d 714 1985 38 for copy of this article see httpwwwombwatchorgarticlearticleview2244 crs20 lawsuit challenged the nhlbis statements concerning sodium consumption and health effects the doj brief said that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the agencys underlying study on sodium consumption and also said that there was statutory basis for the court to review the agencys action because the iqa does not permit judicial review specifically doj said the following plainly nothing in the text of the statute indicates that congress intended for the federal courts emphasis in the original to serve as ongoing monitors of the quality of information maintained and disseminated by federal agencies rather the language and structure of the iqa reflects congresss intent that any challenge to the quality of information disseminated by federal agency should take place in administrative proceedings before federal agencies simply put congress nowhere provided new judicial avenue for private parties to enforce the terms of the iqa doj also noted the abovementioned missouri river court case noting that the first and only court to address this issue recently determined that the iqa does not provide for private cause of action the chamber of commerce and salt institute filed brief on july 16 2004 challenging dojs arguments on november 15 2004 the us district court for the eastern district of virginia alexandria division ruled in this case that the salt institute and the chamber of commerce lacked standing to sue eg they had suffered injury in fact and that judicial review of the agencys decision making was not available specifically the court ruled that there is private right of action under the iqa saying that the language in the iqa reflects congresss intent that any challenges to the quality of information disseminated by federal agencies should take place in administrative proceedings before federal agencies and not the courts39 the court also said that judicial review under the apa was not available because the agencys actions did not constitute final agency action ie one in which rights or obligations have been determined or from which legal consequences will flow40 and because the agency decisions were within the discretion provided to the agency by law41 the court went on to say that neither the iqa nor the omb guidelines provide judicially manageable standards that would allow meaningful judicial review to determine whether an agency properly exercised its discretion in deciding request to correct prior communication in fact the guidelines provide that agencies in making their determination of whether or not to correct information may reject claims made in bad faith or without justification and are required to undertake only the degree of correction that they conclude is appropriate for the nature and timeliness of the information involved 67 fed reg at 8458 courts have determined that 39 salt institute and the chamber of commerce of the united states of america v tommy g thompson secretary us department of health and human services civil action 04359 nov 15 2004 p 24 40 see bennet v spear 520 us 154 178 1997 41 the apa 5 usc701a2 expressly prohibits judicial review when the agency action is committed to agency discretion by law crs21 regulations containing similar language granted sufficient discretion to agencies to preclude judicial review under the apa 42 the court also rejected the plaintiffs claim that nhlbi had violated the shelby amendment again saying that the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue and that the agency had merely applied the terms of the circular that omb had revised to implement the amendment circuit court action on march 6 2006 the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit dismissed the appeal by the salt institute and the chamber of commerce agreeing with the district court that the appellants lacked standing because they did not suffer an injury from the published data43 the fourth circuit concluded that the iqa creates legal rights in any third parties including any right to information or to correctness therefore the court argued appellants cannot establish injury in fact and therefore lack article iii standing to pursue their case in the federal courts concluding observations the fourth circuits determination regarding whether agencies actions are subject to judicial review under the iqa may have major effect on the acts implementation if judicial review is unavailable under the act some observers believe that agencies will be more likely to deny information correction requests also oversight of agencies actions to implement the statute will likely fall more heavily on the executive branch ie omb and on congress in the wake of this decision some critics of the acts implementation have suggested that congress amend the iqa and specifically provide for judicial review others have suggested focusing on new test cases believing that the salt institute case did not represent the best case to test whether the iqa was subject to judicial review eg because the appellants request was that information be made public not that it be corrected another approach some have suggested is for omb to take more active role in reviewing agencies decisions under the act perhaps as part of their regulatory review responsibilities under executive order 12866 even in the absence of judicial review the iqa can still have significant impact on federal agencies and their information dissemination activities ombs reports on the implementation of the act during fy2003 and fy2004 provided numerous examples of agencies changing their information dissemination practices in response to administrative requests for correction from affected parties for example in june 2004 the national institute on aging within the national institutes of health agreed to revise its website and printed publications eliminating statements 42 salt institute v thompson p 27 43 salt institute chamber of commerce of the united states of america v michael leavitt secretary of health and human services 051097 mar 6 2006 crs22 indicating that smokeless tobacco products are less safe than cigarettes the change was direct result of an iqa correction request filed by the national legal and policy center44 iqa correction requests have also been filed by groups and in policy areas that few observers anticipated45 the iqa may also be having an effect on information dissemination in the states the center for regulatory effectiveness has reportedly drafted and promoted model state version of the act that is derived from the federal legislation and the omb guidelines46 the state of wisconsin has adopted data quality legislation47 and other states are reportedly planning to do so possible improvements and modifications as noted previously ombs first report to congress included several suggested improvements in the administration of the iqa eg putting correction requests on agencies web pages and improving the timeliness of agencies responses to those requests none of the actions that omb suggested appear to require congressional action each could be implemented by omb and the agencies administratively similarly gaos august 2006 recommendations could be implemented by omb and the agencies without congressional involvement the observations of other interested parties suggest additional possible areas of clarification or refinement in either the iqa or in any subsequent reporting requirements for example omb watch indicated that ombs reports to congress should have examined the effect that the iqa was having on the pace of the regulatory process and on agency resources omb said it was not aware of any data indicating that the iqa was slowing down rulemaking but also said agencies were finding that it took longer than expected to respond to correction requests and to implement the appeals process gao reported that neither the agencies nor omb have mechanisms to determine the costs or other impacts of the iqa on agency operations to improve oversight regarding these issues either congress or omb could initiate the collection of more systematic and reliable data regarding the iqas effect on rulemaking or agencies resources 44 government watchdog group successfully challenges federal health policy on data quality act grounds pr newswire july 14 2004 45 for example in october 2004 americans for safe access berkeley california advocacy group filed an iqa correction request with the department of health and human services asserting that the departments statements that marijuana has medical use in treatment in the united states misstates the scientific evidence and ignores numerous reports and studies demonstrating the medical utility of marijuana and its constituent compounds 46 chris mooney paralysis by analysis jim tozzis regulation to end all regulation washington monthly 5 may 1 2004 p 23 47 2003 wisconsin act 145 took effect on july 1 2004 and relates to administrative rulemaking regarding small businesses among other things it requires agencies to ensure the accuracy integrity objectivity and consistency of the data used to develop proposed rule crs23 omb watch also indicated that ombs initial report was flawed in its characterization of the number of correction requests and the source of those requests some of the disagreements on those issues may flow from differences of opinion regarding what types of actions should be considered in an iqa correction request for example it is not clear whether congress intended the iqa correction request process to apply to many of the relatively minor issues listed in ombs report eg the dates of publication of pamphlet or the names of persons in photograph the tens of thousands of requests to revise fema flood insurance rate maps and other items that had been addressed administratively before the iqa came into being comments filed regarding proposed rules or requests that the public comment periods for proposed rules be reopened ombs 2005 report notes that agencies are inconsistent in how they treat such submissions with some characterizing them as iqa correction requests and others deciding not to do so gao reported that the sharp decline in the number of iqa requests was result of certain agencies changing how they classified correction requests to clarify these and other issues either congress or omb could better define the scope of the act or the issues to be included in any future report clarification could also be provided regarding whether correction requests that the agencies determine to involve issues outside the scope of the iqa eg challenge to the minutes of federal advisory committee meeting should be included in report that is supposed to list correction requests under the act the iqa and peer review in its final iqa guidelines omb encouraged but did not require the use of peer reviews in the development of agencydisseminated information as noted previously in this report omb indicated that agencies can presume that data are sufficiently objective if they have been subject to an independent peer review process eg as used by scientific journals but said member of the public could rebut this presumption based on persuasive showing by the petitioner in particular instance omb also indicated that journal peer review may not be sufficient for information likely to have an important public policy or private sector impact finally the iqa guidelines set minimum standards for the transparency of agencysponsored peer review eg disclosure of reviewers prior technical or policy positions and sources of funding on september 15 2003 omb published proposed bulletin on peer review and information quality in the federal register that would when made final provide standardized process by which all significant regulatory information would crs24 be peer reviewed48 omb said it received 187 comments on the draft peer review bulletin many of which were critical of the proposed requirements on april 28 2004 omb published revised peer review bulletin in the federal register that the office said incorporates many of the diverse perspectives and suggestions voiced during the comment period49 the revised bulletin essentially required agencies to take three actions to the extent permitted by law 1 have peer review conducted on all influential scientific information that the agency intends to disseminate changed from significant regulatory information in the proposed bulletin 2 have all highly influential scientific assessments peer reviewed according to more specific and demanding standards and 3 indicate what influential and highly influential information the agency plans to peer review in the future by focusing on scientific information not just regulatory information the bulletin was significantly broader than the proposed document it also gave agencies much more discretion to decide when information is influential and therefore requires peer review but also gives omb significant authority to decide when scientific assessment is highly influentialand therefore requires more specific peer review procedures on december 16 2004 omb published final version of the peer review bulletin that was substantially similar to the april 2004 revised document50 changes to the revised bulletin include requirement that the names of peer reviewers be disclosed to the public and an annual reporting requirement for the agencies to allow omb to track how agencies are using the bulletin the bulletin became effective for all influential scientific information including highly influential scientific assessments on june 16 2005 on december 16 2005 agencies began posting peer review agendas for influential scientific information omb said in its 2005 report on the iqa that it considered several agencies agendas to be exemplary in form and specifically cited those of the us coast guard the department of transportation and the food safety inspection service 48 office of management and budget executive office of the president proposed bulletin on peer review and information
