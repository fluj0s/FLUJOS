developed in auditor administration the purpose of this series is to bring standard in auditor administration throughout the world definitions auditor listener or one who listens carefully to what people have to say an auditor is person trained and qualified in applying scientology processes to others for their betterment administration consists of the formation and handling of the lines and terminals involved in production auditor administration would include 1 the knowhow of writing session reports 2 the knowhow of folder arrangement 3 the knowhow of all lines and terminals in the tech area covered mainly in cs series 25 4 the knowhow of other lines and terminals in the org that directly relate to an auditor getting out his product lrh quotes always administration is communication administration is important because the administration is piece of truth administration of folder is responsibility and so is the administrative lines of the technical division auditor has any business being ignorant of administration reference tape 12671 welcome to the flag intern course 3cs series 56 cs series 56 can be considered as auditor admin series 2 and comes next in this series cs

saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 25 august 1971 reissued 2 november 1972 as remimeo auditor admin series 2 cs series 56 how to get results in an hgc obtaining excellent case results is an administrative not wholly technical function auditors and cses are often weak on administrative they think general tech results improve only by more tech study if they continue to think this way they wind up squirreling for they are working on wrong target for improvement wrong why or reason auditing is team activity the day of the individual country doctor is dead even if an individual field auditor starts out as an individual he goes one of two directions he overworks and squirrels himself into failure or he builds up teammay only be receptionist and an apprentice auditor but he is still building up team i have never seen individual auditors succeed over long period failing to form or become part of team they eventually fade out or squirrel the reason is simple enough these rules apply to improve tech results you must improve administration and i dont mean just writing better in folders definition administration consists of the formation and handling of the lines and terminals involved in production unless an auditor understands this fully he will never insist on tech sec tech establishment officer d of p cs examiner pages folder admin and himself will begin to omit keeping folder summary and then omit the session actions and then with big loses retire from it all if i were an auditor and saw some of these things missing id be liable to say are you guys kidding i thought we were here to audit pcs without the correct pattern of lines and terminals you dont get results you get headaches mad neighbors and refunds auditing on lines an auditor should regard himself as highly skilled expert technical specialist whose work requires respect and service and case supervising on lines case supervisor should consider himself sort of czar whose word is so law even the exec director thinks several times before he approachesduly servile of course and bowing the prescribed three times as he exits 5a class xii on flag is listened to by others with hush even if he is only commenting on the weather these are the stars of the team their worldwide reputation for smooth flubless auditing is an administrative result short of space overloaded short of admin personnel turning out the highest well done hours in the world flags div iv produces because of an admin system the highest of these cses and auditors goes to cramming if he misplaces comma or drops tr 1 if the sessions exams at examiner drop from 90 fn the whole place gets overhauled folders are folder error summaried by an fes section the folder summary is kept up each session or cramming the folder is studied and csed the d of p assigns the sessions the cs is done correctly or cramming the folder travels on its lines the tests are done in short it is complex but constantly flowing pattern of moving pcs folders and examinations interspersed with testing and interviews and reregistration there is right way to do it results if an org has only 65 of its sessions fn vgis at examiner the right answer is to organize the place why well the first answer is that the third dynamic is stronger than the first dynamic an auditor auditing alone is first dynamic the pc is first dynamic as it is the auditor plus pc that must be greater than the reactive mind one can easily work the rest out if the auditor is part of functioning third dynamic not just an individual the auditor plus pc versus the bank is lot more than the bank another answer is that an auditor knows the pc if only because of sessions and personal opinion enters into it that is not pure technical view as css must be another answer is that an auditor in group gets more auditing done individually practicing auditors often fail because nobody is taking care of the auditor as person further they get loses one sends them to cramming when they get loses they often start squirreling then they really get loses that ends them as auditors an auditor working in good on policy organization is given service he does get sent to cramming he does keep his tech updated he gets wins when he doesnt hes put back on standard tech so he happily keeps going and makes lots of happy people so if i were auditing in group i would insist as condition of work that div iv and div v be good on policy divisions fully organized with nonsense i know whereof i speak as parttime duty i work as consulting cs with good iv and good v sometimes i have had to take over the whole cs line when the organization bogs in any way i know the whole thing is heading toward single 6handing the lot so i get the lines back in and get people to cramming and get the fn at examiner ratio approaching 100 again thus the advice you get about csing is livelivelive not canned theory org wins being on administrative lines to all orgs i can tell you pointblank that their stats depend on their volume and quality of service that isnt propaganda its pure fact the fnno fn at examiner ratio tells you at once if divs iv and v are organized and operating or if they are just fooling about at 50 to 75 fn at examiner the administrative functions of divs iv and v are stinking bad cs series 25 is out cramming is out hidden data lines exist hco bs books and tapes are not used the public at that of fn will stay away in droves registrars will go batty and adopt hot prospect systems the staff will go low pay and the execs will be perpetual dark shade of purple from yelling the cashbills ratio will be the subject of finance missions and the neighbors will be phoning the police why because an org is itself technical delivery organization and 50 to 75 fn at examiner is an overt product the academy has already failed to apply student study tech and word clearing qual is joke there is library of tech available and if available isnt read the org as tech service delivery unit is treating its public to noauditing situation and will get in trouble remedy the way to remedy is to get on policy with tech organization put in qual with word clearing and library and cramming put in the cs series 25 tech lines tolerate outtech or outadmin in folders dummy run the lines until theyre in cram cram cram cs and auditor and tech personnel flubs whenever they occur get the organization functioning your fn at examiner ratio will climb straight up to 90 95 98 by actual test pcs will flood in reg lines will get easy success stats soar more auditors more cses more organization second third hgc 7and the more thoroughly the admin lines are manned the better the tech lines work this conclusion came from actual inspections of orgs and studies of their stats orgs should be selling more training than processing but why train if you cant interne them in good qual and hgc theyll never amount to anything as auditors unless they work in an organization that is on tech and on policy so you need an hgc tech done in proper administrative framework works some orgs really dont believe they could ever attain the flubless auditing quality of flag but they can it is even easy it is even easier to attain flubless quality of auditing than any other kind you put in real on policy admin pattern in iv and v you begin with qual interne course you send to cramming for any cs or auditing error matter how minute the results come up the errors cease youre success if you do it l ron hubbard founder lrhntrd copyright 1971 1972 by l ron hubbard

summary reports with the introduction of cs series the fantastic new hgc line summary report forms were omitted from the admin procedure at flag however the use of summary report forms is left entirely to the discretion of the cs of an org they are used extensively in training every student auditor on courses and coaudit must write summary report form after each session it is tool for increasing an auditors obnosis of what goes on in session it teaches auditors how to quickly and concisely analyze and report on case filling in the report the summary report form is filled in as follows 1 the date 2 the pcs name and the auditors name in block letters 3 the process run the total tone arm action for the session and the length of the session in hours and minutes 4 goals are longer set at the beginning of session but if the pc in passing mentions any goals he has attained or more likely gains he has had in the session these are noted at this point 5 aspects of running processeach of the questions 1 to 22 of the form are answered here write down briefly what the preclear was doing in the session do not write opinions with regard to what was happening or how the preclear was running the process here we are interested in the aspects of the case in relationship to the process or processes being run 356 ethics report these are written on the auditors cs sheet per cs series 25 7 suggest the summary should be done for the session given the preclear for the day it is not stapled to the worksheets but is paperclipped on top of the auditors report form and beneath the exam report two sessions in one day calls for only one summary report with the ta and data of each session it should be legible and readable if an auditors handwriting is poor it should be printed out by the auditor writing the reports should only take the auditor 15 minutes to do at the most having just audited the preclear you should quite easily fill the report out references hco b

worksheets the worksheets are the sheets on which the auditor writes complete running record of the session from beginning to end page after page as the session goes along worksheet is always foolscap 8 x 13 inches written on both sides and each page is numbered back and front top center of page this is so an auditor can say now the rs occurred on page 25 which saves lot of time further it gives the proper number of pages the session went the worksheet is written in two columns the auditor writes down the lefthand column and then down the righthand column content of worksheet the most important parts of the session to be noted are when the ta goes up on what b when the ta goes down on what c when an fn occurs on whatany cog d when vgis occur on what when bis occur on what f how the process ran what commands are being run g reads ta and time notations should be made at regular intervals throughout the session when process reaches epwrite in the pcs cognition circle the fn and whether or not it was indicated note the pcs indicators the time and ta when twoway comming subject it is essential that all items terminals statements etc that read are so marked on the worksheetslf lfbd all reading items are circled in green after the session rs items ethics situations ser facs and evil purps are marked after the session by ringing them on the ws with red pen 41shorthanding auditors usually develop system of shorthanding the session actions being done so that session speed is not hampered by admin for example the repetitive process recall change recall nochange recall failed change is run as bracket the pc is given the first command then the second and then the third and then the first and then the second etc the first command can be abbreviated to 1 the second to 2 and the third to 3 the ws therefore would look like 1232 28 failed note that each word of the command is cleared before clearing the command as change whole nochange recall fn 1 cleared 2 cleared 3 cleared 1249 26 1 mother went on holiday 2 at school 3 didnt sell bike 1 moved to new house 2 etc after the session when the commands are written out in full on the auditors report form the numbers are again noted so that the cs can refer to them whatever system of abbreviation is used by the auditor the worksheet must communicate to the cs what actions were taken during the session 42legibility worksheets should be written legibly they are never recopied the auditor should always read over his wsheets before turning in the folder to the case supervisor and if any words or letters are missing or cannot be read they should be put in in block print in red example this can be overdone to the extent that it is almost sarcasm at the most it should just run into one or two corrections to page if the auditor is having to correct the page more than that he should learn how to write rapidly and legibly see hcob 3 nov 71 cs series 66 auditors worksheets which also appears as auditor admin series 15 and comes next in this series necessity of worksheets it is crime to give any session without making an auditors report ie actual ws taken at that time or to copy the original wsheets after the

to fail to insist on good legible handwriting when cs has auditors who cant write well and rapidly he gets misunderstood words when he tries to read the worksheets one temporary solution is to make the auditor block print the word in red above each hard to read word some auditors go to an extreme of block printing the whole wis the more permanent solution is to have auditors in cramming practice writing well and clearly matter how slowly and then maintaining the same clarity speed it up the auditor after many such practice sessions winds up writing clearly and fast this can be increased until an auditor can write clearly as fast as people talk the occasional headaches cs might get are not from the restim of the case hes studying but are from the words on wses he cant make out if cs does not insist on both block print clarification and auditor writing practice he will wind up not reading worksheets and may even get foggy about certain cases remedy is to go back to the first folders

asho two methods of fesing there are two methods of fesing case the first is full detailed fes where one goes back and picks up and notes down all past errors on the case so that progress and advance program can be done where the cs is interested in handling the case more rapidly the procedure is to go back to where the pc was running well and come forward looking for the goofs to repair this would also apply in the case of pc who already repaired was goofed in further auditing these are different fes methodsa progress program and repair csing neither one includes admin errors or errors which do not affect the case the flaw folder error summaries feses which do not show clearly whether an error has been corrected later in the pcs auditing can lead the cs into overrepair such flaw lessens the usefulness of an fes new format to handle the above flaw the layout and contents of the fes have been revised the following is the format of the fes which should be on legal or equivalent size pink or red paper according to availability one can see at glance that all the noted errors have been corrected blank space in the right hand column would indicate that the error had not yet been fixed 56this column is filled in by the feser as he goes along or by the auditor as correction is done for example note chronic high ta would be marked off by the auditor cs 53rj to fn list ta normal with the date when that action had been completed any error noted in the correction of the case is noted as new error on the fes the fes is kept in pt by the auditor as errors are noted the cs will use the fes as help in further programming of the pc it is kept in the inside back cover of the pcs folder what is wanted in an fes an fes should contain those points of error in the auditing of case which might cause the pc future difficulty or may require handling these would include rundowns left unflat or with missing steps signs of unflat grades absence of any of the parts of ep noting what was being run any chronic problem or difficulty bypassed ep on any rundown illness or ethics trouble after an auditing cycle the most important points which can bog case are well covered in the cs

december 1974 remimeo auditors supervisors revision in this type style students tech qual basic auditing series 1r the magic of the communication cycle from the lrh tape 6 february 1964 comm cycle in auditing if you look over communication you will find that the magic of communication is about the only thing that makes auditing work the thetan in this universe has begun to consider himself mest and has begun to consider himself mass and the being that considers himself mass of course responds to the laws of electronics and the laws of newton he is actually incapable of generating very much or asising very much an individual considers himself mesty or massy and therefore he has to have second terminal second terminal is required to discharge the energy here we have two poles we have an auditor and pc and as long as the auditor audits and the pc replies we get an exchange of energy from the pcs point of view many auditors think they are being second terminal to the degree that they pick up the somatics and illnesses of the pc actually there is backflow of any kind that hits the auditor but if he is so convinced that he is mest he will turn on somatics in echo of the pc actually nothing hits the auditor it has to be mocked up or envisioned by him you have set up in essence two pole system and that will bring about an asising of mass it isnt burning the mass it is asising the mass and thats why there is nothing hitting the auditor now that is the essence of the situation the magic involved in auditing is contained in the communication cycle of auditing you see now you are handling the smooth interchange between these two poles when you look over the difficulties of auditing realize that you are handling simply the difficulties of the communication cycle and when you yourself as the auditor do not permit smooth flow between you as terminal and the pc as terminal and the pc as terminal back to you you get asising of mass so you dont get ta action part of the trick of course is what has to be asised and how do you go about it but that we call techniquewhat button has to be pressed we find oddly enough if the auditor is actually capable of making the pc willing to talk to him he wouldnt have to hit button to get tone arm action he cannot make the pc get tone arm action basically because communication cycle doesnt exist 63the person who is insisting continuously upon new technique is neglecting the basic tool of his auditing which is the communication cycle of auditing when the communication cycle does not exist in an auditing session we get this horrible compounding of felony of trying to get technique to work but the technique cannot be administered because there is communication cycle to administer it basic auditing is called basic auditing because it goes prior to the technique communication cycle must exist before the technique can exist the fundamental entrance to the case is not on level of the technique but is on level of the communication cycle communication is simply familiarization process based on reach and withdraw when you speak to pc you are reaching when you cease to speak you are withdrawing when he hears you hes at that moment bit withdrawn but then he reaches toward you with the answer youll see him go into withdraw while he thinks it all over then he reaches the reason now he will reach the auditor with the reason and he will say that was it you have made an exchange from the pc to the auditor and will see it reflect on the meter because that exchange now is giving an asising of energy in the absence of that communication you do not get meter action so the fundamental of auditing is the communication cycle thats the fundamental of auditing and that is really the great discovery of dianetics and scientology its such simple discovery but you realize that nobody knew anything about it l ron hubbard founder lrhntrd copyright 1971 1974 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 64hubbard communications

auditing from the lrh tape 2 july 1964 ow modernised and reviewed in order to do something for somebody you have to have communication line to that person communication lines depend upon reality and communication and affinity and where an individual is too demanding the affinity tends to break down slightly processing goes in two stages 1 to get into communication with that which you are trying to process 2 do something for him there is many pc who will go around raving about his auditor whose auditor has not done anything for the pc all that has happened is that tremendous communication line has been established with the pc and this is so novel and so strange to the pc that he then considers that something miraculous has occurred something miraculous has occurred but in this particular instance the auditor has totally neglected why he formed that communication line in the first place he formed it in the first place to do something for the pc he very often mistakes the fact that he has formed communication line and the reaction on the pc for his having formed one with having done something for the pc there are two stages 1 form communication line 2 do something for the pc those are the two distinct stages it is something like 1 walking up to the bus and 2 driving off if you dont drive off you never go anyplace it is very tricky and small thing to be able to communicate to human being who has never been communicated to before this is quite remarkable and is such remarkable feat that it appears to be an endall of scientology to some but you see thats just walking up to the bus now you have got to go someplace any upset that the individual has is so poised it is so delicately balanced that it is difficult to maintain t is not difficult to get well it is very hard to remain batty fellow has to work at it if your communication line is very good and very smooth and if your auditing discipline is perfect so you dont upset this communication line and if you just made foray of more importance than saying something likewhat are you doing thats sensible and why is it sensibleand kept your communication line up all the while and kept your affinity up with the pc all the while did it with perfect discipline you would see more aberration fall to pieces per square inch than you ever thought could exist now thats what i mean when i say do something for the pc 65you must audit well get perfect discipline and get your communication cycle in dont arc break the pc let your cycles of action complete all of that is simply an entrance you see the discipline of scientology makes it possible to do this and one of the reasons why other fields of the mind never got anyplace and could never get near anybody was because they couldnt communicate to anybody so that discipline is important that is the ladder that goes up to the door and if you cant get to the door you cant do anything the perfect discipline of which we speak the perfect communication cycle the perfect auditor presence perfect meter readingall of these things are just to get you in state where you can do something for somebody so when youre real slow picking up the discipline real slow picking up keeping in the communication cycle when youre pokey on the subject you are still 9 miles from the ball youre not even attending yet what you want to be able to do is audit perfectly by that we mean keep in communication cycle be able to approach the pc be able to talk to the pc and be able to maintain the arc get the pc to give you answers to your questions be able to read meter and get the reactions all of those things have to be awfully good because its very difficult to get communication line in to somebody anyway they all have to be present and they all have to be perfect if they are all present and they are all perfect then we can start to process somebody then we can start to process somebody im giving you an entrance point here of if all your cycles were perfect if you were able to sit there and confront the pc and meter that pc and keep your auditing report and do all these multiple various things and keep pleasant smile on your face and not chop his communication well then there is something you do with these things it takes process now we used to have it all backwards we used to try and teach people what they could do for somebody but they could never get in communication with him to do it so therefore you had failures in processing the most elementary procedure would bewhat do you think is sensibleor anything of that sort the pc says well i think horses sleep in beds thats sensible the auditor says alright now why is that sensible the pc says well ah hey thats not sensible thats nuts you actually wouldnt have to do anything more than that hes cognited youve flattened it its so easy to do but you keep looking for some magic well your magic is in getting into communication with the person the rest is very easy to do all you have to do is remain in communication with the person while you are doing this and realize that these huge aberrations hes got are poised with the most fantastically delicate balance on little pinheads all you have to do is to phooph and these things crash now if youre not in communication with this person he doesnt cognite he takes it as an accusative action he tries to justify thinking that way he tries to make himself look good to you and tries to put on public front of some kind or another he tries to hold up his status anytime i see bunch of pcs around who want to jump happily to something else because sane people run on that and crazy people run on something else and they never have to be run on the crazy one i right away know their auditors are not in communication with them and that auditing discipline itself has broken down because the pc is trying to justify himself and trying to uphold his own status so he must be defending himself against the auditor the auditor couldnt possibly be in communication with him 66so we are right back to the fundamental of why didnt the auditor get into comm with the pc in the first place you get into communication with the pc in the first place by doing proper scientology discipline that is not any trick it goes off 1 2 3 4 you sit down and you start the session and you start handling the pc and his problems and that sort of thing and you do it by completing your communication cycles and not cutting his communication the very things you are taught in the trs and you find you are in communication with the person now youve got to do something for the person unless having gotten into communication you do something for the person you lose your communication line because the rfactor of why youre in communication with the pc breaks down he doesnt think youre so good and you go out of communication with him that having happened the person will be in sort of status defensive and wonder why he is being processed on the other hand if you have done something for the pc and he has had his cognition and you try and go on and get more ta action out of the fact that all horses sleep in bedsyou dont get there as youve already flattened the process you can overaudit and you can underaudit if you dont notice that one answer come your way that indicates you have done something for the pc and if you keep him working on that same thing your ta action will disappear your pc will get resentful and youll lose your communication line hes already had the cognition you see you are now restimulating the pc you have gotten your keyout destimulation factorit has occurred right before your eyes you have done something for the pc one more mention of the subject and youve had it there are lot of things you could do with the pc without doing anything for him you can turn on some very very handsome somatics on pc at one time or another without turning them off either youve got to do something for the pc not to him now you can be doing something and the pc is doing b and you go on doing while the pc is doing b then somewhere on down the line you wind up in hell of mess and you wonder what happened well the pc never did what you said so you didnt do anything for the pc there was in actual fact barrier to your willingness to do something for the pc but there must have been tremendous barrier to your understanding of what was going on that you could ask while the pc answered b in itself showed the auditor observation was very poor so therefore the auditor wasnt in communication with the pc so again the communication factor was out and once more we werent doing anything for the pc it requires of the auditor discipline to keep in his communication line he has got to stay in communication with his pc those cycles have got to be perfect he cant be distracting the pcs attention onto the ta eg im not getting any ta action now thats not staying in communication with the pchas nothing to do with it youre distracting the pc from his own zones and areas dont put the pcs attention out of session keep him going and keep that communication line in and the next requirement is to do something productive for the pc using the communication line l ron hubbard founder lrhntjh copyright 1971 1974 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 67hubbard communications office

basic auditing series 3 the three important communication lines from the lrh tape 15 oct 63 essentials of auditing when you are sitting in an auditing session what are the 3 important communication lines and what is their order of importance 1 the first is the pcs line to his bank the itsa maker line 2 the second is the pcs line to the auditor the itsa line 3 the third is the auditors line to the pc the whatsit line now the definition willing to talk to the auditor is very easy to interpret as talking to the auditor so the auditor cuts the line the pc has to the bank in order to get the pc to talk because its the itsa line that blows the charge he says so the auditor cuts the pcs communication line with his bank in order to bring about an itsa lineand then he wonders why he gets ta action and why the pc arc breaks this cut communication line is not perceivable to the naked eye its hidden because its from the pca thetan unseen by the auditorto the pcs bankunseen by the auditor the auditor is simply there to use the whatsit line in order to get the pc to confront his bank the charge blows off it to the degree that its confronted and this is represented by the itsa line the itsa line is report on what has been asised that gives it its flow the sequence of use of these lines in an auditing cycle is 3 1 and then 2 where the auditor neglects this hidden line from the pc to the pcs bank where he doesnt understand that hidden line and cant integrate it or do anything with it he is going to fail l ron hubbard founder lrhnttsrd copyright 1971 1974 by l ron hubbard all

basic auditing series 4r communication cycles within the auditing cycle taken from the lrh tape comm cycles in auditing 25 july 1963 the difficulty that an auditor gets into is normally found in his own auditing cycle there are basically two communication cycles between the auditor and the pc that make up the auditing cycle they are cause distance effect with the auditor at cause and the pc at effect and cause distance effect with the pc at cause and the auditor at effect cause distance effect auditor pc effect distance cause these are completely distinct one from the other the only thing that connects them and makes an auditing cycle is the fact that the auditor on his communication cycle has calculatingly restimulated something in the pc which is then discharged by the pcs communication cycle what the auditor has said has caused restimulation and then the pc needs to answer the question to get rid of the restimulation if the pc does not answer the question he doesnt get rid of the restimulation that is the game that is being played in an auditing cycle and that is the entirety of the game some auditing breaks down because the auditor is unwilling to restimulate the pc there is little extra communication cycle on here the auditor says thank you and you have this as the acknowledgement cycle c command auditor answer c pc acknowledgement now there are some little inner cycles that can throw you off and make you think that there are some other things to the auditing cycle there is another little shadow cycle it is the observation of has the pc received the auditing command this is such tiny cause that nearly all auditors who are having any trouble finding out whats going on with the pc are missing this one does he receive it actually there is another cause in here and youre missing that one when youre not perceiving the pc 69you can tell by looking at the pc that he didnt hear or understand what youd said or that he was doing something peculiar with the command he was receiving whatever that message is in response it rides on this line did pc receive understand and c answer command c command auditor answer c pc acknowledgement an auditor who isnt watching pc at all never notices pc who isnt receiving or understanding the auditing command then all of sudden somewhere along the line there is an arc break and then we do assessments and we patch up the session and all kinds of things go wrong well they actually neednt ever have gone wrong in the first place if this line had been in what is the pc doing completely aside from answering well what he is doing is this other little subcause distance effect line another of these tiny lines is the cause distance effect line ofis the pc ready to receive an auditing command this is the pc causing and it rides up the line across distance is received at the auditor and the auditor perceives that the pc is doing something else it is an important one and you find that auditors goof that one very often the pcs attention is still on prior action now heres another onehas the pc received the acknowledgement sometimes you violate this one you have been acknowledging but youve never seen that he didnt receive the acknowledgement that perception has another little tiny one in it that actually comes on this line it ishas the pc answered everything the auditor is watching the pc and the auditor sees that the pc has not said all that the pc is going to say you sometimes get into trouble with pcs that way everything at cause hasnt moved on down the line to effect and you havent perceived all of the effect and you go into the acknowledgement one before this line has completed itself thats chopping the pcs communication you didnt let the communication cycle flow to its complete end the acknowledgement takes place and of course it cant go through as its an inflowing line and it jams right there on the pcs incomplete outflowing answer line is pc ready for the command c did pc receive understand and c answer command c command auditor answer c pc acknowledgement 70so if you want to break it all down there are six communication cycles which make up one auditing cycle six not more than six unless you start running into trouble if you violate one of these six communication lines you of course are going to get into trouble which causes mishmash of one kind or another there is another communication cycle inside the auditing cycle and that is at the point of the pc its little additional one and its between the pc and himself this is him talking to him youre listening to the inside of his skull when youre examining it t actually can be multiple as it depends upon the complications of the mind this happens to be the least important of all the actions except when it isnt being done and of course its the hardest to detect when it isnt being done pc says yes now what has the pc said yes to and sometimes you are insufficiently curious and that in essence is this internal perception of line it includes this cause distance effect backflash hereis the pc answering the command i gave him so with this there are seven communication cycles involved in an auditing cycle it is multiple cycle communication cycle consists of just cause distance effect with intention attention duplication and understanding how many of these are there in one auditing cycle youd have to answer that with how many principal ones there are because some auditing cycles contain few more if pc indicates that he didnt get the command cause distance effect the auditor would give repeat of it cause distance effect and that would add 2 more communication cycles to the auditing cycle so youve got 9because there was flub so anything unusual that happens in session adds to the number of communication cycles in the auditing cycle but they are still all part of the auditing cycle repetitive commands as an auditing cycle is doing the same cycle over and over again now there is completely different cycle inside the same pattern the pc is going to originate and its got nothing to do with the auditing cycle the only thing they have in common is that they both use communication cycles but this is brand new the pc says something that is not germane to what the auditor is saying or doing and you actually have to be alert for this happening at any time and the way to prepare for it is just to realize that it can happen at any time and just go into the drill that handles it dont get it confused with the drill that you have as an auditing cycle consider it its own drill you shift gears into this drill when the pc does something unexpected and by the way this handles such thing as the pc originates by throwing down the cans thats still an origin it has nothing to do with the auditing cycle maybe the auditing cycle went to pieces and this origination cycle came in well the auditing cycle cant complete because this origin cycle is now here that doesnt mean that this origin has precedence or dominance but it can start and take place and have to be finished off before the auditing cycle can resume so this is an interruptive cycle and it is cause distance effect the pc causes something the auditor now has to originate as the auditor has to understand what the pc is talking aboutand then acknowledge and to the degree that it is hard to understand you have the cause distance effect of the auditor trying to clarify this thing and every time he asks question hes got new communication cycle you cant put machine action at that point because the thing has to be understood and this must be done in such way that the pc isnt merely repeating his same origination or the pc will go frantic hell go frantic because he cant get off that linehes stuck in time and it really upsets him so the auditor has to be able to understand what the devil the pc is talking about and theres really substitute for simply trying to understand it 71there is little line where the pc indicates he is going to say something this is line cause distance effect that comes before the origination takes place so you dont run into jam and you dont give the auditing command the effect at the auditors point is to shut up and let him there can be another little line cause distance effect where the auditor indicates he is listening then there is the origination the auditors acknowledgement of it and then there is the perception of the fact that the pc received the acknowledgement thats your origination cycle an auditor should draw all these communication cycles out on scrap of paper just take look at all these things mock up session and all of sudden it will become very straight how these things are and you wont have couple of them jammed up whats mainly wrong with your auditing cycle is that you have confused couple of communication cycles to such degree that you dont differentiate that they exist thats why you sometimes chop pc who is trying to answer the question you know whether the pc has answered the question or not how did you know even if its telepathy its cause distance effect it doesnt matter how that communication took place you know whether hes answered the command by communication cycle i dont care how you sense this if you are nervy on the subject of handling the basic tool of auditing and if thats giving you trouble and if you get into trouble by suddenly breaking it down and analyzing it then it should be broken down and analyzed at time when youre auditing something nice and simple ive given you general pattern for an auditing cycle maybe in working it over you can find couple of extra communication cycles in the thing but they are all there and if you made someone go through each one painstakingly you would find out where his auditing cycle is jammed up it isnt necessarily jammed up on his ability to say thank you it may very well be jammed up in another quarter l ron hubbard

ease with which you can handle communication cycle depends on your ability to observe what the pc is doing we have to add to the simplicity of the communication cycle obnosis observation of the obvious your inspection of what you are doing should have ended with your training thereafter it should be taken up exclusively with the observation of what the pc is doing or is not doing your handling of communication cycle ought to be so instinctive and so good that youre never worried about what you do now the time for you to get all this fixed up is in training if you know your communication cycle is good you havent any longer got to be upset about whether youre doing it right or not you know yours is good so you dont worry about it any more in actual auditing the communication cycle that you watch is the pcs your business is the communication cycle and responses of the pc this is what makes the auditor who can crack any case and when absent you have an auditor who couldnt crack an egg if he stepped on it this is the difference its whether or not this auditor can observe the communication cycle of the pc and repair its various lapses its so simple it simply consists of asking question that the pc can answer and then observing that the pc answers it and when the pc has answered it observing that the pc has completed the answer to it and is through answering it then give him the acknowledgement then give him something else to do you can ask the same question or you can ask another question asking the pc question he can answer involves clearing the auditing command you also ask it of the pc so that the pc can hear it and knows what hes being asked when the pc answers the question be bright enough to know that the pc is answering that question and not some other question you have to develop sensitivitywhen did the pc finish answering what youve asked you can tell when the pc has finished its piece of knowingness he looks 73like hes finished and he feels like hes finished its part sense its part his vocal intonation but its an instinct that you develop you know hes finished then knowing hes finished answering you tell him hes finished with an acknowledgement ok good etc its like pointing out the bypassed charge to the pc likeyou have now found and located the bypassed charge in answer to the question and you have said it thats the magic of acknowledgement if you dont have that sensitivity for when the pc is finished answeringhe answers gets nothing from you you sit there and look at him his social machinery goes into action he gets onto self auditing and you get ta action the degree of stop you put on your acknowledgement is also your good sense because you can acknowledge pc so hard that you finish the session right there its all very well to do this sort of thing in training and its forgivable but not in an auditing session get your own communication cycle sufficiently well repaired that you dont have to

the auditor fails to understand what the pc said or meant the correct response is i did not hear you understand what was said get that last to do anything else is not only bad form it can amount to heavy arc break invalidation to say you did not speak loud enough_____ or any other use of you is an invalidation the pc is also thrown out of session by having responsibility hung on him or her the auditor is responsible for the session therefore the auditor has to assume responsibility for all comm breakdowns in it evaluation far more serious than invalidation above is the accidental evaluation which may occur when the auditor repeats what the pc said never repeat anything pc says after him matter why repeating not only does not show the pc you heard but makes him feel youre circuit the highest advance of 19th century psychology was machine to drive people crazy all it did was repeat after the person everything the person said children also do this to annoy but that isnt the main reason you do not repeat what the pc said after the pc if you say it wrong the pc is thrown into heavy protest the pc must correct the wrongness and hangs up right there it may take an hour to dig the pc out of it further dont gesture to find out to say pointing you mean this item then is not only an evaluation but nearly hypnotic command and the pc feels he must reject very strongly dont tell the pc what the pc said and dont gesture to find what the pc meant just get the pc to say it again or get the pc to point it out again thats the correct action 75driving in anchor points also do not shove things at pc or throw things to pc dont gesture toward pc it drives in anchor points and makes the pc reject the auditor rock slammer the reason person who rock slams on scientology or auditors or the like cant audit well is that they are wary of pc and feel they must repeat after the pc correct the pc or gesture toward the pc but rock slammer or not any new auditor may fall into these bad habits and they should be broken fast summary very high percentage of arc breaks occur because of failure to understand the pc dont prove you didnt with gestures or erroneous repeats just audit please l ron

body odor and bad breath it is not conducive to social happiness but you dont use lifebuoy soap or listerine to cure it you use proper comm formula when you coax person to talk after he has begun with nod or low yes you ack make him forget then make him believe you havent got it and then make him tell you at great length he feels bad and doesnt cognite and may arc break try it out have somebody tell you about something and then encourage before he has completely told you all thats why pcs itsa on and on and on and on with gain the auditor prematurely acknowledged thats why pcs get cross for reason the auditor has prematurely and unwittingly acknowledged thats why one feels dull when talking to certain people they prematurely acknowledge thats why one thinks another is stupidthat person prematurely acknowledges the quickest way to become social pariah dog is to prematurely acknowledge one can do it in many ways the quickest way to start the longest conversation is to prematurely acknowledge for the person believes he has not been understood and so begins to explain at greater and greater length so this was the hidden arc break maker the cognition wrecker the stupidifier the itsa prolonger in sessions and why some people believe others are stupid or dont understand any habit of agreeable noises and nods can be mistaken for acknowledgement ends cycle on the speaker causes him to forget feel dull believe the listener is stupid get cross get exhausted explaining and arc break the missed withhold is inadvertent one didnt get chance to say what one was going to say because one was stopped by premature acknowledgement result missed wh in the speaker with all its consequences this can be counted on to make you feel frightened of being agreeable with noises or gestures for

auditing skills thats all these are the trs an auditor who cant do his trs cant audit period instead he says he is letting the pc itsa if by this he means he is letting the pc drive all over the road and in both ditches then this isnt auditing in auditing an auditor guides he gives the pc something to answer when the pc answers the pc has said it is and thats itsa if the pc answers and the auditor acknowledges too soon the pc tends to go into an anxietyhe has been chopped so he talks more than he wanted if the pc answers and the auditor does not acknowledge then the pc talks on and on hoping for an acknowledgement that doesnt come runs dry tries again etc so premature or lateornever acks result in the same thingthe pc running on and on and on and they call it letting the pc itsa bah if pc talks too much in session he either is getting cut off too fast by the auditor or hasnt got an auditor at all it isnt 78itsa its lousy trs the one single exception is the pc who had years in analysis but even he begins to get better with proper trs used on him the proper cure is to drill the auditor until the auditor realizes 1 the auditor asks the questions 2 the pc says what is the answer its 3 the auditor acks when the pc has said it to the pcs satisfaction and 4 the auditor acks when the pc has finished saying its and thats itsa scientology auditing is precision skill not gag blop goo slup guck blah 1 the auditor wants to know 2 the pc says it is 1 2 1 2 1 2 etc tech savvy now an auditor who doesnt know his technology about the mind and his processes of course never knows what to ask so he or she simply sits like lump of sacking hoping the pc will say something that makes the pc feel better sure sign that an auditor doesnt know an engram from cow about processes is seeing pc itsa on and on and on in scientology we do know what the mind is what being is what goes wrong in the mind and how to correct it we arent psychoanalysts or psychiatrists or harley street witch doctors we do know the data about beings and life is there in scientology to be learned it isnt our idea of how things are or our opinion of scientology is precision subject it has axioms like geometry two equilateral triangles arent similar because euclid said so theyre similar because they are if you dont believe it look at them there isnt single datum in scientology that cant be proven as precisely as teacups are teacups and not saucepans now if we get person fresh out of the study of the mystical metaphysics of cuffbah hes going to have trouble his pcs are going to itsa their heads off and never get well or better or anything because that person doesnt know scientology but thinks its all imprecise opinion the news about scientology is that it put the study of the mind into the precise exact sciences if one doesnt know that ones pcs itsa by the hour for one doesnt know what he is handling that he is calling pc by my definition an auditor is real auditor when his or her pcs dont overtalk or undertalk but answer the auditing question and happily now and then originate 79so how to tell an auditor how to determine if you have trained one at last is do his pcs answer up or do they talk on and on if i had an auditor in an hgc whose pcs yapped and yapped and ran dry and yapped while the auditor just sat there like chinese pilot frozen on the controls i would do the following to that auditor 1 remedy book of case remedies 2 remedy b book of case remedies 3 disagreements with scientology technology and orgs and scientology personalities all found and traced to basic and blown 4 grind study assignment of the scientology axioms until the auditor could do them in clay 5 memorization of the logics qs prelogics and axioms of dianetics and scientology 6 trs 0 to 4 until they ran out of his or her ears 7 trs 5 to 9 8 op pro by dup until flat 9 hard long study of the meter 10 the arc triangle and other scales 11 the processes of level 0 12 some wins and id have an auditor id have one that could make grade zero release every time and its lack of the above that causes an auditor to say i let the pc itsa with the pc talking on and on and on scientology is the

recognition of rightness of the being taken from the lrh tape good indicators 7 january 1964 an auditors tendency is to look for wrongnesses he is always trying to find something wrong with the pc thats the nature of scientology we assume that there is something wrong with somebody otherwise he wouldnt be here and be dead in his head and he would be capable of doing great deal more than he is doing at the particular moment an individual is basically and routinely good capable of many actions and considerable power in the state of free thetan or native state he is far more powerful individual than when hes been complicated up its the idea of the additive data to the thetan try to give somebody something he doesnt want and you are going to overthrow his power of choice his power of choice is the only thing that he had to begin with which gave him power capability and anything else and that power of choice has been consistently and continuously overthrown by giving him things he didnt want and taking away from him things he didnt want to get rid of back and forth you get the individual pretty overwhelmed and he goes down in power what happened to him actually is he solved something that didnt need solving there was something he couldnt confront so he solved it and he fixed the solution anytime you fix these solutions for ever and ever you put the individual down grade an individual becomes aberrated by additives his experiences in this universe are usually calculated to degrade and depower him now all you have to do is pick up all of these crisscrosses and you return him to power man is an addedto being and everything that has been added to him has decreased his ability to cope when you add something to the being he gets worse we are in the business of deleting wrongnesses from the individual even the freudian analyst realized that some additive had been added that should be deleted so the idea of deleting something to bring about recovery is not new with us because we are in the business of deleting wrongnesses from the individual we seldom look at rightnesses and thats whats wrong with most auditors they are so anxious to find the wrongnessand quite properlyand they never really look at the rightness if they dont look at the rightnesses that are present then they arent appreciating the degrees of truth that are present that can be promoted into more truth 82in other words they are starting at level of truth present all the time so of course they never make any forward progress you must realize that there must be truth present and that this truth must be recognized and that this is handinglove part of auditing the recognition of the fact that truth is present if you only look for wrongnesses and only recognize wrongnesses then you will never be able to pull anything up gradient because you wont think you have any rightnesses to work with it just all looks wrong to you you have to be able to look at the wrongnesses in order to right them but we also have to be able to look at the rightnesses in order to increase them we are only trying to find wrongnesses in order to increase rightnesses and thats very important if you have rightnesses present in session you will never be able to make any progress of any kind progress is built on gradient scale of rightnesses by which you delete wrongnesses and they drop and fall away therefore processing is an action by which wrongnesses can be deleted from the case to the degree that rightnesses are present in the session you cannot take case that doesnt have any rightness present and delete wrongness so you have to realize that there are rightnesses present and then you increase those rightnesses that makes it possible for you to pick up the wrongnesses and thats what auditing consists of auditing is contest of maintaining rightnesses so that we can delete wrongnesses if you keep on deleting wrongnesses all the while maintaining and increasing the rightnesses you eventually wind up with very right being you are trying to get right being therefore if you dont continually encourage right beingness you never wind up with right being you must learn to observe an auditing session you want your pc to wind up in right state in more native more capable less overwhelmed higher power of choice sort of state you want him to wind up with more rightnesses therefore if you audit so that you do not encourage and increase rightnesses then you wont wind up with right pc the degree of rightness you have present must exceed the wrongness you are going to pick up its proportional action if youve got as much wrongness in session as youve got rightness youre not riding on any cushion it makes very difficult job of auditing if you want to pick up this little wrongness you have to have rightnesses present which are big enough to engulf it that makes easy auditing if the rightnesses in the session are very minor and the problem is tiny one there isnt enough rightness in the session to handle the problem and the pc cannot erase it the pcs ability to asis or erase in session is directly proportional to the number of good indicators present in the session and his inability to cope in session rises proportionally to the number of bad indicators present in session any process has its own series of bad indicators and the bad indicator moves in when the good indicator moves out so you have to have primary knowledge of good indicators dont look for bad indicators on and on and on youll drive the pc around the bend and suppress the good indicators what you want to do is know your good indicators for the level you are running so well that when one of them disappears out of 83the session your ears go up and you instantly look for the bad indicator dont look for the bad indicator until you see the vanishment of the good indicator otherwise youre continually prowling around looking for wrongnesses in session and you keep pc very upset and you get auditing done of any kind whatsoever remember this next time you see pc start to bog and drag and flounder one way or the other youve got to get the pcs good indicators back in before you can get the pc to handle what you want him to handle what influences the attitude of the pc is an arc break that of course is influenced earlier by the auditors behavior or the pc has an overt on the auditor or the pc has missed withhold an auditor who never gets in and finds out what is wrong in the sessionthe reasonable auditormesses up pcs like mad if all the good

hat supervisor course revision in this type style checksheets supervisor hats cancels btb of 22 april 1971 same title cramming series 1r cramming purpose to teach the student what he has missed what he is what he does the cramming officer should be the most skilled supervisor in the place he should handle only causes as basic as he can get then he sets the fellow back on the road cramming requires individual skilled attention by someone who is willing to 2 way comm and knows the subject under discussion well enough to be able to find where specific points are covered crammings purpose is to teach the student what hes missed to do that it must handle both why he missed it and what was missed stable data 1 things are caused they do not just happen 2 the cause lies earlier than the effect 3 it is not human to err nor is it reasonable to forget things nor are there people who are naturally slow 4 though stupidity comes in general from charge on the case thoroughly remarkable changes can be effected in rate and thoroughness of data assimilation independent of general auditing by use of study technology 5 basic when blown discharges the rest of the chain basic is earlier in practice the why of suddenly slowed rate of study or of an overt product can be found and gotten rid of by looking just before the change and fixing up what you find sometimes one has to carry the matter earlier especially in the case of improving study rate that is generally slow results another stable datum is if it didnt resolve the situation it wasnt the right cause of it you dont know what was bogging the guy until you find itits easy to evaluate what you think must be wrong with the guy or sell your wins or cogs but its very hard on the guy youre cramming 87the route to 100 results on the students is persistence in finding the actual cause hammering the same point over and over just doesnt find the cause of repeating error and there shouldnt even be the first error if he did the course properly when hes found not youve found when hes found whats out youll have as many vgis as you could ask for and the error will not repeat log book keep log book giving the date and name of student reason sent to cramming this gives good idea of how the student is doing program the cramming officer gets into 2way comm with the student to estimate what needs to be done and lines up short program of steps to be taken in cramming this is done in duplicate the original is handed to the student the cramming officer retains the duplicate for his record and so he can trace the students progress and bring it to rapid completion the students should be kept busy graph trend go over the students daily graph of study stats and from the point of downward trend check the checksheet for what was being studied at that time or just before cramming tech the standard of just taking the bulletin hes hung up on and asking for missed word in the previous bulletin or previous section of the bulletin works great and often simply this would handle the situation whatever it is it is something and there are finite number of things it can be frequently the student will offer word and then half withdraw ityet usually its the very first one he offers when asked so when you ask for word take whats offered all too often the word the guy hung up on is one he almost believes or fully believes he knows basic tool your most basic tool is the full cycle of the misunderstood very large part of the time you have to use the whole thing say youre cramming an auditor whos just goofed cs has sent him to cramming on r3r steps as in the middle of session he started dropping commands your first task is to find what exactly occurred there can be bad admin or other varieties of false reports then why that occurred looking earlier in many cases something else preceded gross obvious goofs he did the course hes got right ever to goof that data aha he wasnt sure if he should have been running that item on the pc seemed like narrative now with the initial goof to hand you find the principle that wasnt understood on check yep he doesnt understand what its ok to run or not to run in dianetics aha aha and what word or term yes he doesnt know what narrative means clay demo of narrative full demonot can somebody guess after looking it up checkout on couple of hco bs and the guys in business then you 88can assess how much restudy of what is needed and groove him in to not omit commands even when flustered now he can learn and will apply other tools all standard study tech is at your disposal hcob feb 21 66 definition processes hc stress analysis etc will get many student out of the soup by themselves frequently student proves to be pushed too far along the gradient and simply needs to be put back to the proper slot often all mass and doingness get left aside and only theory gets donethe guy never got an emeter or looked at pc sometimes the guys programmed onto the wrong course entirelycompletely without purpose on the one hes on when simply asking for missed word draws blank sometimes he cant spot one offhand you can simply ask for the prior area the fellow feels weak in or disagrees with or feels unsure of and from that easily get the missed term clay of terms which the guy missed and hung up on helps lotwhether in the present or previous similar subject this approach works very well when cramming in relation to subject involving only activity where there was particular study of printed matter associated with it when there appears to be earlier counterpolicy and countertech come into this frequently the guy knows the data but also knows something else that is either directly misunderstood or the result of misunderstood theres obvious earlier error he just all the time erroneously omits the r3r step despite having been checked out obviously if its simply matter of gee i never saw that before your job is easy and the why is simply didnt do the material in the first place but say the exec did the course but still wont ever train his staff hes full of apparent comprehension but doesnt apply well theres the overtwont trainyet he feels hes doing right or he wouldnt be doing it fine your approach is why was what you did the right thing to do in those circumstances what made it ok to commit the overt ones got to cope and get the product out good whats the policy covering that that youre usingget copy please you take the policy hes using as the reason whether an actual policy bulletin or someones order or even an everybody knows from psychology and find the principle not understood and the word missed that led to the misunderstanding and youre back in business maybe above it turns out the guy didnt know he should have set someone to organize behind him and finally didnt know what product meant at all repaired the guy will now at last both cope and train slow students often subjects studied earlier and usually blown from have to be addressed eg one student couldnt seem to get or find his misunderstood on the ethics section of oec this was traced back to term hed never understood while studying law and magically he suddenly understood the ethics policies he was studying 89sometimes the student has gone past 2030 misunderstoods and each one has to be defined eg one student had never completed his hsdc because he couldnt read dmsmh hed gone 13 way through and utterly bogged after defining word after word he hadnt understood with the student getting brighter and brighter he suddenly statedhey its easy to read now cramming auditors the first thing to do is to go over the cs the session the cs comments and cramming actions to be done trace back misunderstoods to basic and from that indicate which hco bs to restudy on often the auditor will originate another area of uncertainty take these up too and handle each one other standard tools student rescue intensives sometimes are lifesaver the learning drill even op pro by dup with cs ok trs 09 and all sorts of drills as issued eg 101104 assist tr errors are as fundamental errors as you can get on an auditorexcept perhaps can he sit in the chair the courses large part of the cramming officers responsibility lies in correcting the courses that trained the guy being crammed if it had been run all that standardly youd not have expected the fellow to wind up in cramming sometimes the student himself isnt at fault at allcommon course outnesses which the cramming officer may have to see corrected before students can get anywhere are 1 supervisor 2 materials 3 checksheet 4 improper checksheet 5 checkouts available 6 all theory or perhaps theory with demos or clay substituted for an actual practical section 7 supervisor 2way comm in use nothing mystic here just one talks to anyone 8 evaluated tech eg by supervisor or fellow student 9 uneducated supervisors in generalnot using or applying the study tech themselves 10 bad equipment especially tape recorders 11 student has never done the student hat not knowing study tech at all himself doesnt know how to study and so never learns anything the cramming officer in the face of course and supervisor outnesses as above must firstly unbug the student and get him winning again then call in the supervisor or supervisors involved and get them corrected in the case of course 90admin who cant maintain the tape recorders he is pulled in and fully corrected in this area supervision and cs very often the student is having difficulty because of poor supervision he would be learning well and progressing if the supervisor were better trained or crammed the same situation could exist with the cs he may need training and cramming this should not be overlooked by cramming officer who sees too many students or auditors being sent for the same difficulties it is the cramming officers responsibility to keep supervisors and cses trained as well the student hat the cramming officer may find that the student has never learned how to be student he was never hatted never got an rfactor on what was expected of him as student it is simple to get him hatted with the student hat this does not apply only to students in tech training and technical personnel but to admin students as well staff personnel on admin courses staff status oec hats are also students and require hatting and cramming they should not be neglected by the cramming officer coaching to win occasionally you will find coach who cant give himself or another win he coaches toward loss this could go so far as to not let himself progress just to keep his fellow student back or he may never let his fellow student passor pass him when he doesnt deserve it this could require auditing to resolve but good cramming officer can handle this by finding the why and getting it handled and find the area he has losses on and get the misunderstoods off invalidation and correcting the wrong why one barrier to study is the conviction that right datum is wrong or not to be applied the only resolution to this is finding and pulling off whatever or however it got invalidated and then rapid restudy of the area student ordered to restudy his finance pack because he doesnt know his finance policy will profit from the study best after the why is located specifically and straightened up once hes found say his misunderstood in how to do payroll he can then study the rest of the pack in staff study with profit and certainty restudy without finding whats out tends to leave him in doubt about all his comprehension of the materials and he ends up more uncertain of the materials than before unless he happens to spot the exact error in the course of the general review there is cause persistence is probably the keynote since he can do it and b sometimes the first thing you find and well handle does not resolve the situation then c there was something else awry too you follow each cycle to vgicog vgicog doesnt necessarily resolve the whole show but it ends an action sometimes you get good change as my god you know ive never really known what an fn was or you know ive always avoided 91finance policy and dont really understand it at all that does end that action but then you still have to find the misunderstoods in the policy and drill checkout etc basics the most common misunderstoods of tech students and students on admin courses alike lie in the basics metering trs understanding of the auditors code the basic theory of the human mind strict honesty and honor as an auditor these are the things the student should learn early and what good cramming officer always looks for because if the student did not learn them early in his trainingor if he had had an earlier than scientology misunderstoodhis later training will hang up somewhere the cramming officer should check for things like what is the mind what is charge what is the time track what happens when something keys in what happens when something keys outor erases what is it that makes the meter read what is mass questions like this should be asked and good demos done then the cramming officer can go earlier and earlier he may find the misunderstood in earlier subjects algebra science philosophy simple multiplication it could be anywhere and the cramming officer tracks it down trs metering auditors code the auditors integrity are drilled so that they apply to the sessions the auditor runs the student or auditor will cognite that these are for use and not just for drilling the cramming officer is there to unbug the auditor and student wherever the bug or flaw may be it must be tracked down to basic and cleared up every org must have good cramming officer without cramming officer auditing and training are not

the auditor with the folder and cramming order b go over the folder locating all errors in sequence earliest to latest c find the why for the goof on meter d ensure the cramming order handles the why is short and written in sequence of gradient handling including basics see that the misunderstoods are cleaned up back to the basics eg errors handling out ruds traced back through basic auditing series to the auditors code always use wc 1 2 4 6 7 and 9 in addition to starrates and clay f have the auditor drill the procedure flubbed until flawless g have the auditor do trs 04 69 if necessary debugging individual trs on gradient of perfection h if chronic error metering error or low hours check over his meter position eyes and his handling of the meter and ot tr 0 and tr 0 particularly i now with the error corrected and basics in interview the auditor and verify that the why is handled and send to the pc examiner as vgis fning student j if fn check him over on the meter for bypassed why or misunderstoods isolate the area and get it corrected and word cleared m2 9 and starrated and drilled k write up the why and key actions of the handling for the cs attach the fn exam form and route to the cs logged as complete 93steps b have several parts show b tell c obnosis d what happened just before that show in many instances if person is asked what was done he will not report exactly what was done so cramming off should get person to show him what he did cramming off has to hand cramming order his first action is to get the person to demonstrate by going through the motions in many cases he wont have to go any further because the demonstration will immediately show what was wrong and requiring correction for example an interne is having trouble with assessment but simple demonstration shows that he does not know how to set up for session he has his meter way over to the left the worksheets in the center and the assessment sheet way over to his right and thus cannot see the list the meter and the pc all in one field of vision such demo can take one minute and save cramming off 20 minutes of digging in admin cramming show can take the cramming off into the staff members area tell when show is not possible have the person tell what happened exactly what did you do is stable datum get the exact sequence of events not lot of ramble if very confused have the person use demo kit dont get caught up in reasons or explanations obnosis the cramming officer must be able to pick out the outnesses in what is being said or shown one doesnt have to be an expert to recognize and follow down something that doesnt make sense what happened just before that in some cases particularly in the tech cramming area the cramming off will have to find out what happened just before the goof when checking for what happened just before goof the cramming off will find something he didnt understand andor b something he couldnt control new interne flubs the commands of r3r now if the cramming off doesnt ask what happened just before that he may miss out on his why he will probably find out that the interne realized he was running out of paper or some such common incidence which caused him to become flustered trs to go out and he flubbed the commands in this case through his own lack of planning and setup actions the interne lost control of the session so the cramming off will cram the interne on session setup actions and strengthen his tr 0 through the use of trs booklets and tapes and see that he continues daily trs training on the interneship when look into situation does not readily show up why go earlier and find out what happened ethics the only hidden barrier to real success in cramming is nonparticipation the indicator of out ethics cramming off must recognize out ethics and get it handled he may be able to get the staff member to handle it on the spot or he may have to send the person to ethics or even to integrity processing the point is to recognize the barrier to progress and get it removed 94supervisor cramming unless qual is also correcting training where needful cramming will be overloaded with flubbed

brought in and handled can the supervisor see what is happening in the classroom can he handle what he sees any supervisor with down stats dropouts blows or slow students must become bait for continuing correction program until the standard is way up and into an acceptable level the value of good academy or hsdc supervisor who runs snap and pop courses gets his students through rapidly and thoroughly is extremely high in this case he is personally worth about two times that of top hgc auditor in terms of beans into the org has and hqs course supers prove their worth in future beans and resignups in the org they help to create future business in the academy and the hgc therefore proven top supervisors should not be ignored as areas of facility differential supervisor is handled in cramming like any other person in for correction the situation is located the why found and the handling for that why executed there are many such situations and whys to be found on most to get them

ordered to word clear the entire materials on that checksheet in cramming when certain materials have already been word cleared and the student is still goofing on the procedure it must be considered that he has confusion re the sequences of actions and the student must be very heavily drilled on that action the cramming officer has the whole resources of the org library to call upon many books contain key data applicable to every level and these should be used liberally in cramming if an auditor is showing ignorance of datum or rule it is quite possible that he never read it the three main areas investigated in cramming are 1 the student or auditor never read it the exact data may not have been on an earlier checksheet done on subject so one always ensures that all the data is to hand

goofs with any additional data in detail to the cs cs receiving cramming order back giving why or an unreal why that does not make sense when compared with the session and its results must return the

exact specifics and all outnesses listed separately details may have to be obtained from the cramming log book every time something is repeated put slash alongside the item 3 now ask the person to write up any other off policy or out tech actions being done or not done on post which have not been picked up 4 add these to the original list putting slash every time an item is repeated 1165 now work with the staff member to group the outnesses together by subject area level or basic tech personnel outnesses will sort out into training levels or into basics of auditing course or case supervision as applicable b admin staff outnesses will sort out into staff member basics key hat duties scn basics and other categories listed in btb 7 june 73 ra admin cramming 6 add up all the slashes of the combined items this will locate the major situation as the one with the greatest number of slashes and the minor situations the remainder in order of number of slashes 7 take up the major situation and indicate this to the staff member this should bring in vgis if not go back and redo the above steps adding any missed data until you do get vgis 8 now find the why for the major situation this must bring in vgis the why finding is done on the meter 9 work out handling for the why which will handle the hell out of it 10 get the handling done immediately 11 when the handling has been completed send the staff member to the pc examiner if fn vgis find the right why and complete the handling indicated by the right why 12 end off the handling of the major situation to fn vgis 13 now take up the minor situations in order of greatest number of slashes and find each why and handle separately 14 there can be an ep to this action the person has tremendous resurgence of post efficiency stats and morale and he is doing well again end off the cramming at that point but see that remaining situations and whys are handled either in interne or staff training this action can be done on an oldtime auditor who is anxious to return to auditing in order to clean up the past major areas of failure an old hpahca could get this action done in cramming for fee of course prior to

correction actions are done in qual and the assessment form is routed to the pc folder for the auditing actions needed to be done and staff cs advised do not buy case reasons as whys for staff member post flubs there are always post or staff reasons for flubs however if the cramming officer finds that staff on his lines are misaudited or not audited he should chit the d of p and staff training officer for failure to take responsibility for seeing that staff get regular intensives on rotational basis and that staff members in trouble do have their folders checked for out tech and do get corrected 117when it is found that the staff member never studied or checked out on key data or post hat material in the first place the correct cramming handling is to cram in the key material so the person can now function and see that post training program is written up by pers programmer and done in staff training the one to five steps in the method above do not take more than half to one hour at the most do not hesitate to use trs and drills on staff members in admin cramming they need trs and drilling as much as tech personnel what to do with the staff member who has never been crammed in the first place as admin cramming starts being used more regularly in orgs cramming officers will find themselves with bogged staff who have never had any cramming he will then be handling an actual backlog situation which is unexpressed in this case he should get writeup from the div head involved of exactly how this person has been operating and the outnesses observed the cramming officer should then get the person himself to write up what he considers that he has been or has not been doing plus writeup of exactly what post training the person has had the cramming off goes over the data with the person and they sort out and group the outnesses as found thus locating the key outness to be handled for this person the handling will be what will rapidly handle the why found and enable the person to function on post this action must be followed by an immediate post program by the personnel programmer and completed in staff training the cramming off must report div heads who wont cram their staff to the qual sec for cramming correction orders on the div heads themselves the steps of this bulletin are remarkably efficient in locating major hidden areas of outness in order to be able to handle them the hardest part in handling person who is badly bogged is just where do you start these steps give an exact sequence to do this and are incredibly easy to do ens judy ziff

over out ruds cramming officer can fail in his efforts to correct flubbing staff member if he tries to cram over out ruds cramming done over an arc break like auditing will result in the person getting worse more out of comm or misemotional cramming person over problem or wh will produce change so correction will occur out ruds are easy to spot the person with an arc break wont talk or is misemotional or antagonistic problem produces fixated attention that prevents cramming from finding the actual area of difficulty natter and 11 remarks means withhold recently musician being crammed kept bringing up dispatch that he was in mystery about concerning the group every time it was mentioned it read or bded yet the cramming officer continued cramming him and never handled it so product i sat the musician down told him he was crammed over problem the mystery about the dispatch cleaned it up by getting the dispatch and letting him go over it made sure the problem was handled then found the area of misunderstood and traced it back to an early age and the why fell right out and i got the cramming officer crammed by the senior cs and found her why too so the moral of the story is dont cram over out ruds it is too costly in lost production and flaps cramming officer flubs when the cramming officer flubs you must get him crammed fast because he will repeat the error on others and there goes your results in such cases get him crammed immediately by the qual sec or senior cs if it is the qual sec who has flubbed then he is crammed either by the senior cs or the keeper of tech incomplete handling it is often not enough just to correct why and do further handling in cramming most cramming cycles reveal broader area of situation which must also be handled an example is the auditor who flubs on an l4br and during the cramming reveals he never really listened to the key shsbc ln tapes 119the cramming officer who does not also program the auditor for review of those tapes would not have fully corrected that auditor you could accurately predict future ln flubs and pc upsets subsequent program such as the one above would count as an additional cramming cycle for the cramming officer or retread if lengthy and would count as additional points therefore the maxim of cramming is handle the hell out of it honest correction must be fully and completely done for the sake of the public and the org as well as the staff member summary cramming success depends on not cramming over out ruds and on fully handling all areas of confusion or weakness follow these operating rules and you will enjoy rave results and real correction and your org stats will soar l ron hubbard founder lrhntrd copyright 1974 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 120hubbard

found to be study tech not in use for individual whys for each supervisor and student similar example exists where tapes with scientology materials were not in full or proper use the why being tapes with scientology materials not in use for an individual why for each org person concerned in each case the tech of finding the individual why is necessary to handling the broad why this tech is contained in the data series pls and is restated here in brief form for finding the why on person steps 1 know the data series pls dont have any misunderstood words on them 2 work out exactly what the person should be producing 3 work out the ideal scene 4 investigate the existing scene observe the scene around the person for outpoints related to what the person should be doing in an ideal scene verify that there is situation with that individual and that you know what the situation is dont go trying to find the why of situation bad situation is measured by the difference between existing scene and an ideal scene and threat to ideal scene 5 ask the person exact specific questions pertaining to the situation 6 do not at any time ask the person for the why if the person knew the why the situation wouldnt exist 7 use the comm formula and get your questions answered dont be diverted by the persons reasons 1228 note all outpoints 9 be alert for the areas with the most outpoints which relate to the situation 10 verify the data by looking this will often reveal the major outpoint which leads to the why it must be realized that you are often looking for an omitted something hence knowledge of the ideal scene and product is required 11 when you find major outpoint trace down the chain of outpoints to the why pull the string by asking more questions in the area of the major outpoint 12 the big crashing outpoint that explains all the other outpoints will be the why 13 the why must have something to do with the person if not you will have why is god and it wont resolve 14 indicate the why to the person correct whys result in cogs and vgis wrong why can make the person feel degraded will not bring in vgis and will not lead to resolution of the situation 15 look over existing resources 16 get bright idea of how to handle 17 handle or recommend handling so that it stays handled the handling of the why must directly relate to the why that was found examples 1 situation supervisor not using study tech investigation supervisor was observed found to be very casual with students 8c supervisor questioned all outpoints in area of supervisor not wanting to tell students what to do and himself not liking to be told what to do why big button on control and does not want to control others why was indicated with cognitions and vgis after initial her on the

required product handling product rundown 5 situation d of p not doing standard duties letting pcs stall on lines investigation checked hat and flow chart found flow chart had been done but never referred to and missing all the key points where pcs can stall on lines expecting pcs to arrive back at hgc of their own accord why unawareness of lines and terminals and how they can be influenced handling line drills following pipes and flow lines in an engine room make up correct flow chart and drill it after finding the why and getting the handling implemented the situation is again reviewed to see if it still exists if so wrong why was found the handling is to redo the steps and get the correct why why which cannot be handled or does not lead toward attainment of the ideal scene is of course wrong why the finding of individual whys on persons is normally very fast action the why is simply found and the handling implemented the more you do of them the faster and more expert you become metered why finding when why finding is done on meter the above steps still pertain however meter reads are used to help establish the situation and track down the why falls or bd would indicate the right area the correct why would result in fn cog vgis at this point you would indicate the why and continue with steps 1416 metered why finding should end with an fn worksheets are kept

question is omitted from dianetic r3r patter on drugs and when running evil purposes or intentions one does not ask the pc if he is interested in running the item the requirement on both drug items and intentions is that the item read on the meter suppress and inval can be used and has not been run by r3r previously many pcs it has now been found have replied interest on drug item the item has not been run and the pc then continued to have trouble with drugs checking back pcs who returned to drugs after auditing showed drug rundowns that were so brief as to be nothing one pc who had been on lsd for years had only i hour quickie drug rundown later this person relapsed tracing this in each case the interest question had been used and the pc had replied interest but meant im longer interested in drugs so drug items that have read are run r3r without asking for interest the command is simply omitted in expanded dianetics the same thing has occurred in running evil purposes or intentions the auditor asked the pc if he was interested in running the item and the pc said and so it went untouched but the pc had it confused with interest in doing the purpose and missed running it and then fell on his head later tracing the case back it was found that rses and such had not been run due to the pc saying interest nothing bad will happen if the item is run cs responsibility the cs must keep telling his auditors on drugs or expanded dianetics omit asking for interest on r3r on these drug intentions run them if they read on the meter repair in repairing cases it is good sense

asks if the pc is interested in running it the pc says the auditor does not run it bang we have bypassed case the pc will blow or go sour or not recover one of these cases was unchanged after drug rundown he had pair of eyes that looked like blank discs check of folder showed all major drug items not run due to interest the solution was to recover the lists run the items that had read r3r triple and complete the case another one blew his folder was examined every evil purpose had been left unrun of the items from the wants handled rundown the intentions were mislisted the drug rundown failed due to interest each flubbed case i am finding has had his drug items and evil purposes left unrun on r3r due to interest so dont ask for interest on intentions evil purposes and drug items if they read run them repair 1 on any stumbling case that has had drug rundown or expanded dianetics get the folder fesed to see if reading items were left unrun on r3r triple list them chronologically early to late 2 get the case back with an r factor of incomplete 3 run every one of those unrun drug items intentions and evil purposes 4 if the items dont now read then get in suppress and invalidate

happened today as yesterday headache intensified as day went on its pretty bad now thats all 2622 falling and clean med gis auditors commentsh std remains rs on contemptuous on lx2 rs on unemotional lrh comment well he hasnt made his hidden standard yet headaches are rough to run usually from 1968 tech they are taken apart by finding what psea is connected with the headache and run that headache is after the fact of being hit in the head theres lot on this in earlier dn he gave it to you and you ran it narrative well okay if you recall the earlier materials however it says headache is after the fact of an injury so is not the beginning of the incident headache and this chain you ran all had eb you should realize that so now we know though real fault that this pc 1 rses psychosis equals succumb 2 headache is usually after the engram of injury leaves an eb 3 that aches are taken apart for psea 4 that the case is slightly misprogrammed and needs intentions not attitudes as the attitudes are after the fact of an evil purpose in psycho case 149so we repair this failed chain headaches we get the intentions in the head by an ln list or we look up old ev purps run were wrong or he wouldnt rs still we reprogram for intentions not attitudes for reason of the rs intention very strong to die so pc wont get well until intentions handled beware of wrong list an rs pc is trying to die evil purpose and the auditor is trying to make him live this gives you an intention counterintention problem so all such pcs are problems to audit see cs series 22 28 nov 70 psychosis so change the program to include intentions as type of attitude headache is common with outint we have to know before we go lrh cs 1 assess this headache is because of misrun wentin chain b this headache is

spends the next session clearing up one word and ends with havingness feel that auditors comments and cs 16472 words is really where he is we went on huge chain 3 12 hrs to clear sensation i looked at that wccl 25 jan 72doesnt seem he answered 2 of the questionsjust said yeh fngis exam27 jan 72 another wccl only tick handled looks on last q pc didnt understand said yes then and got fn and then 8rr fnedno commentat exams gis declare q asked comm lag yeh small fn ok inds 3 feb 72 bogs on m2 wccl done probable mus 7 feb 72 red tab declare on wccl get reexam after some m2 and declares so his wcing is badyou were so correct i would like to change pgm bit to clear all words on wccl and wc cs 1 then wcclthen verify or complete m 1 lrh comment and cs 17472 on auditors cs very well done your original observation found this he must have been arc brk fning on the original actions on separate sheet very well done you found the original clue to all this 203so he must have been doing an arc brk fn on earlier wccls this means hes been run possibly over an arc brk gives him his sad effect possible ethics action on the earlier m1 completion so this pc is held down only by words with tons of auditing not knowing the words hes never been audited means one ever cleared commands on him thus hes chronic case this is classic really of what were achieving and how 1 clear arc brk carefully 2 check for arc brk long duration 3 clear word chain 4 clear all words on wccl wc cs 1 5 wccl 6 wclear m 1 verified as complete the auditor does the cs successfully wcing is continued for 7 sessions with good results however in the next session the pc gets sad and red tabs at the examiner pc statement i was kind of uncertain about just which words i didnt u well enough auditors comment and cs 21472 arc brk at exam pc in sad effect not sure on words which are mu bogging bit he needs wccl but thats what im trying to clear words for probably resolve on arc brk 1 fly arc brk rud and in your last session arc brk rud i cleared those words 2 clear ptp and mwh fly each and each as in your last session 3 clear words fraternity lodge society into develop form thematic motif cycle wavelength

getting an fn amongst the words ta went up on fasten after that pg 4 he got dopey and you didnt grab what hed really not understood also the long haul of this if fns will move him back into implants as these contain words mass and force fn is sign of release but from what look up the word if release then fn if fn release your cs wont handle because its bpc stirred up and that responds to handling

i dont feel bad about confused but dont feel good about somethingword clearing thats what it is the auditor clears this word later on page 20 21 of the worksheet the auditor is clearing the word sent the pc says i know what it means auditor mu pc nope laugh yeh i dont know what it means i try to convince you laugh the auditor continues and clears it the 26472 session ends on an fn and an fn exam the next session again wcing the pc red tabs at examiner auditors comments and cs 27472 pc had sore throat so ended session and took him in later hard going pc had considerations how he should feel how long it should last how should be done but actual bog was arc brk with his being considered ethics and chronic sickie hes worried about status and being expelled decided he should get status made certain by chaplain doesnt get on with mo since bits of this have come up before i want it handled before i continue auditing him main problem in ta was it was over arc brk 0 pc to get status verified with chaplain when pc satisfied 1 fly all ruds 2 complete step 4 of pgm 3 continue pgm lrh comments and cs 28472 on auditors cs well done by exams didnt get his ruds in fully or youd have made it on separate sheet you didnt get ruds in pc was not in comm you dont run ruds any old way and you must not clear words over soaring ta i just sent down cs the other day to you 22 apr 72 same pc ordering you to get an fn between words on 26 apr pg 20 21 of earlier session words got out of sequence pc was actually out rud protesting session lrh had ringed i try to convince you laugh in green on the worksheet and written protest earlier on pg 10 hes skipping about amongst words confused becomes clearing the cause of all this weird action in the session is on the earliest pg 8 26 april where the arc brk got 2 reads and you didnt reassess pgm outness clearing backlog of words was pgm error that left us without cleared wccl now needed the general outness is trying to audit someone on ethics lines in some way footnote the auditor had assessed arcu and gotten sf on both c and u and had indicated u instead of reassessing 206your suggestion is correct to get it handled by someone acting as chaplain probably host but there are errors here of an auditing nature moving to new room pcs attn not catching protest 0 chaplain interview 1 l 1 c recently 2 wccl m5 handle hosts report i interviewed ______ pc as requested the situation was pretty much all handled by him as he went on his own determinism and spoke to the chaplainmo last night after session he was concerned that the mo had worse opinion of his medical history than was in fact the case he felt that as the mo had big say in whether he is offloaded or notthis was an uncool situation the mo gave him the rfactor that it is combination of bad mo history and production that gives offload this brought in his gis as he felt he was able to produce and hold his own and his status as so member was longer in danger because of someone elses opinion says its all handled gis the auditor spends two sessions handling the wccl it seems nicely cleaned up so auditor suggests going back to wcing and pgm however before the next session the pc reports to the examiner sprained my ankle at exercisesscorched my hands on the gravel going to be hard going up and down stairs 44 40 pc limps out auditor grabs him and gives him touch assist pc red tabs at the examiner ta 35 auditors comment and cs 2572 sprained anklescraped handlimping i cant put him on footplates as he has bandage on foot and he cant hold cans very well in one handso hes bit false ta now touch assist went very well 1 touch assist 2 hav repeated later in the day if needed lrh comment 3 may 72 on auditors cs ok but this cat is pts on separate sheet proceeding well but _________________________ footnote the chaplains hat is worn by the mo who the pc does not get along with 207has himself an accident he is obviously pts as he roller coastered add pts check to pgm your cs of touch assist and hav is okay the touch assist was given and pcs foot getting better the word clearing is continued with touch assist being given each session to win the wcing is continued for several sessions after the session on 7572 the pc comes to the examiner and says feel alright about that 25 fn normal auditors comments and cs 7572 almost done 1 fly all ruds overts triple added by lrh 2 complete clearing wccl and 8rr 3 hav lrh comments very well done he seemed bit dull at exams heavy on ruds next session the next session the auditor completes clearing the wccl and wc cs 1 the pc is sent to the d of p for pts check however before he has it an grabs him and does some product clearing on him he goes to the examiner the next morning and says _____ did some product clearing on last night i didnt feel very good about it probably had misunderstood word 24 dn that day the pts check is done and dns at the examiner this arrives back with the auditor who has to spend two sessions clearing up the botched product clearing and then starts in on clearing up mus on the pts materials auditors comment and cs 17572 put ethics in on him saw him reading science fiction book when he has time and cant get through pts materials told him to get through fast and keep ethics in or auditing he could wait this came when i found him not doing it during his study and auditing hrs after completing pts materials 1 fly all ruds 2 mu on pts materials 3 fly all ruds on pts 4 complete pts check lrh comment 18572 very well done now hear this you did very well getting his outethics spotted with this you opened the door to resolution of sticky case hes good to man or beast and will get case gain with his ethics out that isnt all hes doing loafing during study 208now he is on one rd pts and we find another needed so we cant switch rds so we add it to pgm right after what were doing standard op procedure so redo this pgm its messy anyway put in 3 may 72 pl by the auditor has 2 lists ln in it and handle we should have done 3 may 72 pl before the pts rd your cs is okay the auditor continues the clearing of words to do with pts check and then completes the pts check auditors comments and cs 21572 all it took was clearing the materialsso he knew what was going on then went very well he began to make sort of list so i will be alert for outlists he is not

cs unsuccessfully auditors comment and cs immediately after 2wc to fn and rfactor his ta soared came down on several areas but climbed again after each one he maintains he is not aware of whing anything yet he has soaring ta on something not or or protest i didnt go into the r3r chain due to the high ta i believe there is some wh he is notising so heavily he doesnt believe he has one he fned at exams after high ta in session which is odd i am unsure how to get him off it so we can do the rd if it does not violate the program i would suggest hilo ta list or some other assessment prepared 1 clear hilo words and assess and handle to fn list 2 r3r triple item from ln done previously 3 hav lrh comment and cs 13572 auditors who dont do lrh cses have been known to get very wet looks like

repetitive if blow ln what intention would ____item have r3r intention the next session the auditor has again high ta troubles auditors comments and cs false ta checklist done put him on foot plates as there was almost div of ta difference when he first tried them as it later climbed back up it was probably just his shoes being taken off hilo assessed 3 times last time to the pc reads per his statements he was getting the commands as if he is below the reality of whing 223states he has had personality change recently and is more exterior to himself this is the second time i have failed to complete cs i did not want to go into another action with the ta that high he said he was feeling great not tired his sleep is irregular due to qm duties the pattern is usually the ta doesnt start to climb until the first 20 minutes of the session or so we should be able to handle this way 1 2wc to fn 2 complete lrh cs of 12572 i dont know where i am erring on this guy but ill get him through it lrh comment and cs 13572 oh well with this many session errors you wont make it anybody can audit an easy pc an auditors flaws show up glaringly only on rough pcs as dn spec will be auditing lot of rough pcs he has to be flawless in trs metering and tech the errors are obvious enough 1 you dont begin major action or an assessment list until you get an fn this is called set up one has to know how to talk ta down to do hilo this holds true unless int is out and that can be tested at once by simply checking went in exterior at which you get bd if its whats wrong and you just handle it if its not int you check lists if not lists you check whs actually i cant see how youd get much of read with ta that high nevertheless cs 53rrr works even with high ta 2 you tried to run an arc brk with high ta you checked it you never touch arc brks on high ta as high ta is not caused by arc brks and arc brks will not get ta down and seriously messes up pc if you try it 3 you are possibly assessing with liltan upswing of tone as in question assessments are done as statement down tone see footnote p 229 4 you have to have the pcs attention he has to be in session this means interested in own case and willing to talk to the auditor 5 to be in session pc has to have confidence in his auditor and an auditor with overts on the pc or doubts or who makes funny cracks about the pcs items shows it in session and there goes confidence because arc is gone 6 an auditors tiny failures in trs begin grating on the pc this throws pc out of session 7 the commonest cause of item on an assessed list of prepared items is meter reading failure the meter is placed wrongly so the auditor cant see it pc and paper in one glance this is the usual reason for items on prepared list eyesight can be factor 2248 an auditor has to have impingement on pc to assess the xiis run into this all the time internes have done gf40xrr the pc gets to the xii the xii reassesses and has whole big parade of reads the lower class auditor just didnt impinge or missed the lot there are pcs alive such as you are presenting here in this folder they do not exist whenever in the past we have thought one did we checked it out and there was such animal there was an auditor whose trs were poor who couldnt or didnt read meter and who had overts on the pc the pc in question each time responded easily to standard auditing you keep not doing cses because you have not done the basic things anyone can run cadillac pc it takes real smooth auditor to handle vintage model t ford these are not harsh words i must not let you get the idea that you can goof and then blame the pc youll just go on losing if i do let it slide did you really check all of the false ta items or did you just shrug it off and grab footplates and are you using meter that works or busted one d of p what does the auditor do really and truly well check this then well use the murder routine if all other points are verified the auditor is crammed the pc has d of p interview and three points arise 1 auditors tr 2 is out 2 cleaning cleans and getting into protest and 3 pc now ready for deeper running auditors comment and cs 14572 d of p interview done the loose grip was spotted in the ta checklist i used the footplates because 08 div difference at the time and pc happier with them if d of ps opinion is correct my tr 2 has been short so ill pick it up and be careful with the metering and trs and cans i have gotten off all the overts i know of off on this and other pcs they include rough trs and mismetering i believe we can get him

the pc to an fn then when the above ln is checked the ta flies to 46 and there it sticks even though the auditor tried to talk it down again auditors comments and cs hit the ditch not cans alone this time as i have checked those very carefully also he bds to fn at exams on the same sized cans i am missing something on him which he has suppressed list of areas from this session producing ta is attached dn and rs on and on despatch i took care to see he knew i had gotten what he said several times he knew i had gotten what he said ta bded on someone could take money from bookstore and started climbing when i asked him if he had said he never thought of doing it and he hadnt whatever it wasnt it was something i did as the ta was actually high at 49 even when checking can grip the fact that he bds and fns at examiner means to that he is whing or protesting something from but not at examiner it could still be tr 2 something must be sitting there unacked 1 d of p in your last

handle it isnt attitudes you want its intentions d of p interview not done on meter 1 what did the auditor do hesitation auditor audited on r3r i didnt know anything was out on r3r hesitation i think if anything perhaps the question in regard to environment maybe my attention wasnt directed to the right place thought it was good session pc ahs and you knows lot q on pt environment i believe i gave what was wanted thats the only point the original question hesitation i dont know if thats where the area of charge is dianetic auditing real good pictures erasing its cool pc goes thro lot of mannerisms hands across face arm over head looking around tapping leg fingering things anything else hesitation only point comm lag i think of i just dont know if thats where the charge is dont believe thats where the charge is referring to session charge started earlier than thursday he had trs in ran made sure i erased it hesitation maybe the question should have been checked he probably did i dont recall he audited very well the only thing it could be is the question 2 how do you feel about your case want to get more into it hesitation and handle whatever needs handling and do whatever im supposed to do thats how i feel about my case and oh i feel i have to take more responsibility and get more charge off my case thats all i feel that the actions that i have are very

you have decided now to go into another rd leaving sanderson rd incomplete you only run items in pcs wording do not change wording you changed his wording to failed control which he did not say you must mark bds plainly when doing one of these 2wcs for things to handle not all ta actions are marked so one is not sure what read i am sure the needle was active yet is not noted having found where his attn is fixated you must now follow through but he did not answer the auditing question he didnt tell you what he wanted handled he told you what he wanted to achieve and you cant run that it would be trying to asis ambition which wouldnt erase and would down curve him and wreck him 244when you start an rd you finish it now im dead ended as cs i have real reads marked the pc didnt really tell you so i cant say what to r3r it is not failed control the pc never said word about it you put an item of your own on the pc and that is listing crime also whats this doing on pg 5 mixed into 2wc for things to handle you must not mix up actions the report sheet is false report and less experienced cs would have been thrown by it the part of this which i have been alerted by in this and other sessions is lack of program command this is rundown you are doing it does have steps you do do them in sequence one must not start one thing break off and start another all these are very basic auditing flaws reviewing this it appears we did not end off on the pgm underway but are 2 or 3 sessions deep on an unprogrammed action in other words we are running case now without program which is illegal as hell apparently things have been done not ticked off on the last 2 programs this case isnt going to b by long way get checked out on this in cramming pgm the case only you know what youve

exact question needs to be worked out for various pcs all ln and therefore very dicey the theory is that thetan even when pressed or suppressed to the absolute limit of near extinction will still try even when cooperating to some way be right thetan cannot die his only out is to try to stop something as he himself cannot stop living this gives rise to fixed ideas as he is trying to stoptherefore the ideas hold in time and continue his efforts to be right continue to stop him in reverse flow this is true because he is already at near total effect he also becomes the effect of his own fixed idea efforts to handle just as man being crushed by housesize rock will still put his hands out to fend it off so will thetan continue to fend off his believed oppressions by stopping them insistence on rightness is last refuge of beingness thus one gets some very aberrated ones these he uses in situations where he thinks he might be found wrong 249these are called service facsimiles service because they serve him facsimiles because they are in mental image picture form they explain his disabilities as well the facsimile part is actually selfinstalled disability that explains how he is not responsible for not being able to cope so he is not wrong for not coping part of the package is to be right by making wrong the service facsimile is therefore picture containing an explanation of self condition and also fixed method of making others wrong real handling would have to include what disability he uses to explain how he is not responsible for not fully coping with life or given situations b fixed postulate he uses to further assert that in actual fact he is still right c the computation as contained in b to make others wrong so as to be right handling therefore would include

somatic never significance the r3r commands are f1 locate an incident of another causing you to have the intention_____ f2 locate an incident of you causing another to have the intention_____ f3 locate an incident of others causing others to have the intention ______ good intentions are never run never the cure for pc who is run on good intention is cs series 53rf the cure for the auditor is

all purps culled from the folder is done as first action in ex dn subsequent purps brought up in sessions are noted and r3rd later on in the programme before any pts rd is done these purps have to be verified as to wording and checked for read before running but not interest considerable charge can be bypassed if purps are missed so this action is thoroughly done rs handling also called the responsibility rd is done as oca righthand side handling list of all rsing statements is made then each taken up the idea is an rs will occur in connection with terminal which will read when checked and thats what you want to run the rsing statement itself will often mention terminal if not the auditor can do brief twc to find out the terminal connected with the statement once the terminal is obtained the auditor lists l n for the purp fl 2 3 r3r triple on each after its listed if terminal can be found the auditor would have to l n for the intention of someone who would rs statement the wants handled rundown is shown in cases b c and f the important points of the rd are to run it as wants to get rid of not wants to achieve and to complete each thing the pc wants handled before going on handling of each thing the pc wants handled is dictated by what the thing is somatic is run r3r triple the intention connected with it can also be run an intention is run r3r triple if its terminal l n for the intention connected with it and run it you can also l n and run the intentions on the other 2 flows if its condition l n ww would have it then list for and run that terminals intention if its doingness l n for the intention of someone who would do that and run it additional handling could be done such as pseais doubleassessed r3r triple handling it as problem by finding and running out the prior confusion or tracing it back to the earlier problem it is solution to and running that r3r triple difficulties on this rd stem from not getting the thing the pc really wants handled which will read very well and run like bomb or errors in the l n or r3r or out ethics holding the condition in place 252the multipleflow purp rundown is very highpowered action which must be precisely done

processing is that processing which increases persons personal integrity and trust in himself and others by freeing him of past overts withholds and missed withholds definition overta harmful or contrasurvival act precisely it is an act of commission or omission that harms the greater number of dynamics definition withhold an undisclosed contrasurvival act action after the fact of action in which the individual has done or been an accessory to doing something which is transgression against some moral or ethical code consisting of agreements to which the individual has subscribed in order to guarantee with others the survival of group with which he is coacting or has coacted toward survival definition missed withhold an undisclosed contrasurvival act which has been restimulated by another but not disclosed this is withhold which another person nearly found out about leaving the person with the withhold in state of wondering whether his hidden deed is known or not integrity is defined as 1 the condition of having part or element taken away or wanting undivided or unbroken state wholeness 2 the condition of not being marred or violated unimpaired or uncorrupted condition soundness 3 soundness or moral principle the character of uncorrupted virtue especially in relation to truth and fair dealing uprightness honesty sincerity this relates to ethics which is defined as the principles of right and wrong conduct and the specific moral choices to be made by the individual in his relationship with others thus we see that person who acts against his own moral codes and the mores of the group violates his integrity and is said to be outethics such acts are called overts person having committed an overt and then withholding the fact of that overt and withholding himself from committing further overts will individuate from the group the group itself will then lose integrity as it becomes divided and lacks wholeness integrity processing is therefore that processing which enables person within the reality of his own moral codes and those of the group to reveal his overts so he longer requires to withhold and so enhances his own integrity and that of the group development in the eary 60s lrh developed the technology known as sec checking as issued it was used for two purposes as general processing tool to clean up pcs overts and withholds and as security tool to detect outethics persons and security risks 261in 1970 this technology was refined and issued under the name of confessionals in 1972 complete update was done of basic ow tech and the earlier procedures of sec checking and confessionals new technology emergedintegrity processing recently integrity processing has been reviewed as to its workability and most optimum usage by lrh and certain revisions have been made usage integrity processing has two uses its basic use is as tool for pc case gain increase in responsibility and case progress as such it belongs at exp grade ii on the grade chart you cant expect pc with unhandled drugs who cant communicate because others dont really exist grade 0 and who is caved in by problems grade i that he hasnt even cognited on to have enough responsibility to answer up on ows grade ii therefore integ as full rd goes at exp grade ii it is usually programmed to be done at or towards the end of the grade and full battery of integ lists are used it is not mandatory grade ii exp process but is recommended the second use of integrity processing is as an ethics or security measure it is used here as part of staff requirements or when security clearance is needed as such it has case prerequisites and is not subject to such things as the drug rd rule as it is not being used for pc case gain only one or at most two integ lists would be used when used as an ethics or security measure integ can be done as auditing in session and is therefore subject to the auditors code or can be done as straight security action not in session in the case of the latter the person must be informed that he isnt being audited the technical procedure in either case would be the same it is noted that use of integ as nonsession security measure or in the case of severe outethics is rare and nothing here condones misuse or abuse of integrity processing as security or ethics action such misuse would be itself subject to immediate and severe ethics action as it would constitute an extreme betrayal of trust historical precedencereligious confession the need for person to be able to morally cleanse himself by confession of sins has long been recognized in religion the buddhist monk 2500 years ago was permitted to confess and seek expiation for acts of censure the penalty for failure to confess was loss of the rights and privileges of monk this was enforcement of the natural law that he who commits actions against the codes or mores of the group separates himself from that group the bible in the books of james and john calls for the confession of sins early christian handling of confession was largely concerned with disciplinary aspects the sinner had to wear sackcloth make his bed in ashes and fast this went on for time proportionate to the gravity of the offence sometimes for years certain sins were previously considered too serious for forgiveness and therefore not open to confession but gradual leniency developed as in the case of calixtus bishop of rome 217222 who decided to admit adulterers to exomologesis greek for public confession in the 4th century at rome and constantinople we hear of penitentiaries priests appointed to act for the bishop in hearing the confession of sins and deciding whether public discipline was necessary due to some misuse of public confession individual private confession became more prominent in the 5th century 262in 1215 the council of the lateran ruled that everyone must make confession at least once year before his parish priest in confession as now administered in christian churches the disciplinary penance is often little more than nominal stress being laid rather on the fullness of the confession thus for at least 2500 years confession has played an important role in religious practice throughout the centuries two points of question have arisen which led to some unpopularity of confession one was the possible misuse of information disclosed in public confession hence the development of private confession before an authorized person whose code of conduct prevented misuse the other was the infliction of disciplinary action as atonement for the sins confessed but the latter goes beyond the realm of personal morals and ethics into justice confession itself and the need for some form of confession has not been in question with integrity processing scientology follows in the tradition of religion this processing enables the individual to confess to overts without duress it is done with qualified auditor bound by the auditors code disciplinary action forms part of the processing the technology by which integrity processing is delivered is new it is not the same as any earlier technology either in scientology or other religion it does however follow in the longstanding tradition of religion in providing means for the individual to admit to and take responsibility for transgression against the mores of the group and so regain spiritual and moral integrity compiled from lrh briefings and materials reissued as btb by flag mission 1234 revised by wo ron shafran cs4 approved by commodores staff aides board

prepared list read and who has been fully checked out and drilled on these techniques as an auditing action it is done in model session with rudiments in every reading question of an integrity processing form is fned the actual form question must be taken to fn not some other question here is the basic procedure for integrity processing 1 set up the room chairs table etc as you would for any auditing session with all admin to hand worksheet paper integ form you will use etc 2 make sure your pcs hands are not too dry or moist the cans are the correct size and the pc knows how to hold them ref false ta hco bs 3 start the session and fly rud if fn if ta high or low do not try to fly rud but do cs series 53rj assess and handle if you are not trained in doing cs series 53 end off for cs instruction 4 put in any needed rfactor on doing integrity processing 5 clear the procedure and the use of the buttons suppress and false etc if necessary as an example run nonsignificant question to demonstrate the procedure eg have you ever eaten an apple 6 take up the first question and clear the words backwards then the full command noting any read while clearing which is valid see btb 2

bulletin has been taken from hco b 10 july 1964 it is useful in integrity processing arc breaks the commonest cause of failure in running overt acts is cleaning cleans whether or not one is using meter the pc who really has more to tell doesnt arc break when the auditor continues to ask for one but may snarl and eventually give it up on the other hand leaving an overt touched on the case and calling it clean will cause future arc break with the auditor have you told all prevents cleaning clean on the unmetered pc one can see the pc brighten up on the meter you get nice fall if its true that all is told have i not found out about something prevents leaving an overt undisclosed on the unmetered pc the reaction is sly flinch on metered pc it gives read pcs protest against question will also be visible in an unmetered pc in reeling sort of exasperation which eventually becomes howl of pure bafflement at why the auditor wont accept the answer that thats all on meter protest of question falls on being asked for is this question being protested there is real excuse for arc breaking pc by 1 demanding more than is there or 2 leaving an overt undisclosed that will later make the pc upset with the auditor why overts work overts give the highest gain in raising cause level because they are the biggest reason why person restrains himself and withholds self from action man is basically good but the reactive mind tends to force him into evil actions these evil actions are instinctively regretted and the individual tries to refrain from doing anything at all the best remedy the individual thinks is to withhold if i commit evil actions then my best guarantee for not committing is to do nothing whatever thus we have the lazy inactive person 268others who try to make an individual guilty for committing evil actions only increase this tendency to laziness punishment is supposed to bring about inaction and it does in some unexpected ways however there is also an inversion turnabout where the individual sinks below recognition of any action the individual in such state cannot conceive of any action and therefore cannot withhold action and thus we have the criminal who cant act really but can only react and is without any self direction this is why punishment does not cure criminality but in actual fact creates it the individual is driven below withholding or any recognition of any action thiefs hands stole the jewel the thief was merely an innocent spectator to the action of his own hands criminals are very sick people physically so there is level below withholding that an auditor should be alert to in some pcs for these have withholds and have done nothing all of which seen through their eyes is true they are merely saying i cannot restrain myself and i have not willed myself to do what i have done the road out for such case is the same as that for any other case it is just longer the processes for levels above hold also for such cases but dont be anxious to see sudden return of responsibility for the first owned done that this person knows he or she has done may be ate breakfast dont disdain such answers in level ii particularly rather in such people seek such answers there is another type of case in all this just one more to end the list this is the case who never runs ow but seeks the explanation of what i did that made it all happen to this person easily goes into past lives for answers their reaction to question about what theyve done is to try to find out what they did that earned all those motivators that of course isnt running the process and the auditor should be alert for it and stop it when it happens this type of case goes into its extreme on guilt it dreams up overts to explain why after most big murders the police routinely have dozen or two people come around and confess you see if they had done the murder this would explain why they feel guilty as terror stomach is pretty awful grim to live with one is apt to seek any explanation for it if it will only explain it on such cases the same approach as given works but one should be very careful not to let the pc get off overts the pc didnt commit such pc recognizable by the ease they dive into the extreme past when being audited off meter gets more and more frantic and wilder and wilder in overts reported they should get calmer under processing of course but the false overts make them frantic and hectic in session on meter one simply checks for have you told anything beyond what really has occurred or have you told any untruths the observation and meter guides given in this section are used during session when they apply but not systematically such as after every pc answer these observations and meter guides are used always at the end of every session on the pcs to whom they apply lrhntrd l ron hubbard copyright 1964 1974 founder by l ron hubbard all rights reserved the 5 december 1974 reissue of hco b 10

december 1972 same title integrity processing series 7 fundamentals the most fundamental thing to know about integrity processing is that case with withholds will not clear and the next most fundamental element to know is that case with withholds will not clear perhaps if this is repeated loud enough and long enough not only preclears but perhaps even auditors will realize that this is an absolute unavoidable truth one which can not be overlooked or neglected at any time under any circumstances first of all what is withhold withhold is action after the fact of action in which the individual has done or been an accessory to doing something which is transgression against some moral code consisting of agreements to which the individual has subscribed in order to guarantee with others the survival of group with which he is coacting or has coacted toward survival because withhold is action or motion after doingness it naturally hangs up in time and floats in time due to the actions or the overts which preceded the action or motion of the withhold the reactive mind is therefore the combined withholds stocked up which the individual has against groups from which he feels that he is individuated but from which he has not separated due to the fact that he has these withholds in his bank and also all the combined agreements toward survival of all these groups from which he is not separate and which he uses reactively to solve problems now without inspection example the individual belonged at some time to the holy fighters one of the mores of this group was that all should be destroyed who do not accept the word the holy fighters went out on punitive expedition against neighboring tribe who would not accept the word but accepted some other belief there was great battle with much killing however during the battle the individual took pity upon helpless child and did not kill him but took the child off the field of battle gave him food and drink and left him returning himself to the battle after the battle was successfully won the holy fighters had their usual service during which all spoke of how they had killed all nonbelievers our individual withheld from the group that he had not only failed to kill but had saved the life of nonbeliever thus we have the action of the withhold after the overt or action of saving the child all of which added up to transgression against the mores of the holy fighters because of such similar transgressions the individual finally individuated from the group of holy fighters and became member of the board of directors of the society for kindness to humans which itself had its own agreements to survival and with which the individual agreed however when difficulties or problems arose the individual instead of treating all with kindness tended to covertly try to destroy all who would not accept the tenets of kindness so he reactively was solving the problems of the society of kindness with survival mores of the holy fighters due to all his transgressions and withholds of his destructive impulses while member of the society for kindness he finally individuated from this group 270now he is member of antiemotions incorporated but he finds that he cant rule out all his emotions but tends to be destructive and kind at the same time so he is still solving problems not only with the mores of the holy fighters but with those of the society for kindness to humans and so it goes processing this individual we will find that he has all these withholds of overts against the holy fighters the society for kindness to humans and antiemotions incorporated after we have pulled all these overts he will truly be separate from these groups and longer reactively use their survival mechanisms as solutions to problems further the action of withholding is one point where the preclear does what the reactive mind does he withholds his own overts of transgressions against the moral code of group in order to avoid punishment thusly enhance his own survival and he withholds himself from the group finally in an effort to avoid committing further overts so just as the reactive mind contains all past survival agreements which are used to solve problems threatening the survival of the individual so does the individual decide to withhold transgressions in order to survive himself and withholds himself from groups to avoid committing overts withholding and surviving occur at the same time so the communication bridge between the preclear and the reactive mind is the withhold the pulling of overts which have been withheld then is the first step towards getting the preclear to take control of the reactive mind the more withholds he gives up the more the old survival mechanisms of the reactive mind are destroyed further as withhold of an overt creates further overt act of notknow on the group with which one is coacting toward survival along an agreed upon moral code so we are running off all the ignorance created for others by an individual which results in ignorance to himself in this fashion we are processing the individual up toward native state or knowingness therefore in doing integrity processing on preclear you are really attacking the whole basis of the reactive mind it is an activity which the auditor should earnestly and effectively engage upon in doing this the auditor always assumes that the preclear can remember his overts and can overwhelm the reactive mind just as with the cchs so with processing checks any objections raised by the preclear as regards integrity processing are only confusion being thrown up by the reactive mind but the individual is really trying to look for what is there despite the reactive minds doing this this is why any failure to pull an overt is considered crime against the preclear the auditor in failing to pull an overt has given the reactive mind win and the preclear failure and has further given the preclear another overt against the group he is now associated with namely that of scientology because he has succeeded in withholding from it so in integrity processing the auditor must get the preclear to answer the question without developing meterdependency this creates confidence that the auditor and the preclear are really working together to overwhelm the reactive mind if the meter gives an instant read to the question then the auditor uses the emeter to assist the preclear in pulling all further overts and takes it earlier similar to get an fn on the question being asked stable datum as regards this is that if the question reacts there are withholds there or not all about particular withhold was pulled never allow preclear to persuade you that it is only already pulled withholds which are still reacting withhold pulled will not cause question to still react it can only be that not all about the withhold was pulled or that there are further undisclosed withholds on that question or it is false read withhold of nothing in which case the question will fn on false 271do not leave an integrity processing question until the auditor the preclear the reactive mind and the emeter are in absolute agreement that there is nothing more on particular question this will be recognized by the ep of fn cog vgis on the question remember the emeter is not bound by the auditors code if it reacts on question then the auditor must take that question to full ep with an fn question having once read is not nulled to noread it is audited to an fn obtaining read and taking the read to fn depends on good auditor presence and excellence of trs basic auditing and metering processing check question must never be left without fning if the preclears intensive is terminating you must complete that question matter how many extra hours you have to put in on the preclear do not end session without carrying the question you are working on to ep any failure to pull an overt is crime against that preclear eliminate all unkind thought questions in integrity processing use done anything to type questions unkind thoughts are merely tags telling you that the preclear has actually done something unkind thoughts are merely mechanism of lessening the overt in pulling overts be careful that you do not allow the preclear to give you his justifications for having committed it in allowing him to give you motivators or reasons why you are allowing him to lessen the overt you are only interested in what the preclear has done not what he has heard that others have done so never allow preclear to get off withholds to you about others except in the case where he has been an accessory to criminal act other peoples overts are handled by asking the preclear have you ever done anything like that yourself remember that your duty as an auditor is to simply employ your skill to obtain greater decency ability and integrity on the part of others you do this by performing well your function of clearing the meter and getting off all overts and withholds an auditor is not an enforcer of public morals if an auditor tries to make preclear guilty he is violating clause 15 of the auditors code which says never mix the processes of scientology with those of various other practices punishment is an old practice which is not part of our activities in scientology audit against the reality of the preclear and his moral code and do not try to make him guilty the value of any withhold is only the value the preclear puts on it as case improves his responsibility level will increase and if his responsibility level is increasing he will get off further new withholds if an auditor is not getting new withholds coming off preclear he had better look for gross error in his auditing he either is disinterested and unwilling to help the preclear or he is technically unskillful on his trs basic auditing and the emeter or he does not have the preclear in session or he has withholds himself only an auditor with withholds will fail to pull them on others the number of withholds preclear has available at any given time depends upon those that are available at that given time to clarify this point assume that all preclears have the same set number of withholds well the number available within the realm of the preclears present state of reality and responsibility will naturally vary preclears with high reality and responsibility level will have more withholds available for pulling than preclears with low reality and responsibility level this is why it is so important that processing checks be continued throughout auditing his reality and responsibility level will increase throughout processing bringing to light many new 272overts if these are not pulled the preclear will be forced into unintentionally withholding them and his case will bog down and not progress there are prepared integrity processing forms to assist you in pulling withholds in using these an auditor must never never omit question on any of these but he can add questions to them then there are specialized integrity processing forms tailored to fit the professional or present activities of the preclear and special forms to cover the transgressions of the preclear against the moral code of any group with which he has coacted on the latter as person in one lifetime only has belonged to many different groups you can see the tremendous possibility of integrity processing applied to the moral code of all groups on whole track basis particular attention must be paid to the present group with whom he is currently coacting namely scientology this is why it is important to do the last two pages of the basic integrity processing form and others specifically related to the subject of scientology as applicable on all scientologists first because in the first place he is expecting something to help him against which he has overts and to that degree these overts are overts against himself as they will if not pulled prevent him from being helped and in the second place overts against current groups are most important then overts committed in this lifetime and then overts committed on the track the reason being that he is still connected with these current groups and with this lifetime integrity processing is most fruitful source of cognition because you are pulling off the preclears notknows on the third dynamic which have kept others in ignorance and himself in stupidity besides this you tremendously increase the preclears ability to communicate and on top of all this you make preclear much easier to audit and if all his withholds are pulled he can be cleared pretty good gains to work for well then lets get busy compiled from lrh briefings and materials by

compiled from briefing to 3rd mate and 4th mate flag given by l ron hubbard hco is primarily interested in justice the method of justice practiced in the 17th and 18th centuries was to catch the offenders and hang them thus keeping the countryside quiet although useful as method of quieting things down however it doesnt do people any good to be hung you will find the remedy expressed in this rule when you give integrity processing to person without finding the earlier basic you hang them if you cant chase back an integrity processing question to an fn you are going to get continuous ethics trouble from that person from then on until it is remedied when you give guy integrity processing and it doesnt produce anything and the needle is clean you should indicate that the integrity processing was unnecessary you will probably get an fn hcos interest in someone is normally in what is going on what is he up to now so one tends to omit to ask how come this guy has been committing overts for the past twoandahalf yearsthe same ones and it is still going on back in that earlier zone is one hell of an overt continuous overts against scientology or lrh so what is it you should trace it back and you could find dilly its the earliest item available on that chain that will get the fn and remember that overts of omission are always preceded by overts of commission so you should ask yourself how come all these overts of omission theres an earlier overt of commission you can be sure this gives us another rule if you cannot fn question you havent got it now it could be the buttons are out invalidate protest action unnecessary did you know you can beef up ta send it up high by doing an unnecessary action it acts somewhat like forcing wrong item on pc it puts him on protest rejection and an effort to stop the action that is where lot of the unpopularity of earlier techniques stems from of the rudiments arc break problem withhold integrity processing specializes in overts and withholds so the full panorama of integrity processing buttons is ruds plus false suppress invalidate evaluate protest unnecessary so if the ta goes up during integrity processing you should check buttons if it doesnt handle rapidly and easily revert to the l 1ra integ repair list 274if you cant get an fn on integrity processing and have to end session you must have line to qual that cleans it up within 24 hours every time an integrity processing action wont fly it has got to be 24hour urgent repair the integrity processing repair list consists of the ruds and buttons people arc break with the physical universe with fellow men feel wronged in some way and have to take it out on somebody and so commit the overt but the somebody they attack is not the source of the upset they misidentify the source if their think was straight they would be able to see what the score was and have charge on it an overt therefore is preceded by an arc break and you will find an arc break is the result of problem so each time you dont take question to fn you run up against this this gives another way for them to get unpopular but if it didnt fn you also know it was necessary to give the person integrity processing if you give person integrity processing and you see trail of catastrophes in that persons wake afterwards you know it didnt fly similarly person who makes huge overts out of every little action which is in essence selfinvalidation has behind that somewhere huge overtbig enough to set the police of several galaxies after them if it doesnt fn you havent got it the emeter and the criminal the joker in all this is that the emeter reads on reality so you can have guy who reads on none of your questions but you find out the next day he had done exactly what you asked him yet it didnt read real criminal just doesnt read on having killed his grandmother in cold blood five minutes before the processing even if he admits it it doesnt read but real criminal wont clear and wont fn occasionally they will rs you have to handle it on gradient of reality why wasnt that an overt is one way you could try he would at first be very surprised at the very thought of it being an overt but you could get stream of justifications off another way is to magnify the overt you can use that on noovert case the tech of it belongs in the field of auditing anytime integrity processing is done the session reports must go into the pc folder otherwise the cs can make an error in csing because of the omitted data one does not do integrity processing in the middle of other auditing rundowns the action therefore requires cs clearance hco and case gain see hco pl 20 july 1970 cases and morale of staff the percentage of people who have case gain will be proportional to the level of morale in your org so it is of interest to hco to ask the cs how many nocasegain cases he has pile 4 trace them down and isolate them the names of those not doing well piles 2 and 3 should also be known and the numbers so you can make sure the greater percentage is getting good case gain hco can get trouble stemming from lack of staff case progress for instance you find an exec giving excuses for not doing his job it can be due to nocasegain under him enturbulating seniors and associates they in turn not recognizing him as the source of 275the enturbulation buy the stops and the cant be dones and find some other excuse as to why not to do their job recognize that when someone dumps his hat on you he has overts man an executive instead of reporting that people dont want to work in his division should be asking how come they dont want to work in the division things will get better to the degree that such cases producing stops and cants have line for them to be handled on begin campaign to get all these cases winning if there is any query as to which of the four categories of case folders per hco pl 20 july 70 person belongs on it goes on the one lower for instance category pile 2 queried as to status immediately becomes pile 3 pile 4 cases are given integrity processing such processing is however not limited to such cases it is extremely valuable processing to

the main danger of integrity processing is not probing persons past but failing to do so thoroughly when you leave an integrity processing question live and go on to the next one you set up nasty situation that will have repercussions the person may not immediately react but the least that will happen is that he will be more difficult to audit in the future and will go out of session more easily more violently pc who has had an integrity processing question left unflat may leave the session and do himself or scientology considerable mischief about the most unkind thing you could do to person would be to leave an integrity processing question unflat and go on to the next one or to fail to obtain an fn on withholds in the rudiments and go on with the session one girl being audited was left unflat on withhold question the auditor blithely went on to the next question the girl went out after session and told everyone she knew the most vicious lies she could create about the immoral conduct of scientologists she wrote stack of letters to people she knew out of town telling gruesome tales of sexual orgies an alert scientologist heard the rumors rapidly traced them back got hold of the girl sat her down and checked auditing and found the unflat withhold question the withhold sexual misdemeanors once that was pulled the girl hastily raced about correcting all her previous efforts to discredit man had been stalled case for about year he was violent to audit the special question was finally asked what withhold question was left unflat on you it was found and handled after that his case progressed again the mechanisms of this are many the reactions of the pc are many the summation of it is when an integrity processing question is left unflat on pc and thereafter ignored the consequences are numerous the remedy the prevention of integrity processing being left unflat is easily accomplished 1 develop excellent trs and basic auditing 2 know the emeter 3 work

efficient way to upset pc is to leave an integrity processing question unflat this is remedied by taking each reading question to an fn on the question the best way to miss an integrity processing question is to let the pc indulge in generalities or i thought withhold given as oh i got mad at them lots of times should be pulled down to when and where and the first time you got mad and finally what did you do to them just before that then earlier similar if fn the pc who withholds somebody elses withholds and gives them as answers is card but he isnt helped when the auditor lets him do it situation you ask the pc for withhold about joe the pc who says i heard that joe should be asked right there what have you done to joe you just you and it turns out he stole joes last blonde but if the auditor had let this pc go on and on about how the pc had heard how joe was this or that the session would have gone on and on and the tone arm up and up we have pcs who use withholds to spread all manner of lies we ask this pc have you ever done anything to the org the pc says well im withholding that i heard or the pc says well i thought some bitter thoughts about the org or the pc says i was critical of the org when and we dont sail in and get what the pc did we can comfortably stretch 5minute item to session or two if the pc heard and the pc thought and the pc said in answer to an integrity processing question the pcs reactive bank is really saying ive got crashing big withhold and if i can keep on fooling around by giving critical thoughts rumours and what others did youll never get it and if he gets away with it the auditor has missed withhold question we only want to know what the pc did when he did it what was the first time he did it and what he did just before that and well nail it every time the irresponsible pc if you want to get withholds off an irresponsible pc you sometimes cant ask what the pc did or withheld and get meter reaction this problem has bugged us for some time i finally got very bright and realized that matter whether the pc thought it was crime or not he or she will answer up on dont know versions as follows situation what have you done to your husband pcs answer nothing bad emeter reaction nul now we know this pc through our noticing she is critical of her husband has overts on him but she can take responsibility for her own acts 279but she can take responsibility for his not knowing she is making certain of that so we ask what have you done that your husband doesnt know about and it takes an hour for her to spill it all the quantity is so great for the question releases the floodgates the meter bangs around and with these withholds off her responsibility comes up and she can take responsibility on the items this applies to any zone or area or terminal of integrity processing situation we are getting lot of i thought i heard they said they did in answer to question we take the terminal or terminals involved and put them in this blank what have you done that ______doesnt dont know about and we can get the major overts that lay under the blanket of how bad everyone is but this prevents you missing an integrity processing question its bad crime to do so this will shorten the labour involved in getting every question flat and if your pc is withholdy you can insert this have i missed an integrity processing question on you while doing the processing always clear up what was missed pc can be very upset by reason of missed integrity processing question keep them going up not down l ron hubbard founder lrh

reason only to faith at the moment when you have reality on this nothing will shake it and youll longer fail cases or fail in life but at the moment it may not seem reasonable so just try it do it well and day will dawn at last what are these natterings upsets arc breaks critical tirades lost students ineffective motions they are restimulated but missed or partially missed withholds if i could just teach you that and get you to get good reality on that in your own auditing your activities would become smooth beyond belief ________ it is true that arc breaks present time problems and withholds all keep session from occurring and we must watch them and clear them but behind all these is another button applicable to each which resolves each one and that button is the restimulated but missed or partially missed withhold ________ life itself has imposed this button on us if you know about people or are supposed to know about people then these people expect unreasonably that you know them through and through real knowledge to the average person is only this knowledge of his or her withholds that horribly enough is the high tide of knowledge for the man in the street if you know his withholds if you know his crimes and acts then you are smart if you know his future you are moderately wise and so we are persuaded toward mind reading and fortune telling all wisdom has this trap for those who would be wise egocentric man believes all wisdom is wound up in knowing his misdemeanors if any wise man represents himself as wise and fails to discover what person has done that person goes into an antagonism or other misemotion toward the wise man so they hang those who restimulate and yet who do not find out about their withholds this is an incredible piece of craziness but it is observably true this is the wild animal reaction that makes man cousin to the beasts 281a good auditor can understand this bad one will stay afraid of it and wont use it ________ have i missed withhold on you can be used in integrity processing if the preclear gets upset or critical during session ________ any arc broken pc should be asked what withhold have i missed on you or what have i failed to find out about you or what should i have known about you ________ an integrity processing specialist who cannot read meter is dangerous because he or she will miss withholds and the pc may become very upset ________ use this as stable datum if the person is upset somebody failed to find out what that person was sure they would find out ________ missed withhold is should have known

the needle this is quite simple the auditor asks the question the needle instantly reacts the pc as he or she usually does looks puzzled if the auditor says it reacts the pc thinks it over as he or she is thinking the auditor will see the same reaction on the needle softly the auditor says that or there or whats that youre looking at as the pc knows what he or she is looking at at that instant the thing can be dug up this is auditor cooperation not triumph most often the pc does not know what it is that reacts as only unknowns react therefore an auditors there when the needle twitches again before the pc has answered coordinates with whatever the pc is looking at and thus it can be spotted and revealed by the pc this is only done when the pc comm lags for few seconds remember the pc is always willing to reveal he or she doesnt know what to reveal therein lies the difficulty pcs get driven out of session when asked to reveal something yet do not know what to reveal by the auditors saying there or whats that quietly each time the needle reacts newly the pc is led to discover what should be revealed auditors and pcs get into games condition in integrity processing and rudiments only when the auditor refuses this help to the pc new auditors routinely believe that in integrity processing the pc knows the answer and wont give it this is an error if the pc knew all the answer it wouldnt react on the meter oldtimers have found out that only if they steer by repeated meter reaction giving the pc there or whats that can the pc answer up on most rudiments questions missed withholds and so on but dont use steering to harass the pc or cut his comm or draw attention to the auditor this is the only use of reads other than instant reads on the emeter help the pc he doesnt

pulled ability to reach is potentially restored but the pc often does not discover this it requires that havingness be run to get the benefit of having pulled most withholds therefore havingness may

integrity processing is specialized type of auditing and it takes lot of skill and at times some courage to do it well auditors must not be kind nor yet unkind this does not mean that you steer lukewarm middle course between kindness and unkindness neither of these two impostors have anything to do with it you just go in and audit you go in to findand that means dig foroverts if you go in with pcs needle clean and your questioning can get that needle to react then you are winning the success of an auditor can be measured by the extent to which he can get reactions on the needle and then cleaning those reactions getting more reactions and cleaning those and so on the skilled auditor gets to the root of the trouble and clears up whole batch of overts at once by handling chains of overts to fn integrity processing is done in model session the beginning rudiments are put in and by the time you start the body of the session in this case the integrity processing the pc should have an fn the next thing is to tell the pc that you are going to help him to clean up and really clean up the questions on the form that you are using remember it is the question you are going to clean not the needle youve already got clean needle and you could probably keep it from reading on questions by bad tr 1 failure to dig or just sheer bad auditing the next action is to announce the first question that you are going to handle at the same time watching the meter for any read on first calling it can be important to groove in the question there are variety of ways to do this eg ask what the question means what period or time the question covers what activities would be included where the pc has been that might be something to do with the question if any other people are likely to be involved in other words you are steering the pcs attention to various parts of his bank and getting him to have preliminary look when this has been done using very good tr 1 you give him the question again small tick may now have developed into real lf or bd you take your pcs answer and get the specifics if he gives you general answer you ask him for specific time or specific example dont accept motivators if he gives you motivator you say ok but what did you do there and you want something before the motivator example pc i got mad at him because he kicked my foot aud what had you done before he kicked your foot in this case the pc is giving an overt i got mad at him but in fact he is cunningly selling the motivator he kicked in the foot so the rule here is go earlier than the motivator similarly you dont accept criticisms unkind thoughts explanations you want what the pc has done and you want the time place form and event when you have succeeded in this you dont leave it there you ask for an earlier time he had done something like it and you keep going earlier what you are after is the earliest time he stole hit somebody got angry with pc or whatever is his crime get the earliest one and you will find that the others will blow off like thistledown keep sly eye on your meter and you can tell when you are in hot area use it to help you to know where to dig but dont use it to steer the pc at this stage this 285encourages laziness on the part of the pc you want him in there foraging about and digging up his bank in the process having once gotten read on the question the question is not further checked on the meter one simply follows the chain back earlier similar same chain use standard integrity processing procedure until an fn is obtained with cognition and vgis if you do this properly you will have well satisfied pc if he arc breaks then you have missed something so pull your missed withholds rising ta is clue to something missed or bypassed fn if pc isnt happyvery happyat the end of question then you have missed something pcs will tell you hundred and one things that are wrong with your auditing the d of ps instruction the form of the question etc but they all add up to the same thingsomething has been missed one word of warning if you leave question unflat mark it on your auditors report and tell your pc it isnt flat it is very bad

only when it has been taken to ep per hco b 13 dec 72r integrity processing series 10r integrity processing questions must be fned if suppression is found start the cycle over with the question itself after suppress is clean realize that withholds exist that they can be suppressed and that they can be restimulated and pulled once you have ep however dont recheck the question 3 suppress is always asked repetitively and not as fast check 4 an rs means crimes that must be pulled sporadic rs can be turned on full by varying the question that produced it the rs will become wider and more chronic as the exact crime is approached when the crime is found the rs will become very pronounced and then vanish thats crimes not failed to wash the car 5 dr dirty read is not an rs but can sometimes turn into an rs by probing if crime is present it is noted on the worksheet as dr though never as an rs 6 the specific details of each misdeed must be gotten dont buy generalized overts motivators and justifications 7 you still use comm cycle avoid heavy accusation 8 arc breaks must be cleanyou cant audit over an arc break 9 check for missed withholds every few questions 10 clean up the integrity processing form at the end with such questions as l2 truth and have you gotten away with anything etc 11 follow questions with have you told more than was there on pc who tends to dub in overts or motivators 12 limit the pc to this life if he takes up running track in an effort to avoid this life offenses 13 clean up any dn as soon as it appears by checking for missed withhold or getting all of the one youre on 14 watch the pcs indicators eg for signs of missed withholds 28715 keep track of the ta position during integrity processing if question sends the ta higher and if it then remains higher something was missed on that question 16 pursue each chain to basic 17 pat can be handled by asking for overwhelmingly large overts eg have you robbed any banks murder technique or by reverse questions such as tell about when you have not stolen something 18 question that reads sporadically isnt quite the right one and needs to be varied 19 keep aware of the needleespecially when question is first called also questions sometimes will show need to be compartmented eg have you ever stolen read anything here the read on stolen should be pursued pc with known withhold can have prior read and not an instant onethis is something to watch for 20 keep your tr 1 in otherwise questions will not read due to lack of auditor impingement 21 keep your tr 2 in otherwise the pc will feel his answer has not been accepted and it can put pc on withhold of nothing 22 help the pc give withhold hes having trouble presenting one way is by having him tell you what subject its about or part of it another is by use of the overwhelmingly large overt approach well did you murder someone 23 cut any natter line pin down the critical thoughts and motivators and get the prior overt the person getting integrity processing must not be allowed to sit and natter about person or an org etc 24 person who has valid ep on an integrity processing form has the whole form ended off its the subject of the integrity list which eps not just one question 25 beware of false read which is thinking something read which didnt protest can then give you read clean up questions with protest suppress inval buttons where the pc says theres nothing there then if it still reads on check there is something there false reads saying something read which really didnt can wreck case can also check for demanding withhold he doesnt have 26 make sure you get the question answeredquestion did you steal the tools from the tool shed is not answered by i have thing about keys reissued as btb by flag mission 1234

processing is not entered into pc pgm in the middle of another rundown or auditing action when required it may be entered into pgm at suitable rest point but any current process or rundown in progress on the pc would be completed first the cs should not use this to unduly delay integrity processing when required as person withholding overts will not make gains until those overts have been pulled the auditor must be qualified as hubbard integrity processing specialist this is new tech its practitioners must be specialist trained standard csing rules apply in addition the cs looks for the following key points 1 any nonsequitur fn on some other subject ensures that each question is fned on the subject being asked about this is the primary thing the cs inspects 2 check that each reading question was taken to an fn 3 check that any rses were recorded clearly and noted at the front of pc folder for future use 4 ensure that an integrity processing repair list l1ra is used if session ends with fn or pc at all upset or gets sick shortly after integrity processing examiner 24 hour rule must be rigorously applied 1 above is of prime importance dont permit auditors to go into some unusual solution such as checking the question after it has been taken to fn that could wreck case the auditor simply audits keeps the pc on the right chain going earlier as necessary to an fn it is the cs who checks to see that it was in fact the question being asked that fned this is done by checking for any nonsequitur answers that fned on some other subject if person falls on his head after an integrity processing session an l1ra is given however an fes to find missing questions that fned on something else is done the whole essence of this is contained in fning every item getting question asked to fn not some other integrity processing repair list lira fines for missing withholds and expanded dianetics for rsers revealing and recording rses and rsing statements for later use

conditions and lot more things than just ow although we call them withholds were really asking person to straighten out his interpersonal relationships with other terminals and groups our normal integrity processing is addressed to the individual versus the society or his family or group because its what people would consider reprehensible that makes withhold that is the basic center line of integrity processing transgressions against the mores of the group you can have special mores between the individual and different groups between the and the mother between the husband and the wife between the staff member and the organization or between the auditor and the preclear to which the auditor integrity processing form is directed its moral code that you are processing one way or the other youre straightening out somebody on the now im supposed tos against which they have transgressed and having so transgressed they now are individuated if their individuation is too obsessive they snap in and become the terminal and can assume the characteristics of that person in dealing with this you go straight to the persons handling of masses and changes of spaces or into his most confused motional areas not emotional person has been recluse and stayed inside house ever since he was 20 you dont start running houses in his integrity processing you find what area he was in before he was 20 staying in the house is solution to something we find an area of considerable activity that lies prior to the difficulty and then run integrity processing on that area we find there was one boarding school he absolutely detests thats what we handle every question would have to do with that boarding school there are students and boys and instructors and coaches and headmasters and buildings and athletic equipment etc write them all down you dont ask the pc then work out all the types of crimes he might have been able to commit against those items in this way you compile whole integrity processing form to suit the situation most often one takes the most appropriate issued form and simply adds few questions to cover the special situation you can always add some questions but dont omit any when you want to handle specific area or activity it can be more satisfactory to compile special form covering all the things you think of that he could have done in that area that he is never going to tell anybody 291this is particularly so when the area has its own special tight mores he has cut up against and so has individuated himself from that area cannot asis any part of the track and of course gets trapped in that particular zone and activity forget is version of not know so any sensory perceptic shutoff is an effort not to know and you have target so you can do little special integrity processing forms to go along with special zone of activity and eventually youll get what do you know there is use telling him what he has been doing wrong he is too in the thing to see it you can see it because youre outside it you just put have you ever done anything to_____ to whole list and youve got formulized method of getting together an integrity processing form cognition is totally dependent upon freedom to know overts and withholds are dedicated to not knowingness it takes the guidance of the integrity processing form list of questions to handle this the formula then is to just make list of all the items you can think of that have anything to do with the target and write up list of possible overts against them or questions that call for overts has he done anything to_____has he interfered with anything about_____etc dont include questions that call for motivators or justifications the first rule isany area or zone of life with which person is having difficulty in life or has had difficulty is fruitful area for integrity processing youll find out every time hes got withholds in that zone or area the second rule is to break the problem down to its most fundamental expression then write down those nouns associated with it and those basic doingnesses associated with this fundamental expression then just phrase up your processing questions on the basis of have you ever_____ and any other verb you want to put in have you ever done_____ _____prevented etc you dont have to get too fancy as the needle will fall when you get close to it that area where an individual is having difficulty he is stupid stupidity is not knowingness not knowingness occurs through overts but the overt has to be hidden so it must be an overt which is withheld these withholds then add up to stupidity so of course he has trouble there isnt anything complicated about it at all compiled from lrh briefings and materials by lt comdr brian livingston reissued as btb by

communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco policy letter of 18 september 1967 remimeo academies shsbc study complexity and confronting in some researches i have been doing recently on the field of study i have found what appears to be the basic law on complexity it is the degree of complexity is proportional to the degree of non confront reversing this the degree of simplicity is proportional to the degree of confront and the basis of aberration is nonconfront to the degree that being cannot confront he enters substitutes which accumulating bring about complexity i found this while examining the subject of navigation in order to teach it and clarify it i found that man had based the subject on an incorrect primary assumption a11 subjects have as their basis point of first assumption in mans technology this is usually weak and nonfactual which makes his technology very frail and limited to reform subject one has to find this primary assumption and improve it this reforming of technical subjects is of great interest to us because our subject scientology is advanced even beyond the space travel technologies of very high civilizations yet it is flanked on all sides by mans corny antique technology in the field of physics chemistry mathematics and so on this tends to hold us back somewhat we strained his tech forward to get the emeter the one thing we had to have in navigation man bases the whole subject on the assumption that one cant confront where he came from or is going or where he is it assumes he is lost this is basis assumption of nonconfront he cant directly see where he has been or where he is going at seait is so largeso he takes off from point of noconfront in all his reasoning in the subject therefore he goes into series of symbols and begins to substitute symbols for symbols this winds him up in mass of complexity one spends 90 of his time in studying this subject trying to find out what symbols the symbols are meant to represent he says in his texts gha on search we find this means greenwich hour angle on further search we find this means what angle some heavenly body forms when related to greenwich as zero on further search we find the idiocy that the navigators clock tells angles in hours when all he needs is clock face giving 360 degrees this is of course complete nonsense why hours and two sets of 12 at that midnight to noon and noon to midnight when what he is trying to find out is how many degrees of time have passed he refers his time to the sun which because of the rotations of earth every 24 hours appears at an increasing number of degrees from greenwich england as the day advances because he starts from noconfront of ship or plane position he then carries noconfront through the whole subject if man isnt lost as he begins to navigate he very often is when he finishes actually ship or plane is ever lost as to position one knows he is on earth and in what ocean and on what side of what ocean and the subject really should be one which merely lets one correct his position bit 309man in this subject of navigation even scorns direct observation confront and calls it jackass navigation in actual fact real navigation is the science of recognition of positions and objects and estimation of relative distances and angles between them the subject is made complex because it has become in mans hands the substitution of symbols for symbols all based on the assumption that he cant confront his departure his current spot or his point of arrival out of this with further study in other fields i found that any complexity stemmed from an initial point of nonconfront this is why looking at or recognizing the source of an aberration in processing blows it makes it vanish mental mass accumulates in vast complexity solely because one would not confront something to take apart problem requires only to establish what one could not or would not confront the basic thing man cant or wont confront is evil these people who always rationalize evil behaviorhe wasnt feeling well which is why he murdered the policeman etccan be counted on to voice some theetieweetie goodiegoodie justification for somebodys thoroughly evil conduct mr x wrecks house and you remark on it and miss theetie weetie will feel compelled to say oh mr x had poor childhood and he didnt mean any wrong she cant confront the simple but evil fact that mr x is complete dog one feels his hair stand on end when miss theetie weetie does this because one is observing complete non confront on the part of miss theetie weetie she is too unreal to do other than make one feel he has had an arc break one will also find that miss theetie weetie leads horribly complex lifeadjusting her thinking to agree with air spirits and leaving her family because there might be mice in the basement when noconfront enters chain may be set up which leads to total complexity and total unreality this in very complex form we call an aberrated condition people like that cant solve even rudimentary problems and act in an aimless and confused way to resolve their troubles requires more than education or discipline it requires processing some people are so complex that their full aberration does fully not resolve until they attain high level of ot large number of people deaberrate just by the education contained in scientology as they find in our subject the natural laws of life and seeing confronting them blow huge holes in their complexities and aberrations therefore the above laws are very important ones as they explain what aberration really is and why processing really works aberration is chain of vias based on primary nonconfront processing is series of methods arranged on an increasingly deep scale of bringing the preclear to confront the noconfront sources of his aberrations and leading him to simple powerful effective being l ron hubbard founder lrhjprd copyright 1967 by l ron hubbard all

the following definitions are applicable to scientology study technology checksheet list of materials often divided into sections that give the theory and practical steps which when completed give one study completion the items are selected to add up to the required knowledge of the subject they are arranged in the sequence necessary to gradient of increasing knowledge of the subject after each item there is place for the initial of the student or the person checking the student out when the checksheet is fully initialed it is complete meaning the student may now take an exam and be granted the award for completion some checksheets are required to be gone through twice before completion is granted checklist list of actions or inspections to ready an activity or machinery or object for use or estimate the needful repairs or corrections this is erroneously sometimes called checksheet but that word is reserved for study steps checkout the action of verifying students knowledge of an item given on checksheet twin checkout when two students are paired they check each other out this is different than supervisor checkout supervisor checkout checkout done by the supervisor of course or his assistants theory the data part of course where the data as in books tapes and manuals is given practical the drills which permit the student to associate and coordinate theory with the actual items and objects to which the theory applies practical is application of what one knows to what one is being taught to understand handle or control twin the study partner with whom one is paired two students studying the same subject who are paired to check out or help each other are said to be twinned twoway comm the precise technology of process used to clarify data with another for the other

corrections in this type style remimeo study series 2 confronting the first requisite of any subject is the ability to confront the various components things parts divisions of the subject itself all misunderstoods confusions omissions alterations of subject begin with failures or unwillingness to confront the difference between good pilot and bad pilot depends of course on consistent study and practice but underlying this determining whether the person will study and practice is the ability to confront the components of study and airplanes quick study by which is meant student who learns rapidly or person who grasps subject quickly has high ability to confront that subject in dramatic profession the wild animal trainer who could confront wild animals remained alive the one who couldnt confront was too slow of perception to live long in more common line of work the fast typist could confront study and typing in the first place and the slow typist couldnt and cant the confusions about talent and native ability and such are resolved to small extent when one recognizes the role played by the ability to confront basically if one can just be there with it he can then achieve the skill of communicating with whatever it is and handling it thus before communicating with the components of subject can properly begin one must be able to be there comfortably with the components of the subject all power depends upon the ability to hold location to communicate one must be able to hold to location this is even true in the physical universe you cant move chair unless you can hold position yourself near the chair if you dont believe it try it thus the ability to communicate with precedes the ability to handle but before one can communicate with something one must be able to be in location near it the ageold puzzle of how some scholars can get on subject they have studied and then not be able to apply even scrap of the data is resolved by this fact of confronting they can confront the book the class and the thought but they havent attained the ability to confront the physical objects of the subject at least such glib students can confront the book the paper the thought they are partway there now all they need to do is confront as well the physical things to which the subject is applied and they would be able to apply what they know 314some people are not so lucky as to be glib students they have to work up to being there with the book paper classroom and teacher thus confronting is actually the ability to be there comfortably and perceive amazing reactions occur when conscious effort is made to do this dullness perception trouble fogginess sleep and even pains emotions and convulsions can occur when one knowingly sets out to be there and comfortably perceive with the various parts of subject these reactions discharge and vanish as one perseveres continues and at last sometimes soon sometimes after long while one can be there and perceive the component as one is able to confront one part he then finds it easier to confront other components people have mental tricks they use to get around actual confrontingto be disinterested to realize its not important to be sort of half dead etcbut these discharge run out as well eventually and at last they can just be there and comfortably perceive eye blinks swallows twitches aches pains are all systems of interrupting confronting and are the symptoms of discomfort there are many of these if they are present then one is not just being there and perceiving confronting on via using relay point is another method of ducking out of it the worst off cannot even tolerate the idea of being there and perceiving anything they run away even go into emotional fits rather than be there and perceive such peoples lives are system of interruptions and vias all substitutes for confronting they are not very successful for success in life depends not on running away from it but by being there and perceiving it and then being able to communicate with it and handle it terms gradient scale means gradual increasing condition of or little more of little by little skipped gradient means taking on higher degree or amount before lesser degree of it has been handled one has to go back and handle the missed degree or thing or else one will have just losses on subject thereafter flattening something means to do it until it longer produces reaction overrunning something means accumulating protests and upsets about it until it is just mass of stops anyone can do anything forever unless he begins to stop it invalidation means refuting or degrading or discrediting or denying something someone else considers to be fact gradients some of the things one would have to be able to be there and perceive in order to study placed on graduated scale of increasing difficulty are beginning at all the classroom or work space paper 315books writing materials sounds student the supervisor the area of the study subjects physical components the motionless equipment of the subject the moving equipment of the subject masses connected with the subject the subject as whole the next stages would have to be confronting while moving this requires consecutive being there and perceiving even though one is occupying different locations the next stages would be confronting selectively while moving despite other things seeking to distract this bulletin is not an effort to set out the numerous confronting drills it is intended to set out the various axioms or laws necessary to an understanding of the subject of confronting itself from these brief notes all the axioms can be derived the fundamental and basic simplicities of confronting itself is the first thing that must be grasped all complexity surrounding any subject or action is derived comes from greater or lesser inability to confront l ron hubbard founder lrh sbntrd copyright 1971 1972 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved

westerners have ever seen chinese or arab school in progress it is very easy for them to miss the scene when one says chinese school the term has been used to designate an action where an instructor or officer with pointer stands up before an assembled class and taps chart or org board and says each part of it it is very funny to one who knows or has heard real chinese school to see the class sitting there silently this is strictly western pattern this is how teacher does it in omaha or cornell but never in shanghai chinese class sings out in unison all together in response to the teacher they participate the only western near equivalent is german beer hall where the audience choruses items sung out by the song leader chinese school then is an action of class vocal participation it is very lively loud affair it sounds like chanting in real chinese school the response is so timed that although spoken by many voices it is quite easy to tell what answer is being chorused it is essentially system that establishes instant thought responses so that the student given 2x2 thinks instantly 4 for example the instructor tapping big multiplication chart cries two times two the class in one voice cries four instructor five times two class ten and so on and on and on by the hour this gets more complex when let us say the maxims of good conduct or the koran are being taught in such cases the tablets or scrolls are on the wall the teacher calls chapter and verse and the students chant it you could teach the laws of listing and nulling the auditors code axioms and so on in this way the tools are the samean instructor pointer chart or set of pictures or big scrolls class there are two steps in such teaching the instructor taps and says what it is then asks the class what it is and they chant the answer b when the class has learned by being told and repeating the instructor now taps with the pointer and asks and the class chants the correct answer drill the instructor himself has to grasp the drill here is how it would go on an org bd 318a instructor taps div 1 this is division one hco division class chants division one hco division instructor taps div 6 this is division 6 distribution division class division 6 distribution division and so on until all divisions have been named few times b instructor taps div 1 what is this class division one hco division instructor taps div 4 what is this class division four tech division and so on and on the divisions are then considered trained in on the class next one would go to departments then to philosophic names of departments then to sections then one would go to the titles of each division head then to dept heads etc etc if one had function org board of what each div and department and post did one would go on with the same thing chinese school drill run for short period each day will eventually cover an enormous amount of org bd newcomers to the drill have to be schooled in to catch up or join new class anything can be taught by chinese school that is to be learned by rote the parts and actions are always the same there is also version that uses text preferably with copy of it in each students hands it sounds the same one is limited only by what he can put on chart or even in text where each student has copy of the text open before him crude charts are easy to draw up with felt heavy ink pen the size of chart is determined by the ability of the students furthest away to see it easily cloud types pictures to be named in foreign language even slides of airplane types anything can be chinese schooled that is to be learned verbatim and youd be surprised how many things should be and if they arent the person has shaky foundation under the subject care should be taken to define strange words but it is not really problem or exercise in word clearing it is verbatim rote teaching and it works and is lots of fun l ron hubbard founder lrh ntrd copyright 1972 by l ron

study series 6 primary rundown note reference hco b 30 mar 72 lrh ed 174 int in going through the study tapes the first time the student looks up every word on this first time he does not study for the sense of what is being said he only listens to words in this and in method 4 word clearing when being checked he is asked what is the definition of word he is not asked do you know the meaning of word to this he could answer yes and believe he did but when asked for the definition that he must then give it is different story entirely this is also the right way to handle any defining of words m2 m4 as well as methods i 3 never let the student be unsure make him look it up you will find that it is the simple word as such from that really bogs reading not technical terms in the study tapes there are some photographic terms any photo dictionary can give these almost any camera store has such dictionaries second time the second time through the study tapes the student listens for the sense of the sentences _________ it is very revealing to do the primary rundown in this fashion some students are actually getting meaning out of something heard or read for the first time in their lives _________ wonder schoolchildren by test get more stupid each additional year of school this has been established by actual test that they do each year they just have higher mountain of

correction rundown which is described in hco b 30 march 72 revised 30 may 72 simplicity the primary rundown is very simple in its steps do not add things onto it do not do something else honesty the keynote of the rundown is honesty the whole rundown can be wasted and the student fail and the end phenomena missed if the student goes dishonest or he is just pushed for student points by the supervisor if done dishonestly the whole future study career of the student will be not only more difficult but may fail entirely 323honesty means dont skip dont brush it off dont say it was done when it wasnt later checks of auditing or administrative failures contain checks of the primary rundown errors and honesty the whole rundown would have to be done again steps 1 verify if students tone arm on meter is usually between position 2 and 3 if so he may proceed if not he at once is sent to the primary correction rundown as his case needs repair or handling before he can do the rundown as mental mass will get in his way and he may get upset this step is checked by the supervisor the primary correction rundown is covered by hco b 30 march 72 revised 30 may 72 it consists of auditing and

right on method 1 he is now put on study tapes this is not just listening to study tapes heaven forbid this is hco b 21 june 72 issue iv word clearing series 41 method 8 this is long and careful cycle

hco b 16 apr 72 issue ii they may not be given method 1 word clearing they may only be method 4ed on solo instruction materials but they may not be debarred from study to all but those in the interference area the primary rundown is the required first step to all study when on or after ot iii such persons must now do the primary rundown before any continuance of study it now becomes mandatory correction rd the primary correction rundown takes care of people who have trouble on the primary rundown but do not lightly order the person to the primary correction rd if they can get through the primary rundown with bit of supervisor time let them go on through but if they are nattery or upset or desperate even when given help it is the primary correction rundown which will handle

answer is full drug rundown see hco b 25 oct 71 the special drug rundown this will end off the drugs and let him live way above any plane he thought drugs put him on we handle drug cases so easily it is foolish not to take this obvious step the reason he went on drugs or alcohol also comes off then he can study and retain what he learns open door the primary rundown is the open door to brilliance

revised 30 may 72 primary correction rundown students who struggle with the primary rundown hco b 4 apr 72 revised 30 may 72 are given the primary correction rundown steps 1 to 9 of the pcrd per hco b 30 march 72 revised 30 may 72 are paid for by the pc quite in addition to his primary rundown if available auditors exist on course of proper class and the pc is student then these steps i to 9 pcrd may be done on coaudit basis but if not well done or messed up or delayed must be done by professional auditor at the students own expense staff member stalled on the primary rundown is put through the pcrd in qual or qual and hgc for different steps qualifications is the correction division pcrd is correction action there should be word clearers in qual and these as class iiis should be competent to do steps i to 9 of the pcrd the object of pcrd is not to stall the person and keep him off the prd the purpose of the pcrd is to get the person through the prd where people have been put off the prd for any reason and are not industriously going through the pcrd it is up to qual to make sure they do get through pcrd and prd orgs that off load pcs or students on the thinnest excuses or qual divisions that will not service and speed the lines have to be watched as the discovery of trouble on the prd can be used to simply halt the student or pc instead of picking up the ball qual has been known to just send students back to class without handling or put students to doing their hats or other nonsense the idea is to complete somebody on what they are supposed to complete folder study if you study the persons folder particularly staff members you will probably find that several of the steps 1 to 9 have already been done these are checked off as done on the pcrd checklist any org that is worthy of the name has folder summaries in the inside lefthand cover of the current folder it is very easy to locate what have been done 326out lists it is not at all rare to find that various whys have been found but that the person is not doing well this is case of wrong items and is handled by cs series 78 thus steps i 2 3 and 6 of the pcrd may consist mainly of correcting botched up lists idle student the problem of putting someone off the prd onto the pcrd is that he is now idle as student he cannot go forward on his studies as he has not done his prd in fact going on studying without the prd is waste of time as its mainly misunderstood glib and wont be applied it is actually faster to do prd or pcrd and then study than it is to study without the prd or pcrd and it is certainly far more effective the thing to do is to get the student who is assigned to the pcrd through the pcrd as noted above he may have several points already done and the rest can be done easily and fast resistive students there are situations where you have students or even executives who will not even go to study these are of course people who need the pcrd worst but how to get them available even for that in the case of senior executive who will not study you can get disarrangement of the study lines as they wont push and will even impede studyfor instance by not making staff go to study time or preventing them from going also policy and hco bs fall out or are not enforced and form of org is not held since reading and study are similar actions so standard actions are not known naturally such thing has to be handled very fast because cooperation from such student is very limited time to do whole pcrd is not possible prepcrd there is prepcrd action that handles this it has 2 steps assess method 5 cs 53rc take the lfbd item and indicate it to the person dont handle it or the rest of 53rc just indicate it to the pc he will usually agree and cognite the ta will come down further and the needle will float thats it b now take the study correction list assess it method 5 pick out the biggest lfbd you got indicate it to the pc he will cognite the ta will drop down and an fn will occur thats it c put these 2 sheets in his pc folder for full handling of all reads by his auditor and add them to the pcs auditing program sheet inside the left front cover of the pcs folder 327the result will often be magical the person will become more agreeable about study or the primary correction rundown of course they should now get primary correction rundown of which cs 53rc is the first step anyway this prepcrd gets them started and it only takes little while the end phenomena of primary correction rundown is can he now quickly and easily do the primary rundown if yes and if it works out in practice that he can thats it let him onto the primary rd but if he bogs back to the pcrd moral the moral of this hco b is get them through the primary rundown if they cant or dont go do the pcrd and if theyre shunted to the pcrd get it done and get them to the real ep which is super literacy the moral is get them through dont idle about get it done then they will whizz along on fast flow study and youve got completions l ron hubbard founder lrhntrd copyright 1972 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 328b r d t c h n i c l b u l l t i n 4 february 1972rd revised

april 74only change made is in signature remimeo study series 9 confront there are several choices in english on the meaning of confront these include the right one to face without flinching or avoiding an example in sentence the test of free society is its capacity to confront rather than evade the vital questions of choice there is another meaning to stand facing or opposing especially in challenge defiance or accusation english is pretty limited language in many ways i imagine the thought of facing something which is what the word came from and originally meant way backfron being face was so horrifying to the types who write dictionaries they knew it would be bad in essence it is an action of being able to face if one cannot if he avoids then he is not aware awareness is the ability to perceive the existence of in the dictionary it also fails to confront that and says awareness the quality or state of being aware and aware means marked by realization perception or knowledge so these chaps couldnt confront and so conceived awareness to be figurefigure we are moving out of the range of language when we want to say he could stand up to things and wasnt always shrinking back into himself and avoiding so he could be fully conscious of the real universe and others around him and thats what confront means if one can confront he can be aware if he is aware he can perceive and act if he cant confront he will not be aware of things and will be withdrawn and not perceiving thus he is unaware of things around him thats the tech of it lrhntmjh l ron hubbard

this type style translating dianetic scientology study materials into foreign languages is inexpensively and effectively done by using sight instantaneous translation of bulletins policy letters and tapes onto tapes the tape original is made copy master is made and thereafter copies can be run off for courses which can be attended by students using only excellent tape copies and excellent reproduction equipment and listened to with high fidelity earphones word clearing technology is used to prevent the student losing interest because of misunderstood words the tape players used must be equipped with foot pedal startstop control the voice of the sight translator should be clear and the diction should be sharp and the tone should not be monotonous sight translator is one equally good in 2 languages who can hear one language and speak the translation into the other language without hesitation they are employed in the the material copied onto tapes can also be broken down into smaller reels for independent study by taking exact notes of the auditing commands and important rules the student will have the texts he needs for later reference the exact rundown of this is given in translating the materials of course from textbook or materials in one language to another the following steps are taken primary targets 1 person fully competent in both the languages and their cultures is found and retained 2 the materials to be translated are made available 3 tape recorder which can be started and stopped easily without leaving clicks on the tape is procured not dictation machine 4 an adequate supply of regular recording tape is made available 5 other materials such as paper and ballpoints are made available 6 quiet place where interruptions and outside noises will not ruin the tapes is found and the person is set up there 7 person knowledgeable in the subject and the language in which the original is written is retained and assists the translator 349operating targets 1 the translator using word clearing technology and dictionary to clear up any misunderstoods rapidly reads or goes through the materials to get general grasp of the subject 2 the technical assistant who knows the subject and the original language now goes through the materials with the translator every technical word or phrase or cultural idiom is underlined 3 while underlining the two persons decide on the correct translation of the technical word or phrase 4 as these are decided they are written down on note paper with complete definition 5 each word phrase and definition is translated into the language and written down on separate sheet of paper 6 the translated words phrases and definitions will become mimeographed glossary for the eventual student 7 each section and paragraph in the material is numbered 8 with this glossary to hand the translator now begins direct translation of the text onto tape the number of the tape and its materials is given at the beginning of each tape used or new chapter begun 9 the translator must be sure to read the materials in an interested voice and not let any hesitation or note of mystery creep in the translator is actually lecturing and must sound so 10 when the materials are complete good production masters are copied off of the master tape the master tape is set aside and not used further 11 the production master is now cut into chapter lengths which are numbered the same as the book chapters 12 several sets of the chapter copies are now made and put in their boxes both tracks can be used even 4 tracks not stereo can be used 13 the glossary in both the original language and the translated language is printed up along with course directions which are described in another technical paper the checksheet and course rules are also translated and printed in the local language 14 the course is boxed in sets with the glossary and course directions following this system one can rapidly produce sets of materials without the delays always experienced in printing as well as with cost reduction the tapes are listened to on individual tape players equipped with earphones and foot pedal startstop control so the students hands are free for taking notes and looking up words in the dictionary etc learning rate in an aural society is much higher than in society accustomed to print even an illiterate person or slow reader can be taught such means dictionary in the translated language must also be available in classroom the quality of the translators voice and clear diction are highly desirable

remimeo translate into the important various languages tape course series 2 dianetics and scientology in other languages hco policy letter of 11 may 1971 reissued as an hco bulletin tapes and book translations of dianetics and scientology are being made into other languages than english it is necessary to know the minimum materials an org in nonenglish speaking country would need to function it is not enough to have one book published it creates demand for services the demand for service must be met an has course in the language is not enough since it is not income producing thus the org could not survive financially it must survive financially to deliver the service even in total socialism the service would have to be given giving service depends on an org having the means of training auditors who can audit well and establishing the organization then the org could audit preclears as well as train more auditors if the auditors who are trained can audit well they will produce excellent results and public repute will spread an org must produce to survive by production is meant training auditors who can audit auditing pcs to good result and making money or in total socialism obtaining adequate support in ratio to production if an org just teaches an has course or tests people it will not be able to survive for it will not be able to obtain enough funds or support for this it is vital to train lots of auditors and audit lots of pcs without its staff knowing the basic data of organization the org will have difficulties in giving service the technology of administration is important thus we get the minimum materials in the language vital to an orgs survival printed material the book dianetics the modern science of mental health printed with hard covers in the language is vital when members of the public read it and take an has course they want training or processing or both this book placed in bookstores advertised in magazines and sold by field staff members and the org itself not only reaches the public but also in hardcover form pays for its own distribution as paperback it does not pay for itself 351to this add testing materials printed in the language for intelligence and personality testing and their marking directions recorded tapes recorded tapes and tape players in the org to play to individuals in classes is the easiest form in which to deliver data from such tapes students may take notes as time goes on the tapes will be transcribed and the material printed or mimeographed this is not to be done by the individual orgs it will be found however that tapes will always be necessary even when some is printed as the volume of data is very great students should not be permitted to print copies of their notes and sell them as time has shown that such notes are not accurate enough and spread errors that show up in training and auditing failures in reviewing student must be sent back to the original not to his notes so he can correct his notes and get the data accurately nearly all noresults are traced to altered data or poor training of the student which amounts to the same thing the minimum list of tapes is 1 mini course supervisor hat 2 has course 3 hdc course 4 academy courses levels 0 to iv 5 original thesis 6 notes on the lectures 7 hat of scientologist 8 staff status i 9 staff status ii 10 translated org bd _________ given these bare essentials and teaching them well and using them will give an org sufficient survival to deliver results if every bit of the above is known and used by staff they will not have too much trouble set up and functioning and solvent an org can then think about further materials class vi class vii class viii and class ix course materials on tape should exist in saint hill org in the language of that country for the org itself volume zero of the oec course should exist on tape 352after that the full course supervisors course should exist then further books such as dianetics 55 science of survival and the creation of human ability should come out as tape and then in published hardcover form the full oec should now be acquired on tape the full study tapes should be to hand the org will now be ready to use all the febc series and the febc tapes _________ the hardest idea for an org staff to get is the idea of production in terms of auditors trained who can audit pcs audited to excellent results and money or support produced to keep the staff members and the org solvent because of this it is best for 2 or more bilingual executives to attain full febc training however with the above minimum materials fully studied and in use an org can survive until it is ready to prosper _________ note at this writing many are working hard to complete the listed materials they are not yet available in all languages there is only one other type of item needed by an org and that is the emeter supplies of these must be arranged for country running in very high volume will probably manufacture its own meters against an exact prototype under existing international patents on source it will be found in all countries where dianetics and scientology and orgs have been successful that key part of the success was keeping the subject on source the public at once distrusts persons or groups who alter the materials or use some of them or attribute them to others this is quite factual and the public is right all great and lasting successes have been made by orgs that were on source and whose materials were straight and correct and used that way l ron

reissued as an hcob changes in this type style the instruction of students by tape is done by individual tape playbacks equipped with earphones and foot pedal startstop control it is imperative that the earphone quality be of the highest and the tape copy have very good sound quality otherwise students go to sleep over misunderstood words the individual tape player method is used because it can handle large or small number of students b it works where there is trickle of students starting at different times c it works where students studying subjects different from each other are using the same classroom i t takes more tape players and must be earphone equipped but it prevents students going past misunderstoods as can occur if they are all listening to group tape play the foot controlled startstop pedal is necessary so the student can use his hands freely to take notes and look up words in the dictionary it also enables the tape to be stopped instantly without the time lag it takes to reach for and push finger button thus going past the place where the stop is desired rules description only the glossary course rules and checksheets with course description are translated into the language being used for teaching and mimeographed or printed into small booklets the description must include how to handle tape players and caution against machine or tape damage and inadvertent erasure of tape to guard against actual erasure it is wisest to tape over the record button or preferably to have the recording unit disengaged also it is sometimes possible to buy at cheaper prices playback units only tape machines in which the recording unit hasnt been installed they must however be of good quality enrollment enrollment is done matter how informal the course is waiver of accident or damage holding the school not responsible must be signed by the student and if minor by his parents or guardian on any tape course an enrollment invoice showing full course payment must be in the hands of the supervisor giving the date of enrollment home address and local address 354a roll book has every students name address and the course enrolled in and date this must not be omitted as it is the only permanent record and is often resorted to to prove contentions files student file system must exist folder with the students name on it and which will receive his completed checksheets exam results etc must be made up at once checksheet checksheet for the course must exist breaking the course down into small easily attained segments of theory and practical it must be in the students language it has blanks opposite each segment so that student checkout can be initialed with date by the person checking him out notebooks student is expected to keep notebook from his tape listening this should be neat and complete the student never copies out the whole tape he takes exact verbatim notes of any process commands or lists and notes down also the important

in the first place some tape machines will do both actions of recording and playback on tape course if these machines are used the button that is used for recording should be removed or sealed up so it can not be used it will wipe the tape clean and lose the valuable course materials if pushed accidentally by student this button is usually colored red tape players come in many makes and models

tracks recorded on the one side 24 speed selector switch tapes can be recorded at different speeds and so some must be played at different speeds to others 25 indicator dial and buttons connected with recordingnot used when playing tapes here are some points to help you use the tape player when placing tape on the machine an arrow on top of the tape reel indicates an opening in which you place the tape end keep this end very small long loose ends break off and can jam the machine b the dull brown colored side of the tape must always face inwards against the playing head when threading the tape this is the side that rons lectures are recorded on c to wind back or fast wind the machine always press the stop key first harm is done if the playing tape is suddenly switched over to reverse or fast forward bypassing the stop button d the magnetic materials of the earphones can harm the tape so never leave the earphones lying on top of an uncovered tape player keep all dirt out of the tape player and when away from the player replace the lid to avoid dust entering into the machine 359f every care must be taken to avoid rough handling of tapes do not misplace tapes into incorrect boxes and never permit loose ends to protrude out of the closed box g switch off the tape player when not in use break time and when you have finished with the machine this prevents overheating of inner parts and drive belts h the tape counter indicator should be set at zero when you first start playing the tape this counter will register your place whenever you stop the tape do not insert piece of paper or anything else between the tape as method of registering your place i at the first sign of any fault with the tape player please call the supervisor and report what it is to him or her j twisting or knotting the earphone cord is strictly forbidden as this leads to inner wire breakage which results in concealed fault that can be difficult to locate k the metal playing head across which the tape moves when playing must be cleaned at regular intervals as it picks up dust from the tape resulting in blurred poor quality sound this playing head should be cleaned after every 8 hours of playing time or whenever the sound becomes blurred the playing head is cleaned by use of cotton swab on the end of toothpick and cleaning fluid this is wiped with firm pressure across the playing head until the dirt and dust are removed and the metal is clean again great care must be taken not to scratch the playing head as the tape would then be damaged as it passed across l the tape player must also be demagnetized after every 8 hours playing time this is done with special demagnetizer designed for the purpose the playing head and all the metal parts on the tape path are demagnetized in this manner these parts build up magnetic attraction with continuous tape playing and this can be harmful to the quality of sound on the tape if not handled and removed as above it is the supervisors or course administrators responsibility to learn to do this action and to do it at least once per day on all tape players m the moving parts of the tape machine mechanism also need regular cleaning and lubrication with very fine lubricant this procedure can be carefully learned by the course administrator from professional at the job and can be done by him thereafter training services aide reissued

foreword the most appalling ignorance has existed on the use of magnetic recording tapes it is therefore of the greatest possible importance that the subject of tape use be grasped and gotten rapidly into effect probably half the technology of admin and tech exists only on tape tapes incorrectly used can be the source of endless misunderstoods because tapes have been almost uniformly misused in the past these misunderstoods have added up to general misunderstood on the subject of tapes themselves students have been known to copy down the whole tape so they could study it this is complete waste of time and misuse of student study hours some orgs even played advanced study tapes to the public european orgs have even played translation quality tapes usually not auditorium quality of oec volumes as raw public lectures and lost their audience through lack of quality and inaudible and strange words casual staff briefing tapes not okay for release of very bad quality have been played to staffs of other orgs and the public there is end to the abuses therefore for the benefit of understanding words alone it is vital that tapes be properly used and not abused types of tapes there are four classes of tapes these are 1 course study tapes 2 public lecture tapes 3 briefing tapes 4 model performance tapes 364course study tapes tapes made for courses are of two varieties english usually by lrh b translations done by translators they are for course use this is what the org sellstraining on tech or admin these tapes appear on checksheets and are done at the points of checksheets where they are called for and are done by method 2 for tapes or method 3 for tapes as required the foreign language tape courses are done from special tape checksheet and are done exactly as laid down by method 2 or method 3 none of these tapes are all written out by the student and then studied this is waste of time further such tapes are not played straight through with the student making notes of any misunderstood words to look up later this will blank out the tape content on the students mind and knock out the student so to play course tape straight through to any student is to risk stupidity and blow it is not done it does not matter whether the student takes notes of misunderstoods or not course tape is not played straight through only the earphone footpedal startstop control procedures are used course tape is never played to group of students when played to more than one student some student is going to get misunderstood and there goes blank student two students dont even listen to tape even on method 2 tape word clearing one has the meter and footpedal and the other the earphones the word clearer stops at each read he does not otherwise listen course tape quality must be good all the words must be hearable and not inaudible they must not be slurred or hard to make out the earphones and tape player used must be high fidelity just any old earphones wont do the tape player playing head across which the tape passes must be cleandone by cotton swab on toothpick and cleaning fluid the tape coating comes off on the playing head and after time the sound is badly blurred using course tape any other way is now forbidden tests have shown that violations of this are the reason for student failures and blows and outethics it goes without saying that the general handling of tape players and tapes must be well learned and practiced by course supervisors and students public lecture tapes the probable reason stats fall after tape congresses is the misunderstood word congresses seldom use really high fidelity equipment further tape copying is often done by outside firms and the tape copies themselves may be of poor quality the combination is deadly 365we looked for the reason for stat drops after tape congresses and this is the only explanation which has come forth doingness congresses that are mainly seminars have been very successful by doingness is meant trstraining drillsand other actions the relay of data to public whose vocabulary is usually inadequate is not likely to win as it hits their faulty vocabulary for one thing and uses new words for another you can show somebody how to do things far better than you can tell him this then extends into div 6 introductory actions as well the relay of data comes after the demonstration in action terms the possibility of possible bad playing speakers possible low tape copy quality the barriers of languages not learned in the first place and the introduction of new mental concepts combine into hurdle that makes tape or film public presentation adventurous listening to public type tapes by using footpedal startstop tape players is being put in special public course category raw public tape and film presentations are however must to keep the flavor and meaning of dianetics and scientology so ensure excellent quality tapes and equipment are used with correct tapes for that public and you will have success briefing tapes these are not to be confused with special briefing course tapes briefing tape is done to brief or debrief missionaires or to record conference or to record special instructions to person or group it can then be used for reference or to settle any dispute it can also be used to inform staff or several staffs briefing tape is then tape designed for special and informed audience if the tape quality is good and the audience is already familiar or trained audience briefing tape can be played only to the audience for which it was intended to do otherwise is to risk misunderstood words and noncomprehension of what it is all about in general rons journals were staff briefing tapes they began to be used for public while they were not without success one could longer brief staffs on this line and the line was therefore cut one could not make them with security that they would be played to staffs an isolated briefing to single executive on these are our future hopes has been thereafter used as staff briefing of many orgs as these are your orders any tape is designed for specific public briefing tapes are especially subject to abuse by being played to wrong publics any briefing tape which contains specific orders and plans which could be misunderstood should be played only to the individuals concerned with stopstart footpedal and method 3 word clearing not going past any misunderstood after person has been briefed verbally it is very revelatory to then word clear 2 the tape made at the same time it will often be found that misunderstood words lead to potential alteris in the actions required 366tape in this instance is an enormous help in assisting and clarifying briefings group can be briefed if thereafter each is word cleared method 3 or 2 on the tape afterwards using standard tape word clearing needless to say such tapes must be of good quality model performance tapes tapes exist which give standard of performance in dianetic and scientology auditing student auditors have never been known to achieve high standard of session presence and communication and accordingly high results without the careful study of tapes made of similar sessions by high level auditors student musician is unlikely to achieve professional performance level unless he has heard professional play it would take film or live demonstration to communicate high standard of performance in purely action subject for instance for centuries one believed that robin hood could split his first target arrow with second until new generation worked on it and few painfully recovered the lost art of archery and then demonstrated how it was done for others to see tapes and films serve vital purpose in maintaining performance standard as these tapes and films show how it is done and the atmosphere and rhythm of action they are not subject to word clearing conclusion tape and film training is vital valuable and has its role but like showing child how to open book and read there is exact technology in using tapes and films the first thing one must realize is that the use of tape and film is itself technical subject that must be studied and learned one does not naturally know it the failures of universities to make educated and civilized men is because their own professors know nothing of misunderstood words and so lectured happily on and on to snoring student body one professor of physics used to open the classroom windows wide in freezing winter to keep his students from going to sleep in his class and then stood on the platform and defined nothing as he rambled on all it did for his class was give them coughs between snores the handling and use of tape and film in training and administration is subject by failing to know it and use that information one can block the road for himself and all others to being learned and being free l ron hubbard founder lrhnt jh copyright 1971 1974 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 367b

must always be listened to through high quality high fidelity earphones this permits the listener to be undisturbed by other noises in the area as well as prevents others from being disturbed by the tape being played high fidelity earphones permit the listener to have his undivided attention on the tape and produce pleasant and easy to listen to sound which closely duplicates what is spoken on the tape the tape player used must also be of high quality to reproduce the sound without adding to or distorting what is on the tape poor quality sound is difficult and annoying to listen to and causes misunderstoods by preventing the listener from hearing exactly what is said properly cared for and regularly maintained high quality player will last several times as long as one costing half as much which never does produce good quality sound setting up the tape player 1 the tape player is set up on steady bench table or platform at comfortable height so the student can operate the controls easily when seated in front of it 2 if possible the tape machines should be set up so that the student is facing the supervisor of the course rather than the student having his back to the supervisor this enables the supervisor to spot easily if the student has gone dull or sleepy from misunderstood word 3the tape machine is plugged in switched on to check if the power is on and that the machine is operating 4 the tape machine must be the type that is set up to operate with startstop foot pedal switch these can easily be obtained and fitted to existing tape players that do not already have them this is very important as the machine will be started and stopped many times by the student with his foot on the pedal while he is using his hands to look up words in the dictionary fill in his checksheet etc the connected foot pedal is placed where it is in easy reach of the students foot test it to ensure it is working 5 the tape player playing head across which the tape passes is checked to ensure that it is clean the tape coating comes off on the playing head and after time the sound is badly blurred if the playing head appears dirty or the sound is blurred the tape head must be cleaned this is done using cotton swab on toothpick and cleaning fluid it is rubbed across the playing head until all the tape coating is removed 6 the tape that is to be heard is obtained and put on the player and set up for startby passing the coloured leader on the tape past the playing head and onto the empty spool make sure it is passed around the roller guides designed to ensure it

speed 11listen to the tapes in the order they are entered on your course checksheet 12 mark off each item on your course checksheet as you finish listening to it or when you have checked out on it if checkout is required 13 mark the tape counter reading of each item on your checksheet as that item begins on the tape this gives you reference by which you can find any item later on you may be required to restudy some items by the supervisor and you may want to hear some of them again yourself to clarify them with later tapes 14 if words or phrase on tape cannot be understood call for the supervisor the supervisor listens to the tape and if he cant distinguish what is being said with the help of the course admin gets hold of the english text and locates the word or phrase then using good foreign language dictionary translates the word or phrase for the student this cycle should only take couple of minutes 15 if student bogs on listening to translated tape he is first word cleared should the confusion not clear up the translated tape is compared to the english material and if found to be translation error the supervisor or word clearer with the use of good dictionary translates the english text correctly for the student the supervisor makes note of the translation error by entering the error on card which is placed in the tape box for student use and sends report to chief

feels funny gets dizzy from time to time or eyes start to hurt the student should locate the section on the tape where he had lack of mass and either go and find the actual mass under discussion and feel and inspect it if possible or find photo of it or demonstrate the mass in clay with labels or use his demo kit to demonstrate the mass the student should then relisten to the rest of the tape from that section on 11 the supervisor must be alert to the manifestations of lack of mass and misunderstood words and quickly see that the correct handling is done rapidly if he does not handle he will shortly end up with students 12 if student cannot locate the misunderstood word using method 3 either on his own or with the supervisor the supervisor should apply method 2 word clearing to that

trouble with to the supervisorword clearers desk where another tape machine and an emeter are set upor the supervisor takes an emeter and sets it up at the students tape machine 6 the student is asked at which point on the tape he became bogged he is then asked for the point on the tape when he was doing ok the tape is then reversed to the exact end point of where he was doing well the first mu

15 the word clearer ensures that the student puts each definition into sentences to ensure the word is fully understood to fn 16 the word clearer ensures that the student has clarified the exact definition of the word as used in the tape and plays back that section of the tape for the student in order to ensure it is cleared 17 the tape is now turned back to the beginning of the section where

handling to the result of an fning student at which point the student is returned to his course d starting the word clearing is done by informing the student i am not auditing you the tape is then started and the procedure is as given earlier in this btb for method 2 the only difference being that the whole materials are covered in this manner with the word clearer taking up and clearing all reading words and any words originated by the student as misunderstood each word handled is cleared to floating needle on the meter f the word clearing period is ended on floating needle g note if the

method 4 notes too generalized question in using method 4 defeats its use and can restimulate person badly example is there anything in college you didnt understand that of course is just plain ridiculous as question have you ever heard anything you didnt understand would be similarly silly break down the materials when doing method 4 you have to break down the materials put them into small separate units in order to ask questions example we have papers 1 2 both on the same subject the wrong question for method 4 would be is there anything in papers 1 2 you didnt understand and not even give him the papers to see the right way to do it would be to take paper 1 and break it down into its obvious sections give the person paper 1 and let him look at it point to its 1st section and say is there anything you didnt understand in this section while watching the meter then point to next section do the same finish paper 1 then go to paper 2 and do it the same person has to know what hes being asked about and has to be thinking of it when asked the question tapes just as it would be ridiculous to ask have you ever misunderstood anything you ever read it would be silly to ask did you ever have misunderstood on tape the right way is to take the tape and put it on machine and play bit of it and ask is there anything in the first section of this tape you didnt understand while watching the meter then high speed the tape forward to another area and do the same thus the tape is covered this can also be done from any tape notes section by section books books are done chapter by chapter 375quickie m4 method 4 is defeated utterly by 1 bad metering 2 too general question 3 not having the material to hand 4 not getting the persons attention on parts of the material 5 not

due to additional data on the subject of tape translations when translating tape lectures to tapes it has been found that higher quality translations are achieved by using tape transcripts instead of the actual taped lecture secondary factor is that using transcripts is easier for the sight translator and consequently speed of production and morale are increased the method for translating taped lectures is as follows 1 the translator is provided with typed transcript of the taped lecture transcripts used must be expertly done and edited so they read well 2 the translator using word clearing technology and dictionary to clear up any misunderstoods rapidly reads or goes through the transcript to get general grasp of the subject 3 the technical assistant who knows the subject and the original language now goes through the transcript with the translator every technical word or phrase or cultural idiom is underlined 4 while underlining the two persons decide on the correct translation of the technical word or phrase 5 as these are decided they are written down on notepaper with complete definition 6 each word phrase and definition is translated into the language and written down on separate sheet of paper 7 the translated words phrases and definitions will become mimeographed glossary for the eventual student 8 with this glossary to hand the translator then takes the transcript to the recording booth and begins direct translation of the transcript onto tape at the beginning of the tape the tape is copyrighted title of the tape and number are given 9 the translated master tape is then given to the recording engineer who handles the making of production masters editing copying in other words gets the tape prepared for distribution 37910 pretaping of transcripts before making the translation master tape is allowed and is covered in hco pl 2 april 71 sight translating expertise what is not done translating an english tape transcription into foreign language on manuscript and then translating from the foreign language transcription onto master tape b transcribing an lrh tape into foreign language and then transferring that onto tape correct sequence is transcription to english first and then the translating onto tape c translating directly from the taped lecture onto tape d using transcriptions which are not expertly done to do otherwise will result in alteris and confusion of the material and misunderstoods for the student or staff member trying to sound as ron would sound on one of his taped lectures this is not required reading the materials in an interested voice and not letting any hesitation or note of mystery creep in is sufficient enough the test is the translator must sound as though he is actually lecturing revised by cs2

is change pubs orgs of series from 17 to 13 tape course series 13 tape course checksheets translated tape courses differ from standard english courses in that the translated hco bs and pls are recorded on tape instead of mimeoed on paper because of this difference the checksheets must be laid out in such manner that the student can easily find where each hco b and hco pl begins on the tapes he must be able to do this without having to listen to all of the tapes or whole tape each time he wants to find particular piece of data from an issue tape counters are used by students listening to translated tape course to keep record of where the issues are located on the tape as the student listens to the items through the tape he writes the tape counter reading as the item begins beside the item on the checksheet this gives him tape counter reference for each item and makes it easy for any specific item on the tape to be located swiftly if he needs to listen to it again so tape course checksheets contain the tape numbers of each tape and space for the tape counter reading the following is the exact procedure used by translations units in making tape course checksheets the translator takes the english checksheet of the course he has translated onto tape and translates the checksheet onto paper with these additions 1 just before the first item on the checksheet is brief explanation of the tape course see attached sample for text 2 the translator leaves more space than usual between items on the checksheet so there will be room to include the tape numbers on the checksheet 3 an extra column is put at the beginning margin of each checksheet item for noting the tape counter reading of each item on the tape b next the tape numbers themselves must be entered on the checksheet designating where each tape begins for example 12 09 71 would be the number of the tape made on the 9th day of the 1 2th month dec 1971 in addition to the tape number the course and sequence are written out on the checksheet with the tape number below it ie hsdctape 1 side tape number 120971 all of this is entered in square on the checksheet an addition is made alongside this square as below 381eghsdctape l side note be sure to reset your tape tape number 120971 counter reading to zero the procedure for entering the tape numbers on the checksheet is as follows 1 full set of the tape copies not master tapes or production masters for that particular course is obtained the copies must be arranged in the proper sequence tape 1 tape 2 etc and must be in their labelled tape boxes 2 the first tape is picked up and the label on the back of the tape box is read this label will list the items that are on the tape in the order they occur on the tape the translator or another person who speaks the language looks at this label to determine the first item on the first side of the tape side 3 he then locates the same item on the checksheet and enters the tape number just above that item on the checksheet 4 he puts square around the tape number on the checksheet 5 alongside the square he adds be sure to reset your tape counter reading to zero 6 he then looks at the side b of the tape box label and repeats steps 25 7 the same steps 26 are done with each tape for that course c the final checksheet is checked on all the above points before being given ok to go to mimeo for issue d the checksheet is sent to mimeo where it is typed on stencils proofread and run off the final product is in the same format as the attached sample additional notes it must not be assumed that tape course checksheets for the same course will be alike from language to language translators speak at varying speeds so the number of items on each tape will also vary thus the first item on each tape will be different for each language all of the above steps must be done for each course in each language this special format for tape translated course checksheets appears on the attached sample it is to be used in all tape course translations sample tape course checksheet format course name usual course introduction plus __________________________ ____________________ students name org name etc etc 382the material on this checksheet has been translated onto tape into your own language play the tapes in the order shown on the checksheet and indicated on the tape boxes sign your initials for every recorded item bulletin etc on the checksheet when you have finished listening to it the name of every separate item is given on the tape before the item is recorded fill out the column tape counter with the numbers at the beginning of every item this makes it possible for you to easily find particular item if you wish to listen to it again make sure the tape counter is set at 0 before you start playing the tape so that you can use the tape counter with success set up the tape recorder the way you have learned and start we wish you very successful course

sussex hco bulletin of 25 june 1971 r revised 25 november 1974 remimeo tech qual all students supervisors word clearing series 3r supervisors course cramming word clearers barriers to study there are three different sets of physiological and mental reactions that come from 3 different aspects of study they are three different sets of symptoms 1 education in the absence of the mass in which the technology will be involved is very hard on the student it actually makes him feel squashed makes him feel bent sort of spinny sort of dead bored exasperated if he is studying the doingness of something in which the mass is absent this will be the result photographs help and motion pictures would do pretty good as they are sort of promise or hope of the mass but the printed page and the spoken word are not substitute for tractor if hes studying about tractors you have to understand this data in its purityand that is that educating person in mass that they dont have and which isnt available produces physiological reactions that is what i am trying to teach you its just fact youre trying to teach this fellow all about tractors and youre not giving him any tractorswell hes going to wind up with face that feels squashed with headaches and with his stomach feeling funny hes going to feel dizzy from time to time and very often his eyes are going to hurt its physiological datum that has to do with processing and the field of the mind you could therefore expect the greatest incidence of suicide or illness in that field of education most devoted to studying absent masses this one of studying the something without its mass ever being around produces the most distinctly recognizable reactions if child felt sick in the field of study and it were traced back to this one the positive remedy would be to supply the massthe object or reasonable substitute and it would clear it up 2 there is another series of physiological phenomena that exist which is based on the fact of too steep study gradient thats another source of physiological study reaction because of too steep gradient 393it is sort of confusion or reelingness that goes with this one youve hit too steep gradient there was too much of jump because he didnt understand what he was doing and he jumped to the next thing and that was too steep and he went too fast and he will assign all of his difficulties to this new thing now differentiate herebecause gradients sounds terribly like the 3rd one of these study hangups definitionsbut remember that they are quite distinctly different gradients are more pronounced in the field of doingness but they still hang over into the field of understanding in gradients however it is the actions we are interested in we have plotted course of forward motion of actions we find he was terribly confused on the second action he was supposed to do we must assume then that he never really got out of the first one the remedy for this one of too steep gradient is cutting back find out when he was not confused on the gradient then what new action he undertook to do find what action he understood well just before he was all confused what did he understand welland then we find out that he didnt understand it well its really at the tail end of what he understood and then he went over the gradient you see it is most recognizable and most applicable in the field of doingness thats the gradient barrier and one full set of phenomena accompanies that 3 there is this third one an entirely different set of physiological reactions brought about througha bypassed definition bypassed definition gives one distinctly blank feeling or washedout feeling notthere feeling and sort of nervous hysteria will follow in the back of that the manifestation of blow stems from this 3rd aspect of study which is the misunderstood definition or the not comprehended definition the undefined word thats the one that produces the blow the person doesnt necessarily blow on these other twothey are not pronouncedly blow phenomena they are simply physiological phenomena this one of the misunderstood definition is so much more important its the makeup of human relations the mind and subjects it establishes aptitude and lack of aptitude and its what psychologists have been trying to test for years without recognizing what it was its the definitions of words the misunderstood word thats all it goes back to and that produces such vast panorama of mental effects that it itself is the prime factor involved with stupidity and the prime factor involved with many other things if person didnt have misunderstoods his talent might or might not be present but his doingness would be present we cant say that joe would paint as well as bill if both were unaberrated in the field of art but we can say that the inability of joe to paint compared with the ability of 394joe to do the motions of painting is dependent exclusively and only upon definitions exclusively and only upon definitions there is some word in the field of art that the person who is inept didnt define or understand and that is followed by an inability to act in the field of the arts thats very important because it tells you what happens to doingness and that the restoration of doingness depends only upon the restoration of understanding on the misunderstood wordmisunderstood definition this is very fast processing there is very swift wide big result obtainable in this it has technology which is very simple technology it enters in at the lower levels because it has to this doesnt mean it is unimportant it means it has to be at the entrance gates of scientology it is sweepingly fantastic discovery in the field of education and dont neglect it you can trace back the subject person is dumb in or any allied subject that got mixed up with it the psychologist doesnt understand scientology he never understood word in psychology so he doesnt understand scientology well that opens the gate to education although ive given this one of the misunderstood definition last it is the most important one l ron hubbard founder lrhntrd jh copyright 1971 1974 by l ron hubbard all rights

has been described has been described for the use of an auditor not supervisor of course supervisors not knowing this then run around itsaing students they let the students itsa and they think they are going to get some place its the most incredible scene that you ever heard of and the boom could go bust only on this one point ive got it narrowed down to this apparently matter how many times the study tapes have been played nobody has ever heard of them i watched recent course run to find out how deep they would let the students strugglehow long it would stay boggedand it would have stayed bogged from here on out and do you know whats out its the study data tapes just thatand thats all thats out on course so when they say 2way comm the students youll find the supervisors instantly start to itsa them and are using auditor 2way comm on these courses it doesnt belong on these courses ill give you now the total dialogue of supervisor the supervisor shows interest there can be little bit of chatter likei see youve just completed greatsomething like that or he shows interesthow are you doing student repliesah well im doing all right supervisornow are there any words there in that that you have misunderstood studentno supervisorwell what is the word that you didnt quite understand studentah well ah this one supervisor good now look that word up now whats the word in the paragraph above that wheres that alright lets look that up now use it in sentence couple of times and ill be back in minute he comes back the student gives him the sentences for it and straightens it out and he sees the students got it 396thats the 2way comm of supervisor if supervisor does any other thing youve got wrecked course ive got the proof of it the way you teach tr course is you give the student the bulletin and you have him read it you dont check the guy out on the bulletin he just reads it when you come back you say alright have you read it yeah ive read it what word dont you understand on it you will find things like hco b and tr and you get those cleared up etc i am having some roaring success stories from febc students who are through this one had gone through the bulletin 10 times and had found words he didnt know all 10 times and he was all of sudden finding new things on the bulletin that hed never heard of before another student had gone through it 20 times with the same result and they were doing fine and getting down to trs and passing them on tr course you give them the bulletin and let them read it and you find what word they didnt understand thats the routine now that sounds so impossibleand its been on the study tapes for so longthat you wouldnt believe that this thing is the key do you know there were students there for 15 or 20 days until we started doing this then all of sudden there was breakthrough and their enthusiasm started coming up they had been just going lose lose lose out the bottom because supervisors were letting them itsa maybe supervisors thought they were auditors they arent neither are they supposed to give advice or tell students howor ask them if they blinked or anything else the other thing they were doing was only emphasizing all the cants the students just went into despair this was because the supervisors were inviting all kinds of itsa and criticizing and so forth you may say gee everybody knows its misunderstood word yehbut they dont use it now ill give you another one i set up test so that each student was brought up to the d of t who had meter on his desk and hed ask them if they had anything they misunderstoodand see if they got read on the meter if it didnt clear up at once hed send them back to get the definitions and look the thing up and of course use the word in couple of sentences and then if it didnt clear up hed send them to the word clearer and really let them get worked over because it goes way back they even found student who had misunderstood word clear back into his last life 397there wasnt any other 2way comm and other interest and they just about blew the roof off with student stat points this is the action of supervisor and thats all the action supervisor doesand he can do that the course has plenty of dictionaries and so on but the main point is it is the misunderstood word this has been proven again on tr practical course its the misunderstood word and the misunderstood action on other courses its just misunderstood words and misunderstood words and misunderstood words one right after the other as fast as they clear this upup the students production goes its painfully slow on some of them at first and i suppose the supervisors have so many misunderstood words of their own that they just wont key into doing this action and thats whats wrecking courses its elementary and its the wildest discovery of all time but they dont use it if it is used your courses start running fast your students start learning quickly and all starts going well other course outnesses like supervisors not giving anybody pack or one to give checkouts are all administrative outnesses as far as actual supervision is concerned its this other line of handling misunderstood words the second that line is in there are wins all over the place the second that line is out there is delivery if auditors are goofing then in their training they have not been made to look up the misunderstood word and lot of itsa has gone on and people have evaluated for them then these auditors having made mistakes they never corrected with this tech think they need something new to run on pcs but they just wreck new tech too we are shooting for target using just this misunderstood word tech of reduction of time by about third on all major courses just using this misunderstood word tech thats all if some student is totally slow student you can get him back to the first bulletin or book he ever read and make him get every word in it he didnt understand and it will go up in

he says yes i had hard night last night up all night arguing with my wife etcwhich could go on for hours but the supervisor says now yesterday or today what word did you run across that you didnt

tech product officers let us consider each student who is tearing along successfully in his studies to be an fning student as supervisor you would want to handle anything that slowed or interfered with such students fn using dopeoff as the only detection of misunderstoods is supervising at below fn level the fn went off long before the student reached the point of dopeoff so waiting for dopeoff to occur before handling is waiting too long let us look at this from the point of view of the tone scale if you consider that each student who is not at tone 50 during study has misunderstood word and if you do something about the misunderstood wordthen you can drive up study velocity so that all students are flying along as fning students its not misunderstood phrase or idea or concept but misunderstood word this always occurs before the subject itself is not understood in comparison with waiting for dopeoff to occur before handling the misunderstoods this method is like high level

session i had was really terrific i thought i didnt have any misunderstoods as i always look them up in the dictionary but in the session i unearthed basic misunderstoods which had caused to go into apathy about discovering things about lifeand the reason for blowing from earlier subjects and throwing away old abilities im very excited about what word clearing can do its like grade as it restores ability my thanks to lrh for this great tech and to my word clearer for great session pm what an experience i had done it on pc and i saw his gains but having had it done on really gives totally new

most basic material about it and starting at the very top of the first page including even the heading and issue numbers watch the meter carefully halt the person at each read and whether he says he knows the meaning or not if it read have him look it up in good big dictionary have him use the word in sentences of his own invention make him do this as long as it is bringing the ta down if you get into trouble with him go back and find the misunderstood you missed keep hunting and keep working at it and his misunderstood words will blow and his inability to understand the post will blow explanation failed posts and duties trace back to misunderstood words until you see it you wont believe it one student who had studied his post for third of year was given method 2 on its materials it took 15 hours of method 2 work protests blows upsets to finally discover that he did not know what post meant or what the words in the title meant another person studied half year to be an administrator yet when he was given his personnel orders appointing him and method 2 was done on them in the first 50 words of the personnel order there were 13 individual misunderstood words each one of which related to the post and were simple english similar ratio continued throughout the personnel order he was about to fail with fanfare behind post failure the explanation is misunderstood words psychosis evil intention is the only other reason for failure but even this can be handled by auditing today and even psychosis lessens when misunderstood words are handled successes it is not difficult to use method 2 word clearing one must be able to handle arc breaks problems and withholds and read meter one must have very big dictionary available when little ones fail one must be

great frequency when doing method 2 word clearing they read it takes big dictionary to define these simple words fully this is another oddity the small dictionaries also suppose everybody knows it is

effect of misunderstood words in those areas which give man the most trouble you will find the most alteration of fact the most confused and conflicting ideas and of course the greatest number of

university in 1879 perverted the term it really means just study ology of the soul psyche but wundt working under the eye of bismarck the greatest of german military fascists at the height of german war ambitions had to deny man had soul so there went the whole subject men were thereafter animals it is all right to kill animals and man had soul so the word psychology could longer be defined the

read with method i out of the way method 2 becomes more rapid method 3 will then be done by the person himself because he now knows better 2 and 3 can be used on and on one or the other if you do it backwards beginning with method 3 much more time is consumed if method 2 is used without i being done much more work has to be done to clean up an existing piece of study material or text so the correct sequence is 1 2 and then 3 this does not mean you cannot start with 3 or 2 it just means it is much faster to do them in correct sequence purpose clearing when purpose of the post is to be cleared it is done after method 1 in general and method 2 has been done on the duties and texts of the post with all such material handled with word clearing it is time then to do purpose clearing of the persons job or situation in life program thus general program could be laid down as 1 handle all arc breaks present time problems and withholds or set up the case with progress program 2 method 1 word clearing 3 method 2 word clearing on the materials or duties the person has 4 purpose clearing of the purpose of the post 429in choosing the materials to be cleared in 3 above choose the texts handbooks or materials most closely related to the post and most basic to the post in choosing the post if the person is not employed remember that student housewife and even human being are posts wd clearing wd clearers when there is qualified word clearer to word clear others the program is changed for the word clearer to 1 choose 2 word clearers who then work on each other 2 any progress program for each one 3 word clear the word clearing series by method 2 4 check out on the auditing required for method 1 5 do method 1 on each other 6 do purpose clearing on each other this greatly reduces any errors in application note progress program or repair program is scientology auditing program to clean up upsets in life arc break means aaffinity rreality ccommunication break in any one of the three which has caused upset in the past class iii academy auditor qualification is required to do method i as the action requires assessing and the handling of arc breaks problems and withholds for which class iii is trained anyone who is able to handle meter is qualified to do method 2 any person can do method 3 purpose clearing also requires class iii academy auditor by meter throughout this series is meant an emeter which means an electropsychometer an instrument which measures emotional reaction by tiny electrical impulses generated by thought l ron hubbard founder

4 september 1971r same title word clearing series 22r how to use dictionary you use dictionary when word clearing the misunderstood word is looked up in the dictionary and the meaning read out loud and they tell you what the word means so that they know it without again referring to the dictionary then the word is used in several sentences which clearly indicate that it consults their understanding words sometimes have different or more than one meaning you have to know every different meaning so all definitions are looked up and the word is fully defined you also must choose the definition in use in the sentence so that the materials are understood the alphabet knowledge of the alphabet is the key to finding words quickly the alphabet must be known cold the word clearer who has to figure out which letter comes first m or n or u or v wastes many precious minutes which add up to many wasted hours words are arranged in alphabetical order in all dictionaries all words beginning with the letter would be in the first section all words beginning with the letter b in the second section and so on within these sections the words themselves are arranged so that each second letter in the word is in alphabetical order for example the word fall precedes the word few which precedes the word field etc near the top of each page printed in bold type are the first word and the last word on the page in very large dictionaries its every two columns you can use this as guide to quickly find the page that contains the word you are looking for how to break up word many words are in combined form and by separating the word you can look up each part in the dictionary by doing this the meaning of the word often becomes clearer take the word theology the first part theo means god or gods and the second part of the word logy means discourse or expression or the science theory or study of when you put the two parts together you have the science theory or study of god sometimes in combining forms of words letter is changed as in the word in dividueate look up words in the definition many times when looking up word you will find in its definition other words which need to be looked up in order to understand the meaning of the original word therefore each word given in the definition must also be clearly defined and understood so that there are underlying misunderstood words on the word you are looking up large childs dictionaries are good as the definition words are simple the socalled merriam webster dictionaries in the us are almost useless and give out more misunderstoods in definitions than they clarify in clearing dont bother with 431them the world book dictionary available from field enterprises educational corporation merchandise mart plaza chicago illinois 60654 usa is huge and very good childs dictionary in the uk the 18 volume oxford series are good use big enough dictionary the smaller dictionaries paperback or junior seldom contain complete definitions of word sometimes most vital part of definition is omitted this can involve running around to look for another dictionary or missing the real meaning of the word so always use big enough dictionary get the word used in sentences as long as it has ta the word when it reads on the meter is used over and over in sentences until it has more ta it doesnt matter if the word was looked up in the dictionary as the word will still read if the word is misunderstood the dictionary usually has several examples of use these are not enough the person has to make up several of his own before he really knows the word words of special tech require dictionary of it if possible many students have been or are engaged in technical professions outside of scientology such as engineering computer programming architecture etc and you will need glossary or dictionary of the terms involved in these technologies when word clearing someone on his post hat aboard the flagship or stationship you would need nautical dictionary back track wordsget the earlier misunderstood word very often you will get word off the track and you wont find it in any dictionary or glossary on this planet you must get the earlier misunderstood word until you get the basic word that was misunderstood foreign wordsget dictionary of that language there are two kinds of foreign language dictionaries one is dictionary entirely in the foreign language the other is the englishforeign language dictionary in which one half of the dictionary is english words with the foreign word next to it and the other half is the foreign word with its english counterpart next to it you would use the all foreign dictionary only with person who knew that language fluently you use dictionary it is always

remimeo word clearing series 23 trouble shooting in word clearing the troubles are actually very few however there are few it is possible for an auditor or student doing word clearing on another to get misunderstood words himself unless he also looks at the definitions and understands them at the same time he is clearing them on the other person this requires extra step in fact it would be rather hard not to also see the definition of the word person trying to blow leave and refusing further word clearing almost always has huge misunderstood on some word not yet located the correct action is to get him back and find and clear the word not getting good result using methods 1 2 or 3 is cured by using the word clearing correction list hco b 21 july 71 revised 9 august 71 this correction list applies to all methods of word clearing for instance if method 2 goes sour and the student knew all the words anyway or doesnt understand it any better or is critical or demonstrates any other unfavorable reactions which do not win through there is always word clearing correction list this list is done by class iii or above auditor it is quite miraculous example student badly bogged after method 2 by his twin handling class iii auditor does the word clearing correction list on him the correction list is handled as per hco b 14 mar 71 fn everything in other words one takes all reads on it to floating needle any other list called for by reads on the correction list is taken to fn and when that calledfor list fns then one considers that the word clearing correction list line has fned correction list reads on 4 list error the auditor takes list called l4b which corrects lists and makes every read on l4b fn then 4 list error is marked fn the technology of handling word clearing correction list is all covered in the general materials of auditing not knowing how to use meter can cause trouble special course in using an emeter is available the emeter drill book gives all the drills it does not take long to learn also emeters are abundantly available today learning to be class iii or preferably class iv academy auditor is not difficult if one uses word clearing all word clearing is done under the discipline of the auditors code ones trs tr training drills for auditing can be straightened out on tr course on which one learns to confront to speak so one can be heard to acknowledge to be able to repeat commands and to handle originations by the student 433troubles in word clearing then can be listed as coming from lack of training so anyone doing word clearing should organize himself to i do tr course 2 learn to use and acquire an emeter 3 learn the auditors code and 4 if not one already learn to be an academy class iii auditor knowing how to do 1 to 3 above is essential to do method 2 word clearing and the skills under 1 to 3 are very easy to acquire further it is not all that difficult to become class iii auditor people sometimes think only someone who wants to be professional auditor studies in the academy false impression one cant imagine how father or businessman or mother or clerk or official could succeed without knowing the basics of human reaction and how to handle them someone who is class iii or class iv knows how the real professional usually becomes class vi and the real experts are the viiis ixs and xs its matter of how expert you want to be flag ship class xii could turn severe mental case from raving lunacy to not only sane but bright and normal in about 8 or 9 hours and normal person to genius in 15 to 20 hours but here we are dealing with the whole range of the human mind in word clearing method 2 one certainly should know his trs his auditors code and his meter and for method i it takes class iii academy auditor almost all troubles will be found to stem from an omission of these requirements and not using word clearing on the materials one is studying to achieve these skills very few troubles actually will be encountered if this hco b is followed word clearing is precision technology and there is something to know about it as it has never before been known l ron hubbard founder lrhntrd copyright

department 14 under the librarian the greatest demand will be for dictionaries of many kinds first there is the consideration of just english dictionaries several including large ones should be to hand those that use big words to define words keep pc chasing around and around and are of course poor dictionaries often one dictionary gives better definition than another so an assortment of english dictionaries is first requirement then come technical dictionaries or texts like engineering physics medical chemistry mechanics seamanship aviation astronomy military etc etc then come philosophical psychiatric and religious dictionaries if they can be found foreign language dictionaries latin greek french etc are must an auditor doing word clearing can come up with some remarkable demands texts or dictionaries covering the subject given on the assessment list word clearing series 8rr are basic starter i can see word clearing auditor poking about in old mouldy bookshops and coming up with triumphah look priceless slang dictionary on oil fields published in 1932 priceless if you get too stopped and are in major city you could end the session and send the pc to the local

word clearing series 25r tape course series 6r tapes how to use reissued 23 november 1971 verbatim additionally as tape course series hco b foreword the most appalling ignorance has existed on the use of magnetic recording tapes it is therefore of the greatest possible importance that the subject of tape use be grasped and gotten rapidly into effect probably half the technology of admin and tech exists only on tape tapes incorrectly used can be the source of endless misunderstoods because tapes have been almost uniformly misused in the past these misunderstoods have added up to general misunderstood on the subject of tapes themselves students have been known to copy down the whole tape so they could study it this is complete waste of time and misuse of student study hours some orgs even played advanced study tapes to the public european orgs have even played translation quality tapes usually not auditorium quality of oec volumes as raw public lectures and lost their audience through lack of quality and inaudible and strange words casual staff briefing tapes not okay for release of very bad quality have been played to staffs of other orgs and the public there is end to the abuses therefore for the benefit of understanding words alone it is vital that tapes be properly used and not abused types of tapes there are four classes of tapes these are 1 course study tapes 2 public lecture tapes 3 briefing tapes 4 model performance tapes 436course study tapes tapes made for courses are of two varieties english usually by lrh b translations done by translators they are for course use this is what the org sellstraining on tech or admin these tapes appear on checksheets and are done at the points of checksheets where they are called for and are done by method 2 for tapes or method 3 for tapes as required the foreign language tape courses are done from special tape checksheet and are done exactly as laid down by method 2 or method 3 none of these tapes are all written out by the student and then studied this is waste of time further such tapes are not played straight through with the student making notes of any misunderstood words to look up later this will blank out the tape content on the students mind and knock out the student so to play course tape straight through to any student is to cause stupidity and blow it also does not matter whether the student takes notes of misunderstoods or not course tape is not played straight through only the earphone footpedal startstop control procedures are used course tape is never played to group of students when played to more than one student some student is going to get misunderstood and there goes blank student two students dont even listen to tape even on method 2 tape word clearing one has the meter and footpedal and the other the earphones the word clearer stops at each read he does not otherwise listen course tape quality must be good all the words must be hearable and not inaudible they must not be slurred or hard to make out the earphones and tape player used must be high fidelity just any old earphones wont do the tape player playing head across which the tape passes must be cleandone by cotton swab on toothpick and cleaning fluid the tape coating comes off on the playing head and after time the sound is badly blurred using course tape any other way is now forbidden tests have shown that violations of this are the reason for student failures and blows and outethics it goes without saying that the general handling of tape players and tapes must be well learned and practiced by course supervisors and students public lecture tapes the probable reason stats fall after tape congresses is the misunderstood word congresses seldom use really high fidelity equipment further tape copying is often done by outside firms and the tape copies themselves may be of poor quality the combination is deadly 437we looked for the reason for stat drops after tape congresses and this is the only explanation which has come forth doingness congresses that are mainly seminars have been very successful by doingness is meant trstraining drillsand other actions the relay of data to public whose vocabulary is usually inadequate is not likely to win as it hits their faulty vocabulary for one thing and uses new words for another you can show somebody how to do things far better than you can tell him this then extends into div 6 introductory actions as well the relay of data comes after the demonstration in action terms the possibility of possible bad playing speakers possible low tape copy quality the barriers of languages not learned in the first place and the introduction of new mental concepts combine into hurdle that makes tape or film public presentation adventurous listening to public type tapes by using footpedal startstop tape players is being put in special public course category raw public tape and film presentations are however must to keep the flavor and meaning of dianetics and scientology so ensure excellent quality tapes and equipment are used with correct tapes for that public and you will have success briefing tapes these are not to be confused with special briefing course tapes briefing tape is done to brief or debrief missionaires or to record conference or to record special instructions to person or group it can then be used for reference or to settle any dispute it can also be used to inform staff or several staffs briefing tape is then tape designed for special and informed audience if the tape quality is good and the audience is already familiar or trained audience briefing tape can be played only to the audience for which it was intended to do otherwise is to risk misunderstood words and noncomprehension of what it is all about in general rons journals were staff briefing tapes they began to be used for public while they were not without success one could longer brief staffs on this line and the line was therefore cut one could not make them with security that they would be played to staffs an isolated briefing to single executive on these are our future hopes has been thereafter used as staff briefing of many orgs as these are your orders any tape is designed for specific public briefing tapes are especially subject to abuse by being played to wrong publics any briefing tape which contains specific orders and plans which could be misunderstood should be played only to the individuals concerned with stopstart footpedal and method 3 word clearing not going past any misunderstood after person has been briefed verbally it is very revelatory to then word clear 2 the tape made at the same time it will often be found that misunderstood words lead to potential alteris in the actions required 438tape in this instance is an enormous help in assisting and clarifying briefings group can be briefed if thereafter each is word cleared method 3 or 2 on the tape afterwards using standard tape word clearing needless to say such tapes must be of good quality model performance tapes tapes exist which give standard of performance in dianetic and scientology auditing student auditors have never been known to achieve high standard of session presence and communication and accordingly high results without the careful study of tapes made of similar sessions by high level auditors student musician is unlikely to achieve professional performance level unless he has heard professional play it would take film or live demonstration to communicate high standard of performance in purely action subject for instance for centuries one believed that robin hood could split his first target arrow with second until new generation worked on it and few painfully recovered the lost art of archery and then demonstrated how it was done for others to see tapes and films serve vital purpose in maintaining performance standard as these tapes and films show how it is done and the atmosphere and rhythm of action they are not subject to word clearing conclusion tape and film training is vital valuable and has its role but like showing child how to open book and read there is exact technology in using tapes and films the first thing one must realize is that the use of tape and film is itself technical subject that must be studied and learned one does not naturally know it the failures of universities to make educated and civilized men is because their own professors know nothing of misunderstood words and so lectured happily on and on to snoring student body one professor of physics used to open the classroom windows wide in freezing winter to keep his students from going to sleep in his class and then stood on the platform and defined nothing as he rambled on all it did for his class was give them coughs between snores the handling and use of tape and film in training and administration is subject by failing to know it and use that information one can block the road for himself and all others to being learned and being free l ron hubbard founder lrhnt jh copyright 1971 1974 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 439b r d t c h n i c l b u l l t i n 26 november 1971 ra

experience shows that doing wc2 without wc1 restimulates earlier charge on words that have been misunderstood in the past when person has not had word clear method 1 and tries to do word clear method 2 on materials it can go very slowly the student due to earlier charge on words can become quite misemotional using method 3 going back to find the misunderstood word is all right and using common ordinary look up dont go past misunderstood word is all right method 2 ep the end phenomena what occurs at the end of word clearing method 2 is continuing fn on the materials when the person is constantly fning on the materials being word cleared method 2 that is the time to end off the ep has been reached when the word clearer forces the student to go on beyond this the reads gotten are often false or are from protest reads that are false come from cognitions realizations on the material protest reads come from just plain annoyance with having to go on when the ep of 2 is reached on specific set of materials the student is then permitted to go on by himself looking up words he doesnt know or going back to find one that was missed person who enters new subject or new branch of subject should be given wc2 on it person who begins higher level of subject should be given wc2 on it if thereafter there is any bog or failure to understand or apply or pass an exam on the subject wc correction list can be done on it and the bog found and handled this ep is only valid if the person has had wc method 1 before the wc method 2 was begun the ep of method 2 can be many times repeated

below fn level the fn went off long before the student reached the point of dope off so waiting for dopeoff to occur before handling is waiting too long as soon as your study stats dropped for half day or you arent quite so bright as you were few minutes ago is the time to look for the misunderstood word its not misunderstood phrase or idea or concept but misunderstood word this always occurs before the subject itself is not understood this is method 3 word clearing 1 the student notices he is not flying along and is not bright or it could be just plain lack of enthusiasm or too long on one item on the checksheet or yawning or disinterest or doodling or daydreaming etc 2 he then looks earlier in the text for misunderstood word there is one always there are exceptions it may be that the misunderstood word is two pages or more back but it is always earlier in the text from where he is now 3 the word is found he recognizes it in looking back for it if the student cant find the misunderstood by looking back for it he can get another student to spot check him the other student takes words from the text that could be misunderstood and asks what is the definition of the word seeing if the student gives correct definition 4484 the student looks up the word found in dictionary thoroughly clears each definition and uses it verbally several times in sentences of his own composition until he has obviously demonstrated that he understands the word by the composition of his sentencesand feels fine about it 5 then the student reads the text that contained the misunderstood word if he isnt now bright eager to get on with it back up tone etc then there is another misunderstood word earlier in the text this is found by repeating steps 25 6 when he is bright up tone etc an fning student the student comes forward from where the misunderstood word was in the text to the area of the subject he did not understand where step 1 began he will now be enthusiastic with his study of the subject unless misunderstood word was missed not fully cleared or theres an earlier one in the text if so do steps 25 if the student is now enthusiastic he continues on with studying students do not have to be word cleared method 2 on the total of any course method 3 word clearing can be used by students on each other or by supervisor or word clearer whenever necessary

pack is complete as the data might have been omitted also he might never have read the pack at all 450if the data was missing do not go on to step 3 see that he gets the complete pack and reads it then repeat method 4 if the person just has not read the materials do not go on to 3 but get him to read the materials then repeat method 4 3 get what it is then ask what word was misunderstood just before that meter reads word clearer finds the word never accepting confusion but finds the word giving the read sf f lf bd gets it looked up in dictionary and used in sentences until it can be seen from the sentences that the student now understands the word and the word fns all the tools of study tech and word clearing are at the word clearers disposal to take the word to fn the word clearer does not stop at one misunderstood but makes sure all are cleared 4 repeat 2 3 until the materials are fully cleared up and any and all misunderstoods or confusions handled 5 if the action bogs when used in the classroom the student must be sent to qual for handling and supervisor to cramming on trs and metering and drilling on this procedure the correct action is wc correction list done on the student and handled of course if the above question fns on asking there would be misunderstoods on the material being checked but the person is in cramming not an fning student or whatever so there obviously are misunderstood words to be found and handled look at hco pl 16 feb 72 the purpose of the dept of personnel enhancement it says this dept reaches and looks for business all over the org

of the dept of personnel enhancement hco pl 16 feb 72 one of the ways the word clearers in this dept do the job is using method 4 word clearing method 4 is used by course supervisors to handle all student queries about contents of course materials the reason students ask questions about what is meant is because of omitted pack materials from their checksheet failure to read what they have or because of misunderstood word just before they got confused the super has to know only where the materials are and be smart enough to do method 4 instead of giving the student alterised answers that

of language construction and are more complex than they at first appear word clearing auditor should have simple grammar book to hand as well as dictionaries the best grammar textbooks are those compiled for persons foreign to language like immigrants these do not contain the supposition that the student is already an english professor lots of examples is the real test of good grammar when doing the study tapes or student hat lack of simple grammar textbook can really throw the student off those simple words can be the huge rocks that stand on the highway to becoming word clear so grammar is needed if student is very deficient lacking in grammar it is best to make him do whole simple grammar text first before he begins to get into just words the words wont hang together for him it takes less time to do short textbook in grammar than it does to struggle with grammar all the way through grammar can look like ghastly subject until one really looks at it then its easy l ron

like cat an animal animal cat they do not give enough meaning to escape the circle the meanings given are often inadequate to get real concept of the word the words are too few and even common words are often missing huge dictionaries can also be confusing as the words they use to define are often too big or too rare and make one chase through 20 new words to get the meaning of the original the best dictionaries are the very large childs dictionaries like the world book dictionary thorndikebarnhart dictionary published exclusively for field enterprises educational corporation merchandise mart plaza chicago illinois 60654 or doubleday and company thorndikebarnhart has whole series of dictionaries of which this is special one field enterprises has offices in chicago london rome sydney toronto the world book dictionary is in two volumes each 28l2 cm 11 14 inches by 22 cm 8 58 inches by 58 cm 214 inches so it is small dictionary also it defines dianetics correctly and isnt determined

each it is called material clearing those the person cannot define must be looked up this method may be done without meter it can also be done with meter the reason the method is needed is because the person often does not know that he does not know therefore method 4 has its limitations as the meter does not always read the actions are very precise the word clearer asks what is the definition of _____ the person gives it if there is any doubt whatever of it or if the person is the least bit hesitant the word is looked up in proper dictionary this method is the method used to clear words or

method 6 is used without meter where person is new on post or new to subject or where there has just been goof an error or an ethics action these steps are done in the following manner 1 the word clearer makes list of the key or most important words relating to the persons duties or post or the new subject this is made up as list the word clearer looks up each word in the dictionary and writes down the definitions the list may have as few as three words or as many as twenty or thirty example bank clerks key words would be bank clerk money cash drafts teller accounts customer etc example there has just been goof resulting in an upset the goof centered around radio repairs operation operator electronics etc 2 the word clearer without showing the person the definitions asks him to define each word 3 the word clearer checks the definition on his list for general correctness not word for word but meaning 4 any slow or hesitancy or misdefinition is met with having the person look the word up and look up any word in the definition the person does not have grasp of 5 one completes his list 6 by then the person has been jarred into looking further by the above actions the word clearer asks what other word relating to your post or subject or error didnt you understand 7 each one mentioned is now defined by looking it up 8 the person can now be method 4ed relating to his post to be sure all is clean and there are upsets note where the person has just had an accident or ethics action it may be necessary to delay the action until the person is calmer or not so upset as the action can be heavy distraction if the person is hurt or frightened and will not be successful it will be found that laziness inactivity slowness and errors on post or in using subject trace to misunderstood key words the remedy is wc method 6 lrhntrd l ron hubbard copyright 1972 founder by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 462hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead

in this method the person is made to read aloud to find out what he is doing it is very simple method it is done without meter it is used on such persons before other methods in order to get the person untangled if person does not seem to be progressing by studying silently one has him read aloud another copy of the same text must also be followed by the word clearer as the person reads startling things can be observed the person may omit the word is whenever it occurs the person doesnt read it he may have some strange meaning for it like israel actual occurrence he may omit didnt each time it occurs and the reason traced to not knowing what the apostrophe is actual occurrence he may call one word quite another word such as stop for happen or green for mean he may hesitate over certain words the procedure is 1 have him read aloud 2 note each omission or word change or hesitation or frown as he reads and take it up at once 3 correct it by looking it up for him or explaining it to him 4 have him go on reading noting the next omission word change or hesitation or frown 5 repeat steps 2 to 4 by doing this person can be brought up to literacy his next actions would be learning how to use dictionary and look up words then simple grammar very backward student can be boosted up to literacy by this method lrh ntrd l ron hubbard copyright 1972 founder by l ron hubbard

this method he should do method 7 first method one should also be done method 8 is an action used in the primary rundown where one is studying study tech or where one is seeking full grasp of subject its end product is superliteracy the steps are these usually an alphabetical list of every word or term in the text of paper chapter or recorded tape is available or provided 1 the person looks up each word on the alphabetical list and uses each in sentences until he has the meaning conceptually the words are looked up in big dictionary the grammatical words or small words are looked up in simple grammar if the person has too much trouble with grammar he should do the whole simple grammar text before going on any technical terms not in the dictionary are looked up in technical dictionary or glossary or in bulletins on the materials ie photographic dictionary this is not done for the whole subject it is done for paper or chapter or one tape of series 2 one then reads or listens to the paper chapter or tape for its sense or general meaning 3 method 4 is then done on the person to find any misunderstoods 4 these are cleared up per method 4 procedure 5 the person reads or listens to the material again 6 the person is again checked for any misunderstoods 7 if there are any misunderstoods the person again does steps 4 5 8 when the material is fully heard or understood as per above steps and checks end off on that paper chapter tape and go on to the next one 9 an alphabetical list is made or exists for the next paper chapter or tape steps 1 to 8 are done on it 10 each succeeding paper or chapter or tape is done with steps i to 8 464when all the material has been done in this way the person will be fully able to apply all the material usually method 8 is reserved for the scientology study tapes which contain how to study and the student hat it can also be used to master major subject it will be found that method 8 or method 2 or 3 or 4 or 6 are very lengthy and hard to do unless one has first had method one word clearing word clearing correction list is used on method 8 whenever student bogs heavily this list will when assessed on meter properly locate the errors and they can be corrected when used on the study tech itself and student hat method 8 honestly done makes person superliterate it is like hearing and seeing and reading for the first time reading text or instruction or book is comfortable one has it in conceptual form one can apply the material learned it is new state l ron hubbard founder lrhntrd copyright 1972 by l ron hubbard

restimulate person badly example is there anything in college you didnt understand that of course is just plain ridiculous as question have you ever heard anything you didnt understand would be similarly silly break down the materials when doing method 4 you have to break down the materials put them into small separate units in order to ask questions example we have papers 1 2 both on the same subject the wrong question for method 4 would be is there anything in papers 1 2 you didnt understand and not even give him the papers to see the right way to do it would be to take paper i and break it down into its obvious sections give the person paper 1 and let him look at it point to its 1st section and say is there anything you didnt understand in this section while watching the meter then point to next section do the same finish paper 1 then go to paper 2 and do it the same person has to know what hes being asked about and has to be thinking of it when asked the question tapes just as it would be ridiculous to ask have you ever misunderstood anything you ever read it would be silly to ask did you ever have misunderstood on tape the right way is to take the tape and put it on machine and play bit of it and ask is there anything in the first section of this tape you didnt understand while watching the meter then high speed the tape forward to another area and do the same thus the tape is covered this can also be done from any tape notes section by section books books are done chapter by chapter 466quickie m4 method 4 is defeated utterly by 1 bad metering 2 too general question 3 not having the material to hand 4 not getting the persons attention on parts of the material 5 not taking each word found to fm quickie m4 misses it sets the person up for loss in his

usages of words and phrases which could be important as dianetics and scientology are written in american english it was sent to by an shsbc student who found its definition of grammar was very helpful to other students this definition also tells you why some college or school texts are so ghastly hard to readthey are not in standard english it also tells you why in 1950 the head of the english department in an american university hailed dianetics the modern science of mental health as marking new era of scientific writing one reason is that it was written by writer not professor the other was that it was written in the english that was in use but read the definition grammar grammar is systematic description of the ways in which words are used in particular language the grammarian groups words that behave similarly into classes and then draws up rules stating how each class of words behaves what classes are set up and how the rules are phrased is matter of convenience grammarian is free to classify his material in any way that seems reasonable to him but he is never free to say that certain forms of speech are unacceptable merely because there is place for them in the system he has designed the classes most grammarians are interested in number of languages as rule they set up classes that are useful in handling many languages but that may have very little meaning for particular language for example the distinction between the dative him and the accusative him is important in the indoeuropean languages generally but in grammar designed solely to teach english this distinction does not have to be made similarly there is an etymological or historical difference between the english gerund in ing and the participle in ing but it is sometimes impossible to say whether given word is gerund or participle for example in journeys end in lovers meeting for this reason some grammarians prefer to handle these forms together under one name such as participle or ing the familiar terms of classical grammar are defined in this dictionary for the convenience of persons who need to use these concepts but much simpler classification based on the structure of presentday english is employed in all the discussions of usage the rules 468in order to say how words are used the grammarian must examine large quantities of spoken and written english he will find some constructions used so consistently that the exceptions have to be classed as errors but he will also find competing and even contradictory constructions which appear too often to be called mistakes he must then see whether one of these expressions is used by one kind of person and not by another or in one kind of situation and not in another if he can find difference of this sort he accepts the two constructions as interchangeable in this way he assembles body of information on how english words are used that may also show differences such as those between one locality and another or between spoken and written english or between literary and illiterate speech studies of this kind are called scientific or descriptive grammars this is relatively new approach to the problems of language and the information brought to light in this way is sometimes surprising the first english grammarians writing in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries did not attempt to describe the english of their day on the contrary they were attempting to improve english and they demanded latin constructions which were not characteristic of english they objected to the expression i am mistaken because if translated into latin this would mean i am misunderstood they claimed that unloose must mean tie because is latin negative they objected to the double negative which was good old english and also good greek but not good latin these eighteenth century rules of prescriptive grammar have been repeated in school books for two hundred years they are the rules for curious latinized english that has never been spoken and is seldom used in literature but that is now highly respected in some places principally in scientific writing it should be recognized that these rules were not designed to preserve english or keep it pure they were designed to create language which would be better simply because it was more like latin dryden writing in the seventeenth century said i am often put to stand in considering whether what i write be the idiom of the tongue or false grammar and nonsense couched beneath that specious name of anglicism and have other way to clear my doubts but by translating my english into latin and thereby trying what sense the words will bear in more stable language one result of this double translation was that dryden went through his earlier works and rewrote all the sentences that had originally ended in preposition or adverb generation later swift complained that the english of his day offends against every part of grammar certainly this is blaming the foot because it doesnt fit the shoe because some people would like to write the language of the textbooks the entries in this dictionary not only tell what standing given construction has in current english but also explain how the rules of the prescriptive grammarian would apply wherever the rules and standard practice differ but in such cases the rules are never simple and the person who has to use this type of english may feel that it would be easier to follow drydens example and write in latin first this book the grammar entries in this book are designed for persons who speak standard english but who may be confused about certain isolated points the entries are arranged so that the answer to particular problem can be found in the least possible time but anyone who wishes to make systematic study of english grammar using this book can do so by starting with the entry parts of speech and following the references to more and more detailed discussions of each concept l

clearing series 44 illiteracy and work i have been engaged in study of applications of tech to illiteracy and illiterate or semiliterate populations and found some simple levels of approach i investigated us aid educational efforts and data to find out why they failed for instance in one project the us spent over one million dollars to educate 105 persons from an underdeveloped country of low literacy and surveyed it later to find that none of the data taught was in use and that progress had been made by the person or the country as result using their data and my own personal investigation in the same country i evaluated the situation and found they had not consulted the existing scene before or during the program their training was for sophisticated environment the country of the program is just emerging from nomadic level civilization into agricultural and the agriculture done is extremely primitive erodes whole plains with noncontour plowing and doesnt even know about irrigation to these people they taught the highly complex technology of the electronic age the people went back home found computers whatever listened to the goats and sat down and did nothing us aid had explanation for this but give them creditthe students liked the us and us aid did honestly survey and admit the failure rare humility from this point i did local study and found that instead of computers these people neededguess what tr 2 acknowledgement training drill 2 how to acknowledge communication this primitive area had never heard of tr 2 good fine thank you were unknown in all their work culture before they saw any need of any technology they had first to see that there was any reason to get any work done at all further their cultural pattern contained dishonesty as virtue this is antipathetic to basic morale matter what the culture and so they were in cultural attitude or pattern which kept them sad depressed and miserable so they couldnt work the program then had to recover honesty to increase morale b introduce acknowledgement for accomplishment c establish the possibility that one could work d introduce statistics so that something existed that could be acknowledged and establish bonuses for statistics so that acknowledgement could be real and stay that way these items are all very elementary and simple portions of our basic technology 470a security checking b trs especially 2 c problems of work course using tape and word clearing d statistical policies and tech bonus policies so in us aid programs there was skipped gradient in culture nomad agrarian skipped to electronicnuclear and skipped gradient in trainingwhy learn when there is reason to work so why be literate or study any sophisticated technical layout would break down in the hands of these peopleand does but this program would lift them up then they would have some reason to study factually one cannot just sail into culture blind and bash around with data it is costly and it accomplishes very little basic knowledge of man is essential to any improvement in any area of the human race l ron hubbard founder lrhntrd copyright 1972 by l ron hubbard all rights

post actions if the above actions do not handle though carefully done the person has out ethics and needs ethics handling and probably integrity processing this does not eradicate the need for executive inspections evaluations and handlings for non working installations but when the why is found and stops removed simply taking each staff member in the area and putting him through the 1 2

compared to method 7 which is educational word clearing and has its own exact procedure method 9 is done on any specific written text usually by subject for example the cs series the data series or one or more pls or hco bs on related subject for example listing and nulling rudiments or key hat pl or pls the procedure is 1 student or staff member reads the text out loud he is not on the meter 2 the word clearer has copy of the text and reads along with the student silently 3 if the student leaves out word or stumbles or exhibits any physical or verbal manifestation while reading the text the word clearer immediately asks for the misunderstood word or term and gets the meanings cleared with dictionary and put into sentences until the word is understood and vgis are present 4 student rereads the last section and continues the text to completion picking up and handling all misunderstood words as evidenced by verbal or physical manifestations 5 student or staff member is sent to pc examiner for fn vgis check if fn vgis student or staff member returns to word clearer to complete to fn vgis or wccl if required 6 the text is now restudied by the student or staff member method 9 can be used before or after the fact of flub for example any upper level cs to get an ok to cs should m9 the cs series restudy and starrate and do in clay as basic action in qual or an auditor who is flubbing on assessment gets m9 on the assessment pack or supervisor who is flubby gets m9 on key mcsc materials in each case the materials word cleared must be restudied and starrated word clearers must be specifically and extensively drilled to do m9 or m7 so that they can read text and pick up any and all physical manifestations at the same time only then is an ok to do m9 or m7 issued 473the fact of having had material word cleared using different method does not prevent m9 being used in fact it would not be unusual for specific material to be handled first with m6 then m9 then m4 if one

difficulties with word clearing the first and major reason for difficulties in word clearing is failure to immediately use word clearing correction list at the first hint of trouble the second is word clearing over the fact of method one word clearing can become lengthy until method one is completed some people have severe difficulty with all forms of word clearing until full and complete m1 with additional applicable subjects added and fully handled the symptom of person requiring m1 or m1 expanded would be approaching all forms of word clearing on subject basis and handling chains on each word approached this makes these shorter forms of word clearing very lengthy this can happen on the prd causing bogged or very slow student he can be cleaned up with wccl in qual followed by completed method one if this doesnt handle it the student needs additional correction or the primary correction rundown everyone runs better on all forms of word clearing when method one is fully completed others may require full primary correction rundown before they can easily tackle day to day word clearing as is required in any org in some rare cases there may be misunderstood symbol in the alphabet itself m7 as the major undercut word clearing process may require an undercut by direct address to the alphabet this can easily be done by getting the person to rattle off the alphabet and handling it itself with m7 handling all letters on which person has difficulty cant remember stumbles on etc until the person can rattle them all off without hesitation the full new world dictionary contains section at the beginning of each letter which may be of assistance in cleaning up the alphabet interrelated uses of word clearing all forms of word clearing can be utilized to get result the fact of using one form does not mean that another will not locate more misunderstoods for example staff member could have m7 word clearing to improve his reading to an ep then have m6 on the key words of his post then m7 the one or two key pls of his post then study them and have final m4 check before starrating dont drop out m2 as one of the effective forms of word clearing it has specialized use on whole texts of materials or tapes the clearing of first or earlier materials plays key factor in unlocking some pt study problems or situations 475person will actually do better on m2 if he has done m7 on general text first in some cases when the persons vocabulary is very poor m7 has to be done before m1 use all forms of word clearing in volume and everybody will win ens judy ziff cs5 as ordered

on word clearing is required the first requirement is method one in the persons basic language if the person speaks several languages or lived in several countries the languages would be handled in the sequence they were encountered to do method one in english on french person without first doing m1 in french is more or less waste of time the person wont make it in english until the earlier misunderstoods connected with the earlier language are fully handled when word clearing person who speaks foreign language it is imperative to have proper dictionary in that language to hand do not use the englishfrench or englishgerman dictionary for it is not dictionary but reference manual only and does not contain full and proper definitions the most charged languages will be that first learned and that used in school obviously it is best for foreign language person to be audited on m1 by an auditor who speaks the same language however if one was not available it could be done by writing up the m1 list phonetically in the language concerned and running standard m1 making sure that the pc keeps the auditor very well informed on the definitions in the dictionary foreign language students on courses are usually provided with translated tape courses in this case the full technology on handling tape courses and their repair must be fully applied m2 and 4 on tapes must be set up for immediate handling in tech and qual it could be also that foreign language student cannot read english because of unhandled problems on reading his own language and so would greatly benefit from an m7 on reading text in his own language if foreign language student is studying an english text he must have an english and the foreign language dictionary to hand so that if he runs into difficulty

errors way of quickying word clearing has sprung up from time to time whereby word being looked up in the dictionary is incompletely defined example the prd student who guesses at the context the word is used in and only looks up one of several definitions as superliterate this person is later found to have trouble with study and checkouts though certain she knew what the words meant example the m4 word clearer in qual says look at definition 5 the student does and gets it but later has trouble with the same word or hco b due to incompletely defined words example the pcrd student who looks up words until shes got the concept incompletely defines half the words on the pcrd and utterly defeats its purpose and hers procedure in clearing words the student looks up every definition using each meaning of the word in sentences until hes got it when all definitions have been cleared the context of the sentence the word was found in is consulted and the student chooses the definition that applies and ensures he understands it at this point the word has been cleared and not before prd this procedure applies especially to the prd where the context is unknown the prd can be made to fail

translations it is often necessary that more time be spent in word clearing translator than would normally be spent on student translator is the relay point between lrhs technology and the foreign student therefore it is doubly important that the translator look up everything he doesnt understand and that he gets the material totally straight in his head any misduplication on the part of the translator will result in mistranslations which will cause great confusion to the eventual student when word clearing translator it will normally be found that his basic misunderstood will be from the time he started to learn the language something is very funny about learning foreign languages it wont be the foreign language the person doesnt understand it will be the grammatical terms in their own language used to learn the foreign language you could spend days for example working with person who cant seem to learn french and then all of sudden find out it wasnt french word he was having trouble with at allit was subjunctive mode or something of that sort this works the same way for another language back into english word clearer could go on forever working with person having difficulty with english if he didnt know this one question 1 what word in your own language that described how you spoke english didnt you understand this question is asked off the meter the word clearer accepts whatever answer the translator gives 2 the word clearer has the translator look up the words found in 1 above in simple grammar book in his own language there may be one or two words or there may be many the word clearer gets them all thoroughly looked up and fully understood by the translator 3 if the translator cannot find an answer to the question yet is having difficulty the word clearer should realize that there are wordsunseenmisunderstood have the translator go through simple book in his own language that teaches english looking up every word he is the least bit unsure of have him do this until he is longer having difficulty 480the above steps can be done for any languages the translator may speak in addition to english if he is multilingual merely substitute the

circles pursued by korzybski and company see data series 1 the anatomy of thought never really led to the realization that word and its meanings are embodied in the basic concept or idea symbolized by that word that conceptualization of meanings is foreign to dictionary writers and experts is evidenced by the fact that definitions are so subject to alteris and change with the passage of time 485for example modern definitions of the word understand are found to be largely inadequate really full and meaningful definition of it could only be found in first edition of websters dictionary of synonyms 1942 understand to have clear and true idea or conception or full and exact knowledge of something in general it may be said that understand refers to the result of mental process or processes clear

1 art for some fifteen years i have been studying amongst other branches of philosophy the subject of art the reason for this is art is the least codified of human endeavors and the most misunderstood what is art is one of the least answered of human questions art abounds with authorities it was chosen because that field containing the most authorities contains the least codified knowledge the obvious invitation is to answer the question and codify the subject this has now been done the subject was originally brought up in conversation with donald h rogers at 42 aberdeen road elizabeth new jersey in 1950 as this zone of human activity seemed to stand outside the field of dianetics and scientology i thereafter worked with it on casual basis having published 15000000 words between 1929 and 1941 i was not unacquainted with the arts since 1950 i have worked with other arts than that of literature in order to make an advance on the general subject of art i have made breakthrough at last in this matter and i find it is applicable to what we are doing and therefore also has practical value to make it matter of record rather than filed sheaf of notes i am publishing these findings as an hco b i also feel they will be of some assistance in forwarding scientology as in the case of all pure research by which is meant study without thought of possible application there is sudden payoff in these answers including the better dissemination of scientology and the rehabilitation of the artist my incidental studies in the fields of photography and music materially assisted these discoveries approaching the state of clear has also assisted in comprehending this rather vast subject of art it is adventurous to state one has solved such sweeping subject but here at least are the fundamentals and basics the following are rough notes but are in fact the basis of that branch of activity we call art the fundamentals of art basic definition art is word which summarizes the quality of communication it therefore follows the laws of communication 489too much originality throws the audience into unfamiliarity and therefore disagreement as communication contains duplication and originality is the foe of duplication technique should not rise above the level of workability for the purpose of communication perfection cannot be attained at the expense of communication seeking perfection is wrong target in art one should primarily seek communication with it and then perfect it as far as reasonable one attempts communication within the framework of applicable skill if perfection greater than that which can be attained for communication is sought one will not communicate example camera that shoots perfectly but is not mobile enough to get pictures one must settle for the highest level of technical perfection obtainable below the ability to obtain the picture the order of importance in art is 1 the resultant communication 2 the technical rendition 2 is always subordinate to 1 2 may be as high as possible but never so high as to injure 1 the communication is the primary target the technical quality of it is the secondary consideration person pushes 2 as high as possible within the reality of 1 being can take lot of trouble with 2 to achieve 1 but there is point where attempting 2 prevents 1 if the ardures of 2 prevent 1 then modify 2 dont modify 1 perfection is defined as the quality obtainable which still permits the delivery of the communication too much time on 2 of course prevents 1 it is usually necessary to lower standard from absolute perfection to achieve communication the test of the artist is how little it is lowered not how high it is pushed professional in the arts is one who obtains communication with the art form at the minimum sacrifice of technical quality there is always some sacrifice of quality to communicate at all the reduction of mass or time or impedimenta or facilities toward the ability to render result is the exact measurement of how much technical perfection can be attempted the rule is if one is being too perfectionistic to actually achieve communication reduce the mass time impedimenta or facilities sufficiently low to accomplish the communication but maintain the technique and perfection as high as is reconcilable with the result to be achieved and within ones power to act communication is art to not do the communication for lack of technical perfection is the primary error it is also an error not to push up the technical aspects of the result as high as possible one measures the degree of perfection to be achieved by the degree of communication that will be accomplished 490this is seen even in workman and tools the workman who cannot accomplish anything but must have tools is an artistic failure art for arts sake is complete paradox as remark art for the sake of communication and attempted perfection without communicating are the plus and minus of it all one can of course communicate to oneself if one wishes to be both cause and effect one studies art only if one wishes to communicate and the search for artistic perfection is the result of past failures to communicate selfimprovement is based entirely on earlier lack of communicating living itself can be an art the search for freedom is either the retreat from past failures to communicate or the effort to attain new communication to that degree then the search for freedom is sick or well impulse searching for and discovering ones past failures to communicate an art form or idea about it will therefore inevitably rehabilitate the artist however due to the nature of the reactive mind full rehabilitation is achieved only through releasing and clearing how much art is enough art the amount necessary to produce an approximation of the desired effect on its receiver or beholder within the reality of the possibility of doing so concept of the beholder and some understanding of his or her acceptance level is necessary to the formulation of successful art form or presentation this includes an approximation of what is familiar to him and is associated with the desired effect all art depends for its success upon the former experience and associations of the beholder there is pure general form since it must assume sweeping generality of former experiences in the beholder artists all to greater or lesser degree need comprehension of the minds and viewpoints of others in order to have their work accepted since the acceptability of communication depends upon the mental composition of the receiver scientology then is must for any artist if he would succeed without heartbreak in any art form or activity one must conceive of the beholder if only himself to fail to do so is to invite disappointment and eventual dissatisfaction with ones own creations an artist who disagrees thoroughly with the taste of his potential audience cannot of course communicate with that audience easily his disagreement is actually not based on the audience but on former inabilities to communicate with such audiences or rejections by vaguely similar audience the lack of desire to communicate with an art form may stem from an entirely different inability than the one supposed to exist professionals often get into such disputes on how to present the art form that the entirety becomes technology not an art and lacking progress and newness of acceptance dies this is probably the genus of all decline or vanishment of art forms the idea of contemporary communication is lost all old forms become beset by technical musts and must nots and so cease to communicate the art is the form that 491communicates not the technology of how the last contributing to the ease of creating the effect and preservation of the steps used in doing it forms reach blunted becomes involved with the perfection alone and ceases to be an art form in its proper definition communication can be blunted by suppressing its art form example bad tape reproduction scratched film releasing bits not authorized this then is the primary suppression on the other hand failing continuously to permit nondestructive communication on the grounds of its lack of art is also suppressive between these two extremes there is communication and the task is to attain the highest art form possible that can be maintained in the act of communicating to do otherwise is inartistic and objectionable these therefore are the fundamentals of art l ron hubbard lrhml jh copyright 1965 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved

have to be this would include painting music photography poetry any of the arts whether fine or otherwise it would also include presenting oneself as an art form as well as ones products yes how good does such work of art have to be ah you say but that is an imponderable thing that cant be answered verily you say you have just asked question for which there are answers except the sneers and applause of critics indeed this is why we have art critics for who can tell how good good is who knows i have surprise for you there is an answer as you know i searched for many years as sort of minor counterpoint to what i was hardwork doing to dredge up some of the materials which might constitute the basis of art art was the most uncodified and most opinionated subject on the planet after mens ideas about women and womens ideas about men and mans ideas of man art was anyones guess masterpieces have gone unapplauded positive freaks have gained raves so how good does work of art have to be to be good the painter will point out all the tiny technical details known only to painters the musician will put score through the alto horn and explain about valve clicks and lip the poet will talk about meter types the actor will explain how the position and wave of one hand per the instructions of one school can transform clod into an actor and so it goes art by art bit by bit but all these people will be discussing the special intricacies and holy mysteries of technique the tiny things only the initiate of that art would recognize they are talking about technique they are not really answering how good work of art has to be works of art are viewed by people they are heard by people they are felt by people they are not just the fodder of closeknit group of initiates they are the soul food of all people one is at liberty of course to challenge that wide purpose of art some professors who dont want rivals tell their students art is for selfsatisfaction it is hobby in other words dont display or exhibit kid or youll be competition the world today is full of that figurefigure but as none of this selfsatisfaction art meets definition of art wider than self for the sake of self the professional is not interested in it in any artistic production what does one have as an audience people not heaven forbid critics but people not experts in that line of art but people that old chinese poet who after he wrote poem went down out of his traditional garret and read it to the flowerselling old lady on the corner had the right idea if she understood it and thought it was great he published if she didnt he put it in the bamboo trash can not remarkably his poems have come down the centuries awesomely praised 493well one could answer this now by just saying that art should communicate to people high and low but that really doesnt get the sweating professional anywhere as guide in actually putting together piece of work and it doesnt give him yardstick whereby he can say that is that ive done it and go out with confidence that he has what is technique what is its value where does it fit what is perfectionism where does one stop scraping off the paint and erasing notes and say that is that for there is point some artists dont ever find it the impressionists practically spun in as group trying to develop new way of viewing and communicating it they made itor some of them did like monet but many of them never knew where to stop and they didnt make it they couldnt answer the question how good does piece of art work have to be to be good in this time of century there are many communication lines for works of art because few works of art can be shown so easily to so many there may even be fewer artists the competition is very keen and even dagger sharp to be good one has to be very good but in what way and how well when i used to buy breakfasts for greenwich village artists which they ate hungrily only stopping between bites to deplore my commercialism and bastardizing my talents for the gold that bought their breakfasts i used to ask this question and needless to say i received an appalling variety of responses they avalanched with technique or lack of it they vaguely dwelt on inherent talent they rushed around to galleries to show picasso or to board fence covered with abstracts but none of them told how good song had to be to be song so i wondered about this and clue came when the late hubert mathieu dear friend stamped with youth on the left bank of the seine and painting dowagers at the beaux arts in middle age said to to do any of these modern abstract cubist things you have to first be able to paint and he enlarged the theme while i plied him in the midnight hush of manhattan with iced sherry and he finished up the first lady of nantuckets somewhat swollen ball gown matty could paint finally he dashed off an abstract to show how somebody who couldnt paint would do it and how it could be done i got his point to really make one of these too too modern things come off you first had to be able to paint so i said well hell theres gertrude stein and thomas mann and ink splatterers like those lets see if it really is an art form so i sharpened up my electric typewriter and dashed off the last chapters of novel in way far out acid prose and put the end at the bottom and shipped it off to an editor who promptly pushed several large loaves down the telephone wire and had to lunch and unlike his normal blase self said i really got big bang this was decades ago other years other slang out of the way that story wound up you really put it over the plate and it sent his circulation rating up and this was very odd because you see the first chapters were straight since theyd been written before matty got thirsty for sherry and called to come over and the last chapters were an impressionistic stream of consciousness that mann himself would have called an advanced rather adventurous overfinneganized departure from the ultra school so just to see how far this sort of thing could go for short while i shifted around amongst various prose periods just to see what was going on that they sold didnt prove too much because i never had any trouble with that but that they were understood at all was surprising to for their prose types ranging from shakespeare to beowulf were at wild variance with anything currently being published so i showed them to matty the next time he had ball gown to do or three chins to paint out and was thirsty and he looked them over and he said well you proved my point theres mystery to it basically youre trained writer it shows through 494and now we are getting somewhere not just with and my adventures and long dead yesterdays as time rolled on this is what i began to see the fellow technician in an art hears and sees the small technical points the artist himself is engrossed in the exact application of certain exact actions which produce when done his canvas his score his novel his performance the successful artist does these small things so well that he also then has attention and skill left to get out his message he is not still fiddling about with the cerulean blue and the semiquaver he has these zeroed in he can repeat them and repeat them as technical actions ulcers strictly routine and here we have three surrealist paintings and they each have their own message and the public wanders by and they only look with awe on one and why is this one different than the other two is it different message is it more popular thats too vague if you look at or listen to any work of art there is only one thing the casual audience responds to masse and if this has it then you too will see it as work of art if it doesnt have it you wont so what is it technical expertise itself adequate to produce an emotional impact and that is how good work of art has to be to be good if you look this over from various sides you will see that the general spectator is generally unaware of technique that is the zone of arts creators were you to watch crowd watching magician you would find one common denominator eliciting uniform response if he is good magician he is smooth showman he isnt showing them how he does his tricks he is showing them flawless flowing performance this alone is providing the carrier wave that takes the substance of his actions to his audience though far cry from fine art perhaps yet there is art in the way he does things if he is good the audience is seeing first of all before anything else the technical expertise of his performance they are also watching him do things they know they cant do and they are watching the outcome of his presentations he is good magician if he gives technically flawless performance just in terms of scenes and motions which provide the channel for what he is presenting not to compare bach with magician though you could all great pieces of art have this one factor in common first of all before one looks at the faces on the canvas or hears the meaning of the song there is the technical expertise there adequate to produce an emotional impact before one adds message or meaning there is this technical expertise technical expertise is composed of all the little and large bits of technique known to the skilled painter musician actor any artist he adds these things together in his basic presentation he knows what he is doing and how to do it and then to this he adds his message all old masters were in there nailing canvas on frames as apprentices or grinding up the lapis lazuli or cleaning paintbrushes before they arrived at the metropolitan but how many paintbrushes do you have to clean enough to know that clean paintbrushes make clean color how many clarinet reeds do you have to replace enough to know which types will hit high c 495back of every artist there is technique you see them groping finding discarding fooling about what are they hunting for new blue just constant of blue that is an adequate quality and you see somebody who can really paint still stumbling about looking for techniquea total overrun someplace one says thats the technical expertise adequate to produce an emotional impact and thats it now he can so he devotes himself to messages if you get this tangled up or backwards the art does not have good chance of being good if one bats out messages without technically expert carrier wave of art the first standard of the many spectators seems to be violated the nice trick is to be technician and retain ones fire then one can whip out the masterpieces like chain lightning and all the great artists seem to have managed that and when they forked off onto new trail they mastered the technique and then erupted with great works it is remarkable thing about expertise do you know that some artists get by on technical expertise adequate to produce an emotional impact alone with messages they might not suspect that but it is true so the expertise adequate is important enough to be itself art it is never great art but it produces an emotional impact just from quality alone and how masterly an expertise not very masterly merely adequate how adequate is adequate well people have been known to criticize story because there were typographical errors in the typing and stories by the nonadept often go pages before anyone appears or anything happens and scores have been known to be considered dull simply because they were inexpertly chorded or clashed and handsome actor has been known not to have made it because he never knew what to do with his arms for all his fiery thunderings of the bards words any art demands certain expertise when this is basically sound magic almost anyone will look at it and say ah for quality alone has an emotional impact that it is cubist or dissonant or blank verse has very little bearing on it the type of the art form is limitation to audience attention generally when it has underlying it and expressed in it the expertise adequate to produce an emotional impact the message is what the audience thinks it sees or hears the significance of the play the towering clouds of sound in the symphony the scatterbatter of the current pop group are what the audience thinks it is perceiving and what they will describe usually or which they think they admire if it comes to them with basic expertise itself able to produce an emotional impact they will think it is great and it will be great the artist is thought of as enthroned in some special heaven where all is clean and there is sweat eyes half closed in the thrall of inspiration well maybe he is sometimes but every one ive seen had ink in his hair or towel handy to mop his brow or throat spray in his hand to ease the voice strain of having said his lines twentytwo times to the wall or the cat i mean the great ones the others were loafing and hoping and talking about the producer or the unfair art gallery proprietor the great ones always worked to achieve the technical quality necessary when they had it they knew they had it how did they know because it was technically correct living itself is an art form one puts up mockup it doesnt happen by accident one has to know how to wash his nylon shirts and girls have to know what mascara runs and that too many candy bars spoil the silhouette quite in addition to the pancreas 496some people are themselves work of art because they have mastered the small practical techniques of living that give them quality adequate to produce an emotional impact even before anyone knows their name or what they do even beard and baggy pants require certain art if they are to be the expertise adequate to produce an emotional impact and some products produce bad misemotional impact without fully being viewed and by this reverse logic of which you can think of many examples such as dirty room you can then see that there might be an opposite expertise all by itself adequate to produce strong but desirable emotional impact that is how good work of art has to be once one is capable of executing that technical expertise for that art form he can pour on the message unless the professional form is there first the message will not transmit lot of artists are overstraining to obtain quality far above that necessary to produce an emotional impact and many more are trying to machine gun messages at the world without any expertise at all to form the vital carrier wave so how good does piece of art have to be l ron hubbard founder lrhntmh copyright 1973 by l ron hubbard

good command of what is called stage manners while it is not possible here to give full text on the subject these basics should suffice 1 the performer purpose is basically communication to communicate one must have r realitywhich is to say one must be visible b to communicate one must have r that there is an audience there to be communicated to c degree of affinity with or for the audience must be physically expressed one cannot treat an audience with contempt for instance perpetual smile is not must respectful look friendly look does as well if you look over the above abcs you will see that the general basic of stage manners is the arc triangle from this almost anything else can be derived however there are some traditional rules i you accept applause this is the contribution of the audience you do not cut it off you acknowledge it with bows or other physical actions but you accept it you dont dodge it ii you never turn your back on the audience an exception is an actor in play stage situations you turn in such way as to turn facing the audience you do not turn the other way around and so give them your back iii never express embarrassment or stage fright even when you feel it force yourself into physical appearance and expression of poise iv if you goof ride right over it do not break off call attention to it or look helpless or foolish just ride right over it and go on v if you do not know what to do with your hands or feet dont do anything with them avoid twisting your feet or legs or hands or arms around dont fiddle with things be positive in motion vi during breaks or silent periods remember you are still on stage and stage manners still apply viialways appear to be in control of the place and the audience 498viiinever let your poise be shattered by sudden surprise ride over it and handle ix performer dominates an audience by his comm b by his art c by his technical perfection d by his stage manners none of this means that one cannot clown joke act superior or even seem austere these are the arts of presence but even in doing these stage manners are observed if as small child one was always cautioned about his manners and resented it one should get clear idea of what manners are in culture manners are the lubrication that ease the frictions of social contacts on the stage stage manners are the means of smoothing the problems of interchange between audience and performer the hallmark of the professional performer next to his art and expertise is flawless stage manners stand before fulllength mirror or use video tape assume the postures of your act accept applause gracefully bow gracefully smile pleasantly laugh be dignified demonstrate poise assume the posture needed for nonapplauding audience ride out boos demand more applause do the postures to end your performance after applause accept standing ovation deplore not being able to give an encore appear at the start for first part of performance assume the postures and poise needed on stage during one minute break between numbers accept plaque accept flowers ride over bad goof be respectful to the audience kid the audience out of it do each one of the ix rules and all without saying word do it with physical motions or lack of them when you can do all these things and look right to yourself and feel easy about them you will have and be confident of your stage manners l ron hubbard founder lrhntmrd copyright 1974 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 499hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 25

sounds and movement in speech music writing dance and in other physical activities meter basically means measure and applies to system or pattern of measured recurrence of length beat or numbers in poetry or music types of music rhythm there are six distinct types of rhythm in music these are regular meaning the evenly accented stressed beat syncopated the placing of upbeats along with downbeats at regular or irregular intervals stopped in stopped rhythm there are regular distinct halts to the flow of melody but all the beats are there they are simply regularly halted for an interval the term comes from choreography as in tap dancing where the dancer taps fill the stops accented where one or more beats in measure received stronger stress beat or accent accent in rhythm can be done by volume duration pitch or tone quality timbre omitted beat the regular omission of one or more beats in measures time may have to be counted over two or more measures in order to regularly omit soul motown added beat additional strong or generally weak beats are added to the rhythm in consistent or inconsistent manner bongos congas etc usage any and all rhythms are made up of the six basics above one two or more can be employed in complex patterns repetition rhythm is rhythm because of repetition recurrence rapport rapport relationship especially one of mutual trust or affinity an audience in rapport is different than an audience of spectators an audience in rapport participates in small or large ways with the performer or the artist or work of art often by vocal or body motion 500such participation is achieved by 1 reliance on the even recurrence of the rhythm 2 ability to predict it will recur 3 formation of agreement by such reliable prediction 4 permitting the audience to fill gaps or significances regular omission of beat or step or full explanation causes the audience to fill it for themselves and brings about physical or mental participation rhythm all life is repeating pulse and ebb and surge of motion life becomes difficult when rhythmic prediction cannot occur anxiety sets in it is relief to participate in predictable rhythm in an art form it is safe and reassuring if the rhythm is exciting it is also exciting therefore participation in predictable rhythm is pleasure and even joy impingement when one changes rhythm within single work one makes wrong because the person has predicted the rhythm but the prediction is not met thus he is wrong if the rhythm recurs the person is made right new rhythm attracts attention if it is agreed with and recurs it gets participation art forms the above materials while written from the viewpoint of music apply to any art form even prose has rhythm not all rhythms are pleasant or acceptable many ways exist to utilize these observations on rhythmie one can begin an unwanted rhythm using the audience objection to impinge and then turn it into wanted rhythm as life itself is going through time and as time is recurrence some rhythms are too dull to attain any attention rhythm used in art forms must therefore slow or speed or change the expected rhythms of ordinary life in order to command attention rhythm can sooth lull excite arouse to any point of the emotional tone scale rhythm one half to one tone below the usual rhythm in life will depress or degrade an audience rhythm one half to one tone above the usual rhythm will dominate and interest rhythm and its expression is the basic key to all art forms lrhntmrd l ron hubbard copyright 1974 founder by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 501b r d t c

bulletins are right enough as to the data in them many were written by others than myself accordingly to correct certain outnesses and get real results every time i gave correct demonstration to the medical officers at flag they were also told by someone else it needed case supervisor clearance and by another that it had to be known by class iv auditor both of these data were false and were cancelled being alerted now that students learning it do it all over doll with idea of balance i wish to make sure the correct data is known so this tech very powerful when correctly done is better understood as to exact use i know better way of giving the real scene than publishing these correct notes by one of the medical officers who took notes during the demonstration talk by lrh to flag medical officers on touch assists with demonstration on assists when you are speaking with medicos you talk to them in terms of restoring comm in blood and nerve channels ive recently observed nobody does correct touch assist hence i want to show you how to get real results normal errors in touch assist are 1 dont go to extremities 2 dont equal balance to both sides 3 dont carry through they go to release point only 4 dont repeat on following days if needed guy stubs toe the other toe is where it is locked up there is balance of the nerve energy of the body on 12 nerve channels going up and down the spine the type of energy in the body travels at 10 ft second the energy from shock will make standing wave in the body the brain is shock cushion that is all it absorbs the shock from large amount of energy the neuronsynapse is disconnection wave one way will have wave reacting the other way in the sympathetic system the wave locks up on both sides of the body so do assist thoroughly on both sides get both sides and unlock standing wave the purpose of touch assist is to unlock the standing waves that are small electronic ridges of nervous energy that is not flowing as it should you can unlock an impulse in the leg and it can get into spine and lock up so this is where you get the chiropractor fixing people but the nerves are telling the muscles to hold the bone out of place 502a shock puts via the nerves permanent command into set of muscles all different commands going out from the shock the system functions through stops to try to hold that shock back its actually nerve to muscle to bone light massage along nerve channels will get muscles unlocked to permit bone to go in place you unlock nerve channels the trick is standing waves the wave is slowed down as it goes through body like at each joint there are brain cells at each joint absorbing the shock inertiawhen enough heavy charge goes through nerve it stops passing the charge through and just builds it up touch assist will bring the flow back and the suspended pain cold electrical charges and muscle command will blow through shock impulse goes tearing down nerve in huge volume all accumulating nodules of standing waves all over body trying to stop the nerve impulse the nerve goes into apathy with the huge volume of impulse like 100000 volts of electricity over small wire something goes with auditing you are bringing back the nerve from apathy up through the tone scale like getting apathy of nerve up through the pain explosion so the touch assist is short sessioned and always balanced at first you might just get an awareness of the area then maybe after the 3rd or 4th assist third or fourth day or many more days with one done each day there is large jolt that will go through the comm cycle is not as important in the touch assist as it is with thetan auditing but it must be present here we are dealing with the body you do give the command get an answer from the patient and acknowledge each time the assist demo done on arthur hubbard arthur had wound on his right foot right side at ball of foot location wound not healing quickly you want to get the guy where he is available arthur was sitting on chair with legs straight and feet on lrhs knees one foot on each knee and arthurs hands palms down on his shins arthur was comfortablelrh asked about his comfort the target of all this touch assist is the pain in the wound in the side of the foot the extremity is the top end of the big toe both hands and especially finger tip are also extremities its sympathetic system on the assist you must go to corresponding extremities r factor im going to touch you like this lrh touched arthurs foot when you feel it well tell okay okay feel my finger yes arthur good lrh this was done rapidly alternating from one side of body to other one command and answer and ack for each touch assist done on each toe back and forth left to right one for one touch on one side touch on other side up foot each toe over to hands left hand to right hand one touch for one this was done for several minutes lrh then had arthur bend over to get to the spine arthur said he had some numbness in the lower spine when lrh asked about this area lrh then did the spine touching 3 inches from spine on one side then to three inches on the other side alternately up the head and around the neck and head lrh asked hows that arthur said better gave cognition on pants being same ones he had on during accident and lrh ended off 503spine arthur during assist had numbness in kidney back area this is the midpoint between the extremities on the sympathetic system in the future if the assist hadnt been done he might have had kidney trouble the impulse locks up in the spine so you have to do the spine too to release that charge extremity the extremity is beyond the point of the body injury really handling the extremity furthest from the injury the legs would strip the blocked energy out if you get the extremity during the assist lrh did not do the legs or arms only toes feet hands fingers and back the way you run the touch assist is give the command then touch do not touch and then give the command as its backwards this requires drill feel my finger then touch point lrh schools of healing the thing thats wrong with each school of healing is that it says it can do the job totally it cant an example of this is swedish masseur saying he can cure person but in addition to massage let us say the person doesnt eat its not part of the cure so doesnt cure the doctors bug is diagnosis he is even setting up computer system in the country to figure out what is with the person but they dont have logic or the data series to program from so they wont make it there is big hole in adele daviss book on dieting she doesnt talk enough about iodine on diets but that is what activates thyroid which burns up the food so her reducing diets dont always reduce if you block out the fields of knowledge you wont get anywhere to cure things doctor should use number of things schools of healing and do each one right regard body with question mark in your mind there is brain at each joint this is why acupuncture works one can paralyze whole body area with it by touching these minor brains with needle it can do other things as well if you know how mesmerism mesmerism is relation to hypnotism at all mesmerism is animal magnetism its physiological rapport not concentration on mental but on mentalphysiological to have rapport with something you can be it 504hypnotism is the reduction and absorption of mental power of the person in hypnotism one takes over the person the subject has control when doing physical healing if you stroke sympathetically both sides alternately inducing rhythmic motion which is monotonous you can mesmerize person in mesmerism there is an imposition on feeling if you mesmerize person and pinch your back he will get red in the same place and feel the pain of the pinch this is physiological rapport words are said during mesmerism in assists you dont want rapport avoid rhythm on stroking in massages keep person talking keep him saying yes and you acking in an assist keep him in comm with you that is why you use the comm cycle or else all feeling can go out of the body the comm cycle prevents mesmeric trance occurring that would leave the patient in rapport rapport is mutual feelingness in an assist 1 keep talking 2 break rhythms 3 end off this is important mesmerism is the transfer of the feeling and fault of operator to patient woman doing massages quietly and rhythmically could be giving her patient her disjointed hip doctor with bad eyesight can make his patients worse or vice versa possibly if he had good eyesight patient could
