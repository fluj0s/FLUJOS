6206c28 shspec166 rudiments part of the data on this tape is contained in hcob 2jul62 repetitive rudiments how to get the rudiments in here is why you have difficulty with rudiments when you do let us consider an emeter on totally arc broken pc it wont read the gradient on this is the more arc broken the pc is the less the meter reads it should go by the opposite gradient the more the arc break the greater the needle response but it doesnt the fact is the more the rudiment is out the less the needle responds in session you often find the second third and fourth ruds out when checked later this is because when you dont get rud in the later ruds dont read well auditor can blunder by not checking what he is trying to put right after getting something answered for instance say you are putting havingness in in beginning ruds you run the pc on some havingness then skip checking the question tell if it is all right to audit in this room on the meter the omission of that step throws the remainder of your rudiments out you would be amazed at how many answers the pc has that he never has chance to give you all of which become missed withholds he only stops giving you answers after you have made flub on metering rudiments there might be several ways to get ruds in the current one is to ask get the pcs response and test it on the meter if it is clean leave it this works fine as long as you never miss if the pc is bit arc broken and you dont get response you say it is clean and from then on you have had it that is the frailty of that system there is another system ask the ruds question indicate that reads what was that the pc answers check the question if it is clean ask the pc do you agree that that is clean that gets you off the hook somewhat another system is the one that used to be used in sec checking ask the pc the question until the pc runs out of answers then check the meter if there is read get what it is recheck if it reads say there is another read here this is the correct phrasing while it still reads will make the pc wrong and arc break him this system prevents missed withholds from developing because it gets the pc talking to the auditor about his case you get more fundamental read that way but you will have to steer the pc because what you have got is unknown to the pc you are plumbing the bank the disadvantage of this system is that some auditors cant leave the middle rudiments alone they spend all their time on them in goals session you should be getting middle ruds in only when everything goes null and you are getting reads of any kind on any goals you wont go over several goals without getting read unless the middle ruds are out dont try to cure nosituations if the pc says something while you are nulling the goals list just use tr4 be sure you acknowledge him or you will have to put in middle ruds because he will feel you missed withhold you expect the goal to read at least once on your threetime repetition get middle ruds in when you get consecutive xs on listing you put in middle ruds when the pc runs out of items you do it when you change from one list to the next also but the important time to put in midruds is when one of the fourlists is shorter than the others and the pc runs down you use midruds as booster in listing or nulling and to test flatness of what question in prepchecking in you overuse them you will drive the pc out of session because it is noauditing situation so using the sec check system to put middle ruds in can overdo the amount of time spent on midruds but this system will get out the unknown rud that is the real killer watch out for the pc who says also dont get caught up in repetitively asking ruds questions against the meter three times maybe but if they are that hot the pc can find the answers this system does get the pc into session if not used senselessly and at length in the middle of goals listing the best time to use this system in prepcheck session is on beginning ruds to be sure everything is grooved in there is problem there lrh cant say there is one perfect system there are number of types of pcs but all pcs agree that auditing is scarce and that it must take place and be effective so any system that wastes auditing time or seems to will rut ruds out so ordinarily in prepcheck system get beginning ruds in really well using the sec check system but polish off middle and end ruds routine three is not as interesting to the pc as prepchecking though it is important the pc is anxious during nulling more than interested so dont use the sec check repetitive ruds system on routine three the pc is impatient he hears the padlock rattle if you have to use an extraordinary system to get ruds in the pc is too nervy for routine three anyway the system is just too timeconsuming for any pc in the middle of routine 3 he should already be in shape to stay in session when you put him on routine 3 anyway dont give ruds that much importance suppose your pc always has latent answers after you have found the rud clean in this case you can say we have the significant withholds off of that or that is clean of important answers or at least we have the reactive answers off it you want to indicate that there is needle response not necessarily that the pc may have more answers however you dont want the pc to carry on after it is clean nor to invalidate his having thought of something the pc can get whole theory worked out on how some thoughts arent important and some are reactive etc etc if you are going to make an evaluative statement at least make it an accurate one
