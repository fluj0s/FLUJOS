in fy2007 risk dhs determined state and urban area risk by using risk and anticipated effectiveness formula developed by th office of grant programs ogp in conjunction with other dhs and federal entities distribution of shsgp letpp and uasi funding was based on this risk nd effectiveness formula the specific formula however was not made publicly av ailable and may not be available in the future due to security concerns more generally dhs indicated that the risk calculations were based upon consider ation of the following factors threat the likelihood of an attack occurring and vulnerability and cons equence the relative exposure and expected impact of an attack14 the risk score generated by dhs for the hsgp in fy2007 was based on 100 point scale where thr eat could contribute maximum of 20 points and vulnerabilityconsequence could contribute up to 80 points thus most of the variation across jurisdictions likely arose from variation in the vulnerability and

national commissi on on terrorist attacks upon the united states 911 commission recommendation to allocate homeland security funding based solely on risk if congress were to appropriate the authorized shsgp and uasi amounts in pl 11053 it could be argu ed that this issue might be further noticeable since guaranteed minimum dollar amounts increase based on the statutes authorized appropriations even

report washington gpo july 2004 p 396 32 ibid 33 ibidothers might contend that the statute is consistent with the 911 commissions recommendation while the 911 commission cr iticized the allocation of federal homeland security assistance and recommende d that the distribution not remain program for general revenue sharing31 commissioners acknowledged that every state and city needs to have some minimu m infrastructure for emergency response32 the 911 commission also recommended that state and local homeland security assistance should supplement state and local resources based on the risks or vulnerabilities that merit dditional support and offere d two highrisk vulnerable cities as examples saying now in 2004 washington dc and new york city are certainly at the top of any such list33 it could be argued however that if dhs were to determine during its risk and effectiveness analysis that all grant recipients scored above the guaranteed minimum then the increase in guaranteed minimum dollar amounts would not affect the overall allocation this could result in dhs not having to reallocate funding to ensure applicants meet the guaranteed minimum amount
