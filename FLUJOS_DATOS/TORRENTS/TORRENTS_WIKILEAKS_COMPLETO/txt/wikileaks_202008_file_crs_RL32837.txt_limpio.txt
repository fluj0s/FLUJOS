congress updated september 1 2006 frank gottron coordinator resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress science and technology policy issues for the 109th congress summary science and technology have pervasive influence over wide range of issues confronting the nation decisions on how much federal funding to invest in research and development rd and determining what programs have the highest priority for example may have implications for homeland security new high technology industries governmentprivate sector cooperation in rd and myriad other areas this report indicates the sweep of science and technology in many public policy issues although it cannot provide comprehensive examination of every science or technology issue which may be of interest to congress in some areas such as global climate change and stem cell research the importance of science and technology is explicit and in the forefront of the policy debate in others such as patent protection and telecommunications reform science and technology may not be as explicit but are important drivers affecting how policy makers may make decisions this report also addresses key issues that directly affect or are affected by science and technology other mechanisms which may indirectly impact science and technology such as tax antitrust and trade policies are outside the scope of this report the appropriate level of federal funding for research and development rd is among the issues facing congress federal rd funding spurs technological advancement which contributes to economic growth and plays role in the education of future scientists and engineers members of congressional committees that oversee rd have expressed concern about the possible repercussions of restraining rd funding science and technology also are important components of homeland security issues not only is congress debating funding levels for rd for counterterrorism but issues concerning public access to scientific information and technological and privacy aspects of data mining potential means to identity terrorist activities and track individual terrorists themselves congress is addressing wide range of other science and technology policy issues from tsunami forecasting and warning to telecom reform revising the telecommunications act of 1996 to cloning and stem cell research to ocean policy and global climate change several energy issues are being debated including president bushs hydrogen fuel initiative and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel the transformation of the national aeronautics and space administration nasa as it implements president bushs vision for space exploration is receiving close attention as the agency announces related job

have pervasive influence over wide range of issues confronting the nation decisions on how much federal funding to invest in basic and applied research and in research and development rd and determining what programs have the highest priority for example could have implications for homeland security new high technology industries governmentprivate sector cooperation in rd and myriad other areas following are brief discussions of key science and technology issues being debated in the 109th congress where available additional crs reports and issue briefs that discuss these topics in more detail are identified at the end of each section many of those reports are regularly updated and should be consulted for timely information research and development budget management and workforce federal government investment in rd the constrained fiscal environment is putting pressure on the full range of federal government spending including funding for research and development rd debate is ongoing in the 109th congress over how much to spend on various rd activities see next issue but more fundamental question is why the government invests in rd at all rather than relying on the private sector universities and other nonprofit groups traditionally the governments role in rd funding is to meet the mission requirements of the federal departments and agencies included is support for basic research that work undertaken to gain knowledge and understanding of the fundamental aspects of nature the payoff for basic research is generally long in coming the results may be unmarketable and the rewards often diffused among many users making private sector investment less likely however as stated in the analytical perspectives accompanying president bushs fy2006 budget request rd is critically important for keeping our nation economically competitive and it will help solve the challenges we face in health defense energy and the environment p 61 as part of the american competitiveness initiative announced by the president in the 2006 state of the union address the crs2 administration will attempt to double over 10 years funding for innovationenabling research done in several government agencies in the united states while the development of new products processes and services for the commercial marketplace is primarily private sector activity the government may get involved for certain limited purposes federal support is often provided for those efforts that typically have been determined to be necessary for the national good but which cannot or will not be financed by industry government also plays role in structuring the environment in which business decisions are made and thereby influences private sector behavior direct federal funding tax policies and the existence of government markets for certain technologies including defense public health and information technologyrelated goods have helped influence resource allocations in the business community according to the national science foundations science and engineering indicators 2006 appendix table 45 in 2004 the latest year for which data are available industry funds accounted for 64 of us rd while the government financed 30 of the total spending with the remaining 6 provided by universities colleges and other nonprofit institutions industrial support for rd is concentrated on development rather than on research activities the government encourages private investment in rd through direct measures such as the research and experimentation re tax credit see crs report rl31181 and through indirect measures including ownership of intellectual property and cooperative rd activities discussed below under technology development issues the myriad effects of federal rd spending highlight the importance of decisions regarding the amount and distribution of federal rd funds choices made by the 109th congress related to the financing of research and development may have immediate impacts on current programs as well as long term effects on the nations technological progress for further information crs report rl33528 industrial competitiveness and technological advancement debate over government policy crs report rl33345 federal research and development funding fy2007 crs report rl33511 federal research and development budgeting and priority setting issues 109th congress crs report rl31181 research tax credit current status legislative proposals and policy issues fy2007 rd budget the bush administration requested 1372 billion in federal research and development rd funding for fy2007 this sum represents 26 increase over the estimated 1337 billion that was approved in fy2006 as in the recent past the fy2007 increase over the fy2006 estimated funding levels is due to significant funding increases in the department of defense dod and the national aeronautics and space administrations nasas space vehicles development program crs3 according to the most recent nsf rd data in 2004 the united states spent 3121 billion on rd of that amount 199 billion or 638 was spent by industry the federal government was distant second accounting for 934 billion or 299 of the national total the remaining 63 is divided between universities with 111 billion or 36 of the national total and nonprofits with 86 billion or 27 of the national total the federal share of total national rd expenditures declined below 50 for the first time in 1979 by 2000 the federal share of total rd had reached record low of 249 before it rose to 299 of total national rd expenditures in 2004 the centerpiece of the presidents proposed fy2007 rd budget is the american competitiveness initiative aci the president proposed this initiative in response to growing concerns about americas ability to compete in the technological global market place over the next 10 years the 136 billion initiative would commit 50 billion for research science education and the modernization of research infrastructure the remaining 86 billion would finance revised permanent rd tax incentive over the next 10 years the most recent federal research tax credit expired on december 31 2005 in his budget request the president asked congress to pass permanent research and experimental federal tax credit as part of the 50 billion for research the president has called for doubling federal rd funding over 10 years this increase would include the physical sciences and engineering research in three agencies the national science foundation nsf the department of energys does office of science and the national institute of standards and technology nist according to the administration in fy2007 the aci overall funding increases for nsf doe and nist would be 910 million or 93 above fy2006 estimated funding levels for the three agencies crs report rl33345 federal research and development funding fy2007 crs report rl33511 federal research and development budgeting and priority setting issues 109th congress government performance and results act gpra and the presidents management agenda the government performance and results act of 1993 gpra pl 10362 is intended to produce greater efficiency effectiveness and accountability in federal spending and to ensure that an agencys programs and priorities meet its goals it also requires agencies to use performance measures for management and ultimately for budgeting recent actions have required agencies to identify more precisely rd goals and measures of rd outcomes as underscored in the presidents management agenda beginning in fy2001 and in each year thereafter the bush administration has emphasized the importance of performance measurement including for rd in memorandum dated june 5 2003 signed jointly by the office of science and technology policy ostp director and the office of management and budget omb director regarding planning for the fy2005 rd budget requests the administration announced that its effort to base budget decisions on program performance would continue and be expanded omb m0315 omb crs4 referred to this memo again in the fy2006 and fy2007 rd budget guidance which reiterated the importance of performance assessment for rd programs respectively omb m0423 and omb m0518 as in recent years section 5 of ombs analytical perspectives budget of the us government fy2007 discusses requirements for agencies to use omb criteria to measure research outcomes focusing on relevance quality and performance rd performed by industry is to meet additional criteria relating to the appropriateness of public investment demonstrate capability to measure benefits and identify decision points to transition the activity to the private sector the administration assessed some rd programs by use of the program assessment rating tool part which uses the omb rd criteria and other measures part results for 102 rd programs were used when making fy2007 budget decisions ombs analytical perspectives volume reports that 29 programs were judged effective 41 were moderately effective commentators point out that it is difficult to define priorities for most research and to measure the results quantitatively or qualitatively since research outcomes cannot be defined well in advance and often take long time to demonstrate as result some say they have little confidence that rd performance measures can be used to recommend budget levels and suggest that congress may not use such measures as much as the administration congress may increase attention to using rd performance measures in authorizations and appropriations as discretionary spending becomes constrained interest continues in monitoring the part process as well as in the administrations budget and performance integration initiative and in implementation of gpra in the 109th congress the house government reform committee has approved hr 185 to provide statutory mandate for partlike reviews it is similar to hr 3826 which the committee reported favorably in the last congress also in the 109th congress the administration has proposed to create sunset commission which would require performance reviews and automatic program termination unless programs were reauthorized bills reflecting the administrations proposal have been introduced s 1399 hr 3276 hr 3277 hearings were held in september 2005 on the two house bills there are also proposals in the 109th congress to create accountability commissions hr 2470 and s 1155 some in congress are not yet comfortable with using performance measurement data to make budget decisions and prefer to use traditionally formatted budget information which focuses on inputs rather than outputs or political judgements to make budget decisions see

crs5 information quality act implementation and peer review the information quality act iqa sometimes referred to as the data quality act was enacted in december 2000 as section 515 of the treasury and general government appropriations act for fiscal year 2001 pl 106554 the act required omb to issue guidance to federal agencies designed to ensure the quality objectivity utility and integrity of information disseminated to the public it also required agencies to issue their own information quality guidelines and to establish administrative mechanisms that allow affected persons to seek correction of information maintained and disseminated by the agencies that they believe does not comply with omb guidance ombs february 2002 final guidance notes that iqa applies to virtually all federal agencies and defines information as any communication or representation of knowledge such as facts or data in any medium or form the guidelines define dissemination as any agency initiated or sponsored distribution of information to the public omb indicated that quality encompasses elements of utility objectivity and integrity and said agencies can generally presume that data are objective if they have been subject to an independent peer review process in december 2005 omb provided congress with report on the implementation of the iqa during fy2003 and fy2004 the report said the agencies received only 85 substantive iqarelated correction requests during those two fiscal years but noted that the agencies received many other requests that were similar to those received before the iqa of the 85 requests 45 were initially denied by the agencies of these 28 were subsequently appealed with 13 of those appeals denied by the end of fy2004 some of the denied correction requests were handled through other means eg treating them as comments on proposed rules and omb noted that many of the denials were based on reasonable interpretations of information omb indicated that the correction requests came from all segments of society and said there was evidence that the iqa had affected the pace of rulemaking comments from omb and others suggest several possible areas for improvement of the iqas implementation major test of the iqa may be whether agencies denials of information correction requests are subject to judicial review in march 2006 the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit ruled that the act does not permit judicial review two district courts had previously reached similar conclusion and the department of justice issued brief stating that the iqa does not permit judicial review the us chamber of commerce has indicated that it plans to ask congress to provide for judicial review of agencies actions under the act for further information crs report rl32532 the information quality act ombs guidance and initial implementation crs report rl32680 peer review ombs proposed and revised bulletins crs6 science and technology education an important aspect of us efforts to maintain and improve economic competitiveness is the existence of capable scientific and technological workforce the bureau of labor statistics reports that science and engineering occupations are projected to grow by 214 from 2004 to 2014 compared to growth of 13 in all occupations during the same time period it is anticipated that approximately 65 of the growth in science and engineering occupations will be in the computerrelated fields faster than average growth is expected in the life sciences social science and the science and engineeringrelated occupations of science manager simultaneous with predictions of the future scientific workforce are data reporting decline in the number of students seeking degrees in certain fields while 318 of the undergraduate degrees awarded are in science and engineering compared to degrees in all fields the percentage has declined or been static in the past several years due in part to the impending retiring scientific and engineering workforce there is growing concern by many in the scientific community industry researchdriven federal agencies and congress about the production of the nations science mathematics engineering and technical personnel the demographics of the science and engineering workforce have been the subject of debate the demographics of the nation have been changing with more than 25 of the us population composed of certain minorities blacks hispanics and native americans as group these minorities have traditionally been underrepresented in the science and engineering disciplines compared to their proportion of the total population another underrepresented group in the sciences is women group that comprises 508 of the population together these groups comprise what some may call new majority while minorities have increased their share of degrees awarded in the past 10 years poor preparation in science and mathematics is said to be major factor limiting the appeal of science and engineering to many in these groups in addition large number of blacks hispanics and native americans lack access to many of the more rigorous college preparatory course offerings several pieces of legislation have been introduced during the 109th congress to address the reported needs in science and mathematics education some of the bills have been signed into law pl 109163 the national defense authorization act of 2006 has among other things made permanent the science mathematics and research for transformation program to address projected shortages of scientists and engineers in the national security workforce pl 109171 the deficit reduction act of 2005 establishes the academic competitiveness grants and the national science and mathematics access to retain talent grants programs both programs are directed at supporting students pursuing degrees in the physical life and computer sciences mathematics engineering technology and critical foreign languages additional pieces of competitiveness legislation have been introduced in the 109th congress that have as key provision funding and strengthening science and mathematics education the bills are s 2197 protecting americas competitive edge through energy act s 2198 protecting americas competitive edge through education and research act and s 2199 protecting americas competitive edge through tax incentives act s 2197 s 2198 and s 2199 are commonly referred crs7 to as the pace legislation and hr 4654 national innovation act of 2006 the proposed initiatives expanded programs restructured curricula and funding levels included in the various components of the pace legislation and hr 4654 differ to some extent but are all directed at improving teacher recruitment and retention improving the skills of existing teacher workforce attracting and retaining students in science mathematics and engineering and the establishment of centers of excellence clearinghouses and distinguished scholar programs hr 5358 science and mathematics education for competitiveness act renames the national science foundations nsf mathematics and science partnership program to become the school and university partnerships for science and mathematics education funding would not be limited to teachers improvement as originally outlined but preference would be given to those applications that have teacher training as focus grants would include teacher training activities to prepare science and mathematics teachers to teach advanced placement and international baccalaureate courses funding would increase from 63 million in fy2007 to 103 million in fy2011 the bill extends the authorization of and expands nsfs science technology engineering and mathematics talent expansion program step which provides grants to institutions to improve their undergraduate science engineering and mathematics programs the bill supports both majors and nonmajors taking science engineering and mathematics courses language is included directing the nsf to enforce the statutory requirement that grant include numerical target for increasing the number of science majors and that the target number be used in the evaluation of the grant it is anticipated that the 109th congress will continue to examine issues important to science and mathematics education including those of the preparation and performance of us students at the precollege level the diversity of the scientific and technical workforce and the impact of visa regulations on foreign students in graduate science and engineering programs see next issue for further information crs report 98871 stm science engineering and mathematics education status and issues crs report rl33434 science technology engineering and mathematics stem education issues and legislative options foreign science and engineering presence in us institutions and the labor force the increased presence of foreign students in us graduate science and engineering programs continues to be of concern enrollment of us citizens in graduate science and engineering programs has not kept pace with that of foreign students in those programs in many institutions foreign graduate students on temporary visas comprise 40 to 50 of some science and engineering programs in addition to the number of foreign students significant number of university faculty in the scientific disciplines are foreign and foreignborn doctorates are employed in large numbers by industry crs8 many in the scientific and engineering communities maintain that to compete with countries that are rapidly expanding their scientific and technological capabilities the united states needs to bring in those whose skills will benefit society and will enable us to compete in the newtechnologybased global economy individuals supporting this position believe instead of limiting the number of foreign students the conditions under which foreign talent enters us colleges and universities and the labor force should be more carefully scrutinized and controlled to address any security concerns furthermore there are those who contend that the underlying concern of foreign students in graduate science and engineering programs is not necessarily that there are too many foreignborn students but that there are not enough us students the debate on the presence of foreign students in graduate science and engineering programs and the workforce has intensified as result of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 concerns have been expressed about certain foreign students receiving education and training in sensitive areas in addition there has been increased discussion about the access of foreign scientists and engineers to rd related to chemical and biological weapons in may 2004 several higher education organizations released combined statement on the impact of the new visa policies on higher education and the scientific enterprise they maintain that the new procedures have made the visa system inefficient and that the tighter visa restrictions are major deterrent to foreign students and scholars considering working and studying in this country during the 108th congress several hearings were held to examine the visa system for foreign students discussions focused on the increased scrutiny of foreign students from countries that sponsor terrorism and the restrictions placed on the participation of foreign students and scientists in militarysponsored projects and other types of rd on february 15 2005 the state department announced that progress has been made in reducing the clearance time for the visas mantis process currently the process averages 15 days additionally the state department has revised the clearance procedures by reducing the restrictions placed on students and scholars and extending the validity of the clearances lengthening the time for each clearance in february 2005 the government accountability office released the report border security streamlined visas mantis program has lowered burden on foreign science students and scholars but further refinements needed which details the efforts and the improvements that have been made in the visa processing may 10 2005 report of the national academies policy implications of international graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in the united states notes the importance of international students to us society not only academically and economically but in terms of global and cultural knowledge and understanding however nsf data reveal that the number of nonus citizens enrolling in us colleges and universities has slowed since 2001 because of the tightening of us visa policies increased global competition for graduates in scientific and technical disciplines and reports that foreign students may encounter an inhospitable environment on september 13 2005 the house subcommittee on national security emerging threats and international relations held hearing to examine the crs9 procedures put in place to correct the gaps and vulnerabilities in the visa process attention was directed at the mechanisms that are necessary to strengthen the visa process as an antiterrorism tool while simultaneously facilitating legitimate travel by foreign students scientists researchers and others in the united states witnesses testified that consular workloads have increased significantly yet the visaprocessing offices continue to lack strategic direction adequate resources and training in addition reliable data are not readily available across and among departments and agencies to determine security and visa fraud related issues and overall increased visa wait times witnesses stated that because visa policies and requirements are ongoing and can change quickly clear procedures on visa issuance and monitoring operations worldwide are necessary to guarantee that visas are adjudicated in consistent manner at each visaissuing post on may 25 2006 the senate passed s 2611 the comprehensive immigration reform act of 2006 the bill would among other things increase the numerical limits on h1b visas from 65000 to 115000 and develop formula for determining future admissions in addition s 2611 would add new exemption from the annual limits for h1b holders who have been awarded graduate degrees in the scientific and technical disciplines from us colleges and universities it is anticipated that the 109th congress will continue to monitor the participation of foreign students in graduate science and engineering programs and the processing of visas for foreign science students and scholars in addition there may be further debate regarding the increased scrutiny of foreign students from countries that sponsor terrorism and the restrictions placed on the participation of foreign students and scientists in certain types of rd there are questions as to whether or not continued reduction in the immigration of foreign scientists may impact negatively on the competitiveness of us industry for further information crs report 97746 foreign science and engineering presence in us institutions and the laborforce crs report rl33125 immigration legislation and issues in the 109th congress homeland security issues counterterrorism rd since the terrorist attacks in 2001 additional federal funding has been devoted to counterterrorism rd and new planning and coordination mechanisms have been established both in individual agencies and in the white house the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 consolidated some rd activities and coordination responsibilities in the new department of homeland security dhs especially in its directorate of science and technology st during the 108th congress oversight focused on the establishment of the st directorate in the 109th congress policy issues include the coordination of programs and priorities both between agencies and within dhs the use of performance goals and metrics to monitor st program accomplishments the adequacy of rd resources for topics crs10 of particular congressional interest such as cybersecurity the integration of threat assessment information into rd prioritysetting and coordination the objectivity and efficiency of st contract and grant awards and the management of the directorate coordination of federal counterterrorism rd is particular challenge because relevant programs exist in many different agencies and accurate information about their activities can be difficult to obtain the rd programs of dhs account for only about onethird of total expenditures for homeland security rd other agencies with large counterterrorism rd responsibilities include the national institutes of health focused on bioterrorism and the defense and intelligence agencies also involved are the departments of justice commerce energy and agriculture the national science foundation the environmental protection agency and others under the homeland security act dhs has some authority to coordinate and help set priorities for other federal homeland security rd including human healthrelated rd what that authority means in practice remains to be seen the heads of other agencies have formal role in dhss rd prioritysetting and coordination and conversely the role of the dhs secretary in setting priorities for those agencies is undetermined dhss effectiveness in planning and coordinating rd may depend upon the secretarys ability to influence other agencies through his interactions with existing counterterrorism coordination mechanisms in ostp nstc and interagency committees internal coordination and prioritysetting within dhs are also of congressional interest the fy2004 homeland security appropriations conference report hrept 108280 expressed concern about the potential for duplication waste and inadequate management oversight and directed dhs to consolidate all departmental research and development funding within the science and technology programs in the fy2005 budget request dhs did propose consolidating the coast guard rdte program and some smaller programs into the science and technology directorate in fy2005 but congress rejected the move of the coast guard program for fy2006 dhs again proposed consolidating the coast guard program along with the rd activities of the transportation security administration and some smaller programs congress again rejected the coast guard move for fy2007 dhs proposed moving all radiological and nuclear rd out of st into the new domestic nuclear detection office consolidation remains an issue for congressional oversight in the 109th congress other issues include questions about how dhs sets priorities among its various rd programs how it utilizes the rd capabilities of the national laboratories and how it manages and oversees rd procurement federal funding for counterterrorism rd has increased significantly since the terrorist attacks in 2001 despite the constrained budget environment according to estimates by the american association for the advancement of science in fy2004 the governmentwide total exceeded 35 billion compared with less than 600 million in fy2001 for fy2006 congress appropriated about 51 billion the administration requested about 06 reduction for fy2007 the administration has made homeland security budget priority for interagency rd planning but further growth may pose challenges as the 109th congress continues to balance competing needs in tight budget for the current status of fy2007 funding for crs11 rd in dhs see crs report

development is concentrated in three departments the department of health and human services hhs the department of homeland security dhs and the department of defense dod hhs largely through the national institutes of health nih has traditionally focused on basic research to support biomedical countermeasure development increasingly hhs supports the development of new countermeasures by grants to fund advanced development and clinical trials dhs cbrn research and development programs focus on threat awareness and characterization including material threat determinations for project bioshield agent surveillance and detection forensics and postevent response and restoration dod has significant biomedical countermeasure research and development program which focuses on protecting warfighters from cbrn weapons and tends to emphasize prophylaxis the three departments programs have the potential for either synergy or redundancy strong executive branch management and congressional oversight may be crucial for maximizing synergy and avoiding redundancy in the 109th congress committees in both chambers have held hearings related to interagency coordination of cbrn defense efforts this attention appears likely to continue for the remainder of the 109th congress enactment of the project bioshield act of 2002 pl 108276 tenyear 56 billion biomedical countermeasures acquisition program removed some of the barriers that had discouraged pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies from developing countermeasures both chambers have held hearings during the 109th congress on the implementation of this program congressional concerns include the perceived slow rate that the program acquires countermeasures and the decision process for choosing countermeasures this scrutiny is likely to continue with additional oversight hearings congress is considering several bills which add to or modify the project bioshield act of 2002 as part the department of defense appropriations act 2006 pl 109148 congress limited the tort liability of biomedical countermeasure crs12 producers some of remaining issues likely to receive congressional consideration are provisions removing

regulate the transfer though not the possession of socalled select agents which are viruses bacteria fungi and toxins that may pose severe threat to public health and safety the initial regulation required the registration of any laboratory shipping or receiving the agents and documentation of these transfers the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 pl 107188 expanded the scope of the program by requiring the registration of all facilities possessing select agents not just those shipping or receiving them pl 107188 gave the department of agriculture

toxins the law instructed hhs and usda to coordinate their activities regarding socalled overlap agents those agents that affect both human and animal health and that therefore appear on both agencies lists pl 107188 also instructed the hhs secretary in consultation with the attorney general to establish safety and security requirements for registered laboratories individuals given access to select agents must undergo background investigations conducted by the federal bureau of investigation both pl 107188 and the usa patriot act pl 10756 barred access by certain groups of individuals based on criminal history immigration status and other factors congress authorized the select agent program through 2007 with an indefinite appropriation in december 2002 hhs and usda issued interim final regulations to implement the expanded program both departments issued final rules with only minor changes in march 2005 the hhs regulation is codified at 42 cfr 730 and the usda regulation at 7 cfr 331 and 9 cfr 121 in addition to the provisions crs13 discussed above all labs possessing select agents are required to submit detailed security training and recordkeeping plans in order to be registered while the select agent program emphasizes the prevention of the intentional use of these agents by individuals seeking to cause harm there have also been concerns about the unintentional release of these agents from registered facilities such releases could potentially result from the failure of environmental controls or from improper laboratory practices worldwide there have been several instances in which laboratory workers became infected with communicable diseases in the course of their work and went about in the community before the infections were recognized the select agent final rule requires that registered facilities have in addition to the biosecurity provisions discussed above biosafety plans to address good laboratory practices worker safety and related matters in 2003 in order to boost national capacity for bioterrorism preparedness and response the national institutes of health awarded construction grants for two biosafety level 4 bsl4 labs the type of lab with the highest level of containment designed for work with dangerous and exotic agents that pose high risk of life threatening disease eg ebola virus and nine bsl3 labs designed to handle pathogens with lower level of risk but still capable of causing lifethreatening disease eg west nile virus despite the safety and security requirements imposed by the select agent rule there has been opposition to the construction of these laboratories in some communities due to concerns about the possible intentional or unintentional release of dangerous pathogens public access to scientific information policies to provide access to scientific and technical information that protect the nation against terrorist attacks require balancing issues of national security scientific communication and constitutional and statutory protections that permit public access to information used for accountability and oversight historically the us government has used classification procedures to protect scientific and technical information that might compromise national security fundamental scientific information whose release does not compromise security is to remain unclassified pursuant to executive order 12958 and national security decision directive 189 after the 2001 terrorist attacks the government widened controls on access to information and scientific components policies are being implemented to control access to federally owned information labeled sensitive but unclassified sbu or sensitive homeland security information shsi this includes information that agencies previously posted on websites or made available upon request consideration is being given to preventing publication of some nonfederally owned scientific and technical information some critics say that criteria for identifying sbu information have not been defined clearly causing inconsistency among agencies and complicating the design and implementation of policies to access and safeguard such information white house directives and federal agencies have used the term sbu in various ways to label and control information some agencies refer to definitions for controlled information such as for sensitive found in the computer security act or to crs14 information exempt from disclosure through the freedom of information act foia or the privacy act those laws gave agencies some discretion and permitted use of risk analysis to identify information to be safeguarded pursuant to the federal information security management act of 2002 fisma the national institute of standards and technology nist has developed guidance for agencies to identify and use riskbased criteria to control access to unclassified including sensitive information and information systems these were to become mandatory in december 2005 but many agencies do not appear to have developed policies and procedures responsive to nists guidance pl 107296 the homeland security act requires the president to prescribe and implement procedures for agencies to identify and safeguard sensitive but unclassified homeland security information secs 891 and 892 omb had planned to issue related guidance in 2003 on july 29 2003 in executive order 13311 the president delegated his responsibility for preparing such guidance to the dhs secretary guidance has not been issued as of august 2006 on december 16 2005 the president instructed federal agencies by memorandum to standardize procedures to designate mark and handle sbu information and to forward recommendations for governmentwide standards to the director of national intelligence dni governmentwide policy is to be developed by december 2006 in 2004 dhs promulgated rules for safeguarding its own sensitive unclassified information and that provided to it by other agencies and nongovernmental entities issues of possible interest to congress include whether agencies which have some discretion to identify sbu are using uniform criteria to identify such information to control it and to permit access to it while protecting information that should be withheld design of an appeals process since the information is not classified assessment of the pros and cons of wider sbu controls in relation to accountability and possible classification of federallyowned basic research information since heads of some agencies performing basic research were given original classification authority legislation has been introduced on these issues and the government accountability office is taking inventory of the sbu procedures used by federal agencies the federal government has traditionally supported the open publication of federally funded extramural research results conducted by nongovernmental scientists in cases where release of fundamental research results might compromise national security eg atomic energy and cryptography research federal policy prescribes the use of classification to limit dissemination series of research publications have increased concern whether publication of some federally funded extramural research results could threaten national security as result some have suggested that such research results should be reviewed for security implications before publication while others say that such review would damage scientific progress and productivity most scientists and publishers have implemented some voluntary selfregulatory measures regarding publication of potentially sensitive manuscripts but these efforts may not be considered stringent enough the department of health and human services following select recommendations presented by the national academies report biotechnology research in an age of terrorism established the national science advisory board for biosecurity to provide guidance for the identification of research that may require special security attention the controls designed by professional groups undoubtedly will be guided by federal policy as it develops crs15 for further information crs report rl31695 balancing scientific publication and national security concerns issues for congress crs report rl33303 sensitive but unclassified information and other controls policy and options for scientific and technical information crs report rl33342 oversight of dualuse biological research the national science advisory board for biosecurity information technology management for the department of homeland security one of the biggest challenges facing the department of homeland security dhs is the ongoing effort to consolidate the computer and communications systems of the 22 agencies that comprise the department in many respects dhs functions as virtual department connecting new and existing agencies into network that capitalizes on their knowledge assets to facilitate information sharing and enhanced communication organizationally this involves breaking down the stovepipes that have previously separated the agencies and developing an encompassing organizational culture that promotes cooperation and information sharing technologically this involves integrating existing systems and infrastructures while simultaneously infusing new technologies as they become available rigorous oversight of these activities is continuing in the 109th congress critical variable that will contribute to the success or failure of these objectives is the development and implementation of an enterprise architecture for the department an enterprise architecture serves as blueprint of the business operations of an organization and the technologies needed to carry out these functions it is designed to be comprehensive and scalable to account for future growth needs as the department moves forward with its enterprise architecture plans it will encounter several issues its enterprise architecture is being used to identify common functions and eliminate redundancies among its component agencies this requires making choices between competing systems and reallocating resources and staff accordingly in doing so dhs will need to improve the interoperability of its systems as well by selecting common data formats equipment and processes this in turn would enable dhs to carry out its information sharing responsibilities as described in the homeland security act and the national intelligence reform act of 2004 since some of these information sharing initiatives involve agencies and organizations at the federal state and local levels as well as agencies within the department additional coordination with these external partners is necessary to ensure the smooth flow of information and compliance with security procedures other oversight issues congress is considering include the authority and influence of the dhs chief information officer cio it funding information security outsourcing and technology development in addition in light of the interrelationships between dhs and other departments the impact of the dhs enterprise architecture on related egovernment initiatives currently underway has also attracted interest crs16 data mining data mining has emerged as one of the key features of many homeland security initiatives and an issue that is attracting strong congressional oversight data mining involves the use of data analysis tools to discover previously unknown valid patterns and relationships in large data sets in the context of homeland security data mining is often viewed as potential means to identify terrorist activities such as money transfers and communications and to identify and track individual terrorists themselves such as through travel and immigration records data mining is carried out in both the private and public sectors some common uses include detecting fraud assessing risk and measuring and improving program performance while data mining represents substantial advance in the type of analytical tools currently available some of the homeland security data mining applications represent significant expansion in the quantity and scope of data to be analyzed compared to earlier efforts since september 2001 there have been number of initiatives to use data mining to identify potential terrorists andor terroristrelated activities that have attracted high level of congressional interest some of these initiatives include darpas total information awareness tia program and the us armys able danger project both of which are reported to have been discontinued and the proposed computer assisted passenger prescreening system ii capps ii project which is being replaced by the secure flight passenger screening program administered by the transportation security administration most recently some members of congress have called for broader congressional review of domestic data mining activities following the public revelation of reported ongoing data collection and sharing activities being carried out by the national security agency nsa in an attempt to identify potential foreign terrorists who may be in the united states legislation has been introduced to clarify and reinforce the role of the foreign intelligence surveillance court to approve electronic surveillance of united states persons for foreign intelligence purposes while technological capabilities are important there are other implementation and oversight issues that can influence the success of data mining projects outcome one issue is data quality which refers to the accuracy and completeness of the data being analyzed second issue is the interoperability of the data mining software and databases being used by different agencies interoperability is critical part of the larger efforts to improve interagency collaboration and information sharing through egovernment and homeland security initiatives third issue is privacy questions being considered include the degree to which government agencies should use and mix commercial data with government data whether data sources are being used for purposes other than those for which they were originally designed and applicability of the 1974 privacy act to these initiatives for further information crs report rl31798 data mining and homeland security an overview crs17 technology development issues technological innovation and the economy impact of federal rd funding technological advancement is an important factor in the nations economic growth experts widely accept that technical progress is responsible for up to one half the growth of the us economy and is one principal driving force for increases in our standard of living historically industrial expansion was based on the use of technology to exploit natural resources today such growth tends to be founded on scientific discoveries and engineering knowledge and is even more dependent than before on the development and use of technology technology can drive the economy because it contributes to the creation of new goods and services new industries new jobs and new capital it can expand the range of services offered and extend the geographic distribution of those services the application of technologies also can contribute to the resolution of those national problems that are amenable to technological solutions technological progress is achieved through innovation the process by which industry provides new and improved products manufacturing processes and services research and development are important to this technological advancement in many ways rd contributes to economic growth by its impact on productivity generally productivity growth in an industry or firm is related to the amount spent previously on rd in that industry or company analysts estimate that onehalf of productivity increases output per person are the result of investments in research and development see crs report rl32324 others argue that innovations arising from rd are the most important ones profound changes in our society have been brought about by advances in research resulting in new products and processes in the areas of medicine semiconductors computers and materials just to name few traditionally the government funds rd to meet the mission requirements of the federal departments and agencies the government also supports work in areas where there is an identified need for research primarily basic research not being performed in the private sector basic research that work undertaken to gain knowledge and understanding of the fundamental aspects of nature is the foundation of many important new innovations however the payoff for basic research is generally long in coming the results may be unmarketable and the rewards often diffused among many users yet while basic research is usually performed with little certainty that it will produce goods and services in the future it appears that there is significant relationship between the conduct of basic research and increases in productivity federal funding reflects consensus that while basic research is important for innovation the rate of return to society as whole generated by investments in this activity is significantly larger than the benefits that can be captured by any one firm performing it it is estimated that the social rate of return on rd spending is over twice that of the rate of return to the inventor ideas often can be easily imitated the knowledge associated with an innovation dispersed and adapted to other products and crs18 processes this it is argued often leads to underinvestment in research by the private sector and thus the need for federal funding expert analysis has shown the importance of federally funded rd to advancements in innovation see crs report rl32076 studies undertaken by economists in the field demonstrate that collaboration with publicly funded research organizations increased private sector productivity in many industries findings that parallel additional work showing the importance of public science to innovation and technological advancement across industrial sectors this federal rd stimulates the additional and often substantial private investment necessary to bring new and improved technologies to the marketplace in the united states the development of new products processes and services for the commercial marketplace is primarily private sector activity the government generally becomes involved only for certain limited purposes including activities that typically have been determined to be necessary for the national good but which cannot or will not be supported by industry however government plays role in structuring the environment in which business decisions are made and thereby influences private sector behavior direct federal funding and the existence of government markets for certain technologies including defense and information technologyrelated goods have helped influence resource allocations in the business community the myriad effects of federal research and development spending on innovation and the economic growth generated by technological advancement highlight the importance of

joint ventures between government and industry or between industry and universities as well as among companies to date congress has determined that providing title to inventions made under federal funding to contractors andor collaborating parties should be used to support innovation in return for patent ownership congress has crs19 accepted as satisfactory the anticipated payback to the country through goods and services to improve our health welfare and standard of living these benefits have been considered more important than the initial cost of the technology to the government or any potential unfair advantage of one company over another in cooperative venture as such cooperative efforts become more widespread new and additional issues have emerged concerns have been expressed regarding the cost of drugs developed in part with federal funding or in conjunction with federal agencies conflicts have surfaced over federal laboratories patenting inventions that collaborating

administered by the national institute of standards and technology nist laboratory of the department of commerce this activity has been targeted for elimination as means to cut federal spending critics argue that rd aimed at the commercial marketplace should be funded by the private sector not by the federal government others stress that atp is market driven and that investments in research are shared by industry and the public sector crs20 beginning several years ago the house of representatives attempted to terminate atp but strong support provided by the senate prior to the fy2007 budget led to continued funding however for the first time the senate committee on appropriations reported out bill fy2007 science state commerce justice and related agencies appropriations act that did not contain funding for atp the bush administration also proposed eliminating the program in its fy2002 fy2004 fy2005 fy2006 and fy2007 budget requests these actions have renewed the debate over the role of the federal government in promoting commercial technology development in arguing for less direct federal involvement opponents of the advanced technology program believe that the market is superior to government in deciding which technologies are worthy of investment they prefer mechanisms that enhance the markets opportunities and abilities to make such choices it is also suggested that agency discretion in selecting one technology over another can lead to political intrusion and industry dependency on the other hand supporters of direct methods maintain that reliance on indirect measures can be wasteful inefficient and ineffective and can compromise other goals of public policy in the hope of stimulating innovative performance proponents of atp argue that it is important to put the nations scarce resources to work on those technologies which will have the greatest promise as determined by industry and supported by the private sectors willingness to match federal funding they assert that the government serves as catalyst for companies to cooperate and undertake important new work which would not be possible without federal participation as congress

and federal rd congressional interest in methods to provide prescription drugs at lower cost particularly for the elderly has focused attention on achieving balance between the publics interest in new and improved technologies and concern over providing companies valuable benefits without adequate accountability or compensation the federal government has various programs and policies facilitating the development of pharmaceuticals and their availability in the marketplace several laws including the stevensonwydler technology innovation act and the bayhdole act encourage commercialization of federallyfunded rd through technology transfer cooperative rd and intellectual property rights particularly patent ownership these laws are intended to stimulate the private sector investment often necessary to develop marketable products utilizing the results of the governments research enterprise congress also has acted to encourage the development of lower cost generic drugs through the hatchwaxman act this 1984 law made several significant changes to the patent laws as they apply to pharmaceutical products in an attempt to stimulate the search for innovative new drugs while providing less expensive generic crs21 products as result of this legislation generics generally are rapidly available after patent expiration and at lower prices than their brand name predecessors concurrently given the increasing investment in pharmaceutical rd and the gains in research intensity of the pharmaceutical industry it appears that on balance the act has not deterred the search for or the development of new drugs however title xi of the medicare prescription drug and modernization act of 2003 pl 108173 modified the hatchwaxman act as it pertained to the listing of pharmaceutical patents in the orange book maintained by the food and drug administration patent challenges by generic firms and the award of market exclusivity among other things it remains to be seen how these provisions affect the availability and cost of prescription drugs concerns have been expressed by members of congress over whether the current legislative approach to encouraging innovation particularly with respect to drug discovery is appropriate in the debate some argue that the governments financial scientific andor clinical support of biomedical rd entitles the public to commensurate considerations in the prices charged for any resulting drugs others view government intervention in price decisions based upon initial federal rd funding as contrary to longterm trend of government promotion of innovation technological advancement and the commercialization of technology by the business community supporters of existing incentives for technology development argue that they have given rise to robust pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries critics maintain that the need for such incentives in the pharmaceutical andor biotechnology sectors is mitigated by industry access to governmentsupported work at cost monopoly power through patent protection and additional regulatory and tax advantages such as those conveyed through the hatchwaxman act at issue is which

represented the first major rewrite of our nations telecommunications policy the 1996 act redefined and recast the 1934 communications act to address the emergence of competition in what were

deployed nationwide primarily by the private sector while president bush has set goal of universal broadband availability by 2007 some areas of the nation particularly rural and lowincome communities continue to lack full access to highspeed broadband internet service in order to address this problem the 109th congress is considering the scope and effect of federal broadband financial assistance programs including universal service and the impact of telecommunications regulation and new technologies on broadband deployment some policymakers believing that disparities in broadband access across american society could have adverse economic and social consequences on those left crs23 behind assert that the federal government should play more active role to avoid digital divide in broadband access one approach is for the federal government to provide financial assistance to support broadband deployment in underserved areas others however question the reality of the digital divide and argue that federal intervention in the broadband marketplace would be premature and in some cases counterproductive another issue under examination is whether present laws and subsequent regulatory policies are needed to ensure the development of competition and its subsequent consumer benefits or conversely whether such laws and regulations are overly burdensome and discourage needed investment in and deployment of broadband services what if any role regulators should play to ensure the internet remains open to all often referred to as open access requirements or net neutrality is

internet and the usa patriot act potential implications for electronic privacy security commerce and government open source software open source software refers to computer program whose source code or programming instructions is made available to the general public to be improved or modified as the user wishes in contrast closed source or proprietary programs which comprise the majority of the software products most commonly used are those whose source code is not made available and can only be altered by the software manufacturer some examples of open source software include the linux operating system and apache web server software the use of open source software by the federal government has been gaining attention as organizations continue to search for opportunities to enhance their information technology it operations while containing costs for the federal government and congress discussion over the use of open source software intersects several other issues including but not limited to the development of homeland security and egovernment initiatives improving government information technology management practices strengthening computer security and protecting intellectual property rights in the 109th congress the discussion over open source software revolves primarily around information security and intellectual property rights however issues related to cost and quality are also of interest for proponents open source software is often viewed as means to reduce an organizations dependence on the software products of few companies while possibly improving the security and stability of ones computing infrastructure for critics open source software is often viewed as threat to intellectual property rights with unproven cost and quality benefits so far there appear to be systematic analyses available that have conclusively assessed security issues for closed source versus open source software in practice computer security is highly dependent on how an application is configured maintained and monitored similarly the costs of crs28 implementing an open source solution are dependent upon factors such as the cost of acquiring the hardwaresoftware investments in training for it personnel and end users maintenance and support costs and the resources required to convert data and applications to work in the new computing environment consequently some computer experts suggest that it is not possible to conclude that either open source or closed source software is inherently more secure or more cost efficient the growing emphasis on improved information security and critical infrastructure protection overall will likely be an influential factor in future decisions on whether to implement open source solutions the rapidly changing computer environment may also foster the use of combination of open source and closed source applications rather than creating need to choose one option at the exclusion of another for further information crs report rl31627 computer software and open source issues primer wireless privacy internet privacy and spyware wireless telecommunications devices are ubiquitous some consumers already deluged with unwanted commercial messages spam via computers that access the internet by traditional wireline connections are concerned that such unsolicited advertising is expanding to wireless communications further eroding their privacy another concern is that their cell phone numbers may soon become public because some of the wireless service providers are creating wireless 411 phone directory whether the service providers should be legally required to obtain customers consent before including their phone numbers in the directory or if the service providers should be allowed to charge customers fee if they want an unlisted number is currently being debated in addition some cell phone records including phone numbers dialed and the callers location are being sold on the internet raising questions as to whether telephone companies are adequately safeguarding cell phone records internet privacy issues encompass range of concerns one is the monitoring of electronic mail email and web usage by law enforcement officials or employers in the wake of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks debate over the issue of monitoring of email and web usage by law enforcement and government officials has intensified with some advocating increased tools for law enforcement to track down terrorists and others cautioning that fundamental tenets of democracy such as privacy not be endangered in that pursuit the usa patriot act pl 10756 makes it easier for government and law enforcement officials to monitor internet activities and for internet service providers to voluntarily disclose the content of mails under certain conditions another internet privacy issue spyware is also focus of congressional concern there is firm definition of spyware but one example is software products that include method by which information is collected about the use of the computer on which the software is installed and the user when the computer is connected to the internet the software periodically relays the information back to the crs29 software manufacturer or marketing company some spyware traces users web activity and causes advertisements to suddenly appear on the users monitor called popup ads in response typically users have knowledge that the software they obtained included spyware and that it is now resident on their computers congress is debating what

concerned about the possible vulnerability of us coastal areas to tsunamis and about the adequacy of early warning for coastal areas of the far pacific possessions and western atlantic ocean these concerns stem from the december 26 2004 tsunami that devastated many coastal areas around the northern indian ocean where few tsunami early warning systems were operating other lawmakers have questioned whether the risk for major tsunami affecting the united states justifies such expenditures however on february 14 2005 the bush administration committed 30 million over two fiscal years to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national weather service nws in the department of commerce to upgrade us tsunami warning capabilities the nws is working toward expanded coverage for the pacific ocean and the us atlantic seaboard as well as the carribean sea and gulf of mexico the fy2005 emergency appropriations act pl 10913 provided emergency supplemental appropriations of 243 million to initiate that effort in december 2005 president bush released report tsunami risk reduction for the united states framework for action prepared by the national science and technology council this report outlines necessary actions to be taken to reduce tsunami risk domestically and in us territories in the far pacific ocean and carribean sea by april 17 2006 five new tsunami detection buoys and additional coastal tidalgages had been deployed in the atlantic basin and are capable of warning populations on the us east coast and in caribbean sea and gulf of mexico of an impending tsunami also of benefit to the united states telecommunications enhancements were funded in pl 10913 to enhance the real time distribution of information associated with global seismic network gsn detection of underwater earthquakes which in certain cases may generate tsunamis congress funded the us geological survey to upgrade the gsn with realtime crs30 communication capabilities for fy2007 president bush has requested 124 million to procure the remainder of tsunami detection buoys for the nwss national tsunami warning program which would be deployed in the far pacific ocean to protect us territories there the request would culminate the administrations revised commitment of 40 million toward that goal part of the funding is intended for longterm operation and maintenance of the tsunami early detection system periodic testing and emergency drills have been conducted since to evaluate the expanded network some other developed nations currently have the technological capacity to build similar warning networks in other regions of the globe and some have long established advanced emergency management capabilities however other nations will have to rely on an international consolidation of resources and expertise to 1 develop local tsunami warning capacity 2 educate indigenous people and visitors about such disasters and 3 learn to employ strategies for adapting to such risks the development of global environmental observation system of systems geoss by noaa and its system architecture is how the united states plans to contribute to global tsunami warning challenges noaa is the lead agency for us involvement in the 61nation geoss program working through the inter governmental oceanographic commission ioc substantial progress has been made in developing international tsunami early warning networks of the caliber afforded to the united states for further information crs report rl32739 tsunamis monitoring detection and early warning systems crs report rs22410 the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa budget for fy2007 presidents request congressional appropriations and related issues technology for warning systems and alerts as was demonstrated on september 11 2001 after the southeast asian tsunami on december 26 2004 and again when hurricane katrina struck the gulf coast in august 2005 the ability to provide effective communications before and after disaster is critical factor in saving lives today the two major alert systems in the united stares are the emergency alert system eas and the noaa weather radio nwr allhazards network noaa is the national oceanic and atmospheric administration an agency of the department of commerce the eas is jointly administered by the federal communications commission and the federal emergency management agency fema it depends on radio and television broadcasters as well as most cable operators to provide information in times of emergency widely used for local warnings about weather and other emergencies eas has never been activated for national emergency the other mainstay for emergency alerts is provided through the national weather service nws of noaa nws sends alerts through the nwr allhazards network noaa continues to expand its weather alert system to include warnings for all hazards and is working to expand the network to include all types of media several initiatives are underway within the federal government to improve expand and integrate crs31 existing warning systems an important one in terms of using testing and developing leadingedge technology is the integrated public alert and warning system ipaws publicprivate partnership in which the department of homeland security dhs has leadership role among the technologies proposed or being tested to expand broadcast capabilities for emergency alerts are equipping cell phones with noaa weather radio receivers developing data casting for digital broadcasting and using cell phone broadcasting technology data casting is oneway broadcast transmission using internet protocols the broadcasts can carry voice and data including videos graphics and text messages in an ipaws pilot testing digital technologies data casting is being broadcast to digital televisions and antennae linked to computer networks or directly to computers and laptops some advanced wireless phones and other portable devices can receive digital tv broadcasts as is being demonstrated in several pilots some countries are advocating the use of cell broadcasting to send alerts to cell phones based on location the netherlands for example requires cell operators to transmit government warnings with cell broadcasts of text messages satellite radio could also become part of the new era of digital signal alert systems xm satellite radio will broadcast emergency alerts to the dc region through link with the alert system of arlington county virginia the convergence of communications technology typified by the nearubiquity of the internet and the wide availability of advanced wireless telephony presages world of endtoend communications for public safety communications including warning systems the 911 commission commented on the often inadequate response of the 911 call centers serving new york city and suggested that 911 call centers be integrated into the emergency response team in order to involve them in providing uptodate information and assistance to the public in bill enacted in december 2004 congress created an e911 implementation coordination office to

as pl 106256 earlier in 2000 the pew oceans commission an independent group was established and funded by the pew charitable trusts to conduct national dialogue on the policies needed to restore and protect living marine resources in us waters the pew commission released its final report in june 2003 americas living oceans charting course for sea change with 26 recommendations that outlined national agenda for protecting and restoring our oceans bearing the official title an ocean blueprint for the 21st century the us crs32 commissions final report with 212 recommendations on coordinated and comprehensive national ocean policy was delivered to the president and congress on september 20 2004 those reports covered an array of issues such as law of the sea see convention on the law of the sea below national and regional governance federal organization regulation and enforcement offshore management regimes funding for sound science and research and for implementing commission recommendations oceanic education coastal and watershed management and ecosystembased management the same law that created the us commission pl 106256 also required the president to submit to congress statement responding to the commissions recommendations for national policy on ocean and coastal resources that statement us ocean action plan was delivered to capitol hill on december 17 2004 but it was largely limited to documenting current efforts many in the ocean community viewed the administrations response as limited and are seeking more extensive action through congress in the current congress thus far committees of relevant jurisdiction have adhered to their own ocean action agendas guided in large part by the pew and us commission reports and have shown little interest in holding hearings to assess the administrations statement in considering legislative responses to the findings and recommendations of those two ocean policy reports the 109th congress is addressing specific legislation relating to ocean exploration ocean and coastal observing systems marine debris research prevention and reduction federal organization and administrative structure and ocean and coastal mapping integration comprehensive bills encompassing an broad array of crosscutting concerns also are under consideration however joint ocean commission initiative established in september 2005 and made up of former members of both the pew commission and the us commission has criticized the lack of progress made by congress the administration states and nongovernmental stakeholders in addressing hundreds of the commissions recommendations and in implementing new measures the february 2006 release of that assessment us ocean policy report card was timed to accompany the roll out of the presidents fy2007 budget the report card highlights where additional efforts are necessary and where opportunities for improvements exist more information about the joint ocean commission initiative

change congress has maintained an active and continuing interest in the implications of and the issues associated with possible global climate change for the united states having received the required number of ratifications the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change entered into force on february 16 2005 establishing binding commitments for reductions in greenhouse gases the united states signed the protocol but thenpresident clinton did not submit it to the senate for ratification in march 2001 the bush administration indicated its opposition to the kyoto protocol and essentially rejected it citing possible harm to the us economy and lack of developing country participation crs33 on february 14 2002 president bush announced us policy framework for global climate change outlining climate change research initiative ccri and national climate change technology initiative nccti along with new cabinetlevel committee on climate change science and technology integration to oversee their implementation the ccri and the nccti focus on shortterm policy relevant objectives of climate change science and climate change technology applications respectively previously established us global change research program usgcrp supports longterm fundamental scientific research objectives and climate change technology program cctp supports the federal governments broader portfolio of climate change technology rd both the new ccri and the existing usgcrp were combined for the first time into the climate change science program ccsp in the fy2004 budget the fy2007 budget requested total spending level of 1717 billion for research managed by the ccsp which was 4 million 02 above the fy2006 funding estimate of 1713 billion included in the 1717 billion ccsp funds were 200 million for the ccri while funding for the embedded ccri experienced growth over two fiscal years from fy2003 to fy2005 the fy2007 funding request for ccri at 200 million was level with the fy2006 funding estimate of 200 million that left the fy2007 funding requested for the embedded usgcrp standing at 1517 billion which was 4 million 03 above the fy2006 funding estimate of 1513 billion some 298 billion was in the requested fy2007 funding profile for technology research and development in the climate change technology programcctp and its embedded

program technology options for the near and long term 2005 and us climate change technology program vision and framework for strategy and planning 2005 release by the cctp of the completed and final strategic plan on climate change technology is expected later on in 2006 two issues of concern for congress are the extent to which spending for the ccri and cctp represent new money versus how much is attributable to the reclassification of ongoing research and technology programs and whether the overall reduced level of funding may be deemed necessary or sufficient to accomplish the work of the ccsp and the cctp discourse in congress over the prospect of global warming and what the united states could or should do about it has yielded over the last several years range of legislative proposals arguments have been presented that policy actions to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases should be taken now in line with the intent of the kyoto protocol alternative arguments have called for delay citing challenging issues that were regionally complex politically delicate and scientifically uncertain the need to expand technological options for mitigating or adapting to the effects of any climate change and the associated high cost of certain mitigation schemes that would prematurely replace existing capital stock before the end of its

fuel and fuel cells for transportation and stationary applications and would complement the existing freedomcar initiative which focuses research on the development of advanced technologies for passenger vehicles for fy2004 congress approved an increase of approximately 82 million for the initiatives for fy2005 congress approved an additional 39 million above fy2004 in fy2006 energy and

alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles issues in congress reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel spent fuel from commercial nuclear reactors contains plutonium produced during reactor operations and most of its original uranium fundamental issue in nuclear policy is whether spent fuel should be reprocessed to extract plutonium and uranium for new reactor fuel or directly disposed of without reprocessing proponents of nuclear power point out that spent fuel still contains substantial energy that reprocessing could recover however reprocessed plutonium can also be used in nuclear weapons so federal support for reprocessing could undermine us nuclear nonproliferation policies contend groups concerned about weapons proliferation in the 1950s and 1960s the federal government expected that all commercial spent fuel would be reprocessed even though commercial light water reactors the type still in use today produced relatively little plutonium the federal strategy called for replacing light water reactors with breeder reactors that would convert uranium into enough plutonium to fuel new commercial breeder reactors indefinitely increased concern about weapons proliferation in the 1970s and the slowerthan projected growth of nuclear power prompted president carter to halt commercial reprocessing efforts in 1977 along with federal demonstration breeder project president reagan restarted the breeder demonstration project but congress halted project funding in 1983 while continuing to fund breederrelated research and development in an advanced liquid metal reactor or the integral fast reactor to address proliferation concerns this program would have used electrometallurgical reprocessing to only partially separate plutonium and uranium congress stopped funding breederreactor development in 1993 and reduced appropriations for reprocessing research the bush administrations 2001 national energy policy called for renewing federal support for reprocessing or recycling through the advanced fuel cycle initiative afci in the department of energy doe the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 sec 953 calls for afci to evaluate proliferationresistant fuel recycling and transmutation technologies as an alternative to previously developed reprocessing technologies this program also supports the evaluation of alternative national strategies for spent nuclear fuel and generation iv advanced reactor concepts the presidents fy2006 budget request of 700 million for afci in fy2006 was increased 10 million by congress pl 109103 to accelerate the design activities associated with proposed engineering scale demonstration crs36 the administrations global nuclear energy partnership gnep announced in february 2006 would encourage the use of nuclear energy among developing nations under the condition that they return all spent nuclear fuel to supplier nations for reprocessing the administration requested 250 million for gnep for fy2007 with all but 7 million for program direction aimed at afci the house cut afci to 120 million but the senate appropriations committee voted to give the program 36 million increase

project is an international scientific collaboration to construct facility for fusion energy research the international partners are china the european union india joined december 2005 japan russia south korea and the united states longrunning disagreement over where to build the facility was resolved in june 2005 with the selection of site in cadarache france in preference to site in japan the united states initially supported the japanese site in 1998 the united states withdrew from the design phase of iter at congressional direction largely because of concerns about cost and scope the project has since been restructured and in january 2003 the administration announced its intention to reenter the project the us share of the cost of building iter about 91 is expected to be about 11 billion through fy2014 once construction is complete the us share of the cost of operating iter is expected to be about an additional 58 million per year for the current status of fy2007 funding for iter see crs report rl33346 energy and water development fy2007 appropriations key issues in the 109th congress are the cost of us participation and the budget impact of iter on the rest of the us

almost twenty agencies 2004 report by the national research council nrc confronting the nations water problems the role of research called for commitment to water resources research to address the nations water problems and suggested central role for federal research in informing water resources issues in particular the report promoted both federallyfunded research on water use and institutions and more coordinated federal water research agenda real levels of spending on water research have remained relatively constant at 700 million in 2000 dollars annually since the mid1970s although the overall level is constant funding declined for some specific research categories including crs37 the water supply augmentation and conservation water quality management and protection water resources planning and institutions and water resource data in contrast aquatic ecosystem research has increased substantially growing demands on developed water supplies has increased interest in water supply technologies and desalination in particular desalination the process of removing dissolved solids primarily dissolved salts and other minerals from water has become an increasingly attractive water supply option as the cost of the dominant technology in the nation reverse osmosis has fallen and the pressure to develop new water supplies has grown opportunities for using desalination are greatest for meeting water demands for coastal communities that can desalinate seawater or estuarine water interior communities above brackish groundwater aquifers and communities with contaminated water supplies desalinations attraction is that it can create new source of freshwater from otherwise unusable waters and more predictable source than freshwater supplies that rely more directly on annual or multiyear precipitation runoff and recharge rates the bush administration has expressed support for current desalination research efforts aimed at reducing costs while criticizing bills seeking financial support for specific desalination facilities proposed legislation and enacted appropriations in the 109th congress have aimed to reverse the declining trend in federal research funds for desalination and other water supply technologies according to the 2004 nrc report water supply augmentation and conservation research by federal agencies totaled 145 million in fy2000 in the past the federal government invested more in this area in the late 1960s federal research in desalination and other saline water conversion activities exceeded 100 million in 2000 dollars annually increasing federal funding for desalination research raises questions such as what should be the respective roles of federal agencies academic institutions and the private sector in conducting research and commercializing the results and should federal research be focused on basic research or promoting the use of technologies biomedicine issues national institutes of health nih budget organization and management issues the national institutes of health nih the primary medical research agency of the federal government is facing challenges in number of areas that may interest the congress in the budgetary arena the past three years have been time of rapid transition from period of marked growth in the nih appropriation to the current climate of restrained domestic discretionary spending over fiveyear period congress doubled the nih budget from 136 billion in fy1998 to 271 billion in fy2003 after fy2003 growth slowed to below the rate of inflation and the final fy2006 appropriation represented drop in funding for the first time since fy1970 the fy2007 request was for level budget at 285 billion house and senate appropriators have proposed changing the amount only slightly crs38 since the doubling the extramural research community has expressed its concerns about the lack of growth in the nih budget asserting that sustained funding is necessary to maintain support of research grants keep young investigators in the pipeline and capitalize on the momentum of discoveries in both basic and applied research nihs fy2006 grant funding policies involved cutbacks in grant budgets and in numbers of grants tight competition for new awards and possible postponement of some large projects previously anticipated including clinical trials prospects for fy2007 are similar advocates warn that research advances on the major chronic conditions that burden our society such as heart disease cancer stroke and diabetes may be slowed other commentators advise that coping with the reality of budget constraints will require nih and the research community to rethink some of their traditional approaches to planning and organizing research the resources of the doubling years have spurred development of unifying concepts of fundamental biology and understanding of disease processes that formerly were thought to be unrelated scientific leaders in and out of nih urge critical examination of the best ways to transform knowledge into medical applications and allocate resources into the most critical priorities for return on the publics investment key factor in such rethinking is consideration of nihs organizational structure which has expanded markedly over time along with the growth in the budget the agency consists of 27 semiautonomous institutes and centers loosely coordinated by the central office of the director as new entities have been created by congress each with its own mission budget staff review office and other bureaucratic apparatus the costs and complexities of administering the enterprise have multiplied further nih wishes to emphasize culture of interdisciplinary teamwork but many observers fear that the present structure of multiple independently operated institutes may undermine important initiatives in cross disciplinary research especially in fields such as neurosciences to address these issues nih has been increasingly emphasizing an effort termed the nih roadmap for medical research httpnihroadmapnihgov launched in september 2003 the roadmap has identified critical scientific gaps that may be constraining rapid progress in biomedical research and which one institute can tackle alone nih wide priorities and initiatives have been developed in three broad areas focusing on new paths to biological discoveries more interdisciplinary research and improving clinical research congress has been supportive of the goals of the roadmap and of nihs efforts to improve the management of its research portfolio including creation of new office to concentrate on cuttingedge transinstitute research the office of portfolio analysis and strategic initiatives httpopasinihgov the last major reauthorization of nih was in 1993 although number of laws focusing on individual nihrelated topics have amended the public health service act since then oversight hearings and discussions on draft reauthorization bill have considered questions such as nihs stewardship of its resources the relative roles of the nih director and the institutes and the optimum alignment of budgetary accounts organizational structure and statutory authority possible proposals for change include giving the nih directors office more planning involvement and budgetary control over crossinstitute research initiatives grouping the institutes and centers differently for authorizations andor appropriations and for the first time setting overall authorization levels for nih some other areas of concern which crs39 congress might consider include improving public reporting of research results enhancing public access to scientific journal articles and exploring ways to shorten the process for young researchers to become independent investigators nih has taken steps to address each of these issues an ongoing oversight issue is nihs implementation of new conflictofinterest regulations depending on the level of their positions nih scientists and other employees are subject to restrictions on their financial holdings and their ability to consult with industry and outside interests and colleagues questions have been raised about the impact of the ethics regulations on recruitment and retention of employees for further information crs report rl33345 federal research and development funding fy2007 crs report rl33695 the national institutes of health organization funding and congressional issues human cloning and embryonic stem cell research embryonic stem cells have the ability to develop into virtually any cell in the body and may have the potential to treat medical conditions such as diabetes and parkinsons disease human embryonic stem cells are derived from very early embryos 5daysold that were created by in vitro fertilization ivf either for infertility treatment or for research purposes work on human embryonic stem cells is controversial as some oppose such research because the process of removing the stem cells destroys the embryo another potential source of embryonic stem cells involves cloning the nucleus of an egg is removed and replaced by the nucleus from mature body cell such as skin cell the cell created via cloning is allowed to develop for five days and then the stem cells are removed stem cells derived from cloned embryos may offer the best hope for understanding and treating disease although south korean scientists had announced the creation of cloned human embryos and isolation of human stem cells from cloned embryos an investigation in december 2005 found that the results had been fabricated major setback for the field these developments and the unsubstantiated announcement by clonaid in december 2002 of the birth of cloned child have contributed to the controversy over research on human embryos one impediment to human stem cell research is the dickey amendment which has been added to each labor hhs and education appropriations act from fy1997 through fy2006 it prohibits hhs from using appropriated funds for the creation of human embryos for research purposes or for research in which human embryos are destroyed as result federal funds cannot be used for most forms of human embryo research including the isolation of new stem cell lines or the cloning of human embryos for any purpose in august 2001 president bush announced that for the first time federal funds would be used to support research on human embryonic stem cells but funding would be limited to existing stem cell lines the national institutes of health crs40 nih has established the human embryonic stem cell registry which lists stem cell lines eligible for use in federally funded research although 78 embryonic stem cell lines are listed only 22 are currently available subsequently the debate has centered on whether the number of cell lines allowed under the bush policy are sufficient to permit us research to remain internationally competitive in this very important new technology scientists are concerned about the quality longevity and availability of the 22 stem cell lines for variety of reasons many believe research advancement requires new embryonic stem cell lines the bush administration established the presidents council on bioethics in november 2001 to consider all of the medical and ethical ramifications of biomedical innovation in july 2002 the council released its report on human cloning which unanimously recommended ban on reproductive cloning and by vote of 10 to 7 fouryear moratorium on cloning for medical research purposes the council released second report on the issue monitoring stem cell research in january 2004 in may 2005 the house passed hr 810 castle which would allow federal support of research that utilizes human embryonic stem cells regardless of the date on which the stem cells were derived from human embryo thus negating the current policy that limits funding to stem cell lines in existence as of august 2001 only excess ivf embryos that the individuals seeking fertility treatments have determined will not be implanted and will be discarded are eligible for stem cell derivation written consent is required in july 2006 the senate passed hr 810 along with two other bills s 2754 which requires the development of alternatives to embryonic stem cells and s 3405 which addresses the use of tissue from later stage embryo or fetus the house passed s 3405 but did not pass s 2754 president bush vetoed hr 810 the first veto of his presidency and signed s 3405 an attempt in the house to override the veto of hr 810 was unsuccessful action on hr 1357 weldon which passed the house in the 107th and 108th congresses but stalled in the senate is also possible the bill bans the process of cloning as well as the importation of any product derived from an embryo created via cloning it bans not only reproductive applications but also research on therapeutic uses which has implications for stem cell research advocates of the legislative ban say that allowing any form of human cloning research to proceed raises serious ethical issues and will inevitably lead to the birth of baby that is human clone critics argue that the measure would curtail medical research and prevent americans from receiving lifesaving treatments created overseas legislation that bans only human reproductive cloning

diseases with genetic component pose significant public health burden with completion of the human genome sequence scientists have turned their focus to elucidating the clinical implications of the sequence information clinical genetic tests are becoming available at rapid rate as evidenced by the fact that some tests have been included in health insurance benefits packages certain components of genetic testing are regulated by the federal government while others are not the national human genome research institute nhgri supports genetic and genomic research investigation into the ethical legal and social implications surrounding genetics research and educational outreach activities in genetics and genomics for hhs in fy2006 nhgris budget was 486 million decrease of 26 million from fy2005 the presidents budget request for nhgri for fy2007 is 4829 million representing further decrease of 31 million issues surrounding genetic discrimination in health insurance and employment and genetic privacy are currently under debate in the 109th congress these include whether health insurance plans should be able to deny enrollment or charge higher premiums to individuals based on the individuals or family members genetic information appropriate privacy protections for genetic information remedies and whether employers should be able to make employment decisions hiring firing promotion based on an employees genetic information on the topic of genetic discrimination the senate unanimously passed the genetic information nondiscrimination act of 2005 s 306 on february 17 2005 companion bill hr 1227 was introduced in the house on march 10 2005 s 306 and hr 1227 are supported by president bush industry health care professionals and consumer groups many key stakeholders are concerned that the information generated by the human genome project which represents significant taxpayer investment cannot be translated into advances in clinical medicine and improved health outcomes without explicit nondiscrimination protections the us chamber of commerce which was previously key opponent of the legislation has modified its position in recognition of the fact that the fear of discrimination is negatively influencing participation in clinical research and utilization of health care services previously the chamber had taken the position that existing federal protections were sufficient to prevent genetic discrimination for further information crs report rl32478 genetic testing scientific background and nondiscrimination legislation crs report rl30006 genetic information legal issues relating to discrimination and privacy crs42 space and aeronautics issues impact of the vision for space exploration on nasas aeronautics and other space activities in january 2004 president bush announced new vision for space exploration that directs nasa to focus its efforts on returning humans to the moon by 2020 and some day sending them to mars and worlds beyond see crs report rs21720 the presidents plan calls for most of the funding for the vision to come from redirecting spending from other nasa activities advocates of aeronautics research space science and earth science worry that funding for their activities will suffer in the fy2006 science state justice commerce appropriations act pl 109108 which funds nasa and the 2005 nasa authorization act pl 109155 congress expressed its support for the vision but stressed that nasa needs to maintain balanced program that includes aeronautics and science the vision also calls for the space shuttle fleet to be retired in 2010 retiring the shuttle without another vehicle to replace it would make the united states dependent on russia to take american crews to and from the international space station iss until the new crew exploration vehicle cev is available later than 2014 according to nasa some argue that the shuttle should be retained until the cev is available while others want to retire it as soon as possible either because of safety concerns or so that its funding can be redirected to other parts of the vision others worry that placing fixed termination date on the shuttle system may create schedule pressure like the pressure that contributed to the february 2003 columbia disaster see crs report rs21408 nasa officials have indicated that nasa plans to complete its use of the iss by 2016 moreover under the original vision the only us research conducted on the iss would be that needed to fulfill the vision by supporting human health and safety in exploring the moon and mars in the 2005 nasa authorization act congress modified this by directing that at least 15 of funding for iss research be used for research not related to the vision nasa spends about 2 billion year on iss in addition to the costs of the shuttle program about 45 billion annually some question whether iss is worth that level of investment considering the modest research objectives that remain nasa is building the iss in partnership with canada japan russia and 10 european countries fulfilling us commitments to those partners may be another rationale for continued us involvement for further

overview fy2007 budget in brief and key issues for congress crs report rl33568 the international space station and the space shuttle crs43 the future of the hubble space telescope two days after the presidents vision speech see above nasa announced that it would not use the space shuttle to conduct further servicing missions to the hubble space telescope see crs report rs21767 thennasa administrator sean okeefe cited shuttle safety concerns as the primary reason for his decision widespread criticism led nasa to explore the possibility of robotic servicing mission but report from the national research council nrc in december 2004 concluded that robotic servicing mission was unlikely to succeed in the time available the nrc recommended proceeding with shuttle servicing mission instead but mr okeefe did not change his mind dr michael griffin who became nasa administrator in april 2005 has stated that he will reassess whether to use the shuttle to service hubble after the shuttle returns to flight status and flies two successful missions in the 2005 nasa authorization act pl109155 congress supported this plan unless such mission would compromise astronaut safety it also required status report on servicing plans within 60 days of the landing of the second successful shuttle flight that second flight landed safely on july 17 2006 meanwhile cost estimates of 1 billion or more have raised questions about the affordability of servicing mission nasa requested full funding for hubble servicing mission in its fy2007 budget even though decision to undertake one had not yet been made for further information crs report rs21767 hubble space telescope should nasa proceed with servicing mission national security space programs the department of defense dod and the intelligence community conduct space program larger in terms of funding than nasa it involves building and launching satellites for communications navigation early warning of missile launches weather intelligence collection and other purposes tracking the overall funding amount for the national security space program is difficult because it is not consolidated into single account according to the dod comptrollers office dod requested 225 billion for space programs in fy2006 dod has not released figure for how much was appropriated fy2007 figures are not yet available number of dod space programs are encountering cost growth and schedule delays including the air forces space based infrared systemhigh for early warning of missile launches the air forces advanced extremely high frequency communications satellite system and the national reconnaissance offices future imagery architecture reconnaissance satellite system dod requests to initiate new programs including the transformational satellite communications satellite program and space radar formerly the spacebased radar program are controversial because of the potentially large costs involved and therefore their
