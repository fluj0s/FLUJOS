necessity defense to the federal law prohibiting cultivation and distribution of marijuana even in states which have created medical marijuana exception to comparable ban under state law congress classified marijuana as schedule i controlled substance classification it reserved for those substances which have currently accepted medical use in the united states theref ore the court concl uded congress could hardly have intended to recognize medical necessity defense for marijuana and recognition of any such defense would be contrary to congress clear intentions the coop raised three constitutional issues in its brief before the court it suggested that federal medical marijuana ban would exceed the reach of congress authority to regulate interstate commerce that such ban would be contrary to the constitutional reservation of powers to the people and that such ban would be contrary to the substantive due process rights of patients who use marijuana for medical reasons the court did not address the constitutional issues suggested in the coops brief because the lower court deci sion under review did not rule upon them other courts have disagreed over whether enforcement of the ban against physicians is contrary to their first amendment right to free speech the courts description of matters within congress legislative authority under the commerce clause in united states v lopez and united states v morrison indicates that the federal ban on the cultivation distribution or possession of marijuana lies within congress prerogativ the court confirmed that congress commerce

justice thomas wrote the opinion for the court justice stevens submitted concurrence in which justices souter and ginsburg joined justice breyer took part in consideration of the case 5 as an initial matter we note that it is an open question whether federal courts ever have authority to recognize necessity defense not pr ovided by statute we need not decide however whether necessity can ever be defense when the federal statute does not expressly provide for it in this case we need only recognize that medical necessity exception for marijuana is at odds with the rms of the controlled substances act the statute to be sure does not explicitly abrogate the defense but its provisions leave doubt that the defense is unavailable 532 us at 49091 6 lest the courts narrow holding be lost in its broad dicta let restate it here w hold that medical necessity is not defense to manufacturing and distributing marijuananecessity exception to its marijuana prohibitions c alhealth safety code ann 1136252 the oakland cannabis buyers cooperative the coop was one of the entities which dispensed marijuana to patients qualified to receive it under state law federal authorities sued to enjoin cultivation and distribution of marijuana in violation of federal law by the coop and its suppliers the federal district court granted preliminary injunction united states v cannabis cultivators club 5 fsupp 2d 1086 ndcal 1998 which the c ourt of appeals overturned for failure to consider an implicit medical necessity defense united states v oakland cannabis buyers cooperative 190 f3d 1109 9th cir 1999 the necessity or choice of evils defense has been recognized by number of other lower federal appellate courts3 the supreme court seemed to verify its vitality at least indirectly when it described the prerequisites for the defense to an escape charge where criminal defendant is charged with escape and claims that he is entitled to an instruction on the theory of duress or necess ity he must proffer evidence of bona fide effort to surrender or return to custody as soon as the claimed necessity has lost its coercive force united states v bailey 444 us 394 415 1980 supreme courts coop decision the coop argued that necessity as common law defense was an implicit exception to the csas prohibitions member of the supreme court agreed 532 us at 4904 in fact majority questioned the very existence of federal necessity defense5 although as the concurring opinion points out the case holds more than that there is necessity defense to the federal proscription on the cultivation or distribution of marijuana6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31100crs3 at 494 emphasis added apart fro m its limited holding the court takes two unwarranted and unfortunate excursions that pr event from joining its opinion first the court reaches beyond its holding by s uggesting that the defense of necessity is unavailable for anyone under the controlled substances act whether the defense might be available to seriously ill patient for whom there is alternative means of avoiding starvation or extraordinary suffering is difficult issue that is not presented here second the court gratuitously casts doubt on whether necessity can ever be defense to any federal statute that does not explicitly provide for it calling such defense into question by misleading reference to its existence as an open question by contrast our precedent has expressed doubt about the viability of the commonlaw defense even in the context of federal criminal statutes th at do not provide for it in so many words see eg united states v bailey 532 us at 499501 stevens j concurring in the judgement 7 under constitutional avoidance where st atute is susceptible of two constructions by one of which grave and doubtful constitutional questions arise and by the other of which such questions are avoided the court will adopt the latter jones v united states 526 us 227 239 1999on the basic point the members of th court were of one mind congress in the csa addressed and rejected the ve ry exception for which the coop sought recognition congress outlawe d manufacturing or distribu ting controlled substances except as authorized in the act 21 usc 841a1 the only authorized exception for schedule i controlled substances such as marijuana is government approved research 21 usc 823f the coop did not argue that it was engaged in government approved research there is other explicit exception for marijuana but the federal necessity defense is creature of common law frequently assumed if rarely cited by name and congress did not reject it by name yet congress did limit schedule i to those controlled substances with currently accepted medical use 21 usc 812b1b it assigned marijuana to schedule i 21 usc 812c thus it is clear from the text of the act that congress has made determination that marijuana has medical benefits worthy of an exception the statute expressly contemplates that many drugs have useful and legitimate medical purpose and are necessary to maintain the health and general welfare of the american people 801a but it includes exception at all for any medical use of marijuana unwilling to view this omissi on as an accident and unable in any event to override legislative determination manifest in statute the court rejected the cooperatives argument 532 u s at 493 the clarity of congresss rejection of medical necessary defense doomed the coops invocation of the constitutional voidance doctrine canon of statutory construction available only in cases of ambiguity id7 the court declined to consider the constitutional issues which might have called for avoidance in the face of an ambiguity because the lower court had not raised them 532 us at

findings and declarations 3 major portion of the traffic in controlled subs tances flows through interstate and foreign commerce incidents of the traffic which are not an integral part of the interstate or foreign flow such as manufacture local distributi on and possession nonetheless have substantial and direct effect upon interstate commerce because after manufacture many controlled substances are transported in in terstate commerce b controlled substances distributed locally usually have been transpor ted in interstate commerce immediately before their distribution and c controlled substan ces possessed commonly flow through interstate commerce immediately prior to such possessi on 4 local distribution and possession of controlled substances contribute to swelling the interstate traffic in such substances 5 controlled substances manufactur ed and distributed intrastate cannot be differentiated from controlled substances manufactured and distributed interstate thus it is not feasible to distinguish in terms of controls betwee n controlled substances manufactured and distributed interstate and controlled substances manufactured and distributed intrastate 6 federal control of the intrastate incidents of th traffic in controlled substances is essential to the effective control of the intersta incidents of such traffic other findings and declarati ons

commerce clause the court seems to have put the co mmerce clause question to rest in gonzales v raich 125 sct 2195 2005 congresss comme rce clause powers are substantial but not unlimited the court summarized the scope of those powers in lopez and morrison two instances where the commer ce clause was found insufficient to support claim of legislative authority f irst congress may regu late the use of the channels of interstate commerce sec ond congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate co mmerce or persons or things in interstate commerce even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities finally congresss commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having substantial relation to interstate commerce ie those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce united states v morrison 529 us 598 609 2 000 quoting united states v lopez 514 us 549 55859 1995internal citations omitted recognizing that the boundaries of this last category of commerce clause power intrastate activity with an interstate impact are not always easily identified morrison and lopez identified some of the signs which reveal that regulated activity may in fact have significant impact on inters tate commerce first we observed that 922q the section at issue in lopez was criminal statute that by its terms has nothing to do with commerce or any sort of economic enterpri however broadly one might define those terms 529 us at 610 the second consideration that we found important was that the statute contained express jurisdictional element which might limit its reach to discrete t of firearms possessi ons that additionally have an explicit connection with or effect on intersta commerce 529 us at 611 12 third we noted that neither 922q nor its legislative history contains express congressional findings regarding the ffects upon interstate commerce of gun possession in school zone 529 us at 612 finally our decision in lopez rested in part on the fact that the link between gun possession and substantial effect on interstate commerce was ttenuated 529 us at 612 the coop argued that only the cultiv ation and distribution of cannabis in exchange for money or barter can be cons idered commerce but even such commerce here is exclusively intrastate and therefore not within the power of congress to regulate commerce among the states brief at 39 yet the act including its proscripti ons on the cultivation distribution and possession of marijuana appears to be within the congresss commerce clause powers as described in lopez and morrison they identify as indicative of criminal statutes beyond the clauses reach those which purport to punish activities that have nothing to do with commerce or any sort of economic enterprise as the coops very name oakland cannabis buyers indicates cultivation distribution or possession of marijuana almost always involve s or is closely linked to some form of commercial activity particularly if distribution requires the participation of physicians and health care insurers moreover while not necessarily dispositive by itself congresss findings with

consumption most likely does substantially affect interstate commerce this is so because it supplies need of the man who grew it which would otherwise be reflected by purchases in the open market as

challenge inter alia by marijuana farmer authorized by local officials to prov ide marijuana for medicinal purposes 12 in wickard v filburn the court upheld the application of amendments to the agricultural adjustment act of 1938 to th production and consumption of homegrown wheat the wickard court explicitly rejected earlier dis tinctions between direct and indirect effects on interstate commerce stating even if appellees activity be local and through it may not be regarded as commerce it may still whatever its nature be reached by congress if it exerts substantial economic effect on interstate commerce and this irrespective of whether such effect is what might at some earlier time have been defined as direct or indirect the wickard court emphasized that although f ilburns own contribution to the demand for wheat may have been trivial by itself that was not enough to remove him from the scope of federal regulation where as here his contribution taken together with that of many others similarly situated is far from trivial united states v lopez 514 us 549 556 1995internal citations omitted exceed the authority granted by the commerce clause until recently the lower federal appellate courts when faced with challenges based on lopez had unanimously concluded that the act is within congre sss legislative author ity under the commerce clause11 divided panel in the ninth circuit however concluded that party seeking to enjoin enforcement of the act had shown her constitutional challenge was likely to succeed that is the court was convinced that the application of the act to the intrastate noncomme rcial cultivation nd possession of cannabis for personal medical purposes as recommended by patients physician pursuant to valid california state law likely exceeded congresss authority under the commerce clause raich v ashcroft 352 f3d 1222 1229 9th cir 2003 the dissent argued that the issue was controlled by the supreme courts decision in wickard v filburn 317

case law we noted that w have upheld wide variety of congressional acts regulating intrastate economic activity where we have concluded that the activity substantially affected interstate commerc although we cited only few examples including wickard v fulburn we stated that the pattern of analysis is clear where economic activity substantially affects inters tate commerce legislation regulating that activity will be sustained even wickard which is perhaps the most far reaching example of commerce clause authority over in trastate activity involved economic activity united states v morrison 529 us 598 610 2000 quoting united states v lopez 514 us at 559 560 some internal citations omitted 14 it is difficult to discern how filburns grow ing wheat for his own consumption is different than the patients growing marijuana for hi s own consumption triggered and dependent upon the endorsement of physician in an admirable but nonetheless commercial relationship and involving an alternative to the commercial market in marijuana the practices of medical users might be considered by some to have an impact on either the commerce that is the medical profession or that which is the marijuana market implicit in the ninth circuits terse asse ssment may be the belief that given the opportunity the supreme court will decide that wickard lies not just within but just beyond the reach of congresss commerce clause power not so and morrison 13 the majority however felt that as the regulated activity in this case is not commercial wickard s aggregation analysis is not applicable14 the supreme court in 63 decision written by ju stice stevens agreed with the ninth circuit dissenter gonzales v raich 125 sct 2195 2005 under the commerce and necessary and proper clauses congre ss may regulate so much of purely local conduct as it may rationally c onclude is appropria to its regula tion of matters of interstate or foreign commerce in wickard the court concluded that c ongress had rational basis for believing that when viewed in the aggregate leaving homeconsumed wheat outside the regulatory scheme would have s ubstantial influence on price and market conditions 125 sct at 2207 in much th same way the cour t felt congress had rational basis for concluding that leavin g homeconsumed mariju ana outside federal control would similarly affect price nd market conditions 125 sct at 2207 more specifically the court had diffi culty concluding that congress had rational basis for believing that failure to regulate the intrastate manufacture and possession of marijuana would leave gapi ng hole in the csa in light of the enforcement difficulties that attend distinguishing between marijuana cultivated locally and marijuana grown elsewhere as well as concerns about diversion into illicit channels 125 sct at 2209 thus as in wickard when it enacted comprehensive legislation to regulate the interstate market in fungible commodity congress was acting well within its authority to make laws which shall be necessary and proper to regulate commer ce among the several states usconst art i 8 that the regulation ensnares some pur ely intrastate activity is of

legislativehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31100crs8 15 perhaps because the courts have rarely found it necessary to look beyond the commerce clause the case law on alternative sources of legislative authority is sparse but it does include united states v rodriquezcamacho 468 f2d 1220 1222 9th cir 1972 furthermore the united states is party to the single convention on narcotic drugs binding inter alia all signatories to control persons and enterprises engaged in the manufacture trade and distribution of specified drugs marijuan cannabis is so specified enactment of sec 841a1 is permissible method by which congress may effectuate the american obligation under the treaty 16 this case represents an intersection of the tenth and ninth amendments the people have used the initiative power reserved to themselves under the tenth amendment to recognize fundmental sic liberty interest they have retained under the ninth amendment by an unwarranted extension of its power s under the necessary and proper clause the federal government now seeks to interfere with both the exercise of the power reserved by the people and the states and the rights retained by the people brief at 489

courts opinion is especially unfortunate given the importance of sowing respect for the sovereign states that comprise our federal union that respect imposes duty on federal courts whenever possible

subject matter jurisdiction such as the power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce it may nevertheless elect to pass laws which exceed what is constitutionally p roper under the imp lementary

compel the states to enact or enforce federal regulatory program or to when it issues directives requiring the states to address particular problems or commands the states officers or those of their political subdivisions to administer or enfor ce federal regulatory program printz v united states 521 us 898 924 934 1997 citing new york v united states 505 us 144 1992 the coop argued that congress is not acting in the necessary and proper exercise of its legislative authority when it acts in total derogation of rights which the people of given state have identified as fundamental unenum erated constitutional rights brief at 45916 the contention may have helped spur the three concurring members of the court to urge at least rule of construction that would recognize medical necessity defense for marijuana possession17 the majoritys sweeping dicta and thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31100crs9 experiments by passing proposition 215 ca lifornia voters have decided that seriously ill patients and their primary caregivers should be exempt from prosecution under state laws for cultivating and possessing marijuana if th patents physician recommends using the drug for treatment this case does not

concurring in the judgmentemphasis in the original 18 lest there be any confusion we clarify th at nothing in our anal ysis or the statute suggests that distinction should be drawn between the prohibitions on manufacturing and distribution and the other prohibitions in the controlled substances act such as the prohibition on possession furthermore the very point of our holding is that there is medical necessity exception to the prohibitions at issue even when the patient is seriously ill and lacks alternative avenues for relief i ndeed it is the cooperatives argument that its patients are seriously ill and lacking alternatives we reject the argument that these factors warrant medical necessity exception fina lly we share justice stevens concern for showing respect for the sovereig n states that comprise our fe deral union however we are construing an act of congress not drafting it because federal courts interpret rather than author the federal criminal code we are not at liberty to rewrite it nor are we passing today on constitutional question such as whether the controlled substances act exceeds congresss power under the commerce clause 532 us at 49494 n7accompanying footnote which sparked justice stevens comments however may reflect the fact that at least five mbers of the court found the necessary and proper argument unpersuasive18 due process clause of course the coops ninth amendm ent fundamentalunenumeratedrights argument is closely akin to its substantiv due process contentions ie that these patients have fundamental right to be free from government

produc ts of controlled substanc and of marijuana in particular federal regulation of marijuana as crime control measure dates back from the marihuana tax act of 1937 50 stat 551 1937 by which time every state in the union already regulated its sale19 the act was modeled after the more general harrison narcotics act of 1914 under which opium and other narcotics were regulated20 congress passed

here congress appears to have done just that it has c oncluded that marijuana is highly addictivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31100crs11 23 as in oakland cannabis buyers cooperative the court in raich did not reach the substantive due process issue respondents also raise substantive due process claim and seek to avail themselves of the medical necessity defense these theories of relief were set forth

questions as to whether the federal enforcement policy permitted contentbased restric tion on speech and whether it was unconstitutionally vague 172 frd at 69498 court in the district of columbia on the other hand refused to issue similar injunction pearson v mccaffrey 139 fsupp2d 113 125 ddc 2001 from the courts perspective there are first am endment protections for speech that is used as an integral part of conduct in viola tion of valid criminal statute 139 fsupp2d at 121 therefore even though state law may allow for the prescription or recommendation of medicinal marijuana within its borders to do so is still violation of federal law the fact that speech or writing is the mechanism used by physicians to carry out such task does not make the conduct less violative of federal law the first amendment does not prohibit the federal government from taking action against physicians whose pr escription or recomme ndation of medicinal marijuana violates the act
