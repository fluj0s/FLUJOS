obtained copy of with the results of the government of iraqs goi investigation report of the september 16 incident at nisoor square the report portrays the incident as an unprovoked attack on unarmed civilians references number of other alleged incidents involving blackwater recommends payments of 8 million and 4 million for each death and injury respectively and calls for the usg to replace blackwater within six months of the incident it is unclear to what extent the goi is committed to these recommendations or how it intends to implement them the embassy has begun accepting claims from victims of the incident with 15 claims submitted so far post has approved payments of 10000 for each death 5000 for each injury and 2500 for property damage the regional security office rso is implementing changes to procedures and increasing linkages to the goi for cooperation and information sharing on psd issues the embassy is awaiting the departments determination as to what information about past psd incidents can be shared with the joint commission and is developing work plan to guide the meetings of the joint commission this work plan will also form the basis of posts proposed structure for the joint commissions report goi investigation c 2 on october 11 the ministry of defense mod gave the embassy copy of the final report of its investigative committee the report was produced and endorsed by the eight iraqi members of the joint commission the details of the incident as described in the report portray random and unprovoked shooting involving small and medium arms fire resulting in the deaths of vehicle passengers and bystanders the report states that there was evidence the convoy was fired upon that total of 17 iraqis were killed 27 wounded 7 cars burned or damaged and that 2 iraqi security forces were among the casualties c 3 the report concludes that the conduct of the psd violated iraqi law and number of cpa orders and that therefore the incident is premeditated murder for which the blackwater personnel must be held accountable it also claims that the ministry of interior has information on seven other instances in which blackwater personnel killed 10 iraqis and wounded 15 others it states that due to these previous violations the companys license was not renewed after it expired in june 2006 the report makes 5 recommendations 1 that court investigate the crime and take actions as stipulated by relevant cpa and iraqi law immediately 2 that the council of ministers requests the us government replace blackwater within six months of the incident and replace it with more disciplined company 3 that blackwater pay 8 million for each death and 4 million for each injury 4 that the moi address the issue of blackwater operating illegally without license 5 that new legislation governing security contractors drafted by the moi and currently being considered by legislative bodies be adopted as quickly as possible ref embassy approves condolence payments c 4 on october 18 and october 20 the embassy sent team to the national iraqi assistance center facility where mnfi collects claims paperwork from iraqis injured in mnfi incidents to collect applications from the nisoor square incident the iraqi national police previously provided the embassy with contact information of family members for 7 of the 17 iraqis killed and for 15 of the 27 injured all of whom were contacted so far the embassy has received paperwork for 15 claims including one claim form that was previously submitted to mnfi c 5 on october 21 the embassy claims and condolence committee chaired by the dcm reviewed the claims submitted the embassys claims and condolence program is modeled after mncis which typically provides up to 2500 per incident death injury or property damage but which permits payments of up to 10000 per incident in extraordinary circumstances if approved by the mnci division commanding general consistent with military practice and with the ambassadors approval the committee agreed to make payments of 10000 to the family members of those killed 5000 to those injured and 2500 for each instance of property damage the committee agreed to arrange forum for payment to the 15 claimants who have already filed paperwork to expedite this payment and to work with the goi to contact the remaining potential claimants the embassy believes that blackwater should also make its own payments in this incident and requests the departments assistance in conveying this message preparing for the next joint commission meeting c 6 as agreed at the first joint commission meeting on october 7 ref the embassy is working with the department to decide what information regarding the nisoor square and other psd incidents can be shared with the commission the embassy legal advisor is developing work plan for the commission which after consultation with our iraq working level counterparts we plan to introduce at the next meeting the goal of this plan is to have each of the joint commissions meetings focus on one of the major themes of the report that the commission will ultimately issue investigation and regional security office update c 7 the fbi continues its investigation with support from the regional security officer rso as needed the rso is implementing changes to its operating procedures diplomatic security ds agents are now in charge of and accompanying all chief of mission com motorcade movements in baghdad outside of the iz and to the extent possible in the rest of iraq an increased staffing pattern to sustain this larger workload has been approved by post management and has been submitted to the department ds is in the process of procuring video systems for all psd vehicles and communications recording equipment for the tactical operations center the rso is also taking technological steps to improve the mutual awareness of rso and mnci elements in the field and is procuring radios that will allow tactical communications between rso air and ground assets and mnci assets c 8 the rso is also forming an investigative response unit that will potentially include mnfi and goi representatives to investigate all incidents involving com security assets including statistical analysis and metrics of psd incidents and systematic collection and archiving of recorded video footage and radio communications additionally the rso is reviewing the viability of alternative nonlethal escalation of force procedures c 9 the rso is working to improve linkages to the goi for the general sharing of information and investigation of specific psd incidents the rso will be participating regularly in the goiusg crisis action cell which is weekly meeting between senior us military officials the minister of defense and the national security advisor where psd incidents are often raised the rso is scheduled to meet with the chiefs of the iraqi police and the national police in an effort to develop closer workinglevel relationships media coverage c 10 the nisoor square incident and private security contractors in general have continued to receive negative coverage and have served as rallying points for iraqi politicians and government officials both those in power and in the opposition coverage of the establishment of the joint commission stemmed mostly from us government statements about it coverage of goi statements included those of aldabbagh on october 7 saying that the iraqi investigation found blackwater responsible for deliberate murder other reports focused on the gois call for blackwater to pay total of 136 million for the incident and comparing it to the lockerbie bombing an october 9 incident involving unity resources group urg the psd of usaid contractor in which two iraqi women were killed was reported as blackwatertype massacre c 11 newspaper and other coverage waned due to the eid alfitr holiday but blackwater returned to the press once the news cycle resumed with reports focusing on the prime ministers advisor sami alaskri who said the iraqi government has clear position regarding the future of blackwater in iraq the security firm should be expelled within six months editorials in all of iraqs newspapers have lashed out at blackwater likening it to another militia contributing to the deterioration of iraqs security numerous editorial cartoons have been published depicting blackwater as bloodthirsty mercenaries while the escalation of the turkish border issue has been dominating the media the blackwater incident will likely remain prominent issue for editorials and political cartoons as the unpopularity of private security firms makes it an easy target crocker
