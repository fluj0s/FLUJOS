administration issues for congress reauthorization of the federal av iation administration faa and other aviation programs is likely to be high priority in the 110th congress as funding authorizations for aviation programs and the aviation tax structure that provides revenue for the aviation trust fund will ex pire at the end of fy2007 congress may consider variety of financing options to provide sufficient revenue stream for ongoing operational costs and planned infrast ructure improvements one particularly controversial option under cons ideration is more direct user fee system which is supported by the airlines but strongly opposed by many other system users congress may also examine airport financing m echanisms including airport improvement program aip grants passenger facility charges pfcs bonds and other revenue sources faced with growing operational costs and fiscal needs to support system expansion airport capital imp rovements and moderniza tion efforts options to control costs within the faa and the air traffic organization ato may be particular focus of reaut horization cost control op tions generally revolve around two overarching strategies consolidation of facilities and functions and competitive sourcing some have recommended that formal process similar to the militarys base realignment and closure brac pro cess be implemented to assess how the faa could best consolidate its functions to control costs and address future system needs further options to maintain and balance air traffic controller staffing levels are likely to be of interest as the faa is facing large wave of controller retirements over the next five years options for improving and streamlining training increasing productivity better balanc ing staffing needs and perh aps consolidating air traffic facilities over the longterm may be c onsidered during reauthorization congress may also examine variety of aviation safety issues during debate over faa reauthorization options for pr eventing runway overruns and for reducing the risk of runway collisions may be of particular interest the adequacy of faa safety oversight has been continuing concern and recent accidents may draw particular attention to oversight of contract repair facilities smaller passenger service operators as well as air charter and air tour operators other safety issues that may arise include longstanding concerns such as mitigating the risks of fuel tank explosions addressing concerns over aging aircraft and addressi ng the unique safety issues affecting allcargo operations issues regarding airliner cabin health and safety may also be considered durin g the reauthorization process growing international pressures to regulate aircraft emissions may prompt debate on aviations environmental impacts and growing interest in alternatives to petroleum fuel may generate some debate over altern ative fuel technologies for aircraft and airport ground vehicles long standing

administration faa is likely to be high priority in the 110th congress funding authorizations for aviation programs set forth in vision 100 the century of aviation reauthorization act pl 108176 hereafter refe rred to as vision 100 as well as authorization of the existing aviation tax structure that provides revenue for the aviation trust fund are set to expire at the end of fy2007 crs has identified nine broad categories of issues among those congress may address in the context of faa reauthorization these include faa budgeting and finance air port development and finance faa cost control measures systemwide demand and cap acity issues modern ization of national airspace system nas infrastructure aviation safety airliner cabin issues energy environment and noise issues and interna tional civil aviation issues this report summarizes major issues facing congress during the upcoming faa reauthorization cycle it parallels the overv iew section of crs report rl33698 reauthorization of the federal aviation administration background and issues for congress which provides more indepth examination of th issues briefly discussed in this report faa budget and finance issues authorization of the existing aviation ta x structure that provides revenue for the aviation trust fund will expire at the end of fy2007 while such tax authorizations have expired in the past the current liberations over faa funding are considered particularly critical this in part is b ecause uncommitted balances in the airport and airways trust fund aatf commonly refe rred to as the aviation trust fund have declined in recent years leaving relatively small reserve to pay for aviation programs in the event that tax collection authorities are allowed to expire also major initiatives to develop and deploy the next generation air transportation system ngats by 2025 initiated during the last r eauthorization process are reaching stage where they will require additional f unding resources if these plans are to be realized while official projections ar yet available on the total cost for ngats early estimates indicate that it w ill require an average of 200 m illion to 1 billion annually in facilities nd equipment costs over the next several years to keep ngats development initiatives on track congress may consider variety of financing options to maintain the ability of the aviation trust fund to provide suffici ent revenue stream for ongoing operational costs and planned infrastructure improvement s in the nearterm and to support the longterm ngats development efforts in the course of this debate congress may consider the appropriate cost allocation between aviation system users the share ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33789crs2 1 general aviation refers to all aviation activ ity except for commercial airline allcargo airline and military operations 2 paul lowe alphabet groups ready to wage userfee battle aviation international news the convention news co inc midland park nj april 2006the cost burden to be borne by the aviation trust fund and the share to be derived from treasury general funds the socalle d public interest contribution the relative tax burden placed on various i ndustry participants has been source of controversy for over 36 years since the aviation trust fund was created the airlines argue that they have been paying disproportionately larger share of the system costs compared to general aviation1 users since the largest revenue sources for the aviation trust fund are deri ved from passenger tic ket taxes the airlines claim that in their highly competitive industry they mu st absorb some of the taxrelated costs in their fare pricing schemes the airlines have identified general aviation users and business jet operators in particular as segment of th aviation industry that in their opinion is not paying its fair share of the costs to maintain nd improve the national airspace system nas general aviation users argue on the other hand that the nas has largely been developed to support the ai rline industry that the incremental costs to accommodate general aviation users is not that large and that existing fuel taxes are sufficient to compensate for their impact on the system one alternative to the existing tax structur supported by the airlines is feefor service system that would be more of direct user fee system than what is in place now some industry observers claim that the faa has been mulling the idea of direct user fee structure to replace existing aviation taxes and fees and an administration proposal s reportedly been under review by the office of management and budget omb for some time2 while the details of the proposal are unknown speculation is that it will conform mo re closely to inte rnational standards that stipulate user fees be computed as some function of the specific impact on air traffic facilities and services such as the commonly used fees based on aircraft weight and distance flown used by many nations during the reauthorization debate cong ress may consider variety of aviation trust fund revenue alte rnatives that may include keep ing the existing passenger ticket and fuel taxes largely or completely intact moving to tax revenue scheme based solely on fuel taxes adopting user feeba sed system or devel oping hybrid scheme that consists of some combination of these alternatives one hybrid approach that has been discussed is to charge feeforservice ty pe user fees for airlines and operators of larger general aviation aircraft while sma ll general aviation user s would continue to contribute solely by means of fuel tax although these fuel tax rates and structure could differ from what currently exists airport development and finance issues the airport improvement program aip provides federal grants for airport development its funding is derived from the airport and airways trust fund and it ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33789crs3 one of five major sources of funding for airport developm ent and improvement airports also fund capital projects using ta xexempt bonds passenger facility charges pfcs local tax levied on each boarding passenger state and local grants and airport revenue the preemin ent reauthorization issue for aip is whether its funding levels will be increased substantially held steadyincreased modestly or reduced the outlook for aip funding will be influenced by the resolution of the debate concerning taxes and fees supporting the aviation trus t fund as well as any decision concerning the scope of the general fund share of th faa budget failure to secure more revenue for the faa budget in light of th recent decline in the uncommitted balance of the trust fund could constr ain any attempts to significantly increase the aip budget during the reauthorization process c ongress may also examine wide variety of other issues pertaining to the aip program including airport eligibility and apportionments among various sizes of airpor ts discretionary fundi ng levels and uses of discretionary grants the scope of grant assurances to protect federal interests in airport projects funding vels set aside for noiserela ted projects the appropriate federal share of funding for airport project s at airports of various sizes possible expansion of or modification to the air port privatization pilot program partial defederalization of air port funding allowing airports to use pfcs instead of aip as primary or sole source for project funds limita tions on the use of aip funds for airport security projects the possible impacts of accommodating new users classes such as very light jets vljs and the airbus a380 superjumbo jet on airport infrastructure needs and airport financing and the use of earmarks or place naming in legislation regarding airport infrastructure projects in addition to aip funding and related issues congress may consider options to raise th cap on pfc levels to provide additional funding availability outside of aip and options to make airport bonds more attractive to investors although some may argue the latter may be more ppropriately addressed through tax reform legislation rather than faa reauthorization cost control issues besides consideration of revenue syst em for funding the aviation trust fund controlling the costs of operating and maintaining the existing national airspace system has been an ongoing concern fo r the faa and for congressional oversight cost control measures may be particular issue of interest during the faa reauthorization debate as congress grapples with the prospect of escalating operational costs that must be balanced with the fiscal needs to support planned infrastructure development both over the nearterm to fund ongoing and planned system expansion and over the longter m to support the ngats development outsourcing has been seen as viable alternative for controlling costs in some instances such as the faas federal cont ract tower fct program and the recently privatized automated flight service stat ions afsss expanded outsourcing of various faa functions such as further expa nsion of the contract tower program and privatization of the faas aeronautical ch arting functions are possible options that both the faa and congress may examine also the faa and congress may look tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33789crs4 3 designees are individuals that are neith er government employees nor government contractors that are authorized or designated by the faa to carry out regulatory functions examples include designated medical examin ers that issue medical certification pilot examiners that issue pilot certificates and ratings and manufacturing representatives that certify the airworthiness of production aircraftincrease the use of designees3 to carry out certain av iation oversight functions however some critics argue that these outsourcing options are likely to yield relatively small cost savings in compar ison to the overall faa operations budget further these options are likely to be highly contentious and face strong opposition from labor and some other industry organizations whether these outsourcing measures potentially compromise safety in any way remains specific point of contention while some have advocated large scale privatiz ation of air traffic services as has been done in cana da australia the united king dom and parts of mainland europe this approach would be highly complex to carry out and this option has failed to garner much support in congress to date the current administration has indicated previously that it has plans to privatize route and terminal air traffic control facilities but may opt to expand the contract tower program consolidation of facilities and functions has also been viewed as possible way to control operational costs at the faa the faa is currently in the process of consolidating administration and support functions in its regional service areas and has plans to consolidate weather services pr ovided at route centers also under the privatized afss program an extensive c onsolidation of flight service facilities is currently in process some have proposed that the faa implement systematic process perhaps using something akin to the militarys base realignment and closure brac process to address future consolidation plans for facilities and functions congress may debate the merits of this proposal during the pending faa reauthorization in the long term under ngats consolida tion of air traffic services and air traffic facilities may be possible with increased reliance on automation and by increasing the autonomy flexibility and au thority granted to individual flights operating in the national airspace system nas the ratio of air traffic controllers to aircraft operating in the system is likely to drop in the near term this will likely be offset by the growth in air traffic operati ons so that modest increase in the overall number of air traffic controllers is expected in the longterm however the changing nature of controller respons ibilities and functions may result in need for fewer controllers and may allow fo r considerable consolidati on in air traffic control facilities across the united states the faa has also expressed interest in consolidation of air traffic facilities as possible means to address ongoing staffing issues particularly among route centers where there is currently shortage of fully qualified controllers to handle the most complex airspace sectors the faa believes that facilities consolidation could help in its efforts to better match controller skills and levels of experience with airspace complexity and provide controllers with better job advancement opportunities while at th same time reducing infrastructure and relocation costs httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33789crs5 4 crs calculation based on faa budget documents and statements regarding average air traffic controller workforce compensation and benefits 5 soaring controller pay looms large in discussions on atc air transport world daily news may 16 2005 6 see s 2201 and hr 4755 which were introduced during the 109th congresswith regard to controlling operational costs air traffic controller pay remains contentious issue as controller compen sation and benefits make up sizable proportion of the faas operational costs co mprising roughly 35 of total operating costs4 under 1998 contract agreement betw een the faa and controllers controller compensation and benefits grew about 64 in eight years5 outpacing the increase in labor costs for other faa employees nd federal workers during contract renegotiations in 2005 and 2006 the faa looke d to obtain sizable concessions from controllers but the two sides could not come to agreement as called for in statute the impasse was referred to congress ho wever congress did not act on the impasse submittal thus allowing the faa to imple ment its final contract proposal which became effective in september 2006 while the law giving the faa authority to negotiate compensation and bene fits in labor contracts rarity in the government sector was enacted largely for the purpose of improving the faas ability to attract and retain high quality professional workforce it has been criticized by management for leading to escalating operating costs and by both manageme nt and labor for straining relations between the two sides congress may wish to examine whether options to improve the law are available to control escalating operational costs and maintain more positive and constructive managementlabor relations within the faa with regard to labor negotiations one legislative option offered during the 109th congress proposed to add an additional phase requiring management and labor to enter into bi nding arbitration after the period of congressional review that follows an impasse in the contract negotiation process6 while congress did not take up formal debate on this proposal in the midst of the recent faacontroller labor dispute this proposal may resurface during debate over faa reauthorization other options to streamline the labor negotiations process within faa may also be considered in th context of faa reauthorization as recent labor negotiations have been viewed as bein g rather disruptive and highly contentious controller staffing is also likely to be key focus in the reauthorization debate as the faa seeks to effectively manage its controller workforce in preparation for an expected surge in retirements over the next several years some available options that congress may consider include dedicated funding authorizations marked for new controller hiring and training authorization for new hires from accredited collegiate air traffic programs to enter directly into onthejob training funding authorization for initiatives to enhance controller training us ing advanced simulation technologies and consolidation of certain air traffic facilities and functions to provide for greater flexibility in meeting staffing needs httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33789crs6 system demand and capacity issues the current faa reauthorization cycle comes at critical time with respect to addressing increasing capacity needs at highvolume airports in airspace around many major metropolitan areas and along certain highly congested routes while recent stopgap measures implemented by the faa have served to stave off unacceptable congestion and delays thus far longterm so lutions are likely needed in consideration of future air traffic growth projections many believe that technology is needed to reduce low visibility aircraft spacing sta ndards to those allowable in good visibility in order to accommodate projected future growth at busy airports however some experts caution that even with the impleme ntation of these proposed options and the completion of planned airport expansions across the country certain very busy airports including both major commercial ai rports and busy gene ral aviation reliever airports may experience peak hour dema nd levels that exceed airport capacity limitations besides addressing expected capacity needs significant challenge facing congress and the faa in the years ahead is accommodating new classes of airspace users in manner that optimizes safety and efficiency for all users new users will consist of the very big such as the airbus a380 superjumbo jet as well as the relatively small very light jets vljs the most talkedabout class of new system users are the vljs which are expected to begin operations in small numbers in 2007 and are projected to experience rapid growth over the next ten years vljs are seen by some as possible solution to provi small communities improved access to the national air transportation system theref ore their introduction may spur renewed public policy debate over pproaches to enhance air transportation in small communities also because these vljs would share high altitude airspace and congested airspace around major metropolitan areas with commercia l passenger jets their impact on system capacity and air traffic control workload is likely to be of particular interest besides vljs th introduction of pilo tless unmanned aerial vehicles uavs or unmanned aerial sy stems uass also poses significant challenges to maintaining safety and not impeding access to airspace for other users such as small general aviation aircraft due to persisting capacity limitations in certain locations the faa and congress may be faced with difficult choices regarding how best to maintain access and address demand in an equitable manne r at capacity constrained ai rports vision 100 provided the faa with limited authority to implement negotiated scheduling among air carriers at few capacityconstrained airports on tria l basis this approach along with other options such as peakperiod pricing slot s and quota systems have all been examined as possible options the faas approach to addressing capacity constraints at new yorks laguardia airport is likely to be an issue of particular interest during the debate over reauthorization as the statutorily imposed slot system for laguardia expired on january 1 2007 and the airline i ndustry has expressed some dissatisfaction with faa regulatory proposals for demand management at laguardia while capacity constraints are posing challenges at major metropolitan airports several trends including the continuing loss of commercial air carrier service in rural america are making the essential air service eas air carrier subsidy program morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33789crs7 attractive to many rural communities howe ver even with increased funding for this program in recent years it is becoming increasingly difficult for the eas program to generate additional air service against this backdrop the eas program faces number of issues that are likely to be addressed in forthco ming reauthorization legislation primary among these is how to prioritize access to the program so that eas funds are used in the most efficient ma nner possible it is likely however that without significant increase in funding additional limitations on the use of eas program funding may have to be considered in addition to the eas program the small community air service development scasd program was established to develop solutions for improving air carrier service to communities that are experiencing insufficient access to the national air transportation system while an initial review of the program found mixed results it has been noted that it is still too early in the programs history to fully assess its potential effectiveness system modernization issues present initiatives to modernize air traffic facilities and services have been channeled into unified effort to deve lop the next generation air transportation system ngats under provision in vision 100 vision 100 created the joint planning and development office jpdo multiagency entity headed by the faa and charged with the task of conceptualizing and integrating the development of the ngats the dot envisions ngats as syst em capable of tripling effective system capacity by 2025 by some estimates air tr affic levels throughout the united states could increase at that pace thereby necess itating these system enhancements the specifics of these efforts and future fundi ng and management challenges facing the jpdo and the faa in carrying forth the plan s to build the ngats are likely to be major focus during the current faa reauthorization process significant issue facing congress during the upcoming faa reauthorization process is obtaining working estimates of what building the ngats will cost crs analysis of available preliminary cost estimates indicates that th prospective total cost to build the ngats by 2025 is estimated to be between 69 b illion and 76 billion which is roughly 5 billion to 12 billion above ba seline facilities and equipmen t fe spending levels another significant issue that may be addressed during th reauthorization process is how to best manage the ngats development effort one major hurdle is that while the jpdo can set objectives goals and strategies for the ngats framework the funding stream for carrying out these plans will ultimately come from the budgets of the various agencies i nvolved primarily the faa and nasa in recognition of this congress may examine op tions to align budget elements of the various agencies involved within the ngat s framework another potential issue is the appropriate scope of the jpdos efforts while some consideration of various ancillary functions and issues such as security and environmental impacts may improve the overall system design for the ngats too much emphasis on these various issues could impede progress on the central issue of improving the efficiency and capacity of the air traffic system besides the scope of the jpdos efforts another issue of interest is the jpdos management approach some observers contend that the jpdo has remained toohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33789crs8 focused on policy and establishing paradi gm for collaboration among agencies and stakeholders and it has not yet translated these general objectives into cohesive blueprint with high degree of engin eering specification regarding timelines and contingencies among the various component elements of the ngats one possible option being discussed for streamlining ngat s system development is the use of an overarching lead systems integration lsi contract for overseeing the ngats project while many questions still remain regarding the management approach to developing ngats there is growing consensus among experts in the field regarding the technological objectives and likely technologies that will comprise the core functionality of the ngats system the core technologies needed to meet these objectives include 1 precision navigation capabilities to pinpoint aircraft locations project flight paths or flight trajectories and predict future aircraft positions with high degree of accuracy and 2 highly integrated information networks to enable shared situation awareness regarding traffi c weather airport conditions and other factors affecting flights and provide tools to facilitate distributed adaptive decision making and informationsharing about ope rational changes such as flight path deviations and their potential impacts on other system users the investment strategy for these technologies that is adopted and carri ed forth over the next three to five years is likely to have lasting impact on bot h the endstate of ngats and the path to reaching that end state in addition to deciding on technology i nvestment and deploy ment strategy for the ngats challenging and potentially c ontentious issue is the phasing out of existing facilities and equipment for air traffic communications navigation and surveillance phasing out of existing syst ems must be addresse d carefully because on the one hand maintaining legacy syst ems while deploying new technologies can be costly and resource intensive on th other hand phasing these systems out too quickly could place an undue burden on system users to equip aircraft and could pose safety concerns if adequate backups and redundancies are not in place congress may express particular interest in the faa s efforts to assess how proposals envisioning new navigation and surveillance technolog ies will address the issue of providing equivalent safety to the current radarbased air traffic surveillance system congressional interest regarding the phase out of legacy systems may also focus on how these plans may impact airspace system users particularly smaller operators who may face greater challenge in equipping aircraft to keep pace with the evolution from the existing national airspace system to ngatscompliant avionics and aircraft systems while advances in precision navigati on and information sharing show great promise for reducing aircraft spacing in all weather conditions thereby increasing system capacity wake turbulence produced by large transport aircraft currently imposes practical limitations on aircraft sp acing even under ideal weather conditions current air traffic procedures specify separa tion standards for airc raft departing behind large and heavy jets to allow their wake vortices to dissipate some view these standards as overly conservative and argue that accurate wake vortex prediction capabilities could allow for decreased sepa ration thereby increasing airport capacity in many weather conditions others argue that the limited capability of available technology and the complexities of wake vortex propagation make it difficult tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33789crs9 predict wake turbulence or to use such predictions to significantly reduce arrival and departure spacing without compromising safety vision 100 authorizes the expenditure of such sums as may be n ecessary for the development and assessment of wake vortex advisory systems promising emerging technology for wake turbulence detection may be able to increase effective landing capacity at airports perhaps by as much as 20 but is still at an early stage of research and development safety issues since the last reauthorization major ai rlines have maintained an impressive safety record congressional oversight of faa safety initiatives and programs has not been major focus of congress in several years as concerns over aviation security since september 11 2001 have been much more dominant issue however there are many aspects of safety where there is still room for improvement in an industry that is for the most part very safe one area of growing concern is the safety of the airport environment recent runway overr accidents have highlighted concern over the adequacy of runway safety areas and the level of attenti on the faa has given to mitigating the risk of catastrophic runway overrun accidents also with regard to runway safety the faa has identified mitigating runway incursions or potential ground collisions with departing or landing ai rcraft as one of its highest priorities however the faas approach to addressing this issue has been criticized by the national transportation safe ty board ntsb and other aviation safety advocates who maintain that improving pilot situati on awareness of the airport environment is critical need for effectively mitigating runway incursions longrunning safety concern is the ade quacy of the faas oversight of air carrier operations and maintenance the growing trend of outs ourcing maintenance to third party maintenance repair and overhaul facilities has raised questions over the adequacy of these facilities compliance with air carrier and faa standards for work conditions and quality assurance particular concerns over repair facilities that service commuter aircraft and work pe rformed on air carrier aircra ft by small repair shops that are not required to be certified by the faa are two particular issues where congress may consider options to enha nce regulatory requirements and faa oversight of these maintenance activities another continuing safety concern that congress may again examine during this reauthorization process is the continued ai rworthiness of aging aircraft which was highlighted by the ongoing investigati on of commuter seaplane built in 1947 that crashed while departing miami for the bahamas on december 17 2005 particular issue of interest is the faas approach to continued airw orthiness and safety monitoring of the fleet of small commuter aircraft and the aging general aviation fleet which are not covered under the aging aircra ft inspections program established for large airliners the 10year anniversary of the crash of twa flight 800 on july 17 2006 has renewed interest in measures being taken to mitigate the risk of fuel tank explosions on large transportcategory aircraft while technological advances in fuel inerting systems have been made in recent ears and the faa has proposed fuel tankhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33789crs10 7 10 years after flight 800 just hot air air safety week 20 31 august 7 2006flammability reduction requirements for new and existing passenger airliners critics have expressed frustration that steps to pr event another catastrophe attributable to fuel tank explosion are moving too slowly in their opinion7 congress may debate available alternatives to accelerate safety initiatives to reduce fuel tank flammability and perhaps options to mitigate the fina ncial impact of complying with proposed aircraft modificati ons on air carriers airliner cabin issues issues related to passenger safety comfort and public health in aircraft cabins have often been of interest in past f aa reauthorization pro cesses and may again generate considerable debate during the current reauthor ization cycle one particular concern is the potential for spread of deadly infectious disease such as communicable strain of avian flu among airline passengers the risk of such threat was highlighted few years ago when the deadly sudden acute respiratory syndrome sars virus caused widespread concern over the public health risks posed by airline travel congress may debate whether more research is n eeded on methods to prevent the spread of infectious diseases in the aircraft cabin and how to effectively deploy available methods to detect and mitigate the spread of disease am ong airline travelers with regard to cabin occupant safety congress may once again consider whether infants and toddler s under two year s of age should be restrained in child seats on airline flights or whether the current practice of allowing lap children should be continued the faa recently rescinded its pl ans to require child restraints for these children as advocated by the ntsb citing fears that families would opt to instead travel by car an arguably riskier mode of travel if faced with the prospect of paying for an additional ticket for their infant or toddler to fly the ntsb maintains that the failure to restrain all aircraft ccupants is an unsafe practice and the faas crossmodal safety comparisons detract from the central issue of whether such practice should be llowed to continue also with regard to issues of passenger comfort safety and convenience in the airliner cabin the use of cell phones and table electronic devi ces peds has been an issue of growing interest technolog ical advances in wireless voice and data communications are far outpacing the faas ability to study the safety implications of using these radio frequency rf emitting devices on board aircraft and make sound policy decisions regarding the inflight use of these devices while vendors are pushing for approval of onboard systems to make cell phone nd wireless internet access available in flight researchers have expressed continuing concern that cell phones and other peds may inte rfere with aircraft instrumentation during the current reauthorization debate congress ma consider whether more focused research on this issue is needed to determine if and under what circum stances these devices can be used in flight without an foreseeable safety consequenceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33789crs11 energy environment and noise issues issues related to energy and the environment may play larger than usual role during the current reauthoriza tion debate energy and fuel issues in particular have been part of the larger public policy debate in recent years and may spur consideration of alternative fuels for aircraft and air port vehicles growing concerns over global warming and environmental impacts may so prompt debate over options for reducing aircraft emissions historically high fuel costs are driving much of the current push for more efficient aircraft which also can be cleaner and quieter however congress may debate available options to study alternative aircraft fuels monitor international approaches to mitiga ting aircraft emissions and noise sponsor research on aircraft emissi onsreduction and quiet aircraft technologies and provide incentives for manufacturers and operators to develop and utilize ai rcraft technologies that reduce dependence on fossil fuels and environmental impacts international civil aviation issues although not technically within the jurisd iction of the faa there are at least three major international aviation issues falling under the jurisdiction of the department of transportation dot th at may arise as congress considers faa reauthorization legislation first observers now consider it somewhat likely that the open skies agreement with the european union will remain unsigned and unimplemented which is major concern for many us airlines seeking greater flexibility to operate flights in european ma rkets second is the closely related issue regarding dots rulemaking on foreign ow nership and control of domestic carriers although the administrative process has b een completed the dot has not to date issued final rule the delay in moving forward has been due in part to strong congressional opposition during the 109th congress in the form of both introduced legislation and attempts to prevent the final rule through ppropriations riders according to some commentators as co mprehensive as the proposed agreement appears to be there cannot be meaningful reform in the international aviation market until congress repeals the socalled citizenship test which limits foreign ownership and control of us air carriers finally there is the longstanding issue of cabotage which is defined as the tran sportation of passengers or car go by foreign air carriers from one point in the united states to another and is with couple of narrow exceptions generally prohibited by us law limited statutory exception to this prohibition allowing interna tional carriers to carry certa in cargo shipments between airports within the united states and destinations in alaska while route to foreign destinations was included in vision 100 in light of these various ongoing international aviation issues the faa r eauthorization process may provide congress with unique opportunity to legislate and play major role with respect to these developments in international civil aviation
