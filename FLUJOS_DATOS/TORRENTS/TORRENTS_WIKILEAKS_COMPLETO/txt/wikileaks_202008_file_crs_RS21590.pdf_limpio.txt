enabling infrastructure for network centric warfare ncw concept that relies on communications technology to link together us military personnel ground vehicl aircraft and na val vessels through integrated wide and local area networks to provide improved battle space awareness for joint military forces1 the gig bandwidth expansion program gigbe is component of the overall gig which upgrades the transmission pathways composing the central portion of the gig the gigbe program achieved full operational capability as of december 20 2005 however some question whether the gigbe design will support military requirements fo r transmitting the expected future high volume of encrypted network traffic also because each service is developing separate network architecture that will tie into the gig some observers question whether these differences will limit interoperability of the overall gig and thus reduce its usefulness to warfighters this report w ill be updated as events warrant

completed operational testing and achieved full operational capability as of december 20 2005 the gigbe is now accredited to support highbandwidth synchronous optical network transmission of cl assified data traffic at 10 gigabitsper second between 86 central point defense site s and may eventually extend to link 100 top defense and intelligence sites2 the list of central point sites is classified but includes locations both inside nd outside the united states future plans for the gigbe network transmissions for the defense information systems network disn that now operate over leased lines will soon be integrated into the new gigbe trans mission pathways which are owned by dod3 the gigbe will eventually be linked with the joint tactical radio system jtrs and the transformational communications architecture to form highspeed highcapacity network the army is upgrading its landwarnet networks to tie into the gigbe through its installation information infrastru cture modernization program i3mp the air force will tie all its bases into the gigbe through the air force combat information transport system and the navy will connect with the gigbe through its forcenet architecture4 network architectures the architecture of the gig network includes the functional design to support business gistics intelligence sharing and military operations the enterprise arch itecture plus the technical sign for transmission of data within each network the technical archit ecture each military service is currently creating its own network architecture to suppor t

c2 constellation prog ram consists of several technical and enterprise architectures some of which are designed to relay information directly between machines using common information standards the constellation platforms include ground stations unmanned aerial vehicles spacebased sensors and possibly new multisensor command and control aircraft within the c2 constellation program the combat information transport system is designed to deliver operational information to warfighters6 the c2 constellation will also support the business process for acquiring future c4isr capabilities7 the architecture is coordinated by group of air force domain councils that in turn are governed by the enterprise architecture integration council8 navy and marine corps forcenet forcenet is concept for communications network that combines all ne tworks and business processes for navy and marine corps systems so that information can be gathered and analyzed in collaborative atsea environment for example naval strike group commanders can use computer network chat rooms to coordinate among their wa rfare commanders and ships as well as reach back to the continental united states for help in diagnosing problems9 forcenet maintains continual state of evolution based on changes in technology and changes in the battle space and is not inte nded to have an end state as such forcenet is not program or system but rather way of integrating wide array of technological resources into distributed networked combat force available in real time to all personnel10 it is an architecture comprised of networked systems processing and computing and interfaces that are secure and transparent to users11 more detailed discussion of the architecture for for cenet can be found in crs report rs20557

information inte gration asdnii the primary problem that must be overcome to make information for network centric warfare ncw easily accessible through the gig is meeting the demand for bandwidth14 encryption requirements for high security for the gig will add considerable management overhead signaling to all network tra ffic and will significantly reduce the amount of bandwidth that is actually available for conveying ssage by the year 2010 the congressional budget office cbo estimates that the suppl of effective bandwidth required by the army will fall short of peak demand by ratio of approximately 1 to 1015 also disa reportedly has projected that requirements for transmission of all encrypted us military information will grow by about 50 percent pe r year in the future however cbo has calculated that the existing design for the gigbe program which supports the core of the gig is adequate to support military needs through 2015 and possibly through 2020 with technology upgrades16 oversight issues for congress the gigbe program raises several pot ential oversight issues for congress transmission capacity of the gigbe is the current design for the gigbe sufficient to support future projections for the bandwidth requirements to properly secure classified military transmissions do reported projections for bandwidth requirements adequately take into account extending the functionality of the gig down to each individual soldier and to each individual nsor and individual weapons system in the future do the calculations for growth in gigbe transmission capacity

technology fu ture developments in weapons design and futu re military tactics interoperability of gig architectures each military service is creating its own network architecture causing many observers to be concerned that interoperability problems between the different architectures may limit the usefulness of the overall gig leaving warfighters unable to tap into all network capabilities dod officials have reportedly stated that all services network architectures are basically the same network and that once the information systems are integrated all military units will be able to access whatever da ta they need policy and security features will control the level of access for each indi vidual dod will integr ate all the separate architectures using plan known as the join t technical architecture jta and the net centric operations and warfare reference model ncowrm17 new dod requirements development pro cess known as the joint capabilities integration and development system now requi res that all technology syst ems acquired to become part of the gig must include joint operational capabilities as part of their development and delivery18 the dod joint staff has also created new force capability board fcb to monitor ncw programs for mismatches in funding or mismatches in capability19 the defense department has merg ed its business systems mode rnization bsm effort with its global information grid architecture project to ensure that all network architecture efforts comply with gig standards20 however some questions remain to what degree are these dod efforts to integrate differing network architectures proving eff ective are the immediate needs of the war in iraq reinforcing the use of different ne twork architectures what are some possible vulnerabilities as the enterprise and technology architectures of the gig network become more fully interoperable does increased interoperability also increase the potential for unauthorized access or hacking of the gig under what circumstances might it be better to maintain military communications network using architectures and technologies that are less homogeneous as technology evolves for attacking networks will security for the gig be adequate to insure reliability of equipment and authenticity for users and data
