national park service nps states and local communities where the nps supports state and local conservation through federal recognition seed money and technical assistance nhas are not part of the national park system where lands are federally owned and managed rather lands within heritage areas typically remain in state local or private ownership or combination thereof heritage areas have been supported as protecting lands and traditions and promoting tourism and community revitalization but opposed as potentially burdensome costly or leading to federal control over nonfederal lands this report focuses on heritage areas designated by congress not other entities and related issues and legislation nhas might receive funding from wide variety of sources and congress and the nps do not ordinarily expect to provide nhas with pe rmanent federal funding congress typically determines federal funding for nhas in annual interior appropriations laws nhas can use federal funds for many purposes including staffing planning and projects the fy2008 appropriation for the nps for assistance to heritage areas was 153 million the bush administration requested decrease to 71 million for fy2009 an annual appropriation for nhas has not been determined to date there is comprehensive statute that establishes criteria for designating nhas or provides standards for their funding and management rather particulars for each area are provided in its enabling legislation congress designates management entity usually nonfederal to coordinate the work of the partners this entity

g343g561g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 over more then two decades congress has designated 40 national heritage areas nhas to recognize and assist efforts to protect commemor ate and promote natural cultural historic and recreational resources that form distinctive landscapes congress has established heritage areas for lands that are regarded as distinctive because of their resources their built environment and the culture and history associated with these areas and their residents principal distinction of these areas is an emphasis on the interaction of people and their environment heritage areas seek to tell the story of the people over time where the landscape helped shape the traditions of the residents in majority of cases nhas now have or have had fundamental economic activity as their foundation such as agriculture water transportation or industrial development congress also has enacted measures authorizing the study of areas to determine the suitability and feasibility of designating the study area as heritage area congress designated the first heritage areathe illinois and michigan canal national heritage corridorin 1984 this area was located in one of the nations most industrialized regions and sought to combine diversity of land uses management programs and historical themes goal was to facilitate grassroots preservation of natural resources and economic development in areas containing industries and historic structures the federal government would assist the effort eg through technical assistance but not lead it the idea of linking and maintaining balance between nature and industry and encouraging economic regeneration resonated with many states and communities especially in the eastern united states interest in establishing heritage areas was commensurate with growing public interest in cultural heritage tourism the attributes of each nha are set out in its establishing law because they are based on distinctive cultural

federal acquisition of lands they consist mainly of private properties although some include publicly owned lands in most cases the laws establishing nhas do not provide for acquisition of land and once designated heritage areas generally remain in private state or local government ownership or combination thereof however in few cases congress has authorized federal acquisition of land in heritage areas for instance congress authorized httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33462g10g142g155g146g157g138g144g142g561g3g155g142g138g156g497g561g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141 g496g561g18

cane river nha such cases of federal acquisitionownership have been challenged by property rights advocates who generally oppose federal land ownership and possible resulting limitations on private land uses see support opposition and challenges below heritage areas are among the types of entities that use technical and financial aid from the national park service nps but are not directly owned and managed by the agency they also are not part of the national park system where lands are federally owned and managed congressional designation of heritage areas is commonly viewed as less expensive alternative to creating and operating new units of the national park system that system now has 391 diverse units national parks national monuments national historic sites national battlefields national preserves and other designations for information on establishing units of the national park system see crs report rs20158 national park system establishing new units by carol hardy vincent while the oldest heritage area is 25 years old nhas are still viewed by some as an experimental form of protecting lands that reflect an evolution in roles and responsibilities the traditional form of nps land protection has been through government ownership management and funding of lands set aside for protection and enjoyment by contrast nhas typically are nonfederally owned managed by local people with many partne rs and nps advice funded from many sources and intended to promote local economic development as well as to protect natural and cultural heritage resources and values since the creation of the first nha interest in additional nha designations has grown considerably there has been significant interest from communities seeking tourism and economic revitalization as well as conservation and preservation in the past the bush administration had supported nhas because they embody partnerships between communities and the federal government locally driven resource preservation and local rather than federal control of land however at recent hearings the bush administration has recommended deferring action on certain bills seeking to establish additional heritage areas despite favorable studies of the areas until systemic nha legislation is enacted 1 in the past few congresses dozens of proposals to designate heritage areas or study lands for heritage status have been introduced and congress has held many hearings on heritage bills and issues the many bills introduced in the 110th congress to designate heritage areas or study lands for potential heritage status indicated continued high level of congressional interest in nhas the sizeable number of existing nhas together with the substantial number of proposals to study and designate new ones fostered interest by some members and the bush administration in establishing standardized process and criteria for designating nhas see legislative activity below however the absence over the decades of such systemic law has provided legislative flexibility in the creation of new nhas and the modification of existing ones further some opponents of nhas believe that they threaten private property rights are burdensome or present other problems and challenges so congress should oppose any efforts to designate new areas andor to create system of nhas see support opposition and

g346g561in addition to the federal heritage areas other heritage areas have been designated by local governments or announced by local preservation gr oups and number of states have developed their own heritage area programs further white house initiative preserve america executive order 13287 march 3 2003 directs federal agen cies to improve management of historic properties through adaptive reuse initiatives and to promote heritage tourism through partnerships with communities2 the first preserve america grants awarded on march 9 2006 included grants for nine projects within nhas these grants were provided on matching basis to assist communities with protection and use of community heritage also the alliance of national heritage areas anha collaboration of the management entities for the federally designated nhas working through its heritage development institute initiative provides training to practitioners of heritage development see httpwwwheritagedevelopmentinstituteorghome the anha also operates resource center for heritage areas organizes educational workshops and programs and promotes heritage tourism

funding and management rather particulars for an area typically are provided in its enabling legislation while there tended to be more variety in the creation and operation of earlier heritage areas the establishment and management of heritage areas have become somewhat more standardized through the inclusion of some similar provisions in their enabling legislation common understandings and characteristics are discussed below nhas usually involve partnerships among the nps states and local interests in establishing heritage areas congress typically designates management entity to coordinate the work of the partners management entities could include state or local government agencies nonprofit corporations and independent federal commissions the management entity usually develops and implements plan for managing the nha in co llaboration with partners and other interested parties while the components of the plans vary in accordance with the authorizing legislation and local needs they often identify resources and themes lay out policies and implementation strategies for protection use and public educati on describe needed restoration of physical sites discuss recreational opportunities outline funding goals and possibilities and define the roles and responsibilities of partners once the secretary of the interior approves plan it essentially becomes the blueprint for managing the heritage area and is implemented as funding and resources are available implementation of management plans is accomplished primarily through voluntary actions nhas might receive funding to prepare and implement their plans from wide array of sources including philanthropic organizations endowment s individuals businesses and governments congress and the nps do not ordina rily expect to provide nhas with full and permanent federal funding but rather encourage nhas to develop alternative sources of funding march 30 2004 report of the government accountability office gao states that during the sixyear period from fy1997 through fy2002 heritage areas received 310 million in total funding about half the funds 154 million were derived from state and cal governments and private sources with the other half 156 million provided by the federa l government of the federal funding about 50 million came from the nps heritage program and 44 million came from other nps programs 2 for information on the preserve america initiative see httpwwwpreserveamericagov

onethird 35 of total funding from 1985 through 20064 state and local governments also contributed about onethird 36 of nha funds with private funding sources providing 25 and the remaining 4 from other sources for 2006 the report indicates that the combined state and local 49 shares of nha funding were higher than federal 37 and private contributions 12 in the past congress has determined the total level of federal funding for nhas and usually has specified in appropriations documents the allocation for each nha the management entity generally receives any federal appropriations for the

areas are considerable and thus congress should expand its assistance for creatin g and sustaining heritage areas supporters view nhas as important for protecting history traditions and cultural landscapes especially where communities are losing their traditional economic base eg industry or farming facing loss of population or experiencing rapid growth from people unfamiliar with the region advocates see nhas as unifying forces that increase the pride of people in their traditions foster spirit of cooperation and unity and promote stewardship ethic among the general public advocates of nhas assert that they foster cultural tourism community revitalization and regional economic development heritage areas are advertised as entertaining and educational places for tourists and may involve activities such as stories music food areas walking tours boat rides and celebrations through increased tourism communities benefit locally when services and products are purchased in some cases increased heritage tourism together with an emphasis on adaptive reuse of historic resources has attracted broader business growth and development 3 the data reflect funding for 22 of the then

g348g561some supporters see nhas as generally more sirable than other types of land conservation they often prefer the designation of nhas beca use the lands typically remain in nonfederal ownership to be administered locally other nha backers view establishing and managing federal areas such as units of the national park system as too costly and observe that small federal investments in heritage areas have been successful in attracting funds from other sources some proponents also see nhas as flexible enough to encompass diverse array of initiatives and areas because the heritage concept lacks systemic laws or regulations while others favor standardized program and process property rights advocates take the lead in opposing heritage areas they contend that some national heritage areas lack significant local support they charge that private property owners should be routinely notified when their lands fall within proposed heritage areas because the nps could exert degree of federal control over nonfederal lands by influencing zoning and landuse planning some fear that any private property pr otections in legislation would not be routinely adhered to by the federal government they are concerned that localities have to obtain the approval of the secretary of the interior for he ritage area management plans and believe that some plans are overly prescriptive in regulating details of private property use eg the species of trees that landowners can plant another concern of opponents is that nha lands may one day be targeted for purchase and direct management by the federal government the lack of general statute providing framework for heritage area establishment management and funding has prompted criticism that the process is inconsistent and fragmented some see need to establish and define the criteria for creating nhas specify what nhas are and do and clarify the federal role in supporting these areas they are concerned that the enactment of additional heritage bills could substantially increase the administrative and financial obligations of the nps some detractors assert that federal funds would be more appropriately spent on nps park units and other existing protected areas rather than on creating new heritage areas still others cite need for mechanism to hold the management entities accountable for the federal funds they receive and the decisions they make some observers recommend caution in creating nhas because in practice nhas may face an array of challenges to success for instance heritage areas may have difficulty providing the infrastructure that increased tourism requires such as additional parking lodging and restaurants other areas may need additional protective measures to ensure that increased tourism and development do not degrade the resources and landscapes still other nhas may require improvements in leadership and organization of the management entities including explaining their message and accomplishments some nhas may experience difficulty attracting funds because the concept is relatively recent and not universally accepted as sustainable approach to resource preservation or economic development some conservationists think the protective measures are not strong enough and some economic development professionals think the heritage idea does not fit the traditional framework for development also achieving and maintaining appropriate levels of public commitment to implementation may be challenging 7 7 information on challenges to nha success is found in jane daly heritage areas connecting

federal nha designation by helping them craft regional vision for heritage preservation and development the agency may provide variety of types of assistance to areas once designatedadministrative financial policy technical and public information the nps seeks to serve as catalyst by offering assistance to designated heritage areas only for limited number of years specifically the bush administrationnps has sought legislation that would limit each heritage area to more than 1 million per year not to exceed 10 million per area over 15 years see below once heritage area is designated by congress the nps typically enters into cooperative agreement or compact with the designated management entity often comprised of local activists to help plan and organize the area the compact outlines the goals for the heritage area and defines the roles and contributions of the nps and other partners typically setting out the parameters of the npss technical assistance it also serves as the legal vehicle for channeling federal funds to nongovernmental management entities at congressional direction the nps also prepares studies as to whether areas are suitable for designating as nhas the nps often testifies before congress on the results of these studies the studies typically address variety of topics including whether an area has resources reflecting aspects of american heritage that are worthy of recognition conservation and continued use they usually discuss whether an area would benefit from being managed through publicprivate partnership and if there is community of residents businesses nonprofit organizations and state and local agencies that would work to support heritage area legislation authorizing an nha might follow positive study recommenda tion although such recommendation is not requirement for enacting legislation to designate an nha representatives of the bush administration testified in the 108 th 109th and 110th congresses in support of developing systemic nha legislation to list the qualities prospective area must possess and the parameters under which designation could occur for instance at march 30 2004 hearing of senate energy

strong support for legislation to establish national heritage program while suggesting modifications to s 2543 108th congress on behalf of doi9 further in hearings during the last few congresses the

board conducted review of nhas the herita ge partnership program and future nps involvement with nhas 2006 report contains the advisory boards findings and recommendations key recommendation is to establish legislative foundation for system of nhas in the park service based on specified concepts concepts include requiring feasibility study to demonstrate that future proposed heritage areas meet certain criteria setting standards for management planning that include business plan and protecting the rights of private property owners another reco mmendation is to develop performance measures

national heritage areas system composed of current and future nhas it sought to provide standards and processes for conducting feasibility studies designating nhas and developing and approving management plans it aimed to protect the rights of property owners the draft also would have authorized the secretary of the interior to provide technical and financial assistance to local

the secretary of the interior to award competitive grants to local coordinating entities whose financial assistance has ended the grants could be used for individual projects at nhas that further the purposes of the management plan the bills sought to protect private property owners for instance by not requiring their participation in nha plans and activities they also sought to protect existing regulatory authoritiesfor example by not altering any duly adopted land use regulation approved land use plan or other regulatory authority they set out the responsibilities of local coordinating entities and the authorities of the secretary of the interior through the nps they further set out the relationship between the nha system and the national park system stating explicitly that nhas
