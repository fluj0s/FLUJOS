review by the appropriate named fiduciary if participant is denied plan benefit3 to accomplish such full and fair review the department of labor dol requir that plans establish review procedures for participants interested in appealing benefit denials4 the internal review structure outlined by the dol has few guidelines the appropriate named fiduciary has 60 days to issue decision after receiving claimants request for review under special circumstances the fiduciary has up to 120 days after the receipt of the request for review to issue decision5 these minimal guidelines have promoted little uniformity among the internal review procedures of employersponsored plans further while some plans provide external review procedures none are required although the managed care industry contends that the existin g claims procedure works well and fears that an additional level of review will increase costs many believe that improved procedures will not only empower patients but enhance access to treatment and improve the quality of care provided6 the creation of mandatory external review process for benefit denials is one of the most fundamental changes being considered by congress proponents argue that external review would act as an oversight mechanism that could identify procedural errors provide substantive review and detect patterns of inappropriate denials7 in addition they believe that external review would assure participants of an impartiality and independence that may be lacking in the internal review process8 congress is not alone in focusing on the external review process in its report on managed care and the rights of patients the presidents advisory commission on consumer protection and quality in the health care industry stated that consumers were entitled to fair and efficient process for resolving differences with their health plans including an independent system of external review9 numerous states have enacted statutes that require independent review for managed care participants who believe that their claims for benefits have been wrongfully denied10 however in corporate health insurance inc v texas department of insurance the
