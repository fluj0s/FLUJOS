classified by dcm richard lebaron for reasons 14 b and d 1 c summary fco russia caucasus and central asia director michael davenport told dcm that hmg was conducting parallel exercises involving cabinet intelligence and foreign office principals designed to give pm brown clearer picture of russian foreign policy making processes and recommendations for dealing with moscow he said the papers will underline that the uk sees recent russian foreign policy actions as continuum in moscows goal to maintain influence in its near abroad but that many of the tactics employed have been hit and miss leading to an uncoordinated opportunistic approach the paper will therefore recommend hardheaded robust when necessary engagement with russia coordinated among nato and eu allies end summary hmg policy paper on russia 2 c davenport explained that hmg was conducting parallel exercises involving cabinet intelligence and foreign office principals designed to give pm brown clearer picture of russian foreign policy making processes and recommendations for dealing with moscow he confessed that volumes had been produced in the exercise but that the foreign office contribution had been winnowed down to single draft which had been passed for review to fs miliband and other cabinet ministers the week of october 13 3 c in previewing that text davenport explained that the paper included the results of an internal hmg debate over whether there had been strategic shift in russian foreign policy the process of producing the paper revealed some internal divides within hmg particularly as to whether posture of cold war type containment should be employed to counter moscows more aggressive stance recently those more familiar with russian policy in hmg were able according to davenport to show the inappropriateness of such tactic given the more integrated russian international presence compared to 20 years ago particularly in the worldwide economy hardheaded engagement 4 c the uk sees recent russian foreign policy actions as continuum in moscows goal to maintain influence in its near abroad and to deter western influence especially nato enlargement the uk therefore reads the military action in georgia as part of pattern exemplified by recent russian policy on cfe missile defense and other multilateral initiatives in implementation of the same strategy davenport views the tactics employed by moscow in that regard as hit and miss leading to an opportunistic approach as opposed to coordinated planning process in the kremlin he cites russias recognition of south ossetian and abkhazian independence as tactical adhocery which many in moscow might now regret given the lack of support for recognition even from russias close friends 5 c looking ahead davenport predicts russia will use all available levers to pursue its goals it will prefer employing political economic social and intelligence methods and resources but georgia has shown that military means are part of the kremlins tactical lexicon the fco paper will therefore identify areas of joint advantage to focus uk and multilateral cooperation with russia particularly in the energy and commercial sectors according to davenport the uk proposes hardheaded robust when necessary engagement with russia coordinated among nato and eu allies to include dialogue and cooperation where possible so as not to isolate moscow davenport noted that fm miliband has invited russian fm lavrov to visit london at mutually convenient time more resilient approach 6 c as examples of this more resilient approach davenport cites the need for deeper transatlantic engagement with former soviet states to support their european aspirations without challenging russia coherent nato policy towards georgia and ukraine to advance bucharest summit goals and more comprehensive european energy policy to include alternate sources improved efficiency and supply diversity as means of countering russian influence some kremlinology london 00002643 002 of 002 7 c within russia davenport underlines that there has been radical change in the political and economic landscape over the past 15 years while the political system is best described as corrupt autocracy it is confident one the economy is stronger and more vibrant with far broader industrial base the putinmedvedev relationship is also evolving with both showing assertiveness during the georgia conflict hmgs view is that putin still holds the reins particularly on ukrainerelated issues but allows medvedev to control events once broad policy has been agreed 8 c comment the broad and high level engagement in this exercise across hmg is an indication of the seriousness with which pm brown and his close advisors are treating russian relations the uk has had more experience lately than most western european countries with moscows ire going back to the litvinenko poisoning case and continuing through the titfor tat diplomatic expulsions and closure of number of british council offices in russia the uk through the stock taking and forward looking elements which will be contained within this paper is clearly trying to put relations back on the right track bilaterally while ensuring moscow understands the consequences of its foreign policy end comment visit londons classified website httpwwwintelinksgovgovwikiportalunit ed_kingdom lebaron
