section 62 64 after ms vesselovs and mr taylorsons initial review they determined that none of the proposals met all of the re quirements of the sow for ground fuel63 however the committee found texacos prop osal to be compliant even though there were some outstanding issues that needed to be addressed texaco had not indicated whether it had service stations in the three locations menti oned in the rfp it also needed to confirm whether it would be able to deliver fuel to generators in as yet unspecified locations 65 the second supplier total haiti was deemed to be partially compliant before it could be ranked fully compliant the comm ittee needed to know whether total haiti could deliver fuel to generators 66 esso was completely eliminated from the exercise because it offered only bulk fuel and did quote prices for service station fu the evaluators therefore found esso to be completely noncompliant64 67 the final supplier dinasa too was f ound to be noncompliant despite this characterization the committee nonetheless asked procurement to clarify dinasas proposal in particular procurement needed to clarify whether dinasa had service stations in the three specified locations and wh ether it would be able to deliver fuel to generators 65 68 in response the missions procurement section contacted each of the three vendors to obtain the requested information66 59

was missing tex acos financial proposal for aviation fuel and another set of financial proposals had been opened and resealed he also referred to handwritten changes on total haitis prices which were not initialled by the vendor he found this highly unusual since they came with explanation or si gnatures certifying those corrections 69 71 the next day ms shane wrote to mr kovlev and denied opening the financial proposals except for texacos70 she claimed that texaco had submitted only one proposal and minustah needed to make c opy for their records which she noted on the bid summary sheet71 see above figure she surmised that the proposals must have been opened between us and you72 72 significantly all financial proposals d been opened at the mission and therefore ms shane misrepresent ed this fact to mr yakovlev73 73 ms shane added that the mission noticed the same handwritten price changes to total haitis bid74 total haiti later confirmed the company made those changes but had never been required to certify the new prices75 74 there is evidence that commercial eval uation or an abstract of bids was ever completed instead on 17 june 2004 mr yakovlev sent staff member 9 an email

dinasa staff member 9 did not recall mr yakovlev informing him that the technical team previously ruled dinasa as noncompliant or explaining how it suddenly became qualified78 76 mr yakovlev then

dinasas offer for bulk fuel not service stations though he did not sp ecifically state this it appears mr yakovlev reached this figure by multiplying dinasas unit prices for bulk fuel by the monthly consumption estimates which amounted to us115440 78 since the amount of both contracts fell within staff member 9s delegation of authority they did not have to be pres ented to any committee on contracts which would expedite their execution 79 mr yakovlev expected th mission to be able to obtain the fuel by the needed date of 21 june 2004 finally mr yakovlev stated that the 79 procurement

strictly confidential ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ page 19 problems with technical and commercial evaluations 1 technical evaluation 82 as stated above on 9 june 2004 the t echnical evaluation committee advised that certain clarifications were needed from the three remaining vendors before it could determine whether some of the proposals were compliant on 14 june 2004 mr vesselov forwarded copy to the mission but sp ecifically cautioned that this was merely draft which could only be finalized pendi ng receipt of clarifications from vendors85 83 on 15 june 2005 the vendors responded and provided the requested information the task force found evidence that this information was conveyed to mr yakovlev as result his commercial evaluation nd recommendation of award was premature 84 on 15 june 2004 dinasa confirmed that it i ndeed had service sta tions in the three areas mentioned86 dinasa added however that th mission would ve to pay higher prices if it sought to use these stations an additional us0360 per litre because of third party operational costs 87 dinasa further confirmed it w ould be able to deliver fuel to generators with its own fleet of delivery trucks or by subco ntracting the work88 85 even though texaco had been ranked co mpliant the technical evaluators still requested further information89 texaco responded and nt chart indicating it had service stations in two of the three request ed locations gonaives and cap haitien it did not appear to clarify any availability in portauprince although texaco agreed to deliver fuel to generators located in most of haiti it was unable to transport fuel to jeremie and noted that delivery to portdepaix was very difficult90 86 total haiti deemed partially compliant had only been asked whether it could deliver fuel to generators in its 16 june 2004 response it confirmed that it could meet this requirement91 87 based on the information pr ovided all three vendors s hould have been found technically compliant total haiti initially had been ranked as c onditionally compliant pending clarification of generator fuel92 its response confirmed this information and as result total haiti should have been deemed fully compliant 93 85 andrei vesselov email to james boynton 14 june 2004 requiring verification before they could

procurement strictly confidential ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ page 20 88 similarly it appears that dinasa also would have been compliant based on its responses to the clarifications94 finally texaco had already been deemed fully compliant before the request for clarifications was issued95 89 final technical evaluation however was completed96 the technical evaluation committee never drafted final written assessment summarizing this information and indicating which vendors were compliant 97 90 staff member 7 in subsequent interv iew confirmed that in light of the vendors responses to the request for clarifications he woul d have considered all three proposals texaco dinasa and total haiti to be technically complia nt to supply ground fuel 98 91 nonetheless mr yakovlev claimed that only dinasa was technically compliant for ground fuel since he wrote that the technical evaluation performed by lsd copy on file assessed 2 companies as technica lly compliant and then recommended the award to texaco and dinasa it follows that he meant only texaco aviation and dinasa ground were compliant99 92 there was reason for mr yakovlev to conclude that di nasa was the only compliant supplier of ground fuel in fact total haitis initial proposal had been technically superior to dinasas since it d initially been rated as partially compliant there was way that additional information could turn total haiti from partially compliant to non compliant 100 it is entirely implausible that by providing missing information total haiti suddenly went from conditionally compliant to noncompliant 101 93 in fact mr yakovlev later contradicted his own conclusion in subsequent correspondence in may 2005 mr yakovlev was reviewing the missions presentation to the committee on contracts for an extension of the dinasa contract he noted that in the original bidding there were 4 bidders tex aco total dinasa and esso out of the 4 the first 3 were found compliant and 2 dinasa and texaco were awarded the contracts102 94 mr yakovlevs recommendation that the gr ound fuel contract be awarded to dinasa was therefore based upon material misrepresentation it is unclear whether this was intentional or inadvertent due to co mplete lack of proper documentation in the files 94 id 95 draft technical evaluation

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ page 21 2 commercial evaluation 95 had total haiti been properly included in the commercial evaluation mr yakovlev would have realised that it wa s the lowest bidder for ground fuel 96 after an exhaustive review of procurement and dpko records the task force has been unable to locate bid abstract or formal commercial evaluation minustah also did not have copy of nything resembling bid abstract103 when ms shane later assigned the fuel case to subject 4 he noticed that the case file wa s disorganized and he did not recall seeing either tec hnical or commercial evaluation104 97 therefore it appears that the only documentation supporting mr yakovlevs recommendation was his single email to staff member 9 in which he merely concluded that split award should be gi ven to texaco for aviation fuel and dinasa for ground fuel he supplied backup information such as financial spreadsheet or final technical evaluation 98 while the mission likely needed bulk fuel and fuel delivered from service stations the rfp did not specify the quantitie s it would need it also did not specify which type of fuel would be used to evaluate the financial proposals105 99 even without proper backup documenta tion it appears that mr yakovlev reached the contract value of us115440 by using dinasas prices for bulk fuel106 in an expost facto presentation to the local committee on contracts regarding later extension of the contract with dinasa nustah advised that t he pricing structure agreed to is based on bulk fuel107 100 dinasas bulk fuel prices however were not the lowest on the contrary dinasa was in fact more expensive than tota l haiti and texaco excluding taxes108 103

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ page 23 104 the two areas in which dinasa had the most problems was w ith its invoicing system and the delivery of fuel outside port auprince as for it s invoicing thousands of transactions were carried out monthly and were reco rded in hand writing making this accounting prone to mistakes112 the mission received long lists of inaccurate funny numbers billing from dinasa113 as result dinasa was not maintaining timely accurate and complete records for billing114 when the was late or did not pay its bills dinasa threatened to stop supplying the mission with fuel115 the mission had requested that dinasa implement an elec tronic data capturing system to record the retail and generator fuel instead of relyi ng on handwritten business records but it was never done116 105 second dinasa had major logistical prob lems in delivering fuel to locations outside the capital portauprince117 it was using substandard fuel tankers and even more troubling was the fact that staff repor ted discrepancies between the reported amount of fuel dinasa billed the and th amount of fuel it actually delivered118 on more than one occasion dinasa delivered the wrong quantity of fuel and at any given time thousands of gallons might be missing at delivery119 as result dinasa had failed to rise to the challenge and support minustah with the in creasing demands for fuel even after problems have b een identified and flagged120 106 dinasas initial onemonth contract was extended

the technical evaluation committee explained that it f ound skylink technically complia nt with score of 97 178 total haiti addressed most re quirementsexcept the staffing plan which in itself was not substantial pa rt of the rfp179 since total haiti had only presented mobilization plan in broad strokes the committee wanted clarifications on this issue before it gave it final rating as result total haiti was conditionally technically compliant with score of 68 until such confirmation was received180 130 finally dinasa had received failing sc ore of 52 out of 100 and therefore was found to be technically non compliant because it did not address all the requirements of the rfp181 dinasa had failed to present distribution and mobilization plan which not only represents lack of understanding of minustahs requirements but affects directly the insta llation of the contractor managed sites which are substantive requi rement of the rfp182 figure technical evaluation committee morandum to

133 unlike skylink and total haiti dinasa was missing critical information in its proposal indeed the failure to provide m obilization plan was so significant that it would not have been appropriate to allow th company to resubmit this information at this stage since this would have given dinasa second chance to bid186 accordingly the team considered that dinasa to be eliminated from the competition187 at this stage dinasa was considered out of the runni ng and only total hai and skylink were eligible for the contract188 2 request for clarifications 25 april 2005 134 after the technical evaluation committee issued its request for clarifications the four members of the tende r evaluation committee met to discuss the situation189 subject 3 subject 5 subject 4 and mr

evaluation and agreed that certain clarifications were needed before final overall evaluation could take place all four member s also agreed however that information would be sought from dinasa

the requisite information204 he insisted that he knew th company could perform under the contract205 140 despite chairing the earlier technical evaluation committee that unequivocally found dinasa noncompliant subject 3 now cl aimed that they had made mistake dinasa should have been rated conditionally compliant not noncompliant206 i t i s unclear why subject 3 suddenly changed his position 141

reach difficult locations like jeremie and hinche283 173 as for its pricing however staff memb erit is unclear whomtold total haiti that its prices were not problem and implied that it did not need to

in which the mission was dramatically reducing its consumption from over 16 million litres per year to just over 2 million litres303 dinasas price increase violat ed the bafo and the procurement

generator fuel discussed infra in paragraphs 271 et seq 182 in spite of dinasas violation the evalua tors did not disqualify dinasa from the bafo exercise they later justified their deci sion on the

hold bafo after the bafo dinasa submitted mobilization plan at add itional cost and was found to be the lowest provider consequently procurement and supp ly sections reached joint conclusion that dinasa should be awarded the contract360 208 the presentation did not explain that the technical team unconditionally found dinasa to be noncompliant and hence disqualifi ed it also did not disclose

sserted that it indeed was permitted because clarifications including thos involving technical issues could be an element of bafo363 dinasa initially was deemed non compliant due to its failure to submit the information on this infrastructure and mobilization plan however it was known factor that dinasas infrastructure in hait i is superior to that of its competitors therefore it was deemed to be in the best interest of the organization to include dinasa in the list for bafo364 211 notably procurement did not explain that the technical evaluators considered dinasas lack of mobilizat ion plan to be material omission not merely minor deficiency365 212 the lcc then asked why procurement si mply did not request clarification instead of issuing bafo in response pr ocurement opaquely

the mission worked collectively on the answers for the hcc in its response the ssion confirmed that bo th the financial and technical evaluations were opened at the same time on the date of the bid opening377 procurement then referred to december 2004 correspondence from the thenchief of procurement services in unhq who had authorized such procedure378 220 notably the mission did not disclose the fact that procurement intentionally turned over the financial bids to the techni cal evaluators before they completed their evaluation b reason for bafo 221 the mission claimed it invited dinasa to pa rticipate in the bafo to ensure fair competition and because it was in the uns interest to do so379 the mission opined that the purpose of the bafo was to give chance to qua lified vendors to strengthen identified weaknesses in their original proposal380 dinasa has been qualified contractor in the past and its bafo proposal demonstrated that they understood the rfp and bafo requirements381 222 similarly the mission asserted that skylink and total haiti were indeed treated fairly because all vendors received the sa documents for the rfp and the bafo moreover all vendors who submitted proposal s were invited to submit bafo and thus had the chance to reconsider their offer382 c pricefuel consumption changes 223 finally the mission asserted incorrectlythat unit prices did not change rather the mission changed the estimate d quantities of fuel in its analysis383 when the tender evaluation committee evaluated the ba fo responses it used the figure of 204 million litres per year in consumption rather th an the originally stated 324 million litres found in the sow and rfp 224 subject 4 explained that when the so w was prepared in september 2004 the troops were not fully deployed

natalia nedel from unps attended the meeting subject 6 who was in new york at the time was as ked to attend as representative of minustah386 226 at the meeting ms nedel and subject 6 answered more questions posed by the hcc they admitted that it was not the co rrect procedure for technical and financials to be opened by toc at same time howeve r they felt there was problem here because subject 6 confirmed that pricing information was not revealed when the proposals were opened and that the techni cal evaluation was conduc ted independent of financial evaluation 387 notably he misrepresented this fact to the hcc subject 6 knew subject 4 had intentionally turned over the fi nancial bids to subject 3 before his team completed technical evaluation 227 as for the bafo they claimed that the purpose of the bafo was to give all vendors chance to reduce their prices388 when asked whether it was appropriate to invite noncompliant vendor to participate in bafo s ubject 6 replied that it not routinely done but here it was done on an exceptional basis when the hcc asked what was so exceptional in this case he had answer389 228 with respect to pricing total haiti originally had been th lowest priced supplier after bafo however dinasa submitted the west prices subject 6 confirmed that dinasa had changed its pr icing based on the bafo390 229 as for fuel estimates they told the hcc th at the fuel estimates used to evaluate the bafo responses were based on revised qu antities these new quantities combined with dinasas bafo prices led to change in the ranking with dinasa emerging as the lowest proposer391 they did not disclose the fact that the numbers used for the bafo evaluation had been manipulated to favour dinasa 384 subject 4 email to natalia nedel 15 july 2005 385 hcc

extensive review the hcc found that the mission violated several sections of the procurement manual during this procurement 231 first the proposed fuel contract wa s valued at approximately nte us30 million and thus exceeded the missions fina ncial threshold under its local procurement authority lpa392 consequently the mission shoul d have requested an lpa from unhq before it engaged in any procurement exercise393 subject 6 conceded this had not been done and unps never granted minu stah the appropriate authority for the exercise 394 232 second the technical and financial propos als were opened simultaneously by the tender opening committee in violation of the procurement manual irrespective of compliance395 233 third the hcc found that the procuremen t process was not conducted in fair manner because the mission should never have invited noncompliant vendor to participate in the bafo by doing so the mission gave dinasa second bite at the apple 396 the committee noted that dinasa did not simply fail to submit distribution plan but that the initial eval uation found other deficiencies as well the earlier technical evaluation graded dinasa low due to logistical problems in delivering fuel to areas outside portauprince discrepa ncies in reported versus actua l deliveries of bulk fuel and its failure to implement an ectronic data capturing system397 234 the committee did not accept the missi ons explanation for the bafo an exercise it found to be unnecessary it concluded that the bafo was likely issued with view to leaving the present contracting arrangement in place 398 235 in light of the deficiencies in the pr ocurement process and unps serious reservations about how the procurement had been conducted the committee rejected the contract with dinasa 399 instead it recommended that th contract be awarded to total haiti the vendor which submitted the west prebafo qualified submission400 236 when assistant secretarygeneral for central support services andrew toh adopted the hcc minutes and the award to to tal haiti he directed the chair of the hcc to draft letter to the cpo of minustah the letter was to advise the cpo of the hccs findings notify

was awarded on the missions assessment of best value for mone and was in compliance with the financial rules and regulations as well as established procurement procedures407 240 after total haiti was awarded the contract the mission entered into prolonged contractual negotiations with the company408 one of the hotly contested issues was the change in fuel consumption figuresan issue both the fuel unit and procurement knew about well before the award the amount of the award 207 million litres was far below the estimated fuel consumption from the request for proposal 324 million litres 409 total haiti viewed the 30 decrease as signifi cant and insisted that its original prices were tied to the original volumes410 241 despite extensive meetings and lengt hy negotiations minstah never reached final agreement with total haiti as result since july 2004 the has been purchasing ground fuel from dinasa without longterm written c ontract in place x the task force eva luat i on favouritism to dinasa 1 bafo exercise 242 the bafo in this case was not conducted in fair and transparent manner but rather as means to award dinasa the contract 243 after the initial evaluati ons the mission had two technically compliant vendors from which to choose dinasa as nonco mpliant vendor should not have been invited to the bafo411 in light of the vast price differenc between skylink and total haiti bafo was never even necessary as the hc c later concluded total haiti should have been awarded the contract after the initial technical and commerci evaluations the only reason bafo was held was to

strictly confidential ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ page 59 244 subject 1 and subject 6 argue d that dinasas failure to provide mobilization plan was not so substantial that it should have been considered noncompliant subject 1 reasoned that dinasa as incumbent may have believed it did not need to provide this information because the mission already had it 412 he believed dinasa should have been asked to clarify this aspect of its proposal413 likewise subject 6 claimed that dinasa should not have been charac terized as noncompliant beca use the procurement manual allows for opportunities to correct deficiency414 245 it was clear that dinasas proposal did not merely need to be clarified it was missing important information and did not re spond to an essential part of the rfp415 even subject 1 conceded that dinasa may not have been asked for clarifications because it would be too huge and essentially it woul d be giving dinasa second shot to respond416 for this reason the technical evalua tion committee consistently ranked it noncompliant and did not belie ve it was appropriate to requ est clarification from the company417 once dinasa was deemed noncompliant its financial bid should not have been opened and it should have been di squalified from the procurement the procurement manual indeed permits competitive negotiations with sufficient number of qualified proposers that have reasonab chance for award it also allows procurement to point out the d eficiencies in the proposals and vendors to revise their proposals 418 the purpose of bafo however is to ensure effective competition 419 246 here dinasa did not have reasonable chance for award nor was the lack of mobilization plan mere deficiency more importantly the fuel unit and procurement did not conduct the bafo to ensure effective competition they held it only so dinasa could have second opportunity to remain in the procuremen t exercise and continue as the missions supplier 420 247 despite subject 1s claim that the bafo was wellintentioned the task force finds that procurement exercise which fail ed to be undertaken fairly and which was intentionally conducted to favour one vendor is never in the uns best interest421 as 412 subject 1 interview 7 march 2007 and subject 6 interview 14 may 2007

was not conducted in the best interests of the 422 2 manipulation of the technical and commercial evaluations 248 the procurement section and fuel unit t ogether colluded to manipulate both the technical and commercial evaluations for th bafo responses in order to make sure dinasa won the contract senior management was involved and in fact directed or at least approved of the bidrigging they included the cas subject 1 the oic of procurement subject 2 team leader in procurement subject 6 and the chief of the fuel unit subject 3 249 it began with the technical evaluation wh ich senior procurement officials wanted to review before it was issued to make sure the figures were okay423 since subject 4 and subject 5 had been told di nasa was to win the contract they knew dinasas technical score had to be the highest accordi ngly when the tender evaluation committee assessed dinasas response to the bafo they increased dinasas score for each category and made sure it was higher than sk ylinks this was small feat skylink had previously been ranked at 97 points so dinasas score had to jump from 52 points to 98 points the rigged evalua tion was then presented to senior managers prior to its release for their approval 250 rigging the technical evaluation howeve r was not enough since dinasas prices were still higher than total haitis senior staff members directed and instructed their employees subject 4 and subject 5 to do whatever needs to be done to make sure dinasa is the hi ghest in score424 specifically subject 4 an d subject 5 had to make solid case for selecting dinasa so dinasas prices had to be lower425 251 consequently subject 3 sat down with subject 5 and helped him adjust the fuel quantities in way that favoured dinasa t ogether they increased the requirement for bulk fuel since dinasa offered lower prices in that category by manipulating the fuel estimates they were finally able to make dinasa the lowest priced vendor once again the new figures were presented to seni or staff members for their approval 252 as subject 4 admitted we fa voured dinasa thats true 426 even subject 1 who did not admit to any manipulation nonethel ess conceded that dinasa should have been given little bit of second shot to correct its proposal despite the deficiencies427 he justified this by claiming that since dina sa was the incumbent if the disqualified the company for failure to provide mobili zation plan dinasa would have complained 428 422 staff member 11 interview 21 march 2007 423 subject 4 interview 24 may 2007 424 id 425 subject 5

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ page 61 3 possible release of confidential information 253 the task force has uncovered evidence that suggests dinasa may have been provided confidential informati on during the procurement exer cise first the initial technical evaluation stated that dinasa woul d be technically compliant if it included mobilization plan at additional cost since technical assessment is completely unrelated to costs or pricing this statement is highly suspect the technical evaluation should have merely requested that plan be submitted irrespective of its cost 254 dinasa confirmed that the mission told the company to submit mobilization plan in response to the bafo and it had to do so without any costs 429 at this time commercial evaluation had already been comp leted and everyone was aware that dinasa was not the lowest bidder consequently the fact that th ey told dinasa to submit plan at cost may have been an attempt to signal to dinasa to keep its prices down in order to bid lower total haiti 255 second troubling aspect was that dina sa increased pricing for one specific area430 while it lowered certain unit prices dinasa raised its price in one area generator fuel for portauprince significantly this was the category of fuel that the mission dramatically reduced its consumption from ove r 16 million litres per year to just over 2 million litres 431 subject 6 later told the task force that othe r vendors decreased prices because the revised quantities changed but he did not elaborate as to whether this meant dinasa learned of the revised quantities432 256 dinasas price increase raises the question as to whether someone at the mission provided the company with conf idential information dinasa denied having any inside information regarding the substa ntial reduction in generator fuel instead it claimed that any increase in prices was miscalculation by the computer that the excel spreadsheet rounded up numbers after certain number of decimal points and as result certain prices increased slightly 433 257 finally dinasa learned that under the fi nal evaluation total haiti was higher than dinasa when dinasa met with staff member s of oios it complained that dinasa did not win even though its offer was m uch more realistic for minustah434 i n i t s formal complaint dinasa again referred to the fact that total haiti won the ground fuel contract for minustah despite ving higher price than dinasa435 w h n l t r questioned about this mr carl boisson

had been more expensive436 258 subject 4 admitted that it was obvious di nasa had inside information because it only increased the price for that one area437 indeed subject 1 subject 2 and subject 6 all commented to him that there had to be leak in the mission438 259 furthermore during the procurement exerci certain staff members appeared to have closer than usual rela tionship with certain employees at dinasa for example subject 3 stated that he hoped dinasa would win the contract439 similarly when he later learned that dinasa did not wi n the longterm contract he wrote to say that i have heavy heart is an understatement440 at the same time s ubject 4 was looking into renting house from mr ronald je an representative of dinasa441 260 the task force has been unable to corr oborate any disclosure of confidential information nonetheless in light of th way the overall procurement exercise was conducted to favour dinasa the task force has difficult time believing this was merely coincidental 261 similarly the task force has been unabl to determine whether the favouritism shown to dinasa was due to criminal conduct or bribery dinasa denied that any staff member ever solicited bribe442 since the task forc does not have subpoena power and only one staff memb er partially complied with the financial disclosure request the task force is unable to reach any definitive conclusion b procurement violations 1 the tender opening 262 subject 3 should not have been part of the tender opening committee since he was both the requisitioner and the chief of the fuel unit responsible for leading the technical evaluation of the proposals443 his participation theref ore violated procurement manual 10113 which prohibits requisitioners from serving on the toc444 t h

discovered this vi olation after seeing subject 3s signature on the bid opening sheet447 neither subject 1 nor subject 6 appears to have taken any steps to dete rmine whether subject 3 saw the pricing information or investigated any compromise of the procurement exercise448 265 second the financial proposals should not have been opened before final technical evaluation had been completed nd received the tender opening committee violated procurement manual section 1084 when it opened both sets of proposals at the same time absent any exceptional circumstances449 266 even if minustah was following policy that permitted bids to be opened simultaneously the hcc found that this prac tice was done irrespectiv of compliance further subject 1 admitted to the task force that the both sets of evaluations should not have been opened at the same time450 2 disclosure of financial proposals 267 subject 3 should not have requestedand subject 4 should not have provided the vendors pricing proposals prior to the completion of technical evaluation accordingly to subject 4 subject 6 explicit ly and the cpo at the time subject 1 implicitly approved of his actions451 regardless of any cl aim by subject 3 that he needed this information for budgetary purposes pricing is not supposed to be considered when performing technical evaluation 268 the financial proposals should not have been opened with the technical bids absent exceptional ci rcumstances moreover the financ ial bids especially should not have been released to the technical evaluato rs until final techni cal evaluation had been completed and received by procurement452 consequently the disclosure and approval of such disclosure violated the procurement manual 269 first these individuals violated section 1084 of the

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ page 64 evaluation453 on the contrary procurement actua lly provided the technical evaluators with copies of the financial proposals 270 they also violated section 11622 of the procurement manual because the technical assessment was not performed without prior knowledge of cost which expressly dictates that under circumst ance shall any cost da ta furnished by the vendors be released to the requisitioner pr ior to the finalization of the technical evaluation454 3 material change in the rfp 271 the fuel unit and procurement discovered during the bidding exercise that the fuel estimates had changed dramatically and ye t this information was not disclosed to the vendors reduction of fuel by 30 was material change in the rfp455 whenever there is significant change in the requirements the pr ocurement should be rebid456 accordingly the procurement likely shoul d have been terminated and new one commenced at the very least procuremen t should have notified the vendors of this material change during the bafo457 272 when the original fuel quantities were developed in the fall of 2004 the missions troop strength was not fully deployed at that tim the troop strength was less than 50458 however by the time of the evalua tions and subsequent bafo in may 2005 troop strength had reached 95 and the supply section had been able to provide better estimates of actual consumption 459 the mission therefore ne eded less fuel in light of the new troop strength460 the new fuel estimates had thus changed significantly and they learned that the fuel unit had grossly overestimated the consumption figures in the rfp461 273 another reason for the delay in determin ing actual consumption was attributable to dinasa dinasas late submission of i nvoices made it difficult for the fuel unit to know the actual consumption figures462 in fact dinasa did t start submitting invoices on regular basis until february march and april 2005463 453 procurement manual section 1084 4 454 procurement manual section 11622 see also section 11653 the procurement officer adds the

process of finalizing new contract for generators which would have included the provision of generator fuela commodity requested in the original ground fuel rfp464 this contract would have drastically reduced the amount of generator fu needed in portauprince under the long term ground fuel contract465 as discussed above this wa s the one category of fuel in which dinasa raised its prices 275 accordingly the fuel unit knew about th decrease in consumption as early as april 2005466 by this point they knew actual consumption wa s approximately 30 less than anticipated467 such large decrease constituted material change to the sow which vendors woul d want to know468 however the fuel it did not update this information in the bafo 276 similarly even after procurement learned the fuel estimates were much lower than originally stated in the rfp it did not disclose this information in the bafo469 subject 6 later claimed that the major r eason for the bafo was the change in fuel estimates fact the fuel unit orally informed procurement about several weeks before it was issued470 he added that subject 1 or subject 2 told him about the new numbers471 yet procurement took steps to inform vendors of this major reason as result the vendors purportedly were not given an opportunity to bid on the new fuel estimates 277 subject 4 discussed this issue with subject 6 and subject 2 w ho decided that they could not mention the fuel reductions in the bafo472 pursuant to the procurement manual bafo could not materially change the sow bafo only allowed vendor to lower its prices reduce warranties or provide other benefits to the un473 i f procurement had substantially changed the fu consumptions it would not have been able to issue the bafo474 such material change to the rfp would have required re bidding of the procurement subject 1 insiste d and the others agree d that rebid was out of the question475 they claimed that the mission simply did not have time to recommence

involved in the technical eval uation of the bids which had been done by committee 478 when advised by inves tigators that it appeared the technical evaluation team indeed had pr icing information subject 1 replied that he disagreed479 he never disclosed to the task force that he learned subject 4 had in fact provided the financial bids to subject 3 281 he also opined that the technical evaluation committee should not have disqualified dinasa but rather stated that it did not have ough information to assess the bid480 he believed dinasa should have been gi ven an opportunity to better its technical offer481 he characterized his staffs hand ling of this as well intentioned482 282 subject 1 did not disclose the fact that the bafo was designed to keep dinasa in the procurement by essentially allowing it to have another chance to resubmit proposal so it could win the contract on th contrary when investigators asked whether it was fair to invite nonco mpliant vendor to participate in the bafo he claimed the process was indeed fair since the other vendors were also invited to participate483 283 as for favouritism subject 1 admitted so degree of special treatment because dinasa was the incumbent he commented that if dinasa had not been the current contractor this would not have been an issue 484 procurement knew it was giving dinasa another bite at the apple as the hcc commen ted which is why it did this in such roundabout way485 his guys cut corners little by holding the bafo and giving dinasa an opportunity to say i t had mobilization costs486 further he believed 477 balakrishnan amirthalingam email to subject 1 2 0 december 2005 fundamental reason why total had asked for the change in the contract duration is because of the substantial reduction

vendor to correct its deficiency509 he criticized the committee the stupidity of the team calling dinasa noncompliant and said its techni cal evaluation was biased and invalid510 294 subject 6 claimed the decision to hold the bafo was collective decision taken by the supply section and procurement511 from procurement this included subject 6subject 2 and subject 1512 he did not agree with in

subject 6 did not accurately explain the purpose of the bafo in fact he provided contradicting reasons for the exercise in the procurement presentation to the committees on contracts he claimed the reason for the bafo was threefold which included skylinks excessive costs tota l haitis prices and dinasas missing mobilization plan however during an interview with the task force he later asserted that the major reason for the bafo was the change in the estimated fuel consumptions 515 296 subject 6 also defended that subject 4 dr afted the bafo and denied drafting this section on mobilization he said he simply approved the document along with subject 2 and subject 1516 he claimed to have idea why ma terial information about the reduced fuel consumption was omitted he also said it was the

stage of the procurement pr ior to the final evaluation subject 6 refused to comment and just said he would consider the matter and respond later519 h l t r claimed it was subject 4 who changed the quantities for the commercial evaluation following the bafo 520 he added that procurement was unable to change the fuel quantities which would have been done by the supply section subject 1 and senior management decided to use the new estimates for the bafo evaluation521 further he did not disclose the reason for the new number s was to lower dinasas total costs but instead claimed that these were the correct fuel consumption figures522 he also denied ever seeing subject 5s 7 june 2007 email to subject 4 with the attached fuel consumption figures under which to tal haiti was lower than dinasa523 when asked why new estimates were used in the final bafo financial evalua tion subject 6 merely defended that the consumption figures were changing by the hour and it was impossible for everyone to know what happened524 300 while subject 6 made some statements demonstrating an underlying favouritism he flatly denied any improper conduct to favour dinasa for example he commented that one wanted skylink and the fuel unit did not want tota l haiti because it did not have facilities in certain locations525 he admitted that they wanted dinasa because it already had existing stations that the coul d use conversely if total haiti won the award the mission would have to rely on the vendor to build gas stations526 301 when asked about subject 2s memorandum to the fuel unit asking which vendor it preferred subject 6 did not disclose the fact that this document was written to conceal the scheme instead he claimed it was drafted in response to security issues and which vendor would be better able to import fuel into haiti527 302 moreover subject 6 may have attempted to obstruct the investigation after he was interviewed by the task forcein wh ich he adamantly denied any

they completed the evaluation529 subject 6 reminded subject 4 that you know what to say subject 6 then asked subject 4 to call him once he finished his interview with the task force530 303 finally subject 6 testified in criminal trial at which he made several denials under oath which appear to cons titute perjury on 4 june 2007 subject 6 testified in united states federal court for th southern district of new york at the criminal trial of mr sanjaya bahel mr bahel former section chief at unps had been charged with accepting valuable new york city real estate in exchange for assisting vendor in obtaining valuable contracts 304 during subject 6s testimony on behalf of mr bahel the prosecution asked him if he had ever shown favouritism to particul ar vendor subject 6 testified that he had not the prosecution then asked whether he d ever asked subordinate to adjust rating for particular vendor he again denied this when asked whether he had ever done anything to assist dinasa he once again nied this in light of subject 6s active participation in rigging both the tech nical and commercial evaluation and his encouragement and direction to subject 4 and others subject 6 did not appear to testify truthfully and honestly at the trial accordingly his material misstatements under oath appear to violate the us criminal code 531 his testimony is attached as annex f 4 subject 3 305

using new fuel estimates532 he also said he could not recall why they used these new figures for th bafo commercial evaluation533 he believed these numbers were generated by subj ect 5 mr albert

and did not disclose the scheme or his role at his second interv iew after being presented with evidence of the manipulation he finally cooperated w ith the task force and confirmed this information however after and only after he received the task forces letter with its proposed findings he recanted much of his statements and accused investigators of being unprofessional and coercive as explained in his response 310 for example subject 4 initially asserted that he never spoke to his colleagues regarding the decision to offer bafo536 he later admitted that he had and the decision for the bafo was mutual one taken by subject 6 and subject 2 in consultation with subject 1 who said it was the best way to go537 likewise subject 4 initially denied meeting with total haiti and dinasa to di scuss their responses for the bafo538 after being shown subject 5s email re ferring to such meeting he conceded that he did in fact meet with vendor during this time539 311 similarly he initially claimed that he did not know about the change in fuel quantities and simply relied on the supply section540 it was not until his last interview after being presented with several drafts of the technical and commercial evaluations where he finally disclosed to investigators th at the sole purpose of bafo was to keep 535 in addition subject 3 was not fully forthcoming about when his unit learned of the change in fuel consumptions he admitted that the initial fuel estimates which he said had been calculated by unhq were inaccurate and off by 30 id 31 however he claimed that it was not

the conduct of supervisors and senior managers regarding influence over junior staff members from drafting documents to requiring approval of evaluatio ns before they were completed senior management placed great deal of pressure upon their employees and therefore hold the most responsibility 313 subject 6 would impose himself on other colleagues and he liked pushing in and taking over he had developed lot of unexpected power in procurement 542 he did not seem to know the limitations or appropriate conduc t of procurement officer543 when another staff member pointed out there were ethics that procurement officers had to follow he responded that but sometimes one has to push to get things done544 314 interestingly although subject 6 liked to take over cases he rarely took official responsibility for the file545 for example subject 6 help ed subject 4 draft the overall evaluation for the procurement of ground fuel and creatively came up with language to permit dinasa to remain in the exercise however the memorandum still went out under subject 4s name546 he also gave subject 4 the langua ge for the mobilization section in the bafo which had been written for dinasas benefit he also told subject 4 to highlight the section in bold547 315 similarly subject 3 was forceful he physically banged the desk and insisted that he did not want to cha nge fuel vendors because he was the one who would have to live with it548 subject 5 who had only just arri ved few months before felt extreme pressure to comply with his supervisors demands549 in fact subj ect 3 sat at the computer

subject 4 indeed attemp ted to solicit bribe from total haiti 329 first subject 4 confirmed much of mr cl ergers and mr kislanskis statements subject 4 eventually and reluctantly admitted that he did make two separate visits to total haiti one of which was w ith mr clerger and the second with both gentlemen he conceded he was alone and did not have an other representative fr om the mission he also admitted discussing the procurement exercise 330 subject 4s independent visit to vendor in the middle of procurement exercise was not the most prudent course of action while staff may visit vendors ideally he or she should be accompanied by another staff member and should obtain written direction from supervisor authorizing the visit582 the preferred course would be to have vendors attend

further supporting its accuracy mr kislanski had incentive or motive to fabricate this story on the contrary by making such allega tions he actually ri sked jeopardizing his and total haitis working relationship with th mission he and total haiti received material benefit financial or otherwise by coming forward and notifying oios of what transpired 334 fifth subject 4s subsequent conduct demonstrated consciousness of guilt after the task force interviewed subject 4 in may 2007 he called mr clerger to complain notably the task force had cautione d subject 4 not to discuss this case with anyone involved since the investigation was still pending subject 4 nevertheless told mr clerger that he had put subject 4 in an awkward situation which he did not appreciate584 335 finally this alleged incident took place during procurement exercise fraught with manipulation the allegation was that dinasa had been bribing employee company that was unfairly awarded the shor tterm contract s ubject 4s purported solicitation of kickback from total haiti was unsuccessful signi ficantly total haiti was not initially awarded the long term contract but dinasa was xii the task force findings and conclusions short term procurement exercise 336 the task force finds that shortterm procurement for ground fuel in minustah was fraught with irregularity and the failure to adhere to proper procedure the issues began at the tender opening when both th financial and technical proposals were opened simultaneously in violation of the procurement manual 337 at the request of unhqs fuel unit clar ifications were requested from total haiti dinasa and texaco before they could all be considered fully compliant after receipt of these clarifications however final technical evaluation was completed such an evaluation would have shown that ll three of these vendor s became technically compliant after providing th requested information 338 when mr yakovlev performed the comme rcial
