gradients and arc lecture given on 1 september 1966 thank you whats the date audience 1st of september ad 16 first september ad 16 saint hill special briefing course this lecture doesnt have any title because i dont have anything to talk to you about well i could talk to you about lot of things and there was request that i speak to you about how to coach and actually ill teach you how to coach this way anyone who doesnt coach well should be labeled suppressive now you can learn all about coaching now there is lot ofcoaching is an area of opinion and its an area of how do you go about it to do this and that well normally i go about it simply to help the bloke that im coaching and i try not to give him so many flunks that he quits and i try not to give him so few that he winds up lousy see so i strike happy medium and the number of flunks and the number of encouragements went my interest is simply trying to make him sound and look like an auditor and if you follow that rule rather than bunch of mechanical rules why you will get there very well but ive had this question thrown at now for number of years and you know its notably absentthe how to coach ive seen other people write up lists of how you do it and that sort of thing but i dont have list of how you do it i just do it and i know thats risky line to go on well you just do it in actual fact i cant see anything very complicated about it if you want to make an auditor you know how he ought to look its pretty obvious how hes flunking and flubbing you know fellow sits there and he says do fish swim you say ah come on now boy what preclear from hell to halifax could ever hear that now speak up man get it over here well do fish swim now look are you going to cooperate with or not that was flunk oh you really want to do something yeah thats right stop talking in back of your head and start talking in front of your face now say it around well how should you say it well you should say it so i should hear it ohh and thats the level of entrance on coaching see and youll find outbut in actual fact any coaching can be improved and i have stepped in in the old days on session after session that was being coached and unwound the guy as mixedup auditor and made him audit made him sound like an auditor on one or another of the trs it is merely what it says if you yourself know what the tr is supposed to do its very easy to coach it then there was other suggestions ive forgotten what they were now they were important too what were some of these suggestions very important let see was it how to be course supervisor let see was that it that wasnt it oh yes its how do i get clear thats the burning question well todayfrankly im always giving this to you as gagi dont have anything to talk to you about but actually i have nothing pinpointed todayi think youre doing fine i think things are rolling along pretty well indeed and the hoc in mad burst of enthusiasm has just run itself out of pcs which of course was exactly what i intended now were going to run the dissem division you know bit mad but quals statisticqualifications statistic dropped so with all the messed up cases there are around i should think they ought to be able to drum up some business too so you will probably get approachedthe students probably will be approached and staff members and so forth and thats fine and by all means cooperate but i would like to see more of the public approached ive noted something recently ive noticed that there were several aberrated people in the broader bulk of humanity ive noticed this you have to have quick eye you know but if youre an expert you can detect it fellows going like this you know yes but anyway scientology has arrived at very enviable point today and werewere holdingmy heels are getting walked on right now on the ot course clear thats all wrapped up but the ot course thats giving some trouble thats giving some trouble see it isnt giving the students any trouble its giving some trouble simply to keep my heels from being walked all over you know you alwaysthese times occur every year or two why i get to point where im just ahead of the hurricane you know people are right there and theyre waiting for that next bit you know well it takes them three seconds to run this next bit on the ot course and it takes sometimes hours to figure out what it is you see so the ratio is pretty good but the last bit the last important bit it took actually eighteen days to wrap it up and that was long and arduous and it took eighteen days to wrap it upand the bit just completedi mean the bit before last took eighteen days and the bit just completed only took two days so the ratio is getting better and my heels are less walked on now you recognize that materials at this echelon are not in actual fact denied to you out of any willfulness or the feeling that psychiatrists will pick them up and do something with them they will eventually pick them up and do something with them they spin hate to have to say it but it is actually matter of protection of the scientologists and the public you can get sicker than pup on upperscale material the body goes creak and bango and so on so you shouldnt get in the idea that there is bunch of security being applied for some reason best known to somebody else because the reason is simply that it makes people sickand if not given proper protective security and so on it would have half of thewell we would have the lower class staff you see out on their ears if it were flowing through the lines and so on and then people starting to audit it very often need very careful supervision and direction or otherwise why it knocks them kicking and those who have been through this of course they just toss this off this is nothing of course thats rightits nothing but before they did i call their attention to when they accidentally skipped half page of materials and then went appetite over tin cup for about five sessions before they finally got back to finding out what they did you know or just accidentally turned the wrong page and glanced at the wrong thing and have the meter practically lock up and thats it so when you begin to estimate the velocity or ferocity of material you have to estimate it against the power of the individual lets take wog out here hes running on about onequarter of one grasshopper power see and he looks at lock and he thinks thatwell lets go back to freudian analysis see lets go back to way back and for five years the psychoanalyst worked hard with his patient in order to discover hidden memory of sexual attack of somebody waving book with naked woman on it before him while he was baby you see and they worked for five years and they finally found this and explained it all to the person and so on and they were spinning because these were so powerful as aberrative incidents all right on the dianetic course you find the only thing that was wrong with 1950 dianetics is we just kept throwing people in over their heads after youve run few locks why you can face some engrams do you see after youve run few secondaries you can face some pain and unconsciousness and its matter of just that so it is all gradients and youll find throughout scientology the gradient approach is primary and regulating factor and the gradient approach has been very very important in this line of research it is incidentally quite new youll find it here and there youll find it mentioned and so on how do you empty grainery well somebody will say well how would bunch of ants empty grainery one kernel of grain per ant you see in the line and eventually little by little well that isnt gradient that isnt gradient the gradient would be the ant beefing himself up till he could carry the grainery see from one kernel to the granary now thats the gradient there are jokes that go along with this you know that illustrate gradient but failed gradient is the fellow who was teaching his horse not to eat and he got him taught so he didnt eat all right but doggone the horse died before he could benefit from it now that would be sort of misapplication because he probably didnt do it on proper gradient really then there is the fellow who has got the gradient and he was going to be able to pick up bull and so he starts in with small bullcalf and lifts this bullcalf every day for very long time you see well the joke is of course he didnt have any processing so he didnt make it but the essence of gradient is just being able to do little bit more and little bit more and little bit more until you finally make the grade and the gradient gets invalidated when you do too much of jump you know you go from fifteen kernels to fifteen bushels all in one step you see gradient you know or you take too long to go from fifteen kernels to sixteen and onetenth kernels see you do that in steps of one hundredth of kernel see and the gradient is so shallow that the fellow gets bored to death before he has any chance to improve on it see so there are two gradients now this is less typical of life at large than it is of thetan spiritual being responds in this particular direction like bomb but body doesnt because body isa body has limitations its built into the stress and strain of the universe its legs can only stand so many hundreds of pounds you see before they snap and the bodyit is not goodnot good exampletrying to pick up bullcalf every day until you can finally lift the whole bull you see thats not good example because its gradient of body well gradient of thetan is quite different his power is probably very close to infinite and it can be walked up the line now i did just hit some stuff that threw my body back out of chair and i thought that was interesting because i was confronting stuff and it didnt bother and i didnt notice right away what was happening because it didnt seem to that there was that much stress and strain contained in it do you follow now similarly you look at pc some day and you go and you do wrong gradient you can do too shallow gradientyou can do too steep gradient now you up the grades from where he is dont necessarily react to the fact that its steep gradient you overlook this fact you cant see why hes having bad time answering that question because you can answer it easily its comparable to what you see in circus performers you ever watch these acrobats and things like thatthrowing themselves in the air and doing the wildest things you know well theyve been trained from babyhood you say and so forth but supposing somebody told you well get up on that trapeze and balance by one heel as you swing back and forth across the top of the tent and youd say yulp well actually you watch those chaps go up rope without using their legs theyre hand over hand up rope you know and if you went out there and took hold of that rope why you would find out you wouldnot only wouldnt go up it hand over hand you probably couldnt get yourself off the ground but that acrobat if he were trying to teach youand he didnt know very much about itif he were trying to teach you something about acrobating why he would probably do something remarkable like all right lets get up to this trapeze here and ill teach you now how to time trapeze and there you would be trying to climb up that rope it didnt occur to him that was problem see well that is the source of most failures on cases either too shallow or too steep now supposingand youve seen this one toosupposing that acrobat equally bad in instruction said well in the next couple of years we will teach you how to go hand over hand up rope well your ultimate goal is acrobating not going hand over hand up rope you figure you can learn this in two or three months at the absolute outside and you say you got to spend that long at it why you become very very tired indeed at just the thought of doing all of that to achieve only that do you see so when youre handling preclear your failures are in actual factand in trainingyour failures are in actual fact violation of gradient which can be tolerated by the person and i always use gradient which is just little bit tough i never use an easy gradienti use it so its just little bit hard all the way its bit of strain all the way but not strain that gives failures just hard work now in that wise you have to estimate pretty well the individual student or the individual preclear what is strain to him you find oddly enough in wogs that you can make an errora great great errorand you can actually assume that the person is at level of gradients simply because something doesnt bother him the reason something doesnt bother him to do it is because he has reality on it at all we used to run into this in 8c we would occasionallywhere we had them touching the walls that old process cchsand we would actually find people that could go through the whole thing just like breeze there was absolutely nothing to it there was change of any kind whatsoeverand they were just as aberrated as coots and the whole point was it was too steep gradient there was reality on it they didnt have to confront doing it because they werent doing it it was all on automatic life was on automatic the walls werent there anyhow so nothing was going to happen anyhow so nothing mattered anyway do you see so you can be tricked sometimes into believing that you have achieved proper gradient because the person simply has trouble at this particular point whereas they dont have any trouble at that point because they have reality on it either fellow probably who was unable to see lions and tigers would undoubtedly have trouble whatsoever walking through cage full of lions and tigers except of course accidentally he gets eaten but heit doesnt bother him bit he simply walks through the cage because there are lions or tigers in the cage well you have to have fairly good estimate of the degree and steepness of aberration in order to draw up some kind of an estimate of what gradient to apply to it and now and then you undoubtedly will run across somebody who has degree of response on the 0 processes youll find somebodythe 0 processes dont bite nothing happens this would be rare action and you seem to be up against some sort of an impasse where you cant make grade release well the reason you couldnt make grade 0 release is either it is overrun or he isnt up to it it isnt that you need more processes at grade 0 if grade 0 didnt make release well then he already was one or its just completely over his head he has never had any trouble talking to anybody because he has never confronted anybody and hes never said anything he just talks continually so he hadnt any trouble at grade 0 had trouble with communications with anybody because theres nobody there you see you could run into that kind of circumstance i think somebody that you took out of spinbin this personundoubtedly you would find among such inmates and i dont tell you to go process such inmates but im just using it as an example you would find amongst these people lot of people who did lot of talking but didnt say anything and werent confronting anybody and it was quite obvious now its obvious when you know what it is and you look for it you know what youre looking for youre looking for somebody who doesnt have anybody there to talk to so he doesnt have any trouble with grade 0 release see he doesnt have any trouble with the process and he doesnt make grade 0 release either you could find such circumstance now this would be quite interesting how do you undercut that well if you look it over you will find out that communication has an anatomy and that communication only takes place in the presence of some reality the arc triangle so if you want to raise one corner of the arc triangle you can raise either of the other two if you cant approach communication you can certainly approach reality or you could approach affinity do you see its obvious that theres whole series of processes that you could go downstairs on that would raise the persons communication level youd have to be thinking on your feet actually its more or less done for you if you could get somethis person to audit lock something like that why you would find out that you had undercut it already dianetic processing does undercut it ordinary auditing of locks and so on has been applied to psychotics with great success and it goes way downstairs because you see there doesnt have to be anybody else there they come up to finding out there is something else in the world besides their own spin or their own delusion or their own hallucination but they can audit locks and they can audit light materials now the reason why this was not successful earlier is that estimate on gradient you see that estimate of gradient was not properly madethe estimate was not made on the basis of what can he run obviously the fellow in the institution is in desperate condition so you must then run something desperate and that is the mistake that the psychiatrists make we call that q and question is the answerthe question itself is the answer to the question by perfect duplication so therefore person who is dramatizing this of course just does what is being done and he gets sort of communication that he is very satisfied with for instance if somebody is jumping up and down why if the other fellow jumps up and down why there is some vestige of communication there so we take this and instead of condemning it we find that one of the very very early entrance point is mimicry but you dont happen to need psychotic in order to practice mimicry processes mimicry processes are very interesting and you can do them on subways and in buses and in stores and so on its very fascinating you see some little kid and he can be very very young kid and you just run some mimicry see he smiles you smile thats the tiniest point of it see but you happen to notice hes wrinkling his nose at you you know hes going like this you know so you go at him like this and he becomes very interested communication has been formed at once as you get good at that why youll find out that child is very enamored with this youll find out oddly enough that he likes you and then you will find out of course that he has pretty good reality on you if you could plumb that estimate for instance if you were in whole mob of people he would pick you out now you would say of course because he knows you because youre real to him and the others arent knowledge and reality are the same thing that is what is known is real that which is is you know that philosophers of the ages have stubbed their toes and tripped up over this thing of what is reality until i have gotten more tired eyes reading their textbooks on that one subject than on any other subject i know anything about you take the questions of if there was nobody in the forest and tree fell would there be sound if there was nobody there to hear it oh blah blah blah blah blah blah would there be universe if anybody was in it if nobody was in it would there be universe could there be universe with nobody in it is the universe you is all mind mind infinite mind you know i mean these preponderated propositions are merely perpetuation of idiocy because reality is very easy its merely what is but of course that doesnt fill up any textbooks now the reality of somebody is the point of approach when you cannot attain communication 0 grade release there is the point now affinity could also be point of attack but is usually one which occurs rather than that reality is something you can do something with now what can you do with reality well ill tell you what not to do with reality he says this room is full of spiders and theyre crawling all over now the method of handling that which was used bdbefore dianeticsand those who havent gotten the word still use this method theyre more barbaric types they cant read you know and they dont know the trend of the times theyre stuck back in the nineteenth century psychiatrists these birds have as their sole approach to this problem there arent any spiders on the wall youre crazy now what you must do is face reality and realize there are spiders on the wall well they just threw away their first gradient the guy did have reality on the wall to the degree that he mentioned there was wall there now if you validate his insanity too hard youre liable to find yourself in trouble because you sort of fix him with win hes been telling everybody about these spiders for very long time and you say of course i see them too thats lie isnt the truth and actually gives him an acknowledgment and rather sticks him with the win and he knows youre crazy because basically he knows there arent any spiders on the wall too but lets pick out of his sentence what he said spiders on the wall and all over see well we have two points of reality we have the wall and th hell with the spiders so if you were to simply ask him what kind of wall wouldnt spiders be on or what kind of wall do spiders like best or who would you have to be not to have spiders on you and you would shift his r now admittedly you have to be clever to do this sort of thing i remember being clever about these sort of thingsand toward the end of the 40s all by myself and it was almost disastrous because there were more psychotherapies originated in 1949 than in any other year known to psychoanalysis every time i audited anybody while anybody else was watching it became school of psychotherapy because they couldnt integrate it they couldnt integrate it with what i was doing which they didnt understand so it in itself became an approach all by itself and was therefore not something with which you thought but simply something which you totally copied and we got all kinds of therapies ive seen textbooks on them and so on id audit joe blow and we would see gestalt iggerbits therapy by joe blow promptly and at once it was the process that was run on him and it would have derivation something like this you see how do we get into communication with this bird or what part of the bank you know could we approach or what idea would he agree with and then this idea that you have used as an entrance you see of course gave him terrific change of case so it was that idea which everybody had to be approached with you see so everybody had to be fitted on this same gradient and i despaired of ever teaching anybody anything to this day there is bit of tradition that iim terrific as psychotherapistthere is nothing to dianetics and scientologyits just my touch what method of invalidation i had heard it and heard it and heard it undoubtedly hubbard has knack undoubtedly he is one of these gifted individuals who something or other but teach anybody to do that of course thats impossible well im giving you why they wouldnt know such thing as gradient scale or the arc triangle or any of these other tools of the trade or use those in any way but would simply totally copy something that was done for one particular psycho or one particular neurotic you see and then they would say that you do that for every neurotic well everybody didnt believe there were spiders on the wall you see they believed that there were policemen camped on the front porch and if you could havecould have taught them something on this could have said look the operative line there is front porch you see they may have policemen on the front porch but theyve at least got front porch so they got porches so then they can have variety of porches and so he has identification hes got all porches identified with porch if you can introduce differentiation amongst porches on that particular case therefore and thereby the person will improve casewise and will increase his reality and therefore will have better communication level and will like people better too much were asking somebody to work out the solution to case by mathematical formula if you want to know it now this planet doesnt have symbolic mathematics it doesnt understand them it has nothing to do with them when they get into symbolic logic they put words into algebra and call it symbolic logic oh blah mathematicsthese mathematicians that go around and scribble x equals the umptyumph blashplunk and wind up with an abomb its wonder they wind up with abombs instead of something that will help things you know their mathematics is so terrible thats very definite statement straight from mathematics is in kindergarten on this planet symbolic mathematics has nothing to do with doing algebra with symbols instead of numbers the way man thinks it is if you look it up in the dictionary or the encyclopedia it is solving vast number of nonnumerical variables by the use of comparisonssimilarities identities and differences and you have to be real whizbang because you cant write it down on sheet of paper now man even goes so far as to say geometry is logic there would be nothing sillier than fellow who went around all the time using syllogisms b b c c d well all right that syllogism might possibly work its obvious that b and c being the same why and d would be the same and that works out fine as longas long as youre using only one apple theres where mathematics falls down because it applies the suppressive generality of number to the specific entity which is being calculated two plus two oh i know that sounded very esoteric but its very simple 2 plus 2 equals 4 it hasnt it doesnt and it never will two what now if you say there is theoretical formula which has basis in reality called addition of 2s you would have pronounced truth but they teach little kid two plus two equals four and we mean any two plus any two equals any four oh two girls plus two boys equals four orchestra members theinstantly you answer the question what in an inspecific way you have insanity so man is higher up than an insane mathematics so dont blame him too much for never having worked anything out zero is the wildest variable that anybody ever had anything to do with because its simply on the basis of zero what what thats the elementary question well the fellow says zero zero of coursezero you say yeah you idiot what what zero of what and he says zero of nothing well you say in what interesting universe is this zero of nothing you locate it or not locate it he cant tell you zero of what so every time they accidentally enter zero into mathematical formula they get any kind of an answer you can name and that is nuclear physics the mathematics thereof which they use today and to this day they dont know when one of those confounded things is going to explode they run their power plants by tickling the tigers tail they figure it all out then they throw that in the waste basket and they walk into the laboratory and they very carefully do it empirically by experiment they can make an accurate guess because their formulas now have enough bugger factors in them to representthats what they call themto represent what they have actually found out empirically so they jostle these things around so they have entered mathematics and experience close togetherso therefore they can now make an estimate of what might happen but they never follow it thats whats interesting they never follow it the guy goes in and he takes the long rod in his hot papa suit with big lead wall in front of him and he takes the long rod and he adjusts and adjusts and he uses little micrometer screw of adjustment to find out just how close you can get piece of plutonium next to piece of plutonium b and to get current rather than bang now he knows as the counter starts going tickticktickticktick bluhbluhblb that hes too close so he backs it off he didnt figure it out in mathematics at all and they make my belly tired theyre bunch of fakes somebody can say listen whos talkingyes sir listen to whos talking man theyve never accomplished anything and we have now the main point im making here is that logic is done by you and there are various hints that you can have to wind up with logic there are various hints you can have but in the final analysis it depends on you and your concept of reality and mathematics is actually very lowgrade expression of r and c now r and c combined add up to understanding to understand anything you have to have affinity r reality and to be able to communicate with it c communication r c affinity reality and communication are always necessary to understanding and oddly enough are understanding as far as mathematics are concerned thats understanding but what is doing the understanding you are so if the mathematician says there is such things as living being and he doesnt exist he has instantly dropped out of his mathematics what is using the mathematics what asks the question and receives the answer so he then doesnt have mathematics so in actual fact mathematics cannot exist without live interpretation now the mathematiciansoh oh thats sillysays you could come along here and figure out robot you could figure out robot and this robot would operate on syllogisms you know what i mean by syllogismaristotelian syllogism you know if monkeys are like donkeys why then monkeys heads are like donkeys heads or something like this you see if two things are similar to each other then two other things that theyre similar to are also similar to each other youve taken geometry you know side angle side and all that sort of thing syllogism invented by aristotle in more vicious moment of his career people will actually you open up most geometry textbooks that are taught in the high schools of the united states and they say this is logic brother it has nothing to do with logic it has to do with syllogisms it was what one thinking beingaristotlelaid out as method so the final ask of the question and receipt of the answer is by being you can talk about unwacs eniacsthey can work on the most weird whirring wheels theyre all very clever theyre all marvelousim not running them down theyre lot of fun but notice that something had to give it the question and something had to receive the answer now that could have been the most idle action in the world that there couldve been use for it but there is an interpreter mathematics does not exist independent of living thought so therefore mathematics could be simply defined as method of memory used by living being to make inanimate objects or other things appear to think or appear to act do you follow now its very handy not to have to count the number of bricks in side wall but only have to count the number of bricks along the top and the number of bricks up one side and multiply the two together and have the number of bricks in that entire wall thats great very proper use for mathematics and thats almost as far as it goes it doesnt go much further than that you can tell how many square feet in piece of ground you can tell how high is cat by measuring him and multiplying and averaging cats and you can do all sorts of interesting things but remember it is always you who are asking the question and you who receive the answer now any time you escape that proposition you immediately have permitted yourself to be overwhelmed by methodology now you will be as good logically as you are clean and you will be able to be cause over the whole thing as much as you are ot because the more livingness you can exert or employ on any given subject why the more logical you can be about it in fact you run up to point where you dont any longer need mathematics now one of the thingsone of the things which has been baffling about dianetics and scientology is how did he figure all this out i can give you whole lot of formulas there were lot of formulas and things used and so on they find them in such early literature as dianetics evolution of science there are lot of little rules of thumb which have been used those are shortcuts and so on but i havent been at this for two minutes you know this is an old line and im very familiar with it now its simple matter its simple matter of r and c very simple because its matter of potential understanding now the affinity you cant stand back and hate men and then find out any reality about men you cant have total unreality about men sitting in some ivory tower someplace you know never go out never meet anybody never talk to anybody never get mixed up with pickpockets you know give all bandits wide berth never talk to headhunters see you cant go about it that way and have reality on man its impossible and communicationwell you cant go about it being careful of what you say and careful of what you hear anybody who is easily offended had better never go into the business of understanding because he winds up only with prejudice hes so offended by what he hears that of course he can understand nothing that of course explains in nutshell somebody who is terribly offended by scientology hes so offended by what he hears he cant understand anything in the first place you see the whole thing is his c is madly out he cant read he cant interpret he cant duplicate the whole formula you see would be out now these are the adjuncts of life and livingness and the first thing you have to do to tackle any subject like this is to be alive not dead or disciplined or approved of if you worked to be approved of all the time you would wind up approved of the most approved of thing ive seen around the only time i see wogs really masse as common denominator gather round and go into affinity and so forth is when somebodys dead as far as i can tell the most approved of thing in the society is something very dead i know the two crimes you can commit in this society is you can be there and you can communicate those are the two basic crimes notice the police say he had an alibi so he didnt do it well thatsthey proved that he wasnt there so of course he didnthe wasnt guilty be there and communicate now therefore the basis of all scientology and dianetic research has been understanding somebody tries to look for some peculiar way in which this was done you see theyre liable to run into the answer of nothing theres just such answer there its just done because of comprehension association with man communication with him communication with life reality on existence what is it what isnt it and so on and not any vast feeling of terrific fear or mustnt hear that and mustnt say something else we sometimes get victimized by it ive said something i have found there was particular reason to withhold this the only thing that i withhold on any of these lines is simply when i have found something that is on the upper road that is going to make wog awfully sick and maybe put him in hospital why i dont really care to release that generally to psychiatrists and to people in general i dont want to see other people ill so when you look over this general situation it was done by awareness so on but awareness is proportional to how alive you are now im not trying to say im more alive than others i just am well all of this of course is not apropos to but is apropos to you in trying to estimate auditing and cases the clearer you are the easier it is to do and the reason for that is is its not done by any other than the most fundamental laws and the most fundamental law in the whole field is r and c and this comprises understanding but of course you must be capable of understanding before you could start to extrapolate or figure out or develop things to do with somebody which departs from very standardized procedure and when you run into somebody who wont go grade 0 release and who cant be rehabilitated on grade 0 release even though you rack up the past lives and everything else trying to find out where he went grade 0 release you cant find that you must conclude that you have problem here where the reality must be approached rather than communication and even sometimes where it must be approached through affinity and affinity is lower than reality in its reach down it can exceed reality it sounds very peculiar and i have reason for saying that except the fact that i have had insane people who had such dim reality that it was almost impossible and had terrible reality on yet feel enough affection tobecause i asked them togo sane well youd say that required communicationwell the tiniest fragment of communication that anybody ever heard of ive actually seen it undercut question concerning reality so that these are the three pins on which you adjust any auditing session and all auditing sessions go by gradients and there actually isnt really much more to it than that if youthere are great many things great many things perfectly true and so forth i am talking now about the estimate of what you do the estimate of what you select to do if you are confronted with such problem then that problem has to be resolved in the zone of affinity reality and communication well auditing is pretty well wrapped up you dont have to worry too much about auditing youre not really going to be called upon to operate on psychotic patients the number of people that you will find who will not resolve by little very lowlevel dianetic auditing if they cant get up to communication release are so few as to be nonexistent because you can get down below that reality on an unconscious person you know just making him feel the bed or the pavement or something he isnt even awarenot even aware of the command you just keep touching his hand gently giving him command touching him to pavement hell come out of it see rather you dont need any particular reason in application of technology to depart one iota from what you already have laid out as matter of fact as you get into the upper grades it becomes more and more serious to depart from it because the mind happens to be put together in certain precise way and its been figured out as to how it is so why bother figuring it out but how about this whole zone and area called life how about the whole zone and area of interpersonal relations how about the zone between yourself or the organization and the world around you well now we have the problems of gradients and we have the problems of affinity reality and communication and thats the problems we have the problem of interfamilial relations well there are two ways to solve interfamilial relations the first and most effective way of solving itthe first and most effective way of solving itis by individual processing to bring the people up to the point where they can understand each other that doesnt even process them on the idea of being family or on their family problems you just process them just on the gradients and dont give it any particular attention anything except standard processing and you will get there and thats the best way to approach it it is so senior to education that i dont think i would ever give any family members advice ethics is there to force them not to advise them when they cant solve it why you say solve it or off with your head you know person cant make any progress at all why you can give him hard shove in that direction but the other way to solve that problem the other way to solve that problem or figure out what could be done about it would be in the zone of affinity reality and communication but of course youre limited if you havent anybody present to understand understanding is composed of affinity reality and communication and if their affinity is low and their reality is low and their communication is nonexistent theyre not going to understand so if they dont understand theyre not going to do it and thats why education is unbeneficial to solve these very very rough problems in handling problem between the organization the society around us we keep desperately lookingor as an auditor and his environment and so onwe keep desperately looking for some marvelous solution some marvelous solution where fullarmed we will spring from the brain of jove and conquer everything and there will be peace on earth and goodwill toward men see and its got to be this marvelous solution by which we do something inside the organization or we say something to the public or something like that well stop straining your brains because youre dealing with this factor there is solution at any time superior to the ability of the person asking for it to understand there is mathematics that could possibly work any such thing out i dont say that mathematics shouldnt work things out and you shouldnt do things with mathematics i get lot of fun out of figuring how much would the propeller have to be pitched in order to make the boat go at eight knots with 161 horsepower i think thats great thats great and after ive worked it all out i usually guess at it more accurately but i use mathematics and im not in the position you know of somebody who hasnt studied his mathematics ive studied them all almost got expelled one time for finding use for dead mathematics that was one of the wilder experiences ive ever had it so enraged that professor he almost turned purple and pink it was horrible it was dead mathematics which was totally useless and i found use for it and i went up and i told him very proudly and i showed him there was use for it in aerial navigation and he almost blew his gasket he flunked at the end of the year and i had to go to the chair of mathematics and take an examination in that mathematics that covered every tiny theorem in it you know one of those vicious things i got 99 on it and this guyit practically ruined his teaching careerhe had to pass but i had found use for mathematics which was classical genius thing you know classical little thing for which there was use so mathematics we know is sacred but i studied this subject and i dont find it sacred i find that mathematics is as good as it can be employed with understanding that its as good as the understanding of who asks and who receives the answer and thats as good as mathematics is and the answer to becoming better at mathematics is become clearer the answer to any problem is to become more alive and more capable of understanding that is the answer which pays off now scientology is way it is road there is standard way of getting there people do get there on that standard way and there isnt much you have to figure out about it today but it is way toward greater understanding this world today is not expressing very much affinity or very much reality and i think it says its reality on communication is so faint to make it communication at all duzdazdizthe soap of the future what they are using their communication media fordyah the newspaper for instance they call it news why if woman were to act like that in village of 200 years ago they would have put her in the stocks for six months for vicious malicious gossip never has anything good to say about anything or anybody and that is the modern newspaper and that is communication in this society all you had to do is read few stories about yourself to know the stories on the both columns ofbesides the one about you are totally felonious not even erroneousfelonious that wrong you can absolutely count that if president johnson is reported as having gone to warm springs and so forth that he is out at the space port in keokuk you know you can count on it i just never did see quite as many errors made per pica of type as can be made in modern newspaper its gorgeous and yet the public thinks its informed about things you say well theres some tendency and so forth yes you become aware of the fact that theres war going on someplace they specialize in those things but ill tell you man that 100000 babies couldve suddenly been rescued from an epidemic and all been made well miraculously overnight and the newpapers would never even mention it too hightoned so the communication of this society is poor reality is poor and affinity is very poor any time world can be subject to wars you know very well that the affinity is rather poor so how do you do all this well you process them you say well how can you get them all to stand still to process them well now youre getting into ot stuff because you sail very easily outside the understanding and reality of beings at along about vi you are actually departing from the zone of comprehension of the normal human beingat about grade vi it isnt even atit isnt even as high as clear its low see but that i would say would be very very high estimate its maybe even at grade 0 see but you for sure i just know for sure youre right outside the normal reality at grade vi much less clear and you go around trying to talk to these people and educate them with data from grade vi and you are going to fall flat on your face and im sure many of you have done it so what can you do from grade vi if you cant feed them all data about youve all lived before and youre this and that and they havent got any of the reality on any of this and theyre wogged around you know theyve come out of the night and theyve seen you for moment and sort of looked at you and thought there might be something there you know and then you told them whole bunch of data and drove them back into the night again see after that cycle has been executed you should sit down and think for moment and say wait minute is there something i can do from this point that would influence these people or give them better lives or bring them up the line and the answer is yes yes there is affinity reality and communication adding up to understanding and its not even difficult you see its essentially terribly simple answer you might say just be but therethat hasthat has value see if you are high state of release and you simply are you would just be surprised how much value that has in your immediate area you dont have to hang up advertising signs or sandwich boards on you people see this rather easily so what can you do well affinity you can feel an affinity you can have reality on whats going on dont kid yourself you see dont let your affinity overwhump your reality see you dont sayyou dont say ive got to feel good toward man so i must not see all of the evil things he does feel good toward him and see the evil things he doesvery elementary and as far as communication is concerned just never allow him the luxury of cutting you back from communicating and youve done it because out of that combination will come an understanding and you will understand what he is all about understanding is sort of total solvent its the universal solvent it washes away everything so you see you actually are not in position as you go up in the line to educationally reform the society in which you find yourself you actually err when you tell them any more than and we commit these errorsbut tell them any more than they need in order to know that there is way there that there is way they can travel and there is road out now that becomes possible there is way now when you communicate to them more than that youve simply so bedazzled their understanding and theyve gone blind over the whole thing because you actually are deficient in understanding what they can understand so the final analysis of what can an organization do in the society aroundthe most fundamental and basic thing that it can do is found in the triangle of affinity reality and communication it can have reality on the world around it it can have an affinity that will not be alloyed or destroyed because of various acts of men and it must continue to communicate but communication remember is always within the reality of the person who can hear it now it is perfectly true that there exist strata so far above the reality of man and so demonstrable actually directly to himhe couldnt miss seeing wall fall down dont you see or bowl of fruit move through the air he couldnt miss this you know it would baffle him now you run into the possibility of throwing him into awe worship religious frenzy because youve now overwhumped him and so he assigns his realityit is some wild assignment and he goes to pieces under it this has happened many times in the past so if you take that line you have to be extremely careful not to throw him into frothing fit because actually instead of leading him toward greater understanding you have depressed him into total unreality so how do you handle man and handle situation well to stand there in body which is vulnerable to bullets to have an identity which can be advertised or flaunted to in various ways go on being intentionally vulnerable you can check the degree that you can afford to be understanding or to comprehend the situation around its all right to be so understanding you can see why this guy just got through hooking the beans but the truth of the matter is as long as you have anything to protect you must of course at the same time while understanding why he hooks the beans and that he is hooking the beans you also have to prevent him from doing so so the net solution to the problem is that you are limited to the degree that you are vulnerable but you become less and less vulnerable the more and more you are capable of understanding now of course vulnerability ceases at the moment when you cant be personally injured but then that is simply state of case you have gotten up to this state of case now what i am talking to you about might sound like its very old and youve heard it all before and so on but you actually at this time are facing crisis in scientology it is right around the corner it is just over the tip of the hill and the crossroads is simply do we get so tired of them we just overwhump them or do we stay true to our own beliefs in continuing to suffer the slings and arrows which are thrown at us still go on in high state of arc this is very interesting proposition and of course there is arguing with it the greatest good for the greatest number of dynamics is the optimum solution but this is time in the history of dianetics and scientology when this question begins to stir what are we going to do with the planet not how are we going to fight down newspaper proprietor you notice these governments lose they lose the questions are not how are we going to prevent bad press any more than its how are we going to cure all the insane people in the society simultaneously by dropping pellet in the water supply system or some other idiotic thing you see thats not the question the question is what are we going to do there are various things which we can do and were on very gingerly point here were on point where we could go wrong and point where we could go right because at this particular time our power exceeds our understanding now it wont exceed it very much or very far but the reason it does this is very simple it isnt that people are going to do lot of things bad but when youre trying to keep bridge open and youre trying to keep way open for lot of people and those people are still vulnerable and can be attacked and so on you tend to take protective measures or you tend to plan protective measures or worry about this type of thing if it were just yourself the answer would be very easy dont you see so it comes up to question and there is mathematics under the sun that will solve it except those which are inherent in the development of scientology and those that are inherent in the development of scientology of course are such things as r and c add up to understanding they are various axioms they are various data so we are at this interesting point in our historyis what are we going to do with the planet because the last thing in the world i want is any more administration im awful tired of administration theres nobody going to get in on administration so nobody wants the planet but hurricane is in actual fact soft summer wind compared to the amount of power which is now becoming available in scientology the direction of that power its utilization and so on will inevitably work out for the greatest good of the greatest number of dynamics this is inevitable the main question then is how does it work out with the minimum number of casualties but we are right at that point of the road which all of you at one time or another have sensed what are we going to do if what are we going to do when well were at that point of the road and i dont pretend at this particular moment to have any answer to it theres figured out answer to it at all in the first place im too far out of arc with victoria state joke but we are in the interesting position todaythe interesting position today of having been yapped at shouted at booted around attacked reviled ridiculed and so forth and holding in the palm of our hand the answer to all the tomorrows this planet will ever have thats one of the most fantastic situations that anybody ever heard of man is sitting out there without the faintest inklingor maybe he does have and thats why he is screaming but the main point of all this isis we are at that point where we have clears theyre being achieved people are moving forward up to ot the more person develops his understanding increases his affinity realitysense of realityand his communication ability increase the amount this can be increased is almost infinite now we have the answer in that our understanding itself will of course pilot the way and all that sort of thing we can logicize ourselves into somnolence about this whole thing but were at crossroads and at this particular crossroads i dont have any really ready answer canned answer to suddenly give you on silver platter of exactly what we are going to do i have already explored various lines and so on for the eventual salvage of scientology in the event of an international cataclysm before we really got there ive been working on that for about six months and i got that pretty well taped scientology wont perish because of some convulsion in the northern hemisphere and our processing and so on is moving up along the line our results are fabulous its 1 2 3 proposition today and sitting there auditing preclear up through the grades i suppose in every preclear you are facing this same question as his power increases what do we do well probably his good sense will dictate what is to be done and our good sense undoubtedly will go on dictating it i think we have been fantastically forbearing now it is only hoped that our reality on the situation doesnt degenerate as point of connection dont you see to point where it longer matters what happens to the little guy but we as group have achieved an historical point which probably should go down resoundingly in history we are governmentally and so forth very unacceptable and they depend completely and utterly upon our goodwill its fantastic position for any group to be in every religious organization of the past every group of betterment and so forth of the past has flunked this test i just hope we dont thank you very much
