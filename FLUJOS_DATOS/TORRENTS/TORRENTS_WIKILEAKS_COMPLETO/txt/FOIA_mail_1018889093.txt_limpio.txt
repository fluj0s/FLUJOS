from michael mann mannmultiproxyevscvirginiaedu to tim osborn tosbornueaacuk ed cook drdendroldeocolumbiaedu subject re your letter to science date mon 15 apr 2002 124453 0400 cc malcolm hughes mhughesltrrarizonaedu esperwslch kbriffaueaacuk pjonesueaacuk tcrowleydukeedu rbradleygeoumassedu jtouarizonaedu srutherfordvirginiaedu mannvirginiaedu hi tim thanks for your message yes you guys have us beat on the early monday end of things your points are all taken i think we all agree there is much work left to be done more than enough for all of us to continue to be involved in constructive collaboration etc scott and i for example are almost done writing up the work based on your visit w us last year and will send the initial draft on to you keith and the others involved in the near future it will be good chance to try to address lot of these questions in an article of adequate length to discuss the nuances that unfortunately cannot be addressed in shorter piece i also appreciate your more detailed comments about the comparisons etc your points are all reasonable ones we can maintain an honest difference about how well those points were conveyed in the science piece for example you can imagine how the statement in your piece this record has smaller amplitude of centurytocentury variability and is consistently at or near the upper limit of alternate records produced by other researchers might indeed have been interpreted as setting mbh99 apart as in your words an outlier we have good reason to believe that our reconstruction will in fact nderestimate extratropical temperature means but far less so full globehemispheremeans prior to the 18th century because the basis functions that primarily set the extratropics apart from the full hemispheric patterns eg nao type patterns and other anomaly patterns largely carried by eofs 2 and 3 start to drop out from our basis set prior to the 18th century while the pattern that best resolves the full global andor hemispheric mean with note from mbh98 particularly large loadings primarily in the tropics and subtropics still remains that is why we have never published an extratropical temperature reconstruction prior to the 18th century i would be happy to discuss this point with you and keith and others in more detail thus i have compared esper et w our records in the manner described in my previous email which i think allows us to diagnose the extent to which differing highlatitude and fullhemispheric patterns may at times explain the somewhat modest differences between the records when similarly scaled to the full hemispheric 18561990 mean and always within the context of the diagnosed uncertainties there is guarentee as you say that the uncertainties are correct but i personally believe theyll stand up over time you can call on this 10 years from now and somebody will owe somebody beer in any case i hope and fully expect we can all continue to all be engaged in constructive interaction hopefully continued collaboration it will require some sensitivity on all our part to the larger issues surrounding our work and the way it gets presented to the broader community but i dont think that should be all that difficult i look forward to these more constructive interactions ill do my best to foster them mike at 0157 pm 41502 0100 tim osborn wrote dear all well the time zone may let you have the last word before the weekend but we can get the first word in on monday morning at 2235 120402 michael mann wrote in keeping w the spirit of toms and keiths emails i wanted to stress before we all break for the weekend that this is ultimately about the science its not personal if my comments seemed to assail eg keiths motives or integrity etc i believe that they were misunderstood as i tried to clarify that in my previous message but i can see that there was potential for misunderstanding of my message precision in wording is very important given the high levels of sensitivity in this debate so i wanted to leave uncertainty about that and of course i very much apologize to keith and tim if they took them my comments that way they again were most decidedly not intended that way thanks for clarifying that mike i think that both keith and i interpreted your earlier email as being more critical of us than you actually meant it to be most issues surrounding the recent esper et and briffa osborn pieces seem to have been covered adequately already there are just couple of issues on which id like to add few comments hopefully clarifying the situation rather than opening up more avenues for debate the first relates to the purpose and style of the briffa osborn piece perspectives are brief nontechnical and not peerreviewed our instructions were the perspective should provide an overview of recent research in the field and explain to the general reader why the work is particularly exciting is it any surprise then that we should focus on the new insights provided by the esper et work and that it suggests different climate history than earlier work and that the constraints of the perspectives format in terms of length audience and style prevented us from listing all the caveats and uncertainties related to this and earlier reconstructions and that might be of relevance to their intercomparison i dont think it is surprising nor do i think we should be criticised for it moreover despite the constraints of the perspectives format i think we were very careful with our wording to avoid misleading the reader the reference to the ipcc for example was not at all sloppy the opposite in fact since it was very carefully worded the ipcc synthesis report is referred to rather than the full tar and it is quite true that there is focus on the reconstruction of mann et in the former as mike says ipcc conclusions were based on other work too but id guess that many of the readers of our perspective wont have read the full ipcc report so we thought it valid to focus on the difference between the new work and that shown in the synthesis report which more will have seen to do this is certainly not unfair to the ipcc it would only have been unfair if we had implied that the ipcc had ignored this new work but of course we werent doing that because how could one expect the tar to consider work that is published year after the tar itself we were similarly careful with our wording in our brief mention of the mwp by saying it is more pronounced in esper et this doesnt mean it is warmer than the others and thus has implications for the ipcc conclusion of recent unusual warmth rather it is pronounced because it is followed by stronger cooling the second issue is our recalibration of the reconstructions while it hasnt been explicitly stated i get the impression that this is considered by some to be poor thing to do the particular recalibration we do has number of effects including making the mann et reconstruction appear more consistently at the top of the range of alternatives but please let assure you mike ray and malcolm that the reason for recalibrating the records is definitely not to make your record appear as an outlier and i hope you believe indeed in jones osborn briffa 2001 science 292 662667 we showed various nh records without applying our recalibration we produced our first comparison of records for an earlier science perspectives piece in 1999 briffa osborn 1999 and thought it would be useful to do recalibration to remove some of the reasons for interreconstruction differences which can be due to different proxy data different statistical methods different calibration target and different calibration period the latter two reasons were removed by recalibrating against common target series and over common period we updated this in briffa et 2001 and acknowledged that the target series in terms of its spatial and seasonal definition may not be optimal in all cases indeed it may be especially suboptimal for mann et because their reconstruction approach combines the proxy records to optimally reconstruct full nh annual mean t whereas we have selected land north of 20n warmseason t as our target for the recalibration despite this we felt justified in doing the recalibration because the mann et series still outperformed the others in terms of its correlation with the instrumental record over the calibration period in our latest piece we have updated the intercomparison in two ways as well as including new series i we took the spatiallyresolved gridded reconstructions of mann et and extracted only land boxes north of 20n and ii we used annual not warmseason temperature as the target the first of these as explained by keith and i in an earlier email which is repeated below because it didnt get sent to all of you firs time round deals with all the points raised by mike about tropical versus extratropical differences i would again argue that we were not sloppy because these changes to our intercomparison were carefully thought out so that explains what we have done and why there is some sensitivity clearly to calibration choices which implies to that the true uncertainty ranges are probably larger than those estimated solely from the statistical properties of calibration residuals as used by briffa et and i think by mann et there is clearly more progress to be made best regards to you all tim date fri 05 apr 2002 171755 0100 to michael mann mannmultiproxyevscvirginiaedupjonesueaacuk tcrowleydukeedurbradleygeoumassedumhughesltrrarizonaedu drdendroldeocolumbiaedurkerraaasorgbhansonaaasorg from keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk subject re briffa osborn piece cc tim osborn tosbornueaacuk dear mike and interested colleagues given the list of people to whom you have chosen to circulate your messages we thought we should make short somewhat formal response here i am happy to reserve my informal response until we are face to face we did not respond earlier because we had more pressing tasks to deal with this is not the place to go into long or overdetailed response to all of your comments but few brief remarks might help to clear up couple of misconceptions you consider our commentary on ed and jans paper more flawed than even the paper itself on the basis that scaling the relationship between full northern hemisphere and extratropical northern hemisphere is much more problematic than even any of the seasonal issues we discuss in fact we did not do this the curve labelled mann99 in our figure was in fact based on the average of only the land areas north of 20 degrees n extracted from your spatiallyresolved reconstructions we then scaled it by calibration against the instrumental annual temperatures from the same region this is just as you stress in your comments on the esper et paper what should have been done we think that this single point addresses virtually of all your concerns we can of course argue about what this means for the pre1400 part of your reconstruction when only 1 eof was reconstructed but the essential message is that we did our best to exclude the tropics and the oceans too from your series so that it could more readily be compared with the other records the fact that we have used only the extratropical land from your data is not clear from the text so we can see why you may not have appreciated this but we think you will concede that this fact negates much of what you say and that we acted more correctly than you realised blame science for being so mean with their space allocation if you want remember that this was an unrefereed piece and we felt justified in concentrating on one issue that of the importance of the method of scaling and its effect on apparent absolute reconstruction levels in our draft we went on to say that this was crucial for issues of simple model sensitivity studies and climate detection citing the work of tom crowley and myles allen but this fell foul of the editors knife you also express concerns about the calibration of esper et eg you say if the authors had instead used the actual unsmoothed instrumental record for the extratropical northern hemisphere to scale their record their reconstruction would be much closer to mbh99 this point is wholly consistent with our discussion in the perspective piece and indeed we show that in absolute terms the records are closer when esper et is calibrated using unsmoothed data but since the variance is also reduced the significance of the differences may be just as high finally we have to say that we do not feel constrained in what we say to the media or write in the scientific or popular press by what the sceptics will say or do with our results we can only strive to do our best and address the issues honestly some sceptics have their own dishonest agenda we have doubt of that if you believe that i or tim have any other objective but to be open and honest about the uncertainties in the climate change debate then i am disappointed in you also best regards keith and tim dr timothy j osborn phone 44 1603
