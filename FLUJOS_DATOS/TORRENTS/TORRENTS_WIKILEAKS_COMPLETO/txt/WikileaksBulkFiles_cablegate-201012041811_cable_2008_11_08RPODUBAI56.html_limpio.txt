iran regional presence office dos reason 14 b c d 1 snf summary xxxxx based in tehran in separate conversations with irpo officers said that officials in irans ministry of interior are willing to work with the united states on issues relating to afghanistan within united nations framework specifically they noted that the irig is seeking cooperation and assistance to address the problems of refugeeseconomic migrants from afghanistan and combating the flow of narcotics from afghanistan both men pointed to xxxxx as the likely irig lead on any such initiative end summary refugees and counter narcotics potential areas for technical cooperation 2 snf during november xxxxx described counternarcotics and refugees as areas ripe for cooperation between iran and the united states xxxxx there is strong support within the ministry of interior for joint and pragmatic approach to address problems emanating from afghanistan xxxxx argued that elements within the irig particularly at the subministerial and working levels would be comfortable working with the usg under the umbrella in separate conversation xxxxx said that iranian officials have repeatedly expressed interest to unodc staff in iran about working multilaterally including with the us and the uk to combat the production of drugs in afghanistan as well as drug trafficking tothrough iran 3 snf xxxxx said that any contribution on the part of the united states toward easing the societal and economic burdens the instability in afghanistan places on iran would be well received by both the people and the government of iran iranians in his estimation feel that their assistance to afghan refugees over the decades of war in that country has been unappreciated by the international community in general and the us in particular xxxxx also argued that explicit and tangible contributions to refugee assistance above and beyond our contributions to unhcr would help undermine irig officials attempts to portray usg actions in the region as inhumane xxxxx cited increasing negative domestic press coverage of the effects on iran caused by the reverse flow of economic migrants from afghanistan to iran at the same time xxxxx cautioned against the usg publicly trying to take credit for its assistance as publicity could backfire by causing moi officials to back away 4 snf both xxxxx as potential interlocutor for both counternarcotics and refugee issues xxxxx is xxxxx able to get many things done xxxxx is known as pragmatist rather than an ideologue and has solid working relationship with the xxxxx in iran 5 snf xxxxx believes that just within the past couple of months members of tehrans political elite who favor cooperation with the west on afghanistan have become noticeably emboldened xxxxx while acknowledging that invitationonly discussions held in think tanks and research centers affiliated with state institutions hardly signals sea change in official thinking xxxxx argued forcefully that just few months ago such events would have been unthinkable 6 snf in separate discussion with xxxxx in early november irpo first heard that the iranian dubai 00000056 0022 of 002 government in this case xxxxx was keenly interested in counternarcotics cooperation with the us following up above via two separate agency officials based in iran we are now confident that this interest is genuine although we can not ascribe irig motivations asgard
