to elisabeth zahner jbfo zrh date 19 may 1999 from tia healy trust department telephon345 949 7212 fax 345 949 0993 subject patricia fleur spray trust dear elisabeth many thanks for your note on the above trust unfortunately we now have number of problems that i hope you might be able to help us clarify i have examined the deed and all of the other documentation on file and can find nothing to indicate that b lance sauertig and stanley n bergman had resigned or were removed as trustees donald hendel i believe works at bergman horowitz and i do not now think he was cotrustee according to the deed which came from bergman horowitz the power to remove and appoint trustees rests with the protector art iv who is jacob rothschild appointed in the deed we would be grateful for any information on the protector we have never had any correspondence with him although if he resigned and appointed successor we should have had written notification do you have any idea why mrs fleur is so disappointed with the co trustees with regard to the two additions to the trust we would like some formal notification of the payment from the paradise successor trust something that indicates that the patricia fleur spray trust is beneficiary with regard to the us507270 if this was distribution to mrs fleur from another trust which she decided to add to the pfs trust then we need to get letter of request from her to add this to the trust additionally as trustees we have to be careful about accepting money into the trust and would like to know the ultimate sources of both of these payments eg if it was another trust set up by patricia fleurs parents if the trust is to receive regular payments in the future from another trust it would obviously be helpful to get all of the details on file now with regard to the appointment of the new accountant we would be grateful if you could confirm whether he is mrs fleurs personal accountant rather than the accountant for the trust and also why the trust paid the fees for the previous accountant if he did not provide any accounts we note the appointment of new legal advisor for mrs fleur can you confirm whether it is her intention that he become cotrustee as mentioned previously this would need to be done in writing by the protector the governing law for this trust is the law of the state of connecticut so if there were any problems then we would need to get legal advice as we are not familiar with us law here this was the reason for having partners of bergman horowitz as cotrustees according to our files the authorised signatories of julius baer trust company are the only authorised signatories on the account and third party authorisations have been given benjamin merlo should be aware that in as far as the patricia fleur spray trust is concerned he should obtain the prior written consent of the trustees for any requests by the primary beneficiary and he should keep us informed of any problems mrs fleur might have with the trust i have presumed that the request for us150000 and the comment re the trust which expires in 2015 do not refer to the patricia fleur spray trust as from our files it is clear that there are number of trusts of which mrs fleur is beneficiary it seems that after many years of inactivity this trust is about to become active again it is therefore important that we clarify all outstanding matters as soon as possible we are most grateful for your kind assistance in getting this situation resolved many thanks and kind regards tia healy trust officer
