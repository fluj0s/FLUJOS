ailable online at http wwwgaog ovnewitems d06425pdfin response to 47704 junk fax complaints re presenting 102004 alleged violations during the period july 2005 through july 2006 the report further states that the co mmission fully addressed approx imately 85 percent of those alleged violations but that figure includes not only complaints against which th fcc issued citation but also violations that were found to be nonac tionable for various reasons gao activity as required under the jf pa on april 5 2006 the gao submitted its report to congress on the fccs enforcement of the junk fax law7 the report addressed the following the fccs junk fax procedures and outcomes the strengths and weaknesse s of fccs procedures the fccs junk fax mana gement challenges the gao found that the fcc had institu ted procedures for receiving and acknowledging the increasing number of junk fax complaints but that the numbers of investigations and enforcement actions had remained mostly the same for example the gao stated that in 2000 the fcc recorded about 2200 junk fax complaints in 2005 the fcc recorded over 46000 complaints however in total the gao found that the fccs enforcement bureau issued only 261 warn ings from 2000 th rough 2005 further the gao discovered that although the bureau had ordered six companies to pay forfeitures totaling over 69 million for continuing to violate the junk fax rules after receiving warnings none of that total had been collect ed by the department of justice the gao also stated that fcc officials cited competing demands resource constraints and the rising sophistication of violators in hiding their identities as hindrances to enforcement with respect to strengths and weakne sses in the fccs procedures the gao determined that an emphasis on customer service an effort to document consumers complaints and an attempt to target enforcement resources efficiently were strengths in fccs procedures however inefficient data management resulting in timeconsuming manual data entry data errors and most importantly the exclusion of the majority of complaints from decisions about investig ations and enforcement continue to be weaknesses further the gao stated that the fcc does not pr ovide consumers with adequate guidance or information to s upport the fccs enforcement efforts finally the gao stated that fcc faces ma nagement challenges in carrying out its junk fax responsibilities the fcc has clear ly articulated longterm or annual goals for junk fax monitoring and enforcement nd it is not analyzing the data it collectshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21647crs5 without analysis the fcc cannot assess whether it needs to change its rules procedures or consumer guidance guidelines mo st importantly the gao found that without performance goals and measures and without analysis of comp laint and enforcement data it was not possible to explore the effectiveness of current enforcement measures
