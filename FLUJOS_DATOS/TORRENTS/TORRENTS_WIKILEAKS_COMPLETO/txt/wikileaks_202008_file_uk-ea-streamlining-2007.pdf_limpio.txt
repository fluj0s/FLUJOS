the objective of the streamlining project is to reduce the proportion of expenditure on flood ris k management projects that we are spending on project development project development has been defined as all work up to the point of investment decision where we enter into contrac t to deliver flood risk management benefit the office of government commerce refers to t his decision point as gateway three beyond gateway three we are making discernable change to floodrisk usually by making some sort of intervention eg constructing wall or embankment in ord er to reduce the probability of an event having negative impacts project development therefore includes all of the following the initial identificati on of need prefeasibility study and report viability study and report strategy study and report project appraisal report par project planning packaging detailed design and procurement engineering consultants carry out the majority of the above activities in addit ion project development often involves some or all of the following before gateway three topologica l hydrogeological and archaeological surveys and other intrusive site investigations environmenta l surveys and impact assessments and cost consultants ncpms andor regionalarea staff manage the above project development work supplied by external partners and some assessment of the internal cost of this needs to be included there is sig nificant amount of expenditure on project development that is funded from revenue budgets andor local lev and as result is not included as part of the capital programme project delivery post gateway 3 covers the cost of the contractor as well as number of overhead costs such as project supervision cost consultants and the management of the deli very phase baseline and current position there are two parts to frm project spend external expenditure through framework and other suppliers and the internal cost of staff who manage the programme we do not currently track the cost of project development and the current implementation of fi nancial systems cannot provide an accurate figure 1b1s gives detail of expenditure against over 300 category codes of which 12 are most likely to c over the majority of frm project spend by only considering expenditure by ncpms area asset syst em management or operations delivery there is total external frm project spend of 217m in 200506 and 199m in 20067 the estimated cost of environment agency staff is an additional 10m using information from framework partners and our understanding of the programme we apply an estimated proportion of each category code and staff cost to project development and project delivery this gives us baseline position based on the last two years as follows 200506 200607 total frm project development 660m 707m total frm project spend 2323m 2145m project development 28 33 diagnosis and root cause analysis the first stage of streamlining was full diagnosis of the existing approach to the program and projects this consisted of tracing back types of waste associated with the approa ch the observable sources of this waste and identifying the key root causes in addition we highlight number of weaknesses of the current approach that are of concern the types of waste identified were overprocessing number of steps overproduction too many 4 projects excess work too much detail and goldplating delay handovers waiting and rework ff specification rescoping the sources of waste were system wide and affected three di fferent areas process products roles responsibilities and controls tools this waste is occurring because of three root causes that need to be addressed the push system there is bubbling up of demand for capital funding with individual projects areas and regions competing against one another for limited funds this compares to pull system where national strategic assessment of risk would result in loc ations being objectively selected for appraisal risk aversion both at programme level where an unrealistic desire for cost certain ty drives higher spend too early in the process and at project level where political pressu re can result in appraisal expenditure on projects that are unlikely to receive fdgia funding in the nearterm and organisational complexity parts of the organisation operate in silos with mult iple handovers between area region and ncpms each of which contributes to additional cost this root cause also contributes to lack of clarity about accountabilit for expenditure on appraisal some overlapping responsibilities and contradictory views about the process an d products due to the fundamental nature of the root causes as well as other weaknesses with the current approach the solution requires holistic systemwide approach includi ng culture change as well as changes to processes and procedures the streamlining improvements implementing streamlining will require significant ch ange in three areas process products roles responsibilities and controls tools streamlined product hierarchy removing two products prefeasibility and viability reports clarification of the scope and boundaries of the each of the four products as shown below strategy plans andor par only where change to the standard of service1 is proposed cost effectiveness appraisals based on asset management plans for sustain replacement projects 1 standard of service defined objective measure for an asset eg for wall this would b the height in metres above ordin ance datum maod and minimum condition grade in line with the potential consequenc of failure 5 streamlined process introduce an early attrition of candidate projects using available national datasets provide simplified cost effectiveness appraisal route for asset replacemen t projects and better use of gateway zero to control the initiation of appraisals gateway one to gi ve technical approval of the preferred option and gateway three to make the final investment decisi on streamlined roles and responsibilities centralisation of the accountability and budget for appraisal of changes to the standard of service local accountability for wholelife costs increased local decisionmaking and accountability f or the longterm cost of sustaining the agreed standard of service1 streamlined controls tools collect and record the required data once to support decisionmaking and enable better control usin g appropriate technology in line with industry bestpractice provide project programme and portfolio management tools for practitioners at all leve ls the business case for streamlining in addition to the strategic case outlined above significant annual savings have been ident ified based on 200m programme predominantly from reduced expenditure on engineering consultants key streamlining activity estimated savings remove pregateway 0 studies prefeasibility inception reports etc 175 35m remove viability product some work still carried out within strategy or par 045 09m simplified replacement route reduced option appraisal 065 13m fewer change projects started attrition at gateway 0 125 25m total savings per annum 410 82m the cost of implementing streamlining has three main components the process and products workstream detail design testing guidance the controls and tools workstream information technology to support and provide visibility the roles and responsibilities workstream developing training and embedding the skills required alongside the above is the cost of programme management and governance of the implementation the degree of external support required depends on the approach and speed of implementation we have estimated the cost of implementing streamlining to range from 18m over 18 24 months 6 2 introduction 21 case for change the streamlining project started in response to the 2004 spending review when the env ironment agency agreed to reduce by 15 the proportion of total frm project expenditure spent on project development this reflected the requirements of the gershon review to increase the proport ion of public funds spent on valueadding activity and was specified in defras 2004 delivery plan and the environment agencys 2005 corporate plan the streamlining project was initiated to address this target the object ive of the streamlining project is to deliver greater outputs reduced flood risk from the same input money by sp ending less on project development and more on activities that directly reduce flood risk the environm ent agency has defined project development expenditure as that incurred pregateway 3 this includes identification f need appraisal and detailed design activities delivery refers to the construction or ther deployment of capital which achieve value adding results the strategic case for streamlining is presented in section 3 22 baseline the environment agencys finance and project managem ent systems are not constructed in such way to enable us to accurately calculate the proportion of development expenditure in ddition we cannot establish expenditure for each part of the process there is reconciliation between budgeted and actual expenditure at programme level and the total expenditure developing frm projects is unknown especially locally in curred expenditure in order to establish baseline we have used the actual expenditure on third parties nd attributed additional costs based on staff remuneration the methodology and assumptions behind the baseline are discussed in appendix 4 to th is report 7 23 approach the diagram below summarises the approach we have adopted to undertake this piece of work the key stages have been diagnose issues diagnosis phase was undertaken to understand how the current system works and identify the key factors driving the high proportion of expenditure on project development this was informed by meetings and workshops with stakeholders and fieldwork exercise to examine 32 projects in greater detail acceptance of the diagnosis meeting with four directors was held in march 2006 to present t he root cause analysis at this meeting the directors asked the project team to develop an ac tion plan to address the identified sources of waste but also to consider more fundamental change t address the root causes including alternative organisational designs for more efficient deliv ery of frm develop and evaluate options an options development phase was undertaken during which we developed an action plan alongside three potential organisational models centralised model devolved model and hybrid version the action plan consisted of nine individual actions eac h designed to address the sources of waste identified in the diagnosis but not capable of addressing the root causes initial preferred solution we presented these options to directors in june 2006 when they accepted all nine actions but decided that the three structural models should not be pursued due t the recent ifrm changes instead the directors asked the team to develop the nine acti ons into holistic solution which delivered the benefits of the hybrid model but withou t involving major organisational change develop preferred solution solution development phase was undertaken to develop and test the holistic solution including further consideration of the key features of the soluti on and the qualitative and quantitative benefits and risks this phase involved numerous interviews and wo rkshops with key stakeholders as set out in appendix 2 initial reactions once sufficient detail of the holistic solution had been dev eloped we took the solution to each of the directors in november 2006 and explained key features taking feedback and incorporating this into the solution key aspect of the streamlined model is the distinction between investment that sustains the agreed standard of service and investment that seeks to potentially change the standard of service option choice this solution development phase was completed with mee ting with directors in february 2007 to decide on the proposed solution at this meeting directors accepted the proposed product hierarchy process and allocation method and requested more work be done on the roles and responsibilities alongside developing the business case diagnose issuesdevelop preferred solution develop business caseselect preferred solutionacceptance of diagnosisdevelop and evaluate options 8 develop business case the team subsequently spent time with key stakeholders to addres s remaining issues by putting greater detail into various parts of the model and adjusti ng the process to address concerns more detailed expenditure data was made available to reduce the uncertainty of the baseline and savings so that benefits realisation plan could be developed alongside this we have put together the business case and evaluated the solution against donothing and do minimum in order to test the preferred solution draft business case on april 13th 2007 we presented draft business case to directors this raised few key outstanding issues that needed to be addressed and on may 15th 2007 directors were presented and agreed to number of amendments to the streamlining model which have been incorporated into this business case the approach has involved numerous interviews and workshops with key stakeholders including 5 steering meetings with directors as well as numerous meetings with area regional and ncpms representatives and specific stakeholders on specialist subject areas list of the stakeholders we have engaged with is included in appendix 2 in summary directors and stakeholders have been consulted throughout the diagnosis option development and preferred solution development stages and have provided guidance to the project in reaching the preferred option the remainder of this section sets out the rationale behind selecting the preferred opti on 24 purpose of the business case the purpose of this business case is to set out the case for change by considering the findings of the work undertaken to date to identify the root causes of the high level of development expenditure this is covered in section 3 strategic case evaluate the solution developed in stages over the last 12 months against the donoth ing and do minimum options using both qualitative and quantitative criteria this is c overed in section 4 appraisal of options explain the solution in greater detail how investment decision products relat the process roles and responsibilities and how expenditure is controlled we also set out the key benefits and risks of operating the new approach this is covered in section 5 preferred solution 9 3 strategic case this section sets out the case for change starting with restating the orig inal diagnosis accepted by directors in march 2006 in addition we set out number of external pressures which are relevant to delivering major efficiencies finally we set out the resulting objectives of the streamlining work in order to fix the problems identified and deliver the efficiencies required 31 the diagnosis in march 2006 directors were presented with full diagnosis of the approach to the programme and projects that make up the capital programme this consisted of tracing back types of waste associated with the approach the observable sources of this waste and identifying the key root causes in addition we highlight number of weaknesses of the current approach that are of concern 311 types of waste and their observable sources the types of waste i nherent in any system overprocessing number of steps overproduction too many items excess work goldplating delay and rework via interviews with staff and sample of projects we found number of sources of the above wa ste that we grouped into three categories process products roles responsibilities and controls and tools process and products there has been growing process burden because when project errors occur we have introduced additional processes and intermediate products in an attempt to prevent the potential for repeat and poor ownership and overview of the end to end process with effective means of challenging the introduction of additional steps or products wide variation in the degree to which process and procedure guidance is followed because it is confusing inadequate or nonexistent lack of clarity about how each of the investment decision products fit together the s cope of each product and the detail required an unknown number of investment decision products are in development at each stage with expenditure only visible locally 10 roles and responsibilities there are silo behaviours due to organisat ional complexity with numerous handovers and multiple project managers lack of clarity about responsibilities resulting in poor accountability poor line of sight from inception to completion both for each project and the whole progra mme and lack of ownership for the endtoend process staff turnover and variable skillbase have an adverse effect on the organisations abi lity to act as an intelligent client and manage input from consultants in the most ef ficient way local political pressure can lead to high expenditure on projects with low benefits and process guidance providers too are remo from both practitioners and approvers controls and tools lack of ability to track financial expenditure on projects from inception to com pletion across the programme as whole there is lot of reporting by ncpms and area project managers but few effective t ools to help them manage projects controls are predominantly focused on preventing the potential to repeat previous errors rather than detection and management which increases the process burden there is lack of ability to identify at programme level when project is unlikel to deliver benefits in proportion to the expenditure and therefore limit the expenditure at an early stage apparent link between budgeted cost of appraisal and the scale of potential benefits and budgets inflated to avoid having to request budget increases form g there is gaming to circumvent current controls due to national competition f or resources eg engaging consultants to undertake additional detailed work to increase benefits strategic decision makers have little control over expenditure at the early stages f project development as this expenditure is not visible at national level and the requirement for preconstruction costcertainty coupled with need to spend t he budget and penalties for overspend leads to one of two consequences budget inflation at the st art of the project to ensure all ri sks can be managed within the budget or sacrifice of quality if the budget proves insufficient 312 root cause analysis the sources of waste identified above arise because of deeper root causes identified below the push system there is bubbling up of demand for capital funding with individual projects areas and regions competing against one another for limited funds this compares to pull system where national strategic assessment of risk would result in loc ations being objectively selected for appraisal risk aversion both at programme level where an unrealistic desire for cost certain ty drives higher spend too early in the process and at project level where political pressu re can result in appraisal expenditure on projects that are unlikely to receive fdgia funding in the nearterm and organisational complexity parts of the organisation operate in silos with mult iple handovers between area region and ncpms each of which contributes to additional cost 11 this root cause also contributes to lack of clarity about accountabilit for expenditure on appraisal some overlapping responsibilities and contradictory views about the process an d products directors accepted the diagnosis and root cause analysis in march 2006 at this meeting t he directors also acknowledged that due to the fundamental nature of the root causes the soluti on requires holistic systemwide approach including culture change as well as changes to p rocesses and procedures 313 other weaknesses with the current approach in addition to the above sources of waste and root causes that result in high proportion of expenditure on project development there are also number of other weaknesses ssociated with the current system the existing system is focused predominantly on contro lling access to capital so as to ensure that for each project we make the economic optimum decision this means subjecting all po tential capital investment to rigorous appraisal since we cannot afford to deliver all the projects iden tified by these appraisals priority score is used to ration the number of projects that can proceed past ga teway 1 this approach fails on number of fronts threshold competition the current approach encourages increased appraisal expenditure in order to achieve the priority score funding threshold eg undertake further investi gations with the aim of trying to identify additional benefits and reduce delivery costs suboptimal programme the current approach encourages the investigation of economically optimum decisions in every location while in reality we cannot affo rd to deliver these projects the result is that we deliver an optimum reduction in flood risk to relat ively few locations perverse prioritisation all capital investment competes on the basis of prio rity score but this does not take into account of the cost of disposing of an existing asset in some c ases not funding the timely replacement of existing assets means we are effectively allowing them to deteriorate without proper consideration of either the immediate or strategic im pacts social environmental or financial in locations where this reactive approach is ut of the question we may incur excessive maintenance costs to maintain the st andard of service andor reactive emergency works and portfolio sustainability the environment agency does not have clear understanding of the longterm cost associated with the current frm asset portfolio both in terms of maintenance and eventual replacement ther is systematic mechanism for accounting for this portfolio viewpoint in making investment decisions in developing holistic solution to address high development costs the abov weaknesses must be taken into account 32 other pressures and context since the streamlining project was initiated there have been number of developments in the political landscape that raise the profile of this work the potential result for failing to deliver the required gershon efficiencies th is affects our reputation and questions our competence the likelihood that the comprehensive spending review 2007 will increase pressure to deliv er significant efficiencies and the requirement to demonstrate external stakeholders that the environment agency is c apable of delivering savings by improving efficiency as always there remains the risk of frm asset failure with potentially ca tastrophic consequences the environment agency would face intense scrutiny by the media and potential pub lic enquiry if the competence of the environment agency is questioned the politics could demand majo r change in 12 responsibility for frm especially since frm is very different function fro m the core business of environmental regulation on risk grounds alone the arrangements for frm must be brought up to standard which would pass scrutiny based on good practice including the efficiency and effe ctiveness in delivering an frm service and developing projects in summary the case for streamlining is strong baseline demonstrates that the proportion of expenditure remains high sources of waste require action to rectify the root causes of waste remain other weaknesses with the current approach other political and funding pressures to deliver significant efficiencies and the need for the environment agency to be seen as competent frm delivery mechan ism 33 objectives of the streamlining project the solution must address the failures in the current system by recognising that until we have carried out an appraisal we cannot change our commitment to an existing standard of service2 understanding the scale and future costs of these existing commitments in order to inform our investment strategy asset portfolio management accepting that we cannot afford to carry out an appraisal to change the standard of rvice in all locations and focussing appraisal of change on those locations where we are likely to deliver the greate st contribution to our targets the solution should be aimed at achieving value for money at programme level rather than individual project level and optimising the programme within the boundaries of affordability in order to achieve significant reduction in project development costs the solut ion needs to address the root causes of the high level of expenditure on development identified in the diagnosis phase therefore the objectives can be broken down further as follows to increase the attrition rate of projects at an earlier stage in the capital programme to produce less complex more consistent framework of investment decision products to facilitate culture shift towards risk management rather that risk elimina tion to lead with national approach in managing flood risk rather than reactive and demand led to take holistic view of the longerterm programme and asset portfolio susta inability and to provide better visibility of expenditure finally the solution must also be achievable deliverable and operate within acc eptable risk levels 2 see glossary for terminology description 13 4 appraisal of options the following section sets out the criteria for assessing the options and gives brief description of 3 options and qualitative and quantitative assessment before selecting preferred optio n the preferred option will be explained in greater detail in section 5 41 assessment criteria drawing from the objectives set out in the previous section and the parameters identi fied at the directors meeting in march 2006 we have developed the following set of criteria which we have used to ev aluate the options assessment criteria description does the option result in less complex more consistent framework of investment decision products does the option increase the attrition rate of projects at an earlier stage does the option facilitate culture shift towards risk management rather that risk elimination financial efficiency does the option reduce the proportion of frm capital expenditure spent on development by 15 pa management information does the option provide improved information of expenditure at each project stage for all frm expenditure from inception to completion sustainability does the option seek to capture and recognise the longterm costs of existing commitments before adding to them risk deliverability how complex and risky will the solution be to implement and operate 42 assessment of the options based on the findings of the diagnosis phase the objectives set out in the previous sec tion and the parameters set out above we have identified the following three options for consideration 1 do nothing retain existing approach 2 do minimum retain the existing approach but alongside this make the necessary changes to the way information about expenditure is collected and analysed the objective of thes changes would be to provide greater transparency and contro l of where expenditure is incurred in order to establish baseline and mechanism for estimating potential savings of fut ure changes to the approach or 3 streamline existing system im plement the changes necessary to move from push to pull system for initiating project appraisal develop simplified project development route for replacement projects and improve management information systems 14 other suboptions for option 3 were considered and the preferred option narrowed down based on feedback from the steering group as discussed in section 23 421 option 1 do nothing the do nothing option involves retaining the existing approach as described in appendix 3 the table below sets out how the do nothing option performs against the qualitative criteria set out ab ove qualitative assessment criteria description comments does the option result in less complex more consistent framework of investment decision products improvement does the option increase the attrition rate of projects at an earlier stage impact does the option facilitate culture shift towards risk management rather that risk elimination impact financial efficiency does the option reduce the proportion of frm capital expenditure spent on development by 15 pa the environment agency would fail to meet this defra target as continuing with the current approach will not result in real reduction in development expenditure management information does the option provide improved information of expenditure at each project stage for all frm expenditure from inception to completion improvement sustainability does the option seek to capture and recognise the longterm costs of existing commitments before adding to them improvement there would still be risk that the capital programme is not financially sustainable in the longterm when in place amps will capture the long term costs associated with maintaining and replacing the environment agencys existing assets however there are currently plans to integrate this information with the funding allocation process for the frm capital programme therefore there would still be risk that the frm asset portfolio is financially unsustainable risk deliverability how complex and risky will the solution be to implement and operate while the implementation risks are non existent the existing system will continue to represent some operational risks for example i an unsustainable portfolio of assets is developed the current system does not factor in the affordability of maintaining the existing assets this is not sustainable in the context of fixed budgets ii failure of existing assets the prioritisation system is weighted towards improvement maintenance activity is not systematically assessed to ensure it is delivering value for money consequently there are asset systems awaiting replacement capital where there is high risk of failure this means that in some cases we are effectively allowing existing assets to deteriorate without proper appraisal of the consequences 15 iii incoming investment decis ion products do not add value to organisation there is existing or proposed hierarchy for the new products there is high risk that the additional cost in these areas will not reduce costs in others eg appraisal there is shared view about the role of existing products such as strategies iv national audit office review potential questions from the national audit office and public accounts committee regarding the ability to measure savings and improve efficiency quantitative assessment this section sets out the potential financial benefits and costs of th do nothing option obviously the do nothing option would cost nothing to implement but it would also fail to genera any benefits this would mean that the environment agency would fail to meet its defra target to reduce the proportion of frm capital expenditure spent on development by 5 each year for 3 years 422 option 2 do minimum the do minimum option involves improving the ex isting management information systems to provide greater transparency around where expenditure is incurred in particular the ability to track expenditure by project and location for all appraisal activity whet her by area ncpms or any other party the ability to record the cost incurred in each stage of project development the ability to track actual expenditure and compare it to budget for all frm asset exp enditure and for all appraisal and delivery activity and provide way of measuring both the current proportion of the programme spent on development and any future progress against the target qualitative assessment the table below sets out how the do minimum option performs against the qualit ative criteria set out above criteria description comments does the option result in less complex more consistent framework of investment decision products improvement does the option increase the attrition rate of projects at an earlier stage impact does the option facilitate culture shift towards risk management rather that risk elimination greater visibility of expenditure will not in itself create shift towards risk management approach however improved management information may facilitate more error detection and management methods rather than more process financial efficiency does the option reduce the proportion of frm capital expenditure spent on development by 15 pa the environment agency would fail to meet this defra target 16 management information does the option provide improved information of expenditure at each project stage for all frm expenditure from inception to completion the option would improve the amount and quality of management information available in relation to expenditure on the frm asset projects sustainability does the option seek to capture and recognise the longterm costs of existing commitments before adding to them minimal improvement via amps but without changes to process there is means to recognise the longterm costs and managing this systematically therefore there would still be risk regarding the longterm financial sustainability of the frm asset portfolio risk deliverability how complex and risky will the solution be to implement and operate the implementation risks associated with improving the environment agencys management information are issues with reconfiguring the current financial system issues with reimplementing the projects module links to other systems in addition whilst this option would address current issues with management information most of the operational risks relating to the current approach will remain as discussed in the do nothing option i an unsustainable portfolio of assets is developed ii failure of existing assets iii incoming products do t add value to organisation quantitative assessment this section sets out the potential financial benefits and costs of the do minimu m option implementing the do minimum option would not explicitly lead to any financial bene fits and this would mean that the ea is likely to fail to meet its defra target however this option can be seen as first step to realising potential efficiency savings in that by improving the visibility of expenditure the ea would be in position to gain grea ter control over expenditure and consequently put measures in place to reduce levels of spend these measures are proposed in option 3 it is also possible that the process of improving transparency around expendi ture would alter behaviours so that expenditure falls the implementation costs associated with the do minimum option are in the regi on of 05m over 6 months this relates to consultancy costs for gap analysis and specification with the likely requirement of resource for reconfiguring key parts of the oracle financials as well as reimpleme nting the oracle project module within the system it does not include any additional license costs or custom ization assuming that standard specification of the projects module will be sufficie nt 423 option 3 implement streamlining this option involves implementing streamlining as described in detail in t he following section 5 there are four key changes to the existing system 1 separating frm asset projects into two development processes based on decision risk one for replacement projects replacement candidates and one for projects which are proposing change to the standard of service change candidates one aim of separating the programme into two di fferent processes is to provide greater transparency around the level of funding associated with maintaining and replacing the existing asset portfolio over the coming years this would therefore enable the environment agency to make more informed judgements about when and where to seek c hanges to the agreed standard of service and the size and shape of the change programme required 17 2 developing streamlined project development route prior to gateway 1 for replacement projects for projects where replacement is in line with the policy intent in the catchment f lood management plan and benefits identified in the asset management plan justify the long term cost of the existing standard of service streamlined project development route would be available the streamlined pathway for replacement projects would mirror the latter stages of t he current appraisal process ie cost effectiveness appraisal to identify the preferred technica l solution to deliver the agreed standard of service defined in the asset management plan it would therefore not requi re evaluation of different options to change the standard of service responsibility for this channel would be held at the area level 3 moving from push to pull system for init iating project appraisal fo r change candidates change projects would be initiated only after being given mandate at programme level b ased on an assessment of risk at gateway 0 this approach recognises that the environment agency cannot afford to appraise all potentia l change candidates filter would operate at gateway 0 using nationally held data to prioritise potential projects based on number of criteria such as the extent to which the project contri butes towards outcome measures and the urgency of intervention the number of change projects that proceed past this stage would be constrained by an assessment of the amount of funding available given the vel of commitment required to fund the replacement programme this would reduce the amount of work undertaken on change projects pre gateway 0 and would also reduce the number of projects proceeding past gateway 0 responsibility for the appraisal of change candidates would be held centrally 4 improving the existing management informat ion systems to provide greater transparency around where expenditure is incurred for this option the management information solution woul d need to go beyond that described in the do minimum option in order to support the new model key requirement of the enhanced management informatio n system would include the ability to track all expenditure related to the frm asset portfolio against either the cost of sustaining t he standard of service or the cost of changing the standard of service for expenditure relating to the sustain programme the cost of producing asset management plans the cost by asset system whether maintenance repair or replacement both historic and planned future expenditure in order to understand the wholelife cost and any consultant expenditure relating to supporting the sustain programme for expenditure relating to the change programme the cost of producing smps cfmps and other highlevel strategies eg te2100 location of the all proposed change to the standard of service pregateway 0 record expenditure at each stage of developing project from inception to completion g0 g05 g1 g3 delivery and the type of expenditure consultant contractor site investigation cos t consultant etc 18 qualitative assessment the table below sets out how the implement streamlining option performs against the qualitative criteria criteria description comments does the option result in less complex more consistent framework of investment decision products there are two new key products which will be introduced from 2007 catchment flood management plans cfmps and asset management plans amps the current approach to project development does not currently relate to either of these products in particular there are differing opinions about the boundaries between cmfps and project appraisal as well as between project appraisal and amps this model will provide clear framework within which these products operate the key benefit is that the model will use the investment channelled into these products to support decision making for example using cfmps as an additional filter in selecting projects for appraisal and using amps as means to provide visibility of expenditure by asset system and manage their whole life costs this option would bring more clarity and distinction to the roles and responsibilities of areas and ncpms in relation to the development of capital projects and would reduce the number of handovers and also the complexity of multiple client relationships does the option increase the attrition rate of projects at an earlier stage the move from push to pull system for initiating projects would result in greater attrition rate of projects at gateway 0 filter would operate at gateway 0 to select those projects which contribute most to outcome measure targets or are most urgent this assessment would take place at programme level and be guided by assumptions around the number of projects that can be funded by the capital programme budget over the coming years currently projects are filtered at gateway 1 and would have undergone significant investment prior to reaching this stage therefore reducing the number of projects initiated would lead to significant savings financial efficiency does the option facilitate culture shift towards risk management rather that risk elimination implementing streamlining would facilitate the shift toward risk management in number of ways by clarifying accountability for project expenditure and decisions streamlining would simplify the ownership of decisions reducing the ability to hide behind committee style collective decisions by providing training for project managers and decision makers in the use of tolerance as method of managing risk as part of delivering projects by providing improved management information and tools 19 criteria description comments for managing risks at both the programme and project level facilitating more error detection and management methods rather than more process better controls would provide comfort for managers that both potential and realised risks are being detected and acted upon does the option reduce the proportion of frm capital expenditure spent on development by 15 pa the quantitative analysis later in this section shows that the estimated savings associated with this option are in the region of 82m per annum this represents approximately 4 reduction in the proportion of the investment programme spent developing projects management information does the option provide improved information of expenditure at each project stage for all frm expenditure from inception to completion this option would provide significant improvements to the amount and quality of management information available in relation to expenditure on the capital programme sustainability does the option seek to capture and recognise the long term costs of existing commitments before adding to them amps would provide information on the whole life cost of existing asset systems they also provide forward analysis of when asset systems would requ ire large injection of investment in order to continue providing the current standard of service collectively amps would provide important information as to the financial sustainability of the current frm asset portfolio and indicate the affordability of making additional acquisitions and enhancements risk deliverability how complex and risky will the solution be to implement and operate set out below are number of the key risks associated with operating this option which would need to be managed the new model recognises that the environment agency cannot afford to appraise all potential change candidates however the environment agency will need to accept that the trade off associated with reducing the number of projects which undergo appraisal is that in some cases there may be less optimal decisions made for example in the new model there may be instances where an existing asset is not considered priority to undergo appraisal ie undergo an assessment of whether the level of protection should change in this case the asset may end up being replaced to the same standard of protection whereas if an appraisal had been undertaken there is possibility that it could have concluded that higher cost benefit ratio could be achieved by improving or reducing the level of protection the replacement route would represent significantly simplified version of the change route there is risk that projects which should be change candidates take the replacement route in order to increase the speed of delivery and reduce the level of input required this is mitigated be series of controls and checks on this route set out in section 52 there is risk that amps and cfmps are not of sufficient quality to provide the planned controls of potential replacement and change candidates in reliable and robust manner recent review of cmfps has highlighted quality 20 criteria description comments and consistency issues equally amps do not yet exist this means the specification and production of the two products are key focus of the implementation the environment agency needs to consider whether the reduced level of expenditure on project development justifies these increased risks these operational iss ues and proposed mitigating actions are considered in more detail in section 5 quantitative analysis this section considers the financial benefits and co sts of the streamline existing system option in summary we have identified the potential for approximately 82m of annual savi ngs predominantly in reduced expenditure on consultants the cost of implementing the streamline option has been est imated at 18m financial benefits significant annual savings have been identified based on 200m programme predominantly from reduced expenditure on engineering consultants activity estimated savings remove pregateway 0 studies prefeasibility inception reports etc 175 35m remove viability reports 045 09m simplified replacement route reduced option appraisal 065 13m gateway 0 mandate fewer change projects initiated 125 25m total savings 410 82m the detailed assumptions underpinning these savings are set out in appendix 5 implementation costs the main changes are associated with removing current redundant investment appraisal products prefeasibility and viability prototyping and piloting each of the proposed change gateway 0 and the sustain gateway 0 developing fit for purpose product specifications for investment appraisal products mps cfmps strategy plans project appraisal reports cost effectiveness appraisals introducing and embedding the new process for projects and decision making changing roles and responsibilities to support the above changes and changing the management informatio n system to support the above changes we have set out the estimated resource requirements and costs based on an assumed approach to implementation that uses inhouse resource w here possible and leverages external support where required the cost of implementing has been estimated at 18m depending upon the level of ex ternal support required 21 43 conclusion option 1 do nothing should be rejected as it fails to meet any of the objective s of the project in addition the environment agency would remain exposed to number of existing risks such as the sustainability and affordability of the capital programme and the risk that some as sets are effectively being allowed to deteriorate without proper appraisal of the consequences most importantly thi s project has highlighted that the environment agencys management information systems and aspects of it s portfolio and programme management is inadequate for the scale of public investmen t and adverse risk associated with the programme maintaining the status quo would leave the envi ronment agency exposed to scrutiny from number of external bodies and the public option 2 do minimum makes proactive attempt to reduce either the sources of was identified in section 311 the root causes in section 312 or address any of the identi fied failings of the current approach detailed in section 313 as such it is unlikely to directly result in reduction in the cost of project development this option could potentially represent first step towards im plementing the preferred option by delivering improved programme and project information it is estimat ed that the implementation costs associated with this option would be approximately 08m nd would not directly result in any measurable reduction of the cost of project development option 3 streamline existing model is the preferred option as it is the option that per forms most strongly against the criteria it has been specifically designed to address where possible the sources of waste identified in section 311 the root causes in section 3 12 and address the identified failings of the current approach detailed in section 313 it is estimated that the total implem entation costs associated with this option would be approximately 18m over 18 24 months in return it is est imated that this option would make an initial reduction in the cost of project development of 41 generating approximately 82m of annual savings on 200m frm project programme taking the average project development cost over the last two years of 30 this provides an ex pected reduction due to streamlining to just under 26 within two years the payback period fo r the initial implementation of streamlining is less than two years in addition by implementing streamlining there is the potential for futu re reductions in the cost of project development toward the target of 20 as we develop greater knowledge of the programme and further reduce some aspects of project development expenditure to suit implementing streamli ning would result in significant improvements to the environment agencys management informat ion systems in order to provide greater transparency and control of expenditure implementing streamlining lso facilitates the drive for improved asset management by providing important information as to t he financial sustainability of the current frm asset portfolio as well as indicating the affordability of mak ing additional asset acquisitions and improvements 22 5 preferred option this section describes of the preferred option in more detail and considers the key i mplications benefits and risks of pursuing this solution 51 the streamlined model the streamlined model would divide frm activity relating to assets broadly int sustain programme activity and investment required to sustain the ex isting portfolio where we wish to continue providing the agreed standard of service and change programme to investigate strategic options for further reducing flood risk the sustain programme would focus on delivering for the best value for money t he current commitment measured by meeting performance specifications whilst minimising the wholelife cost it is proposed that responsibility for the sustain programme would be held at the area level and incl ude producing asset management plans setting out the costs and benefits of existing as sets managing the maintenance repair and replacement of assets to minimise wholeli fe cost and identifying candidate change projects and submitting them for investigation the change programme would be concerned with delivering changes to further reduce flood risk measured by outcome measures it is proposed that national teams would hold responsibility for the change programme including analysing potential locations for changing the standard of service and cons ulting with regions and stakeholders on which change projects to appraise commissioning the investment appraisal of change projects and holding the budget for this and the delivery of change projects that receive approval and funding at the heart of the model is the programme level activity to enable these two funct ions to deliver on their areas of responsibility the model has four elements that are inextricably linked the hierarchy of products the process for projects going through the system the allocation method and roles and responsibilities 23 52 asset investment decision products taking account of the different views and responsibilities and addressing the needs of the many stakeholders and partners in developing an frm project is not simple there are plethora of i nterested parties including rfdcs local authorities highways drainage land management asset management emergency teams regeneration partnerships natural england water companies british waterway s network rail emergency services and others shoreline catchment flood management plans scfmp are one important element of t he planning framework and bring some coherence to the complex vironment these are vital and implementation of streamlining will require significant effort to ensure that scfmps are fit f or purpose within the streamlining context equally asset management plans will be critical in the environment gencys ability to manage its commitments over the long term the organisation needs to ensure that the specific ation and cost of delivering these are well controlled and that they are effectively leveraged as means t define and measure the service the environment agency provides in terms of managing flood risk the proposed model attempts to incorporate both of these products within the context of the re quirement to reduce development costs the streamlined product hierarchy the diagram above shows how the four investment appraisal products that inform our inves tment decisions would relate with highlevel strategic plans at the top and more tactical plans at the bottom 521 shoreline catchment flood management plans scfmps would set the policy intent that can be translated as one of four policy objectives for each asset system reduce the current standard of service with disposal of assets where required continue with current standard of service sustain standard of service improve current standard of service to meet climate change risk etc maintain standard f protection and improve or enhance the current standard of service by improving the standard of protection 24 in addition scfmp would identify at macrolevel appropriate grouping of asset systems where there are interdependencies scfmp would not contain sufficient detail to make an invest ment decision as it would not develop options and therefore costs to sufficient level of detail but scfm p would lay appropriate boundaries within which more detailed investment appraisal can operate scf mp would take wider view of flood risk considering both actions that reduce the probability of flooding as well as actions that reduce the consequences of flooding the result of scfmp would be highlevel plan of the basket of measures by which th environment agency would undertake to reduce flood risk in the catchment some of those meas ures would require further investigation most commonly where an expensive hard engineering solution m ay be required other measures such as flood warning development control landuse planning incident manageme nt plans etc do not require rigorous investment appraisal more specific plans to deliver these ther measures would be part of regional plans and justified by other means usually as part of national strategy for each type of intervention being highlevel scfmps are not the appropriate vehicle for making investment dec isions they inform the boundaries within which we then plan and carry out our activities major decisions to change the standard of service requires more rigorous justification and must follow the gateway pr ocess beginning with gateway 0 and leading to project appraisal report for more complex or contentious c hanges strategy plan considers the wider context longterm updownstream effects as well as longterm financial and environmental sustainability more simple changes to the st andard of service would not require strategy plan the decision about whether strategy plan is required or not rests with the project sponsor at gateway 0 522 strategy plan as described above where change to the standard of service is complex or contentious t he options for managing flood risk are often best considered at the subcatchment or estuarywide level in t hese cases higherlevel strategy plan may be necessary because of the variability of the nature of flood risk and the methods available i n each situation for managing flood risk the strategy plan needs to be flexible this flexibilit will be reflected in scope and approach although there will remain fundamental similarities in the structure and contents an example of this would be the difference in approach for fluvial subcatchment with an urban conurbation c ompared to coastal management unit or an estuary in addition as additional information about the flood risk and the possible manage ment options are gathered the business case needs to be reassessed in this way the strategy plan must be able to absorb new information and detail as it arises and the impact on options for managing flood risk for example if the geology of an area proposed for possible storage reservoir is unsuitable and is l ikely to require significant treatment the business case should be updated to reflect this pot entially making this option not viable the decision to continue with investigating options for changing t he current standard of service must be taken with reference to the relative priority of th resulting investment in some cases it may be necessary to curtail the strategy plan and concentrate on other means of reducin g the consequences of flooding via improved flood warning incident management land use planning and development control strategy plan is not required to justify the replacement to the same stan dard of service of existing frm assets unless the amp cfmp or some other source suggests that the current standard of service is inappropriate either too high or too low having considered the potential to change the standard of service via strategy plan that does not in any way restrict the result of strategy p lan to contain mix of both sustain and change projects especially w here strategy contains multiple frm systems that are hydraulically interconnected at the subcatchment level the strategy plan product is not essentially different to the current project appraisal guidance pag strategy plan in analysing the current approach we have found that we cannot cut corners with appraisal but that the process and guidance needs to be more coherent and clear having said that we need to take new approach to choosing where and how much we spend developing this product based on 25 an impartial and objective national perspective of risk the longterm financial sustainability of the current asset portfolio and more closely matching the supply of justified change projects in line wit h funding future changes to project appraisal guidance would need to be taken into account to ensure the strategy plan continues to fit within the framework of investment decision produc ts and continue to adhere to the relevant guidance the process for starting at gateway 0 and completing at gateway 05 of strategy pl an will be discussed in greater detail later 523 project appraisal report par there are essentially three different types of par depending on the route taken but all begi n at gateway 0 and all finish at gateway 1 one of these is specifically for projects that s eek to sustain the current standard of service whilst the other two relate to potential changes to the curren t standard of service and are alternatives depending on whether strategy plan is required or not replacement par seeking either a3 or a2 approval for those projects that have been given mandate via gateway 0 for replacement to the c urrent standard of service these projects would be the subject of relatively short cost eff ectiveness appraisal various options for delivering the agreed standard of service are compared and t he one with the lowest wholelife cost whilst satisfying other requirements is selected as the preferred option change par seeking a2 approval an a2 project appraisal report is required for those projects where change to the standard of service sos has been determined within strategy plan that has been given a9 approval if the strategy plan has been able to determine the sos this par will be similar in nature to the above replacement par in that it will be cost effectiveness appraisal the difference will be that a2 approval allows change to the sos and therefore the appraisal will need to be more detailed in recognition of the increase in investment decision risk inherent in changing the standard of service change par seeking a3 approval an a3 project appraisal report is required for those projects where change to the sos is proposed but the flood risk problem is not considered to be complex or contentious and strategy plan is not required this par will need to consider the wider strategic implications updownstream effect s and longterm of the potential action in determining the preferred option many different standards of service will need to be appraised this par will be the most detailed as it will need to consider the strategic issues f upstreamdownstream effects and longterm financial sustainability of the proposed change t the standard of service in this way par is the route from gateway 0 to 1 sometimes via strategy plan and gateway 05 524 asset management plan amp asset management plans have been critical part of bestpractice asset management for at least decade for frm asset management plans are about to be introduced and will eventually be c ompleted for all systems amps would be completed first for those asset systems where w are incurring expenditure for the purposes of streamlining it is necessary the amps provide measurable agreed standard of service and contains details as to the expenditure required to sustain th is our minimum requirements for amps are as follows 1 problem description why we have an asset system in place 2 standard of service define in measurable way what the assets are designed to do and their minimum condition grade 26 3 current condition whether the assets are currently delivering the agreed sos 4 action plan what we plan to do in order to provide the defined standard of service 5 costs how much it is costing us over the life of the asset system and 6 benefits an indication of the benefits that are derived from the standard of service amps need to be short and to the point and the knowledge required for their production and upkeep retained inhouse amps are prerequisite for the streamlining process and are vital to the streamlined model for the following reasons collectively amps will provide important information as to the financial sustainability of the current frm asset portfolio and indicate the affordability of making additional acquisitions and enhancements b amps will provide an indication of those asset systems for which we need to undertake change to the sos via strategy andor par in order to possibly dispose of or handover assets c amps would provide forward look of which asset systems may require large injection of investment in order to continue providing the current standard of service so we can bett er plan for the required investment appraisals in locations where we may wish to either improve or reduce the standard of service and d as default mechanism and means for managing our assets for those locations where we would like to carry out an investment appraisal to change the sos but cannot afford to do s due to other higher potential and more urgent locations amp and scfmp would also be important filters in the process by which we intend to make the first sift of potential change candidates this process will be explained more fully in th next section 525 feedback and reviews each of the products discussed above would necessarily have an impact on each other the policy int ent within an scfmp should inform the boundaries of the strategy plans andor p ar scfmp would also inform the amp especially in locations where we would like to possibly i ncrease or decrease the current standard of service provided by the existing assets future reviews of scfmp would be ab to draw on information about the costs and benefits of the existing assets from the am ps and would also be better informed by strategy plans especially where these have been curtailed in these locations we need to manage flood risk using methods other than raised walls or embankments by increasi ng our efforts in reducing the consequence part of the risk equation similarly wherever strategy plan and par results in change to the standard of service clearly the amp needs to be revised to reflect th new standard of service scfmps would need to be reviewed on 510 year basis the development of full picture regarding the asset portfolio would take some tim with few iterations of amps required as we gather better information once these are more mature some parts f the amp would need to be updated annually to inform business plans and the allocation on less frequent basis 35 years we would need to review the agreed standard of service in light of changes in the source of flood risk as well as any changes in benefits there are also number of feedback loops that resu lt from projects progressing through the process which are discussed in the next section 27 53 the streamlined process in each section we have highlighted different stage of the process to explain how it would operate 531 control of the system the gateways as can be seen in the above diagram there are three key control points for all projects w ith an additional gateway 05 for strategy plans gateway 0 strategic review the selection of candidate projects to be given mandate for further investment appraisal and development only after candidate project receives mandate at gateway zero would appraisal expenditure be incurred this is also the point where for c hange projects the decision about whether strategy plan is required is made gateway 1 business justification technical approval of the preferred option gateway 1 w ould not be concerned with affordability programming or packaging of projects or the specific detail of how the preferred option would be achieved only whether the business case of the proposed solution is sufficiently robust in this manner gateway 1 would be check t ensure that the preferred option represents good value for money is technically feasible and the risks have been adequately identified and accounted for it is at gateway 1 that scheme of delegat ion approval is given gateway 3 investment decision contract award this is the point beyond which we would be delivering real reduction in flood risk where th contractor mobilises and delivers the specified frm asset subject to the appropriate stage boundaries and managing environmental health and safety and other project risks gateways 1 and 3 would be the same for both sustainreplacement and change projects gateway 0 would be different because the information we have to make the decision is diff erent and the result if project is rejected is different gateway 05 strategic direction in addition to the three main gateways for locations wh ere change to the sos would be complex or contentious and strategy plan is required which i s subject to review and approval a9 at gateway 05 28 532 identification of need the first stage of the process would be the identification of need the diagram above shows tha t the new model separates potential projects into two categories from the outset replacement candida tes and change candidates replacement candidates are those where benefits identified in amp can justify the longterm cost of the existi ng standard of service policy intent as stated in the cfmp is to continue the current standard of servic and there are proposals to raise or lower the current standard of service change candidates are those where amps demonstrate that costs and benefits do not justify the continuation of investm ent cfmp policy intent is to change the current standard of service increase or decrease and there are proposals to appraise potential alternative options where do the candidates originate candidate replacement projects would be planned for within amps under the heading of replacements where replacement has been identified as necessary within the next three years the nfcdd asset reference would be specified in addition an asset may deteriorate faster than predicted g due to an event and therefore require replacement sooner than planned candidate replacement project would be identified by its nfcdd reference and would be supported by information in the amp candidate change projects would come from number of sources cfmp identified locations where we have policy intent to reduce flood risk and that i s most likely to be achieved by improving the standard of service to reduce the probability of an event cfmp identified locations where we have policy intent to increase flood risk to an area previous strategic studies have identified locations where risk may be high or l ocations where the costs are high in relation to the benefits 29 amp identified locations where the benefits that can be attributed to an asset syste m are low in comparison with the longterm cost of providing the standard of service flood event indicates location where risk may be high local knowledge of the catchment has identified locations where risk may be hi gh local knowledge of the asset systems has identified assets where the costs are high in relation to the benefits and nafra or other highlevel analysis has identified locations where risk may be high candidate changeimprovement project would be submitted as simple gis shapefil of the location at risk this mechanism and how it works will be explained in more detail in sectio n 534 it is important to recognise that the streamlined model would not lock the env ironment agency into continuing the status quo there are undoubtedly many assets where the environment agency mu st consider reducing the current standar d of service the current system does not adequately select and prioritise the appraisal of potential disposal projects consequently decisions to reduce the level of service either arise reactively due to lack of funding or assets continue to attrac t revenue expenditure for maintenance work where the controls are much ss stringent the existing system therefore poses the risk that urgent or emergency works force poor longterm decision without proper consideration of the strategic context within the streamlined model the separation of replace ment and change candidates means that there is more transparency around the implications of deciding the replace existi ng assets and systematic method for dealing with all desired changes to the standard of service whether thi s is an increase or decrease in order to ensure that projects take the correct route and provide senior decisionmakers with visibility of the future investment need to sustain the agreed sos and demand to change the sos all candidate projects would be managed via single database replacement candidates will be referenced against their nfcdd reference and potential change candidates will be referenced via unique identifier relate d to its location in this way it will be possible to ensure that replacement cand idate is not also being considered as change candidate as well as predict and programme for future investment this is represented in the process as vertical line before gateway 0 533 replacement gateway 0 strategic review the first sift of potential replace ment projects at gateway zero replacement projects would be subject to three key challenges confirm that the benefits and wholelife costs in the amp demonstrate that t he agreed 30 standard of service is economically justified b confirm that the policy intent identified in the cfmp matches the proposed replacement c confirm there is demand for change to the standard of service in this locat ion candidate replacement projects that satisfy the above criteria would be given mandate to ta ke the simplified replacement route and conduct cost effectiveness appraisal as discusse d in pag3 the key difference from the change route is that the replacement route would not involve c onsidering alternative standards of service but rather the most cost effective way of delivering the agreed stan dard of service because of this the value of expenditure required for cost effectiveness appraisal f simplified replacement project is expected to be much less than that required for change projects projects not given mandate to take the simplified replacement route must therefore be considered as candidate change project where depending on the urgency of investment they may be more likely t be pulled forward as the subject of par or strategy plan replacement projects that take this route would then arrive at gateway 1 via relati vely short cost effectiveness par where the various options for delivering the standard of service spec ified in the amp are compared with with more robust cost estimate in order to avoid potential doublecoun ting of benefits and costs of mutually dependent system of assets the systemwide appraisal would be contained within the amp where the cost of staining the asset system to the agreed standard of service can be compared to the benefits attributable to the asset system 534 change gateway 0 strategic review the first sift of potential change projects because we cannot afford to fund the appraisal of an infinite number of potential change candidates filter would operate at gateway 0 to ensure we are selecting those which contribute most to ou tcome measure targets or are most urgent key feature of the proposed process is sharp initial decline from large number of pot ential candidate change projects before gateway 0 to much reduced number that are given mandate to be inve stigated further this initial cut is carried out on an impartial basis without external expendi ture on consultants and using objective analysis of national information such as nafra and other exist ing datasets the cost to make candidate visible for selection would need to be kept as low as possible and as simple as possible to keep the initial hurdle low for these savings to be realised 31 further reduction of these potential change projects that have been given mandate would occur durin g appraisal most significantly during the early stages as part of an initial desktop st udy of each change project with only the most promising continuing through to gateway 1 the followin g diagram illustrates the proposed attrition of candidate projects the diagram below illustrates the proposed filtering of change projects at gateway ze ro the proposed filter for change projects would operate on the basis of cfmp policy intent this identifies the fit with established policy which has been agreed with rfdcs urgency of intervention the urgency of the investment for existing asset systems where change is proposed this information would be provided in the amp for all candidate loc ations information would refer to whether there had been an event any political strategic imperati ves eg commitments previously made that the environment agency must honour and other relevant information this would be contained within the submission made alongside sh apefile of the location contribution to outcome measures shapefile for each location where project is proposed 32 would be used to query against nafra and other datasets to provide an indicative scale of the risk in within that location this would enable the environment agency to identify the relative priority of the various candidate project locations for which there is demand for chang to the current standard of service the following data provides an example of how this would work in practice using theoretical shapefile against the existing nafra dataset the picture on the left shows an area of wraysbury with the nafra risk bands and properties overlaid the shapefile is the black polygon in the centre for which we can determine the following information risk band area m2 properties low 138967 69 moderate 41945 21 significant 954576 13 result 60 135 additional national datasets eg flood vulnerability mapping provide another level of information to be collated on the types of properties eg care homes schools infrastructure eg electricity substations telephone exchanges and other factors such as social deprivation scores whilst there would inevi tably be inaccuracies with this information it gives us sufficient indicat ion of the scale of flood risk in given location and therefore the scale of potential benefits in simple objecti ve and easily comparable terms analysis of potential change candidates and subsequent prioritisation using this in formation would be undertaken centrally prioritised list would then be shared with regions and rfdcs who would make suggestions regarding the reordering based on greater knowledge of the locations and taking account of other issues not considered in the analysis for example due to other regional developmen t pressures political sensitivity etc following this consultation about the relativ priority of the change candidates candidates on the approved list are then given g0 mandate to begin an investment appraisal either strategy plan where changing the sos would be complex or contentious or an a3 par where th change is more simple candidate replacement projects that are not selected for investment appraisal in any gle year may be selected in the future however in the meantime for locations where there is an existing asset there needs to be feedback loop to ensure that the necessary maintenance is carried out to c ontinue providing the agreed standard of service candidates that are rejected on the basis of an incompat ibility with the cfmp policy intent are unlikely to be considered again until such time as t he cfmp is reviewed candidates that are rejected on the basis of low contribution to the outcome measures c an remain in the funnel for consideration in future years when funding for investment appraisal of change ca ndidates may be increased given that the analysis of candidate shapefiles is relativ ely simple lowcost analysis and that future improvements to nafra and other datasets would continue to improve the accuracy of the analysis there is reason why these lowerpriority candidates cannot remain in the funnel in addition this would provide an indication to defra and hm treasury of ongoing mand for reducing the probability of flooding it is important to note that the rationing part of gateway zero would only be applied t fdgia funded appraisals where flood defence committee wishes to spend local levy or other externa l contribution on appraising project this rationing is not necessary project funded by means other than fdg ia must still follow the same process and the resulting project will be cons idered alongside other potential projects when making the allocation beyond gateway one 33 535 g0 g05 strategy plan process as described previously strategy plan is the mechanism by which we assess t he strategic direction for locations where changing the sos is complex or contentious the decision about whet her strategy plan is required will be taken at gateway 0 strategy plan would start only after receiving mandate to undertake an investmen t appraisal after the filtering of potential candidates at gateway 0 the initial stage of s trategy plan would be to investigate the problem in greater detail based on existing information and longlist of potential solutions with rough estimates of cost if at this stage the cost is prohibitive or the scal of benefits in relation to the cost is lower than that expected in order to attract funding then decision to curtail the strategy plan would be made the project sponsor would confirm the curtailment and the decision recorded to prevent revisiting or repackaging the problem if the initial business case proves sufficient second iteration would foll ow depending on the project it may be at this point where the consultation process is started either just internally or if necessary externally the strategy plan would take the appropriate approach given th risks and t he potential benefits it would be constrained though by ensuring that the cost of the strategy pl an does not get out of balance with the potential benefits in terms of reduced flood risk further iteration in the strategy plan process would be where there is shortlist of few potential options for solving the problem and we then need to investigate in greater depth both the po tential side effects as well as the cost it is with this shortlist that we would perform t he full economic appraisal in order to determine the optimum solution to be taken forward as the preferred option if change to the current standard of service can be justified then a9 approval of the strategy plan would be given after review at gateway 05 at all points in the process before and after gateway 0 neas wo uld have visibility of project progress and would review the locations and advise likely requirements to satisfy envi ronmental legislation as well as provide input as to potential opportunities for environmental improvements strategy plan ends at gateway 05 with a9 approval of the longterm strategi c direction strategy plan would not include approval of expenditure required for implementing the strategy plan change projects t hat are suggested by strategy plan are required to have project appraisal report and gain a2 approval of the proposed expenditure at gateway 1 packaging similar work across areas that arent hydraulically connected this is done post gat eway 1 when we do project planning of those projects that we have chosen to fund otherwise we risk 34 packaging higher value for money projects with lower value for money projects and sacrific ing other high priority projects as result detailed design whilst outline design may be necessary to develop the strat egy plan in order to assess the likely cost of options this should not be developed any further than nec essary to reach decision about the preferred strategic option since optimism bias or other cost adjustme nt to take account of the unknowns is applied to the cost part of the benefit cost ratio unnecessary det ail within the strategy plan is premature as is the case now a9 approval at gateway 05 of the strategic option would not mean that we are necessarily going to fund the works identified in the strategy plan after gateway 05 potential projects would be compared at gateway 0 and funding allocated to projects that deliver the greatest overal l contribution to the outcome measures and are deemed high priority in particular year in li ne with available funding if all remaining options for making change to the current standard of service are ruled out the strategy plan should be curtailed in this case other means for managing increasing f lood risk will be used aimed at reducing the consequences of flooding rather than reducing the probability the type of actions available includes flood warning incident management landuse planning and development c ontrol risk to be managed in future is excess expenditure investigating or developin g strategy plans where the result is either donothing or low priority projects the risk of these strategy plan s not being curtailed early enough due to political and local pressure would remain however there are number of key features that would be put in place to control expenditure on strategy plans more visibility of expenditure on strategy plans highlighting where relatively hi gh costs have occurred national central budget holder for all appraisal activity incentivised to minimis nugatory development spend and maximise outputs to inputs one project budget holder aware of the tradeoff between increased detail and increased costs nationally based appraisal teams able to take more balanced objective view and clearer accountabilities allowing performance management of individual project managers most importantly the scale of benefits that are likely to result would guide expenditure on strategy plan for example as guide the production of strategy plan should cost more than 2000 per benefiting property individual candidates that come out of strategy are separated into change and sustain candida tes and subject to national assessment at the respective gateway zero for each of these where for reasons of better procurement package includes both sustain and change candidates these would be considered together as single change candidate project 35 536 g0 g1 project appraisal report par for change projects there are two types of par for change projects depending on whether strategy plan has been completed and approved a9 change projects that do not require strategy will be seeking a3 approval at gateway 1 change projects supported by strategy will be seeking a2 approval at gateway 1 the process for each of these is fundamentally different there are essentially three different types of par depending on the route taken but all begi n at gateway 0 and all finish at gateway 1 one of these is specifically for projects that s eeks to sustain the current standard of service whilst the other two relate to potential changes to the curren t standard of service and are alternatives depending on whether strategy plan is required or not change par seeking a2 approval an a2 project appraisal report is required for those projects where change to the sos has b een determined within strategy plan that has been given a9 approval typically the st rategy plan will have determined the standard of service of the system eg the line len gth and height but not the specific treatment or means for providing the new standard of service eg whether the increase in hei ght will be achieved with new earth embankment or cantilevered steel sheetpile wall the par then assesses the various options available to deliver the strategy defined standard of service choosing the most cost effective method that still satisfies the requirements set out in th strategy in this way the a2 change par is similar in nature to the replacement par the difference will be that a2 approv will result in approval of change to the sos and therefore may need to be more detailed in recognition of t he increase in investment decision risk inherent in changing the standard of service change par seeking a3 approval an a3 project appraisal report is required for those projects where change to the sos is proposed but the flood risk problem is not considered to be complex or contentious and strategy plan is not required this par will need to consider the wider strategic implications updownstream effect s and longterm in determining the preferred option many different standards of service will need to be appraised this p ar will be the most detailed as it will need to consider the strategic issues of upstreamdow nstream effects and longterm financial sustainability of the proposed change to the standard of service for both of these pars there will be cases where the business case for making the change to the standard of service is challenged by new information and as for strategy plans expenditure on project appraisal reports would be guided by the sca of benefits that are likely to result eg rule of thumb might be it should cost more than 2000 per benefiting property for an a3 par and significantly less than this for an par tha t is supported by strategy plan 36 537 gateway 1 business justification technical approval of the preferred option at gateway 1 the completed project appraisal report is subject to technic qa and either recommended for technical approval or not nrg and pabs would continue to provide an independent check on the business case and highlight risks to the project executive the pr oject executive in consultation with the relevant sod officer can then decide whether the costs of reducing t hose risks merits further investigation or whether the risk can be managed during delivery and therefore not investigat ed further at this stage together with replacement projects change projects that are selected for delivery undergo project planning packaging detailed design and procurement before making final investmen t decision at gateway 3 538 programming and allocation for gateway 1 to gateway 3 after receiving technical approval at gateway one all projects with technical ap proval of the option choice are compared and prioritised taking into account both urgency and relative contributi on to outcome measures in this way projects are again pulled forward for project planning packaging tailed design and procurement there is need at this point to prioritise effectively between looki ng after existing assets that reduce flood risk and making efforts to further reduce flood risk by changing the standard of service the allocation of funding at this point is only for the cost of gateway 1 to gateway 3 although it is unlikely at this stage to see much attrition of projects but to comply with ogc procedures t here must be final decision point at gateway 3 before project can progress this final gateway also g ives decisionmakers an opportunity to check that the project is still on track and within the toleranc of the business case presented at gateway 1 as discussed later the allocation is calendar event that occurs at single tim each year the programming and allocation decisions need to take longerterm view rather than just singl point process view taking into account the whole frm sset portfolio the forward programme as well as the next 12 months 539 project delivery and gateway 3 investment decision contract award there are proposed changes to these stages of the process and so both replacement and change projects would proceed through gateway 3 and on to project in the same way as they do under the current system 37 54 the streamlined allocation method there are three distinct management activities relating to expenditure on frm assets allocation of funding programme management and portfolio management allocation is the process of prioritisation and rationing the shortterm 12 mo nths funding available across many competing opportunities this has typically involved regio nal bidding for funding according to need alongside allocation to capital projects with sufficiently high priority score programme management is the shortmedium term 1 5 years decisions pipeline management previously this has been regional responsibility but has benefited from greater central scrutiny and challenge the key part of the overall programme that would benefit from increased central responsibility are for expenditure on projects that seek to change the c urrent standard of service from the initial proposal through to the delivery and handover of the delivered asset improvement and portfolio management is the mediumlong term 5 50 years drive to minimise the cost of providing an agreed standard of service alongside decisionmaking about where we should be developing projects to change the standard of service this evaluates the financial sustainability of the asset portfolio and an assessment of the relative priority between b uilding new and improving assets alongside investment to reduce the consequences of flooding because of the annual allocation cycle the allocation of funding to specif ic projects is an event that currently occurs at particular point in time rather than function of the process it self it also occurs at number of key points in the process rather than single point as such allocatio n is an overlay to the process of an individual project and considers the pipeline of projects the pipeline from change programme perspective refers to the number of projects within various stages in their develo pment and delivery cycle and the projected costs of their completion the diagram below illustrates how streamlining would group the allocation of fun ding and expenditure according to the different investment requirements of the sustain and change programm the annual allocation becomes more highlevel process where funding is separated into different groups depending on the outcome within frm there are two parts to flood risk probability and impactconsequences activities that reduce the consequences of flooding flood warning flood forecasting incident management etc would form one group and activities that reduce the probability of flooding asset maintenance replacement improvements new assets would form another within this second group that are focused on reducing the probability there 38 are two main groups asset sustain programme activities and investment in assets to sustain their agreed standard of service this includes the wholelife cost and activities such as mai ntenance repair refurbishment and eventually replacement of an asset the cost of the asset sustain programme can be considered the true need since these are assets for which the environment agency typically is responsible for or at least has some duty of care responsibilities asset change programme activities and investment in projects to change the agre ed standard of service of existing assets as well as constructing new assets this would include all project development activities as well as the project delivery since each of the change projects represents an opportunity the cost of the asset change programme can be considered demand programme management over the shortmedium term 1 5 years of each of the above asset sustain and asset change programmes have different objectives the asset sustain programme is focussed on reducing the risk of failure by delivering the agreed standard of service which includes minimum condition grade whilst reducing the wholelife cost of the asset base challenge to the cost base for the as set sustain programme is achieved by comparison of asset system benefits and costs with the highcost lowbenefit asset systems being subject to greater scrutiny nd possible reduction in the minimum condition grade or asset disposal due to the variability and geographical spread of the asset base the responsibility for the asset sustai n programme is likely to remain within the region with key role for the regional asset investment planning teams in reducing the volatility of the forward in vestment profile during implementation both the regional and area frm teams will require significant guidance from head office asset management to help embed the new approach the asset change programme is focussed on delivering the improvement targets in terms of reducing the probability of flooding in locations where that represents the best value for money in addition it is important to manage the pipeline of asset change projects to ensure that future delivery is in line with likely funding levels the current approach has overproduced in this area and needs to be carefully managed down the role of ncpms straddles these two programmes and they will need to respond to the needs of each programme and consider operational efficiencies in supporting the business asset portfolio management over the mediumlong term 5 50 years will be focussed on determining what shape and size the asset portfolio needs to be in order to deliver the government strategy for managing flood risk in england and wales should we be growing the asset portfolio should we be focussed on urban or rural areas where are the opportunities for attracting additional funding is the focus on probability reducing assets too great or too little and other more strategic questions about the frm asset portfolio at the most simple though we need to continually evaluate the financial sustainability of the asset portfol io make an assessment of the relative priority between building new and improving assets alongs ide investment to reduce the consequences of flooding the streamlined system provides greater flexibility in managing the programme both in year and over the longer term funding allocated to the change programme can be managed across the different st ages of change projects in more flexible way pulling forward additional change projects at gateway 0 for investment appraisal as funding originally allocated to contingency is made availa ble likewise funding allocated to regions sustain programme can be managed in more optimal way to deliver the agreed standard of service for the least cost by taking wholelife cost approach the balance of the proportion spent on sustain and change would be dependent on the financial sustainability of the portfolio as whole if future funding allows we may b in position to afford wide ranging enhancements and new acquisitions if future funding is less generous we may need to pri oritise 39 more asset disposal and simple replacements alongside select few enhancements in order to further reduce flood risk in the most beneficial locations in sustainable manner the change programme needs to be compiled with longterm view based on good understanding of the longterm costs of the existing portfolio alongside projected funding levels with an eye on nearterm funding realities the allocation to investment appraisal needs to be flexible to s uit the budget in any one year both in ramping up and ramping down activities it is much easier to stal l or go slowly with an appraisal than it is to stall the delivery phase where contractual obligations have bee n entered into the sustain programme needs to be managed with an equally longterm view based on providing the agreed standard of service for the least wholelife cost as transition amps wou ld need to be informed by likely funding levels the result would be combination of smoothing inve stment profiles delaying some investment as well as the reality that some asset systems would be underfunded where this is the case percentage of assets within some systems are likely to be below the agreed minimum condition grade in deciding which asset systems to fund we can use the benefits identified in amps to identify higher priority asset systems in some cases this would prompt review of the minimum cond ition grade defined in the sos so that it is more affordable and sustainable in the longterm together these two parts of the streamlined approach show how the environment agency can m ake more considered decisions about how to invest the total frm budget in relation to its assets alongside this we need to also consider the relative benefits of consequence reducing investments ch as flood warning land use planning flood awareness campaigns development control and other facets 40 55 streamlined roles and responsibilities the section below sets out the proposed changes to the arrangements for managing the frm programme within the streamlining model this is not an exhaustive list of l groups involved in projects or the full job description of the various teams but we have detailed some of t he changes to the key roles involved in managing expenditure on frm assets in summary streamlining results in some centralisation some decentralis ation and some simplification of roles and responsibilities these changes have been limited only to those necessary to deliv er streamlining and do not optimise the frm structure where to do so would alter signific antly the overall environment agency structure key change is that responsibility and budget for all appraisal activity would be centrali sed at present the development phase is concluded with strong central control at gateway 1 the proposed structure retains this but in addition brings this control earlier in order to limit development costs and ensure all projects under development are aligned with national priorities area input would remain i mportant in identification of potential change candidates as well as ongoing consultation throughout th project lifecycle once projects are given mandate at gw0 budget and responsibility is held by ncpms again wit h strong area input but with the double client area plus ncpms being eliminated development activity resulting in the construction of an asset would require ongoing maintenance responsibility for the maintenance and operation of the asset would continue to res t with the area as is currently the case for capital maintenance and replacement projects which maintain the agreed standard of serv ice responsibility and budget would be wholly with the area the appraisal of the agreed standard of s ervice would be contained within asset management plans option appraisal would be required for replacement projects technical appraisal would be dertaken where alternative technical solutions are feasible the scheme of delegation requires capital projects over 2m to be approved by the national review group this would continue for projects of this scale ncpms would be internally com missioned to undertake the project and to appraise alternative technical solutions where necessary the vital responsibility for all other aspects of frm flood incident management devel opment control landuse planning and public awareness campaigns would remain as now group current role changes frm directors sub group dsg and board frm finance committee

work instruction guidance and templates in accordance with specification provide assistance to local teams in the interpretation of guidance provide assistance to local teams in the interpretation of guidance audit the production of amps to ensure they are fit for purpose monitor regional delivery of asset management outcome measures the above roles concentrate on how the programme and asset portfolio is managed there are number of options for the governance arrangements for individual projects the prince2 definiti on of these roles and how our current approach differs is outlined below project role current role ogc definition project sponsor partially covered with the business sponsor role senior manager who provides the mandate and authority for the project project executive line manager of the project manager holds the budget and is directly responsible for the delivery of the project to time cost and quality not necessarily the line manager of the project manager senior user somewhat similar to the current business sponsor role represents the enduser on the project board ensuring that the products are fit for purpose senior supplier not formally represented but responsibilities are usually handled by either the consultant project manager or the client manager represents the supplier consultant or contractor on the project board ensuring that the project plan is deliverable to cost and time 43 project manager typically duplicated with ncpms as the contract manager and the area client acting as quality manager responsibility for budget is shared consultant will typically appoint project manager as single point of contact for their involvement tasked with managing quality risk and budget of the project responsible for the daytoday management of the project within clear tolerances set by the project executive and the project board receives adhoc direction from the project executive but not necessarily line managed by them there are number of options to consider including the best location for each of t he project sponsor executive and manager roles as well as the senior user and senior supplier roles where necessary the various options will be considered in the first stage of implementation 56 streamlining model key benefits the benefits of the operating model can be split into qualitative benefits providing greater control and visibility of expenditure providing coherent framework for new frm products and enabling the environment agency to live within its means with an as set management perspective financial benefits ie reducing development costs 561 qualitative benefits providing greater control and visibility of expenditure the recent request from the nao for expenditure on capital projects broken down by stage demonstra tes that the current operating systems are not sufficient to provide management information in particular there is agreed baseline from which the defra target can be measured alongside this our fieldwork demonstrated lack of programme level financial i nformation particularly reconciling actu expenditure against budgeted there was also information about expenditure per asset system so judgements could not be made about the effectiveness of the maintenance regime or i ts contribution to reduced wholelife cost the new operating model provides much clearer set of project and programme accountabilities for the change and asset management regimes it also identifies the key requirements f or management information system allowing the collection and management of financial informati on key benefits arising from the enhanced management in formation system would include the ability to track expenditure at any stage on any project and on any location manage budgets and asset systems by gaining more detailed understanding of the cost profile associated with the existing portfolio record clearly the expenditure on delivery and development and provide detailed information to third parties such as the national audit office tracking of expenditure against risk by linking gis systems to expenditure systems and build up knowledge of the costs of appraisal and delivery of different asset systems 44 providing clearer framework for frm products there are two main products wh ich will be live from 2007 catchment flood management plans cfmps and asset management plans amps the current approach does not currently relate to either of these products in particular there are differi ng opinions about the boundaries between cmfps and strategies as well as between strategies and amps the model provides clear framework within which these products operate the clear benef it is that the model uses the investment channelled into these products to support decisionmaking fo r example using cfmps as an additional filter in composing the change programme and using amps as means to provide visibility of expenditure by asset system and manage their whole life costs enabling the environment agency to live within its means within the new model amps would provide informatio n on the whole life cost of existing asset systems they would also provide forward analysis of when asset systems require large injection of investment in order to continue providing the current standard of service collectively amps would provide important information as to the financial tainability of the current frm asset portfolio and indicate the affordability issues associated with m aking additional acquisitions and enhancements 562 financial benefits reducing development costs the key benefit of the new operating model is that it should reduce the level of expendit ure on development activity the key financial benefits arise from replacement projects implementing streamlined process for replacement projects which means that they only require technical options analysis and change projects filtering potential candidates earlier using nationally available data so that fewer projects undergo appraisal and streamlining the appraisal process so that it is all undertaken by ncpms key point is to note is that most of the anticipated expenditure saving s are through reduced third party expenditure as environment agency staff typically commission rather than perf orm most appraisal activity reducing development costs replacement projects the use of cfmp and amp products together with other potential central controls all ows comfort that those projects meeting the criteria to avoid option appraisal do not present undue risk of making poor investment decisions projects where there is policy intent to change the current s tandard of service community demand for change increased risk or low costbenefit would not meet thi s criteria the reduced development cost would be expenditure on appraisal currently spend on projects that would go through the new process in future the scale of costs saved is an unknown as the current system does not distinguish between different types of capital replacement activity and distorts demand for improvements through using one process to assess both types of projec t 45 ie as full appraisals are required teams carry out the investigative work to review options however since development cost has been shown to be 30 of projectrelated expenditure relativel few projects would need to go through this route to have significant impact reducing development costs change projects significant driver of expenditure is the number of potential projects put forward this is not constrained or controlled centrally the volume of expenditure incurred and number of projects initi ated is not known together with local pressure on the area officers and arbitrary cuto ff of the priority score system there is implicit encouragement to push each project as far as it will go the model solution is to introduce an early attrition of demand for improvemen ts based on national datasets this allows the composition of the programme based on objective national c riteria followed by regional consultation and input from rfdcs this effectively allows head office to llocate central team set budget to spend on appraisal as this appraisal is centrally managed there is greater opportunity to control costs and manage change projects as programme this means products such as prefeasibility and viability are longer required 57 financial benefits the following is an analysis of indicative potential cash releasing savings that we estimate to come from implementing the streamlined model it is important to note that there is an i nherent lack of information available centrally about baseline expenditure on the different stages of project development and delivery within the capital programme for example area expenditure on capital projects is only visible centrally on an overall basis and ncpms expenditure can be identified at project level but it is not possi ble to identify expenditure on stage by stage basis eg viability appraisal delivery directors have therefore accepted that these savings are indicative only and should not form the basis of target regime until such time as improvements to the management informati on system facilitate the devel opment of more robust estimates the potential savings for some parts of the streamlined model are entirely dependent on th extent to which the environment agency wishes to leverage certain capabilities of the model and as such is difficult to predict in advance much like the top speed of car is dependent on road and weather conditions as well as the drivers ability and willingness to take calculated risks key point is to note is that most of the expenditure savings are through reduced thi rd party spend as environment agency staff typically commission rather than perform most appraisal activity potential financial savings the table below sets out the estimated savings based on 200m total expenditure on frm projec ts that are potentially achievable by pursuing the streamline exis ting system option key streamlining activity low estimate best estimate high estimate remove pregateway 0 studies prefeasibility inception reports etc 25m

82m 111m the 82m represents 41 reduction in the cost of project development the detai led assumptions underpinning these savings are set out in appendix 5 58 operating risks associated with the preferred option it is important to recognise that there are num ber of risks associated with the operation of the new 46 model which will need to be managed in particular the new model recognises that the environment agency cannot afford to apprais all potential change candidates however we will need to accept that the trade off associated wi th reducing the number of projects which undergo appraisal is that in some cases there may be less opti mal decisions made for example in the new model there may be instances where an existing as set is not considered priority to undergo appraisal ie undergo an assessment of whether the level of protection should change in this case the asset may end up being replaced to the same standard of protection whereas if an appraisal had been undertaken there is possibility that it could have concluded that higher cost benefit ratio could be achieved by improving or reducing the level of protection the replacement route would represent significantly simplified version of the change route there is risk that projects which should be change candidates take the replacement route in ord er to increase the speed of delivery and reduce the level of input required this is mitigated be series of controls and checks on this route these include the fit with cfmp pol icy objective the costs and benefits contained in the amp which is centrally reviewed for any proposed replacement activit and the potential to identify nationally or at local level potential locations as c andidates change projects and there is risk that amps and cfmps are not of sufficient quality to provide t he planned controls of potential replacement and change candidates in reliable and robust manner recent review of cmfps has highlighted quality and consistency issues equally amps do not yet exist th is means the specification and production of the two products is key dependency within the implementa tion with the requirement for the incoming products to meet the specification to th required quality this is defined workstream in the implementation the table below sets out the some of the key risks associated with impl ementing the preferred model and proposed mitigating actions to address the risks ref risk impact probability overall action mitigation 1 not making optimum decisions means losing high cost benefit projects medium high high tolerate the new perspective involves accepting that we cannot afford to ensure we have made the optimum decisions in all locations merely that we can prioritise where we do so 2 asset

is not attributable to the model which would still operate just with fewer appraisals 3 the focus on existing commitments will lose bargaining power with defra medium medium medium treat nafra can be

change and this would require strong communications work 47 6 implementation this section considers the delivery issues associated with implementing t he preferred solution and is broken down into the following sections managing the implementation of streamlining implementation cost estimate benefits realisation and implementation risks 61 managing the implementation of streamlining directors have noted consistently through the design of the new operating model that although major organisational change is not prescribed implementation would require significant effort and c ommitment the main changes are associated with removing current redundant investment appraisal products prefeasibility and viability specifying and influencing the delivery of new investmentdecision products introducing and embedding the new process for projects and decision making changing roles and responsibilities to support the above changes and changing the management informatio n system to support the above changes 611 outline programme plan the streamlining programme will affect three key areas where changes are required each of whic h will be managed as an individual workstream process and products controls and tools and roles and responsibilities these three workstreams will together deliver the overall change required and the relationships between each will need to be managed during implementation the streamlining programme has three ma in stages stage 1 building and testing stage 2 transition and operating and stage 3 embedding and review 48 key workstreams 60 606020 stage 1

programme board consisting of senior managers who would meet regularly to review the progress of the implementation of streamlining and provide guidance on issues that are raised programme sponsor provides the mandate for the work and would typically be director for this the programme board would be accountable to the programme sponsor for ensuring the delivery to time cost and quality the programme board would consist of programme executive chairs the programme board and carries overall responsibility to the programme sponsor for achieving the objectives and the benefits also provides adhoc direction to the programme manager senior user representative of the endus er who will need to oper ate the streamlined system and is most concerned with quality of the deliverable that it is to the agreed specification this should be senior person within the operations team and senior supplier representative of the resources implementing the change req uired this role is to ensure that the programme is deliverable in terms of cost and time and that the quality specified is achievable 52 detailed stage plan would be completed for each stage before starting at the end of each stage the board would then review progress on the previous phase and approve the plan for the subsequent phase this approach allows management of potential overruns and risk mitigation and recognises that realistic detailed planning can only be completed for short advanc period the programme board agree the overall programme plan submitted as part of the business case at the project initiation they then receive stage plans for each subsequent phase of the programme the programme manager is responsible for delivering the stage plans the board agree with the programme manager the arrangements for range of project functions including reporting exceptions this is where toler ances agreed before each stage have been breached risk and issue logging this is the capture of risks and issues which ne ed to be highlighted to the project board and progress and updates this is the recording of activity and progress against the projec t plan 62 implementation cost estimate there are three key components of cost in the implementation of streamlining 1 the cost of making the necessary changes to improve management information reporting an d programme and project management tools 2 the cost of managing of the implementation and 3 the cost of training to operate the new approach in addition there are costs associated with operat ing the new streamlined system predominantly this involves the operation of the gateways and developing cfmp and amps to cover all asset systems t his has not been quantified as this cost is not dependent on streamlining and will be incurred any way any additional resource required to operate the gatewa ys will be covered by redeployment of existing resources in terms of the cost of training to operate the new approach we have allowed fo r some work in developing the training modules as part of the roles and responsibilities workstream we hav assumed that the cost of training staff is accounted for elsewhere in the environment gencys spending programme since both asset management and project management is effectively core function of providing flood risk management service 621 improving management information and project management tools major contributor to the cost of implementing streamlining is the necessary review of it tools in both providing management information as well as the collection and input of that informat ion via project management software suite key requirement of future system is integration of the project management tools with oracle financials so that we have single source of data and can m easure expenditure at each stage in the pr oject lifecycle and have greater confidence in the proportion of expenditure spent on project development this will involve work investigating both our management informatio n requirements and the project management tools necessary to both provide this information as well as assist in the management of project expenditure following gap analysis from our current position we can then speci fy the changes required and the timeframes and costs of making these changes from an initial scoping of this work we expect this to cost in the order of 700k more accurate figure for the it part of the implementation will need to be determined during the first st age when the specification is produced 53 622 managing the implementation of streamlining we have assumed that the following roles are required to deliver the implementation plan 1 x project sponsor receives updates from the executive and may give occas ional input 1 x streamlining programme executive to chair the above board and provide adhoc guidance to the project manager it is estimated that this role would require approximately 05 days per week of input 1 x senior user to represent the enduser of streamlining as discussed above it is est imated that this role would require approximately 1 day per month of input 1 x senior supplier to represent the supplier of implementation resource th is person would also support the programme manager in delivering the implementation this role is li kely to require 3 4 days per week of input the above three roles form the streamlining programme board to guide the implementation and provide quality assurance to the sponsor 1 x streamlining programme manager to manage the daytoday plans and activities required t implement the streamlining model including managing the links between each workstream nd any external workstream required to achieve the streamlining objectives 3 x streamlining workstream leads to manage individual packages of work in the programm these roles are likely to be fulltime and may require more than one person at tim alongside each of the workstream leads is group of key stakeholders who will provide input and support the delivery of the changes required these stakeholder groups will vary in size 1 4 people and are likely to need to provide at least 05 days per week process and products this workstream lead would take responsibility for designing and testing the new processes developing the product specifications developing guidance and reviewing the operation of the new processes and products process and products skills required are problem solving abilities strong analytical skills good project management skills significant experience of delivering process reengineering and efficiency experience of implementing inline qa and data quality reviewsaudits prince 2 practitioner who understands the ogc gateway reviews controls and tools this workstream lead would take responsibility for the developing the it solution and implementing and reviewing th controls in the new system eg product acceptance criteria governance approvals process gateways and measuring the benefits controls and tools skills

arcgis and linking these to relational databases it specification experience gap analysis spec writing knowledge of bestpractice data management knowledge of industry standard ppm tools and 54 extensive experience implementing it projects with the above components roles and responsibilities this workstream lead would be responsible for the people related aspects of the implementation including communication s training and skills and capabilities assessment streamlining is transformation programme which requires completely new behaviours in order to realise the efficiencies required these behaviours need to be trained and embedded as new way of thinking that would require extensive communication and learning of new skills and ways of working roles and responsibiliti skills required are extensive experience in delivering cultural change projects prince2 practitioner excellent persuasive and communication skills conflict resolution and negotiation skills some understanding of employment law and experience of managing industrial relations and union consultation 3 x workstream support for each of the workstream leads it is estimated that the three workstream support roles would be on full time basis and will need to complement the sk ills of each workstream lead in addition the implementation programme would require support and inputs from various part s of the business where there are key dependencies that streamlining relies on but for which it is not di rectly accountable for the cost of this is not accounted for as it is assumed to be part f the existing job description in terms of managing the implementation of streamlining we are proposing hybrid approac h with resource and expertise provided inhouse where possible and supplemented with the experience an d expertise of implementing major change projects from external suppliers the environm ent agency needs to decide whether it has sufficient inhouse capabilities and availability to devo to implementation and where it might require additional support both th speed of implementation and the approach taken will have large bearing on the cost of managing the implementation we have developed indicative resource costs for the approach outlined above managing the implementation estimated cost k environment agency input 8 ftes 35k each 280 estimated external support 380 total 660 we have assumed that the environment agency would undertake most of the key roles t out above to provide this resource internally we have estimated cost of 35k per fte for the 8 x ftes required we have allowed for some external support that is likely to be required for specific specia list input such as oracle specialists and process reengineering expertise equivalent to 15 x fte over the f irst 18 months of implementation in practice this is likely to relate to input from more than one individual the estimate also includes an allowance for partner director quality assurance and review time to oversee the consultant input 55 623 summary of costs it improved programme and project management tools 700k internal costs 280k external costs 380k contingency 450k total 1810k depending on the implementation approach the total figure for implementing stream lining over an 18 24 month timeframe is 18m based on the assumptions above to reflect the relatively high risk in term s of implementation the estimate of costs includes contingency of 450k the f igures presented do not include vat it is anticipated that implementation would result in 21 reduction in the cost of project development in the following financial year with the full 41 realised in the s econd year after implementation for total frm project expenditure of 200m this amounts to 41m in year 1 and 82m in year two n this basis the payback period is therefore less than 12 months after the start of implementation 63 measuring the benefits the nao defra and the ea itself require acceptance of baseline in order to meaningfull assess performance in reducing the proportion of development expenditure the baseline methodology outlined in appendix 4 provides repeatable means of measuring the annual proportion of development expenditure in the future in addition proposed improvements in the accuracy of m anagement information will facilitate greater understanding of the cost structure the following metrics will provide means for tracking performance of which only the first metric is currently possible 1 project development vs project delivery annual expenditure as proportion of the tot frm project spend the methodology in appendix 4 provides means to determine this using existing da ta 2 project development vs project delivery by individual project location th is metric is not currently collected due to the lack of unique identifier for each location it is so difficult to attribute the cost of scfmp strategy plans and pregateway 0 studies but with unique identifier based on location eg shapefiles we can more effectively measure the cost of project development by location 3 project development vs project delivery by project type for projects for whi ch the objective is to sustain the current sos and change projects which require robust strategic impacts assess ments it may also be possibly to differentiate between tidal fluvial and coastal proj ects or even between asset types walls embankments pumping stations etc 4 project development vs project delivery by programme in order to take int account the long timeframes 3 5 years over which project is developed and delivered this will require mix of historic spend information and forward projecti ons predominantly forward projection of the predicted programme may be required in order to account for growing or shrinking total project spend although this is likely to be indicative at best we have included benefits realisation plan in appendix 5 this sets out the benefits that t he project aims to achieve explains how they would be realised and assigns target delivery date and stakehol der to take responsibility for delivering each benefit as described in the previous section we have also identified those parts of the baseline where we expect to see the effects of streamlining as it is implemented and embedded appendix 4 gives details of the areas where savings would result 64 risk assessment whilst there are considerable uncertainties in terms of costs and si gnificant risks that need to be managed during implementation there are also cons iderable risks associated wi th the maintaining the 56 status quo the risks identified with implementation are detailed belo w should be cons idered alongside the identified operating risks in section 58 risks associated with the status quo have been detailed in section 421 the lack of management information and visibility about expenditure couple d with our fieldwork demonstrating lack of consistency in the process projects follow mean that there i s high amount of risk in the proposals identified the current deliverydevelopment expenditure breakdown is based upon estimates and assumptions although similar proportions apply to the neeca vs ncf breakdown the lack of information about the composition of the current programme in term s of types of projects the cost of appraisal and the number of projects taken forward at each stage makes comparing the current with the new very difficult and the incoming products cfmps and amps are not yet clearly defined and operational whilst these risks are not insignificant they are risks that are inherent to the status quo as much as in the streamlined model there are other ri sks of not addressing the lack of clarity or hierarchy of the incoming products beyond the proposed model in this respect in order to make streamlining work we h ave had to improve other parts of the system that required fixing anyway the clari ty brought by having clear sense of purpose and direction for eac h of the products in the system has benefits beyond the scope of streamlining alone 57 641 risks associated with implementing the streamlined model the table below sets out the key risks associated wi

met regularly with core group of directors and senior management at key stages david king director of water management paul leinster director of operations nigel reader director of finance david jordan deputy director of operations david rooke head of flood risk management john parker head of frm investment funding miles jordan head of ncpms the key meetings with the steering group march 2006 acceptance of the diagnosis after presenting summary of the diagnosis work carried out the directors asked the project team to develop an action plan to address the identi fied sources of waste but also to consider more fundamental change to address the root causes including alternative organisational designs for more efficient delivery of frm june 2006 initial solution options directors were presented with nine individual actions to reduce the cost of project development as well as three broad organisational design options directors accepted all nine actions but decided that the three structural models should not be pursued due t the recent ifrm changes instead the directors asked the team to develop the nine acti ons into holistic solution that delivered the benefits of the hybrid model but without involving major organisational change november 2006 initial reactions to holistic solution once sufficient detail of the holistic solution had been developed we took the solution to each of the directors in november 2006 and explai ned key features taking feedback and incorporating this into the solution key aspec t of the streamlined model is the distinction between investment that sustains the agreed standard of service and investment that seeks to potentially change the standard of service february 2007 option choice after incorporating feedback into the solution and developing this in greater detail the solution development phase was completed with meeting to agree on the proposed solution at this meeting directors accept ed the proposed product hierarchy process and allocation method and requested more work be done on the roles and responsibilities alongsid developing the business case april 2007 draft business case we presented draft business case to directors this rais ed few 60 outstanding issues primarily relating to the role of strategy plans and the use of nafra in the proposed solution may 2007 amended business case directors were presented and agreed to number of amendments to the streamlining model which have been incorporated into this bu siness case in addition we have had numerous interviews and workshops with key stakeholders incl uding area regional and ncpms representatives and specific stakeholders on specialist subject areas key stakeholders that we have spoken to in developing the project to this stage included brian

proportion of expenditure on project development it is essential to first understand how the existing frm capital programme functions it is important to note that the diagnosis stage of this project identified significant confusion and differences of opinion in relation to defining the existing system for developing and delivering f rm capital projects examples of this include lack of clarity around roles and responsibilities widespread variability in the process for initiating managing and delivering f rm projects and contradicting opinions about the correct scope function and hierarchy of investment deci sion products with this in mind we have attempted to set out below an illustrative proces s map that aims to capture the current process that frm capital projects follow but recognise that this may not re present consensus view the diagram and text below provides high level summary of the key stages involved in the current system for devel oping and delivering frm capital

events deterioration of an existing assets requests fr om regional flood defence committees rfdc or recommendations from previous studies or strategies which route to take in justifying capital expenditure depends on the nature of th problem 62 prefeasibility and other inception reports prefeasibility is the first evaluation of the flood risk problem along with potential solutions the prefeasibility report includes det ails of potential options and the estimated costs and benefits of the options to generate an indicative priority score once prefeasibility is complete handover meeting occurs with ncpms who are us ually engaged by the area client to take the project forw ard to feasibility these reports are typically produced by neeca consultants and managed by the area viability reports in some instances when ncpms receive project they undertake viability report in order to confirm the viability of the project and its priority score before proceeding to feasibility these reports are typically produced by neeca consultants and are managed by ncpms project appraisal reports in some locations the next stage involves ncpms carrying out full appraisal on the project to consider the potential options the appraisal looks i n detail at the different options and must at least consider do nothing and do minimum opti on the appraisal results in preferred option with corresponding priority score neeca consultants managed by ncpms typically produce project appraisal reports strategy plans in most locations strategy will be required due wider issues that need to be taken account of there is flowchart in pag 3 which helps to determine when strategy pl an is necessary strategy plan may in some cases be the starting point in th process to justification of capital expenditure strategies are effectively appraisals based on an entire inte rconnected system and are highly variable in geographical scope strategy plans can also be multilayered especially on the coast or in estuaries in some cases strategy plans are develope d in sufficient detail to gain both a9 and a2 sod approval for the preferred option choice although this had led to confusion about the role of strategy plans in other cases strategy plan will onl confirm the overall approach for wider area with project appraisal report required for individual parts of the approved strategy neeca consultants managed by ncpms typically produce strategy plans review and approval when the par or strategy has identified preferred option review board considers the technical detail before it is recommended for approval projects over 2m capital investment require technical approval from the national review group nrg and projects under 2m capital investment require approval from the project appraisal board pab allocation once projects have received scheme of delegation approval they must then obtain funding approval in competition with other funding needs in previous years defra have set priority score threshold above which project would receive funding but since fdgia has been introduced the environment agency has had much greater flexibility in decisions about which projects to fund although priority score continues to be the primary prioritisation to ol project planning once funding has been approved ncpms can package projects together to maximise procurement efficiency before engaging consultants to do the detail des ign and programming options are considered to maximise procurement efficiency project delivery finally having made the investment decision ncpms engage supplier or contractor and award the contract and manage its delivery 63 appendix 4 baseline methodology the objective of streamlining is to reduce the proportion of expenditure on flood risk management projects that we are spending on project development project development has been defined as all work up to the point of investment decision where we enter into contract to deliv er flood risk management benefit the office of government commerce refers to this decision point as gateway three beyond gateway three we are making discernable change to floodrisk usually by mak ing some sort of intervention eg constructing wall or embankment in order to reduce the probabi lity of an event having negative impacts project development therefore includes all of the following the initial identification of need prefeasibility study and report where required viability study and report where required strategy study and report where required project appraisal report project planning and packaging and detailed design and procurement engineering consultants carry out the majority of the above activities in addit ion project development often involves some or all of the following before awarding contract for delivery topological hydrogeological and archaeological surveys and other intrusive site investi gations environmental surveys and impact assessments and cost consultants ncpms andor regionalarea staff manage the above project development work supplied by external partners and some assessment of this internal cost needs to be included there is signif icant amount of expenditure on project development that is funded from revenue budgets and as result does not feature on the capital programme project delivery covers the cost of the contractor as well as number of overhead costs such as project supervision cost consultants and the management of the delivery phase post gateway 3 64 data source and baseline methodology the environment agencys finance and project management systems are not configured in such way to enable us to easily calculate the proportion of development expenditure in addition we have not been able to separate expenditure for each part of the process there is mechanism for reconciling the regional budgets and actual expenditure on individual projects at the programme level the total expenditure developing frm projects is unknown especially locally in curred expenditure in order to establish baseline we have used the actual expenditure on third parties c ombined with an estimate of internal staff costs oracle provides the raw data for external spend i n the form of actual expenditure against category codes the data for salary costs comes from the budget allo cation for area frm and from ncpms records external spend when an order is raised within 1b1s it is given category code for the type of expenditure we have identified 12 categories that account for the majority of external expenditure relating to frm projec ts unfortunately whilst we have very good data concerning who was paid and how much we do not have robust mechanism for determining what they did or for which specific project as result we initially made some assumptions about the proportion of each code was spent on development or delivery more recently procurement has provided detail that has enabled us to attribute expenditure according t who raised the order expenditure with external suppliers is recorded against over 300 category codes 12 of which we are most relevant to frm project development and delivery the following table shows the t otal spend against these categories since april 2005 this includes nonfrm and nonproject expenditure code category 200506 total spend 200607 total spend 0703 contractor payments 40141101 46135079

subtotal external costs 55829784 61543300 internal spend the above covers the external expenditure on project development under these the 12 category codes we need to add to this the internal cost of environment agency staff to manage the programme there are number of teams both at head office and regionalarea level who are involved in managing proj ect development work unfortunately activity based costing is not mature enough to d etermine an accurate figure for the time or cost incurred internally developing frm projects the two ma in groups who are involved in developing projects are ncpms who manage the contracts with external suppliers and the area frm teams who identify the need manage the initial investigation and prov ide ongoing input as the client as the project is developed we have estimated that at least twothirds of ncpms resource is involved in work deve loping projects up to the contract award stage and based on an annual cost of 9412m 200506 final outcome have attributed 67 of this to project development for regionalarea frm we know from the 200304 business plans that there were 40 ftes working to develop strategic plans at cost of 14m 64 ftes working

70732840 total frm project spend 232304518 214461305 project development 28 33 it is important to recognise that the 200506 financial year represented peak in the delivery of frm projects developed in previous years in addition the 200607 year was affected by inyear budget c uts that affected all of the defra family moreover frm projects currently take many years to develop to gateway three and ivery may be spread out over number of years as such it would be ideal to analyse expenditure on project development over period of three or four years in order to gain better understanding of the relat ive costs without more than two years of reliable data to examine the above analysis demonstrates that the current approach is not as efficient as it could be and there are significant opportunities to make improvements potential errors we have not included external expenditure against category codes other than the 12 listed above we have not included external expenditure paid for via charge cards potential for errors in assigning expenditure to the wrong category code potential that some of the expenditure raised by either ncpms asset system m anagement or operations delivery is for nonfrm spend where this is known we have recategoried we have not included the cost of either head office teams neas ncpg nrg if or regional teams lack of robust activity based costing has resulted in salary costs being based on budget allocation for area staff costs 68 appendix 5 savings estimates and measurement the following is discussion and breakdown of the assumptions in the savings and where in the baseline we would expect to see the effects of streamlining manifest all of the sa vings identified are achieved by reducing the expenditure with external suppliers although streamlining will make some internal resources available we envisage most of this being redeployed on other frm act ivities specifically amps and managing the agreed standard of service the following is the external expenditure on each of the category codes code category 200506 frm project development 200607 frm project development 0703 contractor payments 32581 23947 0705 cost consultants 926891

savings to be realised due the following key streamlining actions reduced expenditure through longer conducting pregateway 0 studies the saving estimates assume that the implementation of option 3 would remove the require ment for areas to undertake most of the work involved in pre g0 studies such as inceptio n reports and pre feasibility studies in the new model replacement projects would be initiated th rough amps and change projects would be initiated at programme level us ing data held nationally therefore fewer projects would be initiated and for those initiated less work would be required at the pre g0 stage it is recognised however that some of the work currently undertaken during the prefeasibility sta ge would still need to be undertaken in the new model although in the new model this work would be undertaken as part of either strategy plan or par examples of prefeasibility work that would stil l need to be undertaken in the new model are 69 scoping the study carrying out document review of historic information identifying the site initiating the project and carrying out some modelling work which does not need to replicated or reworked the table below sets out the assumptions behind the 35m per annum estimated sa vings arising from removing pre gateway 0 studies the best estimate is based on the assumptions that each of the 26 area offices initiate and complete four pregateway 0 studies per year 100 i n total the studies cost between 30k and 50k each under the new system approximately 75 of these wo uld longer be initiated this is due to better management of the initiation of projects all of the prefeasibility co sts relating to these projects are saved and we have assumed that of the remaining 25 projects initiated approximately half of the costs would have to be incurred anyway within either the strategy plan or par process the high and low estimates are based on changing these variables low estimate best estimate high estimate estimated average

prefeasibility costs still applicable 50 50 50 estimated saving 035m 05m 068m total savings from halting prefeasibility 245m 35m 473m we expect this saving to manifest itself as reduction in the baseline 17m spend on 0729 neeca non ncpms we might also see reduction in spend on 0708 engineering services consultants this estimate is based on assumptions regarding the number of project initiated and as there is much less scope for regions and areas to engage consultants without clear mandate to do so more significant reduction in nonncpms spend on neeca may be possible in terms of staff costs we have assumed there are associated savings based n the fact that the additional requirements for asset management plans and the increased focus on managing the existing asset portfolio would in the short term occupy the time of area staff in place of managing consultants delivering prefeasibility studies reduced expenditure through longer conducting viability reports the saving estimates assume that the implementation of option 3 would remove the require ment to undertake much of the work currently undertaken in viability report it is recognised however that some 70 of the work currently undertaken during the viability stage would still need to be undertake n in the new model in the new model this work would be undertaken as part of the strategy plan or par stage examples of viability

125m we expect this saving to be largely realised in reduction in 0728 neeca ncpms spend from the current 24m of expenditure we might also find reduction in spend on 0708 engineering servi ces consultants reduced expenditure on appraising replacement projects currently full option appraisal is carried out for all proposed capital expenditure becaus of the need to consider multiple options examining the effects and consulting on the pos sibilities this is very expensive process the priority scoring system and hou ses target also implicitly encourages the full investigation of potential improvements to the current standard of service alongside t he simple replacement option 71 the streamlined model takes different approach for investment decisions where th main driver for investment is to replace an asset that has reached the end of it useful life where there is stakeholder demand for an improvement to the current standard and where the asset management plan demonstrates robust economic case for the existing standard of service that replacem ent projects would not require option appraisal the unknown at this stage is how many projects might be eligi ble to take this route the use of cfmp and amp products together with other potential central controls all ows comfort that those projects meeting the criteria to avoid option appraisal do not present undue risk of making poor investment decisions projects where there is policy intent to change the current s tandard of service community demand for change increased risk or low costbenefit would not meet thi s criteria the scale of costs saved is an unknown as the current system does not distinguish between different types of capital replacement activity and distorts demand for improvements through using one process to assess both types of projec t ie as full appraisals are required teams would carry out the investigative work to review options we have estimated that between 5 15 of 200m asset investment programme ght be eligible for simplified replacement route the reduction in cost of justification due to avoiding f ull option appraisal to reach gateway 1 we have estimated at 13 this is based on the cost of project development via strategy plan and par which require the full option appraisal to be in the order of 23 after implementing streamlining with simplified route we expect this could be as

reduction in spend on 0708 engineering services consulta nts fewer change projects started much like the above benefit the potential savings associated with this are largely dependent on how the system is managed in any ne year we could pull forw ard as many or as few change projects as we wished the saving here would be the avoidance of the expenditure which would ordinarily be incurred in developing potential change candidate once more the environment agency does not have information about the types of project improvement or replacement nor the costs of appraisals and strategi either for these types of project or more generally equally there is poor visibility about the number of projects which are started but do not progress the assumptions are therefore the expenditure on identification of need and getting to gateway 0 would be reduced due to simplified method for submission and analysis of potential change projects usi ng shapefiles and we would more effectively restrict the number of candidates at gateway 0 through objec tive centrally managed attrition this would result in fewer projects starting that are not priorities given the current funding levels in essence the savings delivered by better matching of investment appraisal t the available funding is entirely dependent on what proportion of the total frm asset investment programme we wish to spend on 72 investment appraisal by setting the budget first and then determining how many investment appraisals we can deliver for that amount we would be able to more effectively control the tota l

saving to manifest in the baseline by reduction in 0728 neeca ncpm s spend from the current 24m by about 25m we feel this estimate is very conservative and would hope to see much more drastic reduction i n spend on neeca as we shift to system with much better control on the initiation of change projects and more focus on delivering projects at any rate the spend we do incur on neeca in the future would be much more effective in that projects that have been shortlisted at gateway 0 based on urgency and contribution to outcome measures would have better continuity and certainty associated with the m savings summary as discussed above significant annual savings have been identified based on 200m programme predominantly from reduced expenditure on engineering consultants key streamlining

programme in this section we have included an outline description of t hese key initiatives in order to understand the context in which we are designing new system for developing and delivering capital projects asset management plans amps the environment agency has target to produce am ps for all asset systems by 200708 the total number of asset systems recorded is 3 300 although this is likely to be an overestimate it will still be significant challenge to achieve the target the amp specification is currently in the process of being developed and it is not ye t clear how amps will fit with existing frm structures and systems for example whether they will be used in place of business plans for funding and if yes what information they will require the streamlining team believe that amps have an important role to play i n improving the current frm capital programme and have met regularly with the process team responsible for the roll out of amps to discuss the potential requirements of streamlined approach to capital developmen t we believe that it will be possible to develop specification which will be simple enoug h to achieve the amp target whilst also fulfilling the needs of the streamlining model further detail around the proposed functionality and content of the amps is contained i n section 5 of this report shorelinecatchment flood management plans scfmps the core objective of cfmp is to develop complementary sustainable polici for flood risk management within catchment over the long term the key outputs from cfmp are broad understanding of the size nature and distribution of current flood risk and scenarios for fut ure flood risk in catchment combined with complementary set of justifiable longterm fl ood risk management policies that satisfy the catchment objectives the development of prioritised set of actions for the catchment is further key product cfmp is new complex and innovative product it is about taking strate gic view of the catchment thinking about how it works how it should work and establishing the most sustainable approach to managing flood risks over the longt erm the development of the cfmp programme has required the development of innovative processes and approaches work on cfmp pilot programme commenced in 2001 and ringfenced funding is provided by defra in england the main programme of work commenced in 2004 and in wales the main programme of work commenced in 2006 currently there are 71 cfmps under development 43 are programmed to complete by december 07 18 are programmed to complete by december 08 and 9 in wales are programmed to complete by april 09 cfmps will also need to play an important role in any new approach to frm capita l project development further detail about the role cfmps will play in the preferred solution is included i n section 5 76 appendix 8 impact of the 2007 summer floods in june and july of 2007 england and wales experienced two separate extreme rainfall ev ents that overwhelmed urban drainag systems and overtopped many defences resulting in significant flood damage this has resulted in potential change in our understanding of flood risk as well as signif icant change in our funding forecast each of which may have an effect on the streamlining propos potential changes in our understanding of flood risk increases the shift away from traditional flood defence approach by demonstrati ng that absolute protection from flooding is neither technically feasible nor economically or env ironmentally viable the events demonstrate that thinking in terms of setting design standard is both t rap and delusion such standards conflict with the principle of managing all floods and not just s ome it is also delusion because estimates of the magnitude of extreme floods are very inaccurate and due to climate change likely to get modified over time reinforces the government strategy making space for water looking for ways to live wi th and adapt to flood risk and using natural processes to reduce the impact as well as the probability of fl ooding the flood events further emphasis the importance of surface water runoff and urban drainage as source of flooding which may result in widening of the environment agencys remi t potentially more focus on integrated urban drainage and storage to attenuate peak flows as opposed to more traditional defences which typically shift the problem to other areas critical infrastructure such as power supply and water supply may require higher standard of protection as well as increased focus on more vulnerable groups within communit ies flooding in locations where we have defences resulted from overtopping rather than asse t failure water levels were so high that overtopping of defences was unsurprising it is unlikely that we would have provided defences to prevent the flooding that resulted whilst there were few if any reports of flooding as result of asset failure the foc us on asset condition at the public accounts committee hearing suggests that the conditi on of the existing portfolio will remain relatively high priority increased focus on wider strategic planning and integrated flood management as this will require considering more strategic consideration of the potential sources and impacts of any proposed changes this may put pressure on the unit cost of producing cfmps and strategy plans the potential that extreme rainfall events of this type may be more frequen t in the future this may change the calculation of benefits of since an event that we previously considered to have 1 probability of being exceeded in any one year 1 in 100 may now have 133 probability of being exceeded 1 in 75 and so the average annual damages associated with an event will be higher the investment product hierarchy proposed within streamlining pr ovides clarity of function of the strategic input from cfmps and strategy plans as well as the tac tical input from amps and better understanding of the longterm costs of th current frm asset portfolio streamlining will promote new process and product guidance clarity of roles and responsibilities and more effective and efficient controls and tools t enable the environment agency to respond more quickly and for less initial cost deliv ering more in terms of real reduction in flood risk 77 changes in the funding forecast the announced 200m additional funding for frm if spent entirely on the frm projects programme would represent doubling of the programme from 225m in 200607 to 425m by 201011 in the shortterm this will reduce the current funding constraints on the programme and significantly reduce backlog of projects that currently do not have high enough priority score indicative prio rity score will reduce to 16 for midforecast programme growth and could reduce much further there will be need to develop enough projects over the next 23 years to maintain the increased programme the current lead time for projects is much longer and without streamlini ng the process we would struggle to populate enough projects with gateway 3 approval to deliver annual expenditure on project development at 20 of the total frm project spend would need t rise from the current 71m to 85m annual expenditure on project delivery at 80 of the total frm project spend would need to ris from the current 143m to 340m in the shortterm there will be an increase in total expenditure on project devel opment but measured overall increase in the total proportion spent on project delivery there will need to be significant increase in internal resource efficiency across t he business in order to deliver the increase eg each ncpms project manager will need to manage greater number f projects there will be need to effectively control the competition from regions to start proj ects so that the supply of proposals is in line with the available funding by changing from push system to pull system streamlining will preve nt under or overprogramming of the initial project development stages ensuring we pull forward as many potential projects as is necessary to drive the progra mme and achieve the targets as result the controls proposed withi n streamlining ensure that we start the right projects and that once they are started they have much quicker and clearer path to delivery increased clarity around project roles and responsibilities will also able nugatory work to be identified and curtailed earlier shifting reso urce quickly to other potential projects and in doing so enable delivery of more projects 78 impacts on the streamlining strategic case whilst the funding forecast has changed the diagnosis in section 3 of th business case is fundamentally the same the sources and root causes are effectively different whether the total frm project expenditure is 225m or 425m an increase in funding will not in itself improve effic iency and there is real risk that an even greater proportion of the available funding is directed toward exces sive project development for project to progress beyond gateway three it has already been the subject of number of reviews and procurement controls many more than for projects in the initial stages of development shortterm or piecemeal approach to streamlining may appear attractive but is unlikely to deliver sustainable improvements and would retain underlying inefficiency and their root causes s treamlining has been conceived and developed as complete package of changes that are mutually dependent and rely on each other to achieve the required result the increase in funding if managed well does provide an opportunity to ease the pain of improvin g efficiency successful implementation of the streamlining proposal will ens ure effective and efficient delivery of the frm projects programme whether funding levels increase decline or stay the s ame the recent flooding and public expectation on the wise use of the increased funds have heightened t he need to significantly improve the efficiency of the frm projects programme as result the urgency and importance of the swift implementation of streamlining has if anything i ncreased as result of the recent flooding impact on streamlining benefits the benefits of streamlining have been measured as percentage reduction in the proportion of the tota l frm project expenditure spent on developing projects to gateway 3 we have estimated that by implementing streamlining we can reduce the proportion from the current 30 by 41 for 200m programme this represents total of 82m if the programme increased by 80m to 305m in 200809 the 21 reduction in that year would represent saving of 63m if the programme increased by another 50m to 355m in 200910 t he 2 reduction in that year total of 41 would represent an additional saving of 83m total of 14 6m in addition to the annual baseline shift the measurement of savings will nee d to reflect the longerterm reduction in costs by taking account of the contribution of development costs to estimated delivery in future years investment in planning in the early years could otherwise skew the res ult impact on streamlining implementation risks to properly gear our future programme and respond to political pressure more studies are likely to start because of the need to drive larger programme there is an increased risk that some projects that turn out to be marginal will be developed in great detail when they should have been curtailed earli er we need to ensure these are curtailed early in their life when sufficient evidence is captured to confirm any outcome would be low priority so we do not spend years and hundreds of thousands proving that hard engineered solution is not economically environmentally or socially viable the internal resources required to implement streamlining are unlikely to impede the devel opment or delivery of projects since many of the changes are to policy and process controls and too ls with manageable shift in roles and responsibilities at the local level the transitional risks of making the streamlined system operational are minimal and will be supported by guidance and training that would replace the current guidance and training it may take s ome time for the new systems to embed but the changes are complement ary to the need to deliver more better faster and for less impact on streamlining implementation timeframes section 61 of the business case details the key deliverables and proposed t imeframe there is some scope for bringing forward some aspects of streamlining such as the removal of prefeasib ility and viability report products but in order to roll out the new process and products there is need to prototype and design some key aspec ts of the proposed system the soo ner an implementation plan is agreed and suitable project governance and external support is in place the sooner we can start to realise efficiencies
