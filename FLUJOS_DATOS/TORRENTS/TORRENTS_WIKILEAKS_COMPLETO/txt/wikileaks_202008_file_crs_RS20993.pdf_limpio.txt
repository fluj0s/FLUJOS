technology are converging with internet technology to foster new generations of applications and services presently the united states and other countries are moving to thirdgeneration 3g and fourth generation 4g mobile telephony the leading choices for 4g technology are long term evolution lte and wimax an industry designation for the broadband standard related trend is the growth in use of wifi wireless fidelityfrom the perspective of spectrum management significant difference in the technologies is that 3g and 4g services operate on designated licensed frequencies while wifi shares unlicenced spectrum with other uses unlicensed spectrum is not sold to the highest bidder and used for the services chosen by the licenseholder but is instead accessible to anyone using wireless equipment certified by the fcc for those frequencies new technologies that can use unlicensed spectrum without causing interference are being developed for vacant spectrum designated to provide space between the broadcasting signals of digital television known as white space in november 2008 the fcc established rules that permit the use of this white space during 2007 m2z and several other companies petitioned the federal communications commission fcc to release some spectrum licenses for national broadband network m2z offered to provide basic service for free to consumers and public safety and offer content filtering for familyfriendly access in september 2007 the fcc issued notice of proposed rulemaking to establish service rules to auction the licenses designated as auction aws3 the fcc did not act on the auction proposal and the issues surrounding it remain unresolved policy issues before the 111 th congress could include the competitive impact on commercial wireless carriers when municipalities offer wireless broadband services promoting the development of broadband wireless access and assuring the availability of appropriate spectrum for both licensed and

advanced wireless technologies telecommunications carriers broadcasters cable companies content providers and others are seeking effective strategies to move to new standards upgrade infrastructure and develop new services and content this migration path includes decisions about acquiring and using spectrum spectrum is managed by the federal communications commission fcc for commercial and other nonfederal uses and by the national telecommunications and information administration ntia for federal government use international use is facilitated by numerous bilateral and multilateral agreements covering many aspects of usage including mobile telephony1 spectrum is segmented into bands of radio frequencies and typically measured in cycles per second or hertz2 commercial wireless communications typically rely on bandwidth below 3 ghz because of limitations in current technology although developments in technology increase the efficiency of spectrum and expand its usable range there is persistent demand for spectrum to carry new services as other technologies reach the market new developments in wireless technology support many services for business and consumer markets such as enhanced internet links digital television and radio broadcast reception highquality streaming video and mobile commerce mcommerceincluding the ability to make payments

highspeed wireless networking5 today most new laptop computers come equipped with the technology that allows wireless access to the internet using wifi technology wireless local area networks wlans operate on unlicenced spectrum using radio frequencies in the free 24 ghz and 5457ghz spectrum bands group of standards for frequency use in these bands is known as the 80211 family or legacy the 80211an standards are commonly referred to as wifi for wireless fidelity wifi provides highspeed internet access for personal computers and handheld devices and is also used by businesses to link computerbased communications within local area links are connected to highspeed wireline landline either at business location or through hotspots hotspots are typically located in homes or convenient public locations including many airports and café environments such as starbucks another standard for wireless internet is bluetooth which has shorter range than wi fi but works well in cell phones bluetooth handles both voice and data wifi is mostly data but also supports v oice over internet protocol v oip calls sometimes known as v owifi wimax worldwide interoperability for microwave access refers to both technology and an industry standard the work of an industry coalition of network and equipment suppliers 6 that have agreed to develop interoperable broadband wireless based on common standard ieee 80216 for pointtopoint transmissions wimax technology can transmit data over distances of up to 30 miles and is used in the united states as last mile technology that is means to provide fixed wireless service to locations that ar not connected to networks by cable or high speed wires mobile wimax is still in the early stages of development 7 wimax uses multiple frequencies around the world in ranges from 700 mhz to 66 ghz in the united states frequencies where wimax is being tested or used include 700 mhz 19 ghz 23 ghz 25 ghz and 27 ghz future technologies for wireless broadband

to communities in part because they support existing community services such as internet access for schools and communications for public safety are fiberoptic cable networks and wireless accesswifi today possibly wimax in the future the spread of wireless services such as access to the internet and anticipated advances in wireless technology are modifying the business case for choosing broadband technology networks that depend on fiberoptic cable backbone are capitalintensive and usually more profitable in highdensity urban areas number of rural communities have used their resources to install fiberoptic broadband services in part because they were too small market to interest forprofit companies increasingly communities are looking at wireless technologies to support their networks several states have passed laws prohibiting or limiting local governments ability to provide telecommunications services an effort to challenge such law in missouri by municipalities offering local communications services in the state was heard before the us supreme court in 2004 9 in the telecommunications act of 1996 congress barred states from prohibiting the ability of any entity to provide any interstate or intrastate telecommunications service10 the court ruled that entity was not specific enough to include state political divisions if congress wished specifically to protect both public and private entities they could do so by amending the language of the law this court decision and the steady improvement in broadband communications technologies that municipalities wish to have available in their communities have provided fuel for policy debate about access to broadband services the central debate is whether municipal broadband services are part of essential infrastructure with many public benefits including stimulus to the local economy or whether they provide unfair competition that distorts the marketplace and discourages commercial companies from investing in broadband technologies in particular the fact that urban areas are creating wifi networks and providing among other services free wireless links to the internet is viewed as threat to commercial companies and form of unfair competition municipalities installing free wifi zones often contend that generally available access to the internet through wireless connections has become an urban amenity arguably necessity in sustaining and developing the local economy municipal wifi also provides the opportunity to improve social services and internet access in disadvantaged communities that often are not served by fiber optic networks 11 8 for further information see crs report rl30719 broadband internet access and the digital divide federal assistance programs by lennard g kruger

filtering for family friendly access in return for the grant of the license which would be assigned without auction m2z offered to pay percentage of gross revenues to the us treasury in september 2007 the fcc issued notice of proposed rulemaking to establish service rules for the auction of license or licenses at 21552175 mhz designated as auction aws3 12 proposed provisions include obligations to offer free broadband service similar to that proposed by m2z and family friendly access the proposed spectrum band is adjacent to bands previously auctioned in the advanced wireless service aws1 auction that concluded in 2006 there are allegations that the proposed network would cause harmful interfe rence to users on the aws frequencies there are also concerns that the filtering would be applied in such way as to constitute censoring the concept of lifeline broadband service has significant support from many policy makers the fcc did not act on the auction proposal and the issues

spectrum so that devices could be developed and ready for retail sales by february 2009 13 one of the potential uses for white space is wireless broadband access to the internet14 these unlicensed applications could be used as an extension of the licensed applications that will be possible on the 700 mhz band once it is cleared of analog broadcasts the national association of broadcasters nab and others protested the use of white space for consumer devices on the grounds that they could interfere with digital broadcasting and with microphones used for variety of purposes companies such as microsoft dell and motorola however stated the belief that solutions can be found to prevent interference in november 2008 the fcc established rules that permit the use of the white spaces with
