includes record of the support owed under the order arrearages interest or late penalty charges amounts collected amounts distributed the childs date of birth and any liens imposed and also includes standardized information on both parents such as name social security number date of birth and case identification number states also must establish an automated directory of new hires containing

employee and the employers name address and tax identification number this information generally is supplied to the state new hires directory within 20 days after the employee is hired moreover

permits the fpls to be used for the purpose of establishing parentage establishing setting the amount of modifying or enforcing child support obligations and enforcing child custody or visitation orders6 federal law requires that designated state agency directly or by contract conduct automated comparisons of the social security numbers reported by employers to the state directory of new hires and the social security numbers of cse cases that appear in the records of the state registry of child support orders federal law requires the hhs secretary to conduct similar comparisons of the federal directories 7 automation is critical to the operation and success of the cse program8 g18g138g157g142g155g151g146g157g162g561g7g156g157g138g139g149g146g156g145g150g142g151g157g561 legally identifying the father is prerequisite for obtaining child support order federal law requires tanf applicants and recipients to cooperate in establishing paternity or obtaining support payments

simple civil process for establishing paternity 3 requires an affidavit to be completed by men voluntarily acknowledging paternity and entitles the affidavit to full faith and credit in any state 4

parents to provide financial support for their children and stipulates the amount of the obligation and how it is to be paid it is usually established at the time of divorce or when welfare case is initiated pl 100485 required states to use their stateestablished guidelines in establishing child support orders states decide child support amounts based on the noncustodial parents income or based on both parents income 6 pl 104193 permitted both custodial and certain noncustodial parents to obtain information from the fpls pl 10533 however prohibited fpls information from being disclosed to noncustodial parents in cases where there is evidence of domestic violence or child abuse and the local court determines that disclosure may result in harm to the custodial parent or child 7 when match occurs the state directory of new hires is required to report to the state cse agency the name address and social security number of the employee and the employers name address and identification number within two business days the cse agency then instructs appropriate em ployers to withhold child support obligations from the employees paycheck unless the employees in come is not subject to income withholding 8 federal law requires suspension of all federal cse funding to the state when its cse plan after appeal is disapproved moreover states without approved cse plans could lose funding for the tanf block grant pl 105200 imposed substantially smaller financial penalties on states that failed to meet the automated data systems requirements the hhs secretary is

payment of the child support collection is important because in many cases arrearages are never fully paid while the family receives tanf cash benefits the states and federal government retain any current support and any assigned arrearages15 collected up to the cumulative amount of tanf benefits paid to the family while states may pay their share of collections to the family they must pay the federal government the federal governments share of child support collections collected on behalf of tanf families this means that the state and not the federal government bears the entire cost of any child support passed through to families and disregarded by the state in determining the familys tanf cash benefit16 states must distribute to former tanf families the following child support collections first before the state and the federal government are reimbursed the familyfirst policy 1 all current child support 2 any child support arrearages that accrue after the family leaves tanf these arrearages are called neverassigned arrearages plus 3 any arrearages that accrued before the family began receiving tanf benefits an exception to this rule occurs when child support arrearages are collected via the federal income tax refund offset programthose collections are divided between the state and federal government 17 any child support arrearages that accrue during the time the family is on tanf belong to the state and federal government

historically congress has agreed that visitation and child support should be legally separate issues and that only child support should be under the purview of the cse program both federal and state policymakers have maintained that denial of visitation rights should be treated continued payments this means that cse incentive payments that are received by states and reinvested in the cse program are not eligible for federal reimbursement 15 the child support assignment covers any child support that accrues while the family receives cash tanf benefits as well as any child support that accrued before the family started receiving tanf benefits pursuant to pl 109 171effective october 1 2009 or at state option october 1 2008 the assignment will only cover child support that accrues while the family receives tanf 16 pl 109171 helps states pay for the cost of their cse passthrough and disregard policies by requiring the federal government to share in the costs of the entire amount up to 100 per month for one child up to 200 per month for two or more children of child support collections passed through and disregarded by states effective october 1 2008 17 pl 109171 gives states the option of distributing to former tanf families the full amount of child support collected on their behalf ie both current support and all child support arrearagesincluding arrearages collected through the
