freddie mac which is exempt from the registration and disc losure requirements that apply to other companies that sell stock to the public committed itself in 2002 to voluntary compliance with securities and exchange commission sec di sclosure standards in its restatement freddie announced that it would begin voluntar sec reporting as soon as possible after the companys return to timely reporting this has not happened yet but the current projection is to begin filing time ly quarterly reports by the end of 2007 freddie filed its 2006 annual report on march 23 2007 in timely fashion background freddie mac is gse that pl ays an important role in the secondary mortgage market like fannie mae2 its rival gse freddie buys mort gages from lenders and repackages them in the form of securities which it ma hold or sell to public investors freddie finances its purchases of mortgage loans by selling bonds either bonds backed by its own financial resources called straight debt or mortgagebacked securities where interesthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21567crs3 3 appendix ii p 2 available online at httpwwwfreddiemaccomnewsarchivesinvestors 2003restatement_112103html 4 derivatives are financial instruments whose value is linked to changes in some price or variable in this case interest rates to hedge against fa lling rates freddie purchased interest rate swaps in which freddie agreed to pay floatingrate inte rest to the swap dealer while the swap dealer agreed to pay freddie fixed rate of interest the size of the payments is calculated by reference to notional principal amount that doe s not actually change hands as rates fell continuedand principal payments made by homeowners are passed through to holders of the bonds as gses fannie and freddie are exempt from state and local taxes from certain regulatory requirements and have line of credit with the us treasury their most significant advantage however is what is called the implicit guarantee although the bonds they sell are not formally backed by the full faith and credit of the us government market participants behave as though they are because the markets do not believe that the treasury would allow fannie or freddie to default the gses are able to sell bonds at lower interest rates than other financial institutions more than 60 of all single family mortgage debt has been sold in the secondary market or securitized as the leadin g players in this market the housing gses represent an extraordinary concentration of fi nancial risk because there is strong public interest in ensuring that freddie and fanni remain financially strong congress in 1992 created ofheo safety and soundness regula tor dedicated exclus ively to these two institutions the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s illustrated the riskiness of the mortgage market if interest rates ri financial institutions may find that their cost of funds exceeds their income from longterm fixedrate mortgages if rates fall homeowners refinance their mortgages and reduce income streams to institutions which must still pay off debt previously issued at higher interest rates protection from interest rate risk is critical to the soundness of the gses and it app ears that strategies to avoid or hedge risk were partly responsible fo r freddies recent accounting problems freddie macs accounting problems appendix ii to freddie macs novemb er 21 2003 restatement discusses the accounting errors that made revision nece ssary the basic factors underlying the accounting errors were lack of sufficient accounting expertise and internal control and management weaknesses in addition certain tran sactions and accounting policies were implemented to achieve steady growth in reported earnings the two accounting policies that appear to have been most impor tant in this regard yielding 88 of the upward revision in pretax net income are the classification of securities and accounting for derivatives instruments3 how these issues affect net earnings is discussed below between 2000 and 2003 interest rates fell dramatically mortgage rates from over 8 to as low as 52 the fall in rates d two major impacts on freddie macs financial statements both freddies bond portfolio and the derivatives contracts freddie had purchased to hedge the risk of falling interest rates4 increased sharply in value underhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21567crs4 4 continued freddies floating rate obligation diminished wh ile it continued to receive the fixed payment 5 stockholders equity is separate from current ea rnings it represents the proprietary interests of the owners stockholders of corporation or th goingconcern value of assets over liabilitiesgenerally accepted accounting principles gaap these gains in asset value should have been reported as current income however freddie chose accounting treatments for these asset gains that deferred recognition of income until later years thus smoothing out the effects of falling interest rate s the restatement of earnings is based upon freddies and its new auditors decision that these accounting policies were incorrect much of freddies bond portf olio was held in an accounting category called held to maturity htm this meant that the bonds would not be sold and that therefore day today fluctuations in their market value we re irrelevant all that mattered was the amount of principal and interest pa yments which was fixed and known in advance these bonds were carried on freddies balance sheet at historical cost which meant that increases in the bonds market value as inte rest rates fell after 2000 were essentially ig nored and did not appear as current earnings howeve r during the 20002002 period some of the bonds classified as htm were sold as result th restatement reclassifies much of the entire bond portfolio as available for sale afs nd changes in market value are recognized gains in the bonds value over the period appear in the restated earnings as either current earnings or stockholders equity5 derivatives accounting is governed by fas 133 of the financial accounting standards board fasb under fas 133 the fa ir value of all fina ncial derivatives must be calculated markedtomark et at the end of each accounting period changes in fair value from the previous accounting period must be reported as current income unless the derivatives are used for hedging if derivative is used to hedge an asset the value of that asset the hedged item will move in the opposite directi on to the derivatives value thus fall in the price of the hedged asset will be offset by gain in the derivative or vice versa under fas 133 the firm can reco gnize as earnings both the change in the derivatives value and the offsetting change in the hedged items if the gains and losses are closely correlated the net effect on reported earnings will be very small or zero there is another form of hedge accountin g under fas 133 covering derivatives held to hedge future transaction or cash flow since the hedged item in this case does not yet exist it cannot be marked to market and used to offset gains in the derivatives fair value however fas 133 allows the gain or loss in derivative used to hedge future event to be assigned to comprehensive income sub category of stockholders equity when the future transaction or cash flow occurs the rivative is marked to market and changes in fair value are recognized as current income but presumably gains or losses in the derivative will be offset by the hedged item either form of hedge accounting has the effect of reducing the impact of changes in derivatives fair value on current earnings and the bottom line to qualify for this accounting treatment however fa sb requires that there be close relationship between changes in the value of the derivative and the hedged item derivatives that do not meet fasbs hedge test are considered speculative trading instruments and changes in fair value from period to period must be reco gnized and reported as current earningshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21567crs5 6 baker botts llp report to the board of directors of the federal home loan mortgage corporation internal inves tigation of certain accounting matters december 10 2002 july 21 2003 107 p 7 ibid p iiifreddie mac like most us corporations that use derivatives states in its annual reports that it does not use derivatives fo r speculative purposes in its restatement however freddie concludes that most of its derivatives in 2001 and 2002 did not qualify as accounting hedges this means that from gaap perspective these were speculative positions recognition of fair value gains nd losses in derivatives positions resulted in an upward revision of preta x net earnings by 50 billion based on the november 21 2003 restatem ent the account ing treatments of derivatives and bond portfolios we re the major factors in the restatement in both cases the drop in interest rates to 1950s levels produced unexpected windfall gains in the value of financial instruments fr eddie chose not to recognize these gains to avoid creating an impression of earnings volatility knowing that thes gains would be reversed if the trend in interest rates turned upwards according to the june 25 statement accounting policies were designed with view to their effect on earnings in the context of freddie macs goal of achieving steady earnings growth in other words freddie sought to smooth out reported earnings and reduce volatility by deferring to future years earnings that should have been recognized under gaap as current income an internal report to freddies board of di rectors issued in july 2003 provides further detail on specific transactions designed to defer earnings and produce the desired accounting results6 the report concludes that these transactions and the accompanying accounting policies indicated serious deficien cies in freddie macs internal controls disclosure practices and in the governance policy of former management the report notes however that these transactions do not appear to have been made at the expense of the companys risk manage ment policies and practices7 in the november 21 2003 restatement freddie mac stated that it accepts the reports conclusions in november 2005 freddie announced that its reported income for the first half of 2005 would have to be restated and redu ced by about 200 million because of problems in legacy computer system the june 25 2003 release noted several actions taken to fix weaknesses in accounting and management controls these include the expansion of senior accounting staff creation of an operating risk oversig ht unit and strengthening the review of accounting and other critical bus iness operations in conjunc tion with ofheo freddie has embarked on comprehensive remediation program to effect broad changes in the finance function in 2006 freddie reported that its remedia tion effort had proved to be much more difficult and complex than expected am ong the areas where work continued were mitigation of identified material weaknesses and significant deficiencies strengthening of the financial close process implementing critical systems initiatives and completion of review of the companys system of internal controls related to the processing and recording of the companys financial

by the end of 2007 freddie macs management and regulatory problems the smoothing out of reported earnings through questionable interpretations of gaap is normally regarded as violation of accounting

enhance the safety and soundness tools available to the gse regulator by giving it more flexibility to establish and enforce risk management operational and capital standards and authority to put gse into receivership if necessary the accounting scandal at freddie mac was followed by similar scandal at fannie mae in 2005 given the importance of fanni and freddie to housing finance and the financial system at large these deficiencies in accounting are troubling if freddies management cut corners with accounting ru to conceal an inconvenient excess of earnings how might it respond to shortfall in earnings that presaged serious trouble in the company an announcement that either fannie or freddie faced unexpected and undisclosed problems could trigge r wide instability in debt
