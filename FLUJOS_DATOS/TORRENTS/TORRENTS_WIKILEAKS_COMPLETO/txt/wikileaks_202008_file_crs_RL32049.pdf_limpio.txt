debt would be retired within matter of years it was reasoned at the time that it would not be in the nations interest to issue debt that would still be outstanding after the national debt had been retired and the budget had entered period of sustained surplus the drawbacks to discontinuing the 30year bond were seen to be insigniﬁcant the treasury also discontinued other maturities such as the

would not need to borrow longterm when it planned to retire the entire publicly held national debt within few years since then th projections of large surpluses have been transformed into large deficits on au gust 3 2005 the treasury announced that the 30year bond would be reintroduced in the first quarter of 2006 to evaluate the merits of this change it is useful to consider how the reintroduction of the 30year bond would affect the cost of government borrowing the macroeconomy and financial market efficiency reintroduction of the 30year bond could reduce government borrowing costs but the circumstances under which 30year bonds would be less costly than shorter term debt would be rare the government could lower its interest costs only when the yield on 30year bonds is lower than the yield on present and expected future yields on shorterterm debt this occurs infrequently because when longterm rates fall shortterm rates typically fall even further actively changing borrowing patterns to reduce interest costs would be departure from current treasury debt management policy and would r counter to its goal of pr omoting efficient financial markets reintroduction of the 30year tr easury bond would not be expected to have any significant effect on the macroec onomy economic theory suggests that government budget deficits have important effects on ec onomic growth and interest rates but there is thought to be little signif icance to the maturity at which the debt is financed us treasuries are important to the func tioning of the financial system through their roles as benchmark security and safe haven the benchm ark role refers to the tendency of the financial sector to us us treasuries to price other financial securities and as collateral in other financial instruments the safe haven role refers to the large capital flows into treasuries at times of financial unrest the effect of reintroducing the 30year treasury bond on financial efficiency revolves around whether it would enhance the benchmark and safe haven role tr easuries serve these roles effectively because they are highly liquid and predictable reintroducing the 30year bond would reduce the liquidity and predictability of other treasury securities only if future budget deficits ar small before its discontinuation the 30 year treasury bond served in the benchmar k role since its retirement it has been replaced by the 10year treasury note the government borrows across many maturities to neutralize the effect on private borrowing patterns if the gove rnment borrowed disproportionately at the short or long end of the market it could force private borrowers out of that end reintroduction of the 30year bond would nhance the governments neutrality with respect to maturity length some also argu that the private suppl for very longterm debt falls short of private demand which is driven by institutions such as banks insurance companies and pension funds reintroduction of the 30year bond could fill that gap this re port will not be updatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32049contents t h g l s f t r s u r d b t m n g m n t 1 f f c t n t h f d r l g v r n m n

refunding statement press release js2671 aug 3 2005reintroduction of the 30year treasury bond an economic analysis the history of 30year treasury bonds stre tches back to world war i in the postworld war ii era the treasury began to issue 30year bonds in 1977 in the decades before 1977 longterm federa l government borrowing was limited by mandated interest rate ceilings that were often lower than market rates after the repeal of interest rate ceilings the i ssuance by the treasury of 30year bonds and other longterm bonds increased rapidly in the 1980s along with the growth in the budget deficit new issues of the 30year treasury bond were discontinue d in november 2001 based on budget projections at the time that the publicly held na tional debt would be retired within matter of years1 it was reasoned at the time that it would not be in the nations interest to issue debt that would still be outstanding after the national debt had been retired and the budget had tered period of sustained surplus the drawbacks to discontinuing the 30year bond were seen to be insignificant the treasury also discontinued ot her maturities such as the 20year bond and the 3year note in the surplus years in order to increase liquidity in the remaining maturities as borrowing needs dwindled since then the projections of large surp luses have been transformed into large deficits on august 3 2005 the treas ury announced that the 30year bond would be reintroduced in the first quarter of 20062 to evaluate the merits of this change it is useful to consider how the reintr oduction of the 30year bond would affect the cost of government borrowing the macro economy and the efficiency of financial markets before doing so it is useful to define the goals of treasury debt management the goals of treasury debt management the federal government currently borrows across the yield curve from bills that mature in three months to notes that matu re in 10 years in 2004 the average lengthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32049crs2 3 us department of treasury treasury bulletin june 2005 table fd5 4 testimony by treasury assistant secret ary lee sachs before the house committee on ways and means sept 28 1999 these principl have not been changed by the current administrationof maturity on outstanding treas uries was 4 years and 11 months3 the treasury identifies three major principles guiding its debt management decisions 1 to provide sound cash management in order to ensure that adequate cash balances are available at all times 2 to achieve the lowest cost financing for the taxpayers and 3 to promote efficient capital markets4 at times these principles are mutually compatible at others they conflict with one another for example issuing longt erm bonds helps the government achieve the first goal because it adds predictability to its revenues by reduc ing the uncertainty of future interest costs but it will often raise interest costs to the taxpayer while the reintroduction of the 30year treasury bond would increase predictability it is arguable whether sufficient predictability ca nnot already be achieved with 5year and 10year securities the remainder of th report will explore the effects of the reintroduction of the 30year bond on th other two goals of treasury debt management and its m acroeconomic effects effect on the federal governments finances reducing interest costs frees up governme nt revenues for lower taxes or higher government spending issuing 30year bonds could reduce interest costs to the government when longterm rates are low both in absolute terms and relative to shortterm rates to dete rmine whether 30year bonds will lower interest costs it is necessary to compare their yields not only to shortterm yields today but also to expected future shortterm yields the alternative to issuing longterm bond is to issue shortterm security and continue to roll it over into new shortterm securities as it matures thus longterm bonds ar financially prefer able to shortterm securities only if longterm ra tes are lower than the discounted sum of current and future shortterm rates this is most likely to be the case when the yield curve shifts down and flattens but it is rare for both to happen simultaneously to understand why this is true it is n ecessary to understand movements in the yield curve the yield curve is plot of interest rates by maturity typically it is sloping upward such that longterm rates ar higher than shortterm rates thus when an interest rate of any given maturity changes there can be two sources of the change shift of the yield curve with change in slope as shown in figure 1 or change in the slope of the yield curve as shown in figure 2 as economic conditions improve the yield curve tends to both shift upward so interest rates are higher at all maturities and flatten so that the difference between short term and long term rates diminishes all else equal it is common for the yield curve to become inverted longterm rates are lower than shortterm rates at relatively highhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32049crs3 5 this relationship is borne out in the data from 1977 to 2002 the annual correlation between 30year treasury yields and the spread between 10year treasury yields and 30 year yields was 072 6 the last time the treasury made major ch ange in borrowing patterns to lower interest costs was 1993 when 45 of its longterm fina ncing was shifted to shortterm securities however this was done at time when longter m interest rates were at their lowest nominal level in 16 years this was onetime shif t in policy toward s horter maturities and borrowing patterns were not continuously ltered to take advantage of subsequent movements in interest rates see treas ury shift toward shortterm

recession begins by cont rast rates are typically low ie the yield curve has shifted downward when the yield curve is relatively steep5 this suggests that the reintroduction of the 30year bond could lower interest costs in rare instances if the government aggressively pursued costminimizing strategy the treasury does not currently pursue such strategy however because it would undermine the other two pr inciples of debt management6 as will be discussed below the other goals of debt management rely on maintaining neutrality predictability and liquidity pursuit of these goals inhibits the treasury from exploiting movements in the yield curve through changes in issuance patterns undoubtedly this leads to higher interest co sts in the short run but some argue that pursuing an aggressive l eastcost strategy would not necessarily lower borrowing costs in the long term us treasuries have lower interest rates than any other asset because they are perceived as safer than any other asset part of this safety derives from their predictability and liquidity and were these features to be reduced by erratic and idiosyncratic issuance pattern s treasuries would be less desirable to investors who would therefore demand hi gher yields to hold them borrowing across the yield curve may also extend the appeal of treasury securities to broaderhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32049crs4 7

9 john berry treasury to stop 30year bond sales washington post nov 1 2001 p e1 10 see crs report rl31235 the economics of the federal b udget deficit by brian cashell 11 borrowing from abroad can offset the loss in american saving but the income from that investment will flow to foreigners rather than americansclass of investors increasing demand for u s treasuries and hence lowering their interest costs7 from debt management perspective the treasury is concerned not only with minimizing the cost of interest payments but also with minimizing the risks associated with uncertain interest payments for example if the treasury borrowed exclusively on shortterm basis its average cost over time would be lower but the volatility of its interest payments would be higher this would lead to larger income transfers from taxpayers to bond owners in years when interest rates are high and smaller transfers in years when rates are low borrowing on longerterm basis reduces interest payment volatility by locking in given interest rate over the life of the bond smoothing the transfers from taxp ayers to bondholders over time issuing 30year bonds again would increase the treasurys ability to smooth interest payments over time8 the argument explained below that in terest payments are not burdensome to the economy as whole since we owe it to ourselves suggests that there is economic rationale for the goal of minimizing interest payments on domestically held debt through variable issuance strategies however valid economic argument can be made in favor of minimizing interest payments for the portion of the national debt owned by foreigners there is also the issue of whether th reintroduction of the 30year bond would impose onetime administrative costs on the treasury at the time of its discontinuation treasury undersecretary pe ter fisher said that the 30year bond could be reintroduced at cost to the treasury9 since there are administrative costs associated with every bond issuance rolling over shortterm bonds in general entails higher administrative costs than issuing longterm bonds however administrative costs are tiny compared to the amounts borrowed effect on the macroeconomy economic theory suggests clear effect of the budget balance on the economy10 in the short run budget deficits may stimu late aggregate spending in the economy particularly if the economy is in recession in the long run deficits reduce the sustainable rate of growth by crowding out private investme nt all else equal11 this reduces us living standards in the long run from what they otherwise would be httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32049crs5 12 benjamin friedman debt management policy interest rates and economic activity national bureau of economic rese arch working paper 830 dec 1981 13 see crs report rl30520 the national debt who bears its burden by marc labonte and gail makinen 14 in this section the term treasuries will be used for statements applying to treasury securities of all maturities and 30year treasury bond will be used for statements specifically applying to the 30year bondby contrast the maturity at which the defi cits are financed is thought to have negligible effect on the economy nd has received little attention from macroeconomists because longterm rates are thought to have greater effect on investment spending than s hortterm rates some macroeconomists have posited that if the government concentrates its borrowing at the short end of the market it can flatten the yield curve by pushing down longterm rates and pushing up shortterm rates they argue that this would lead to more investment spending and hence higher economic growth rate for given budget deficit12 this would argue against the reintroduction of the 30year bond ther does not seem to be much empirical evidence supporting this theory however so if it is correct the effect does not appear to be large furthermore financial markets are more dynamic than their reasoning implies since investment levels are ultimately determined by national saving which is not affected by changes in the yield curve it is not clear why an increase in long term borrowing by corporations would not be exactly offset by decrease in short term borrowing by corporations if this is the case reintroduction of the 30year bond would have effect on private inve stment and hence economic growth it is often argued that the economic burden of the debt comes from the interest payments that must be paid on the debt since these interest payments make taxpayers worse off economists re ject this argument on the grounds that higher interest payments make bondholders qually better off therefore the debt represents transfer from one american the taxpay er to another the bondholder with net effect on the economy in this case reintroducing the 30year bond as means of lowering interest costs the merits of which were analyzed in the previous section would redistribute income from bondholders to taxpayers but would have effect on the nations overall welfare this ar gument does not hold for the approximately onehalf of the national debt held by fore igners however for this portion of the debt proposals to minimize interest costs w ould raise us welfare on net since less us income would be tran sferred to foreign bondholders13 effect on financial markets the last of the treasurys three main prin ciples guiding debt management is the promotion of efficient capital markets us treasuries are popular investment option for wide range of individual and institutional investors many of whom would be pleased to see the 30year treasury bond return14 if this were their only significance then one could not say they had either positive or negative effect on the financial system as whole it is the fact that treasuries play two special roles in financial markets as benchmark and safe haven that makes them of specialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32049crs6 15 gregory

adapted from testimony by treasury assist ant secretary gary gensler before house committee on ways and means june 23 1998importance to the overall f unctioning of the financial system the merits of reinstating the 30year bond are therefore judged in terms of these two roles 1 role of treasuries as benchmark treasuries play an important role in the financial system as financial benchmark treasury benchmark status is manifested in its role in providing info rmation about general market conditions the pricing of other securities relative to treasuries their uni versal acceptance as collateral in myriad range of financial transactions and their underlying role in the creation of other financial in struments such as derivatives treasuries are able to serve as benchmark because of their pr edictability liquidity and riskfree status three features that will be discussed below before the late 1990s the 30year treas ury bond was the preferred security for benchmark status since 30year bond sales dwindled with growing surpluses and ultimately ended the 10year treasury not has replaced it as the new benchmark15 while the role of the benchmark is strong argument in favor of predictable liquid treasuries in general it is unclear whet her returning the 30year bond to that role would have any advantages over mainta ining the 10year treasury note as the benchmark perhaps the fact that when previously given the choice investors preferred the 30year bond to the 10year note as benchmark is evidence that investors would favor its retu rn to the benchmark role 2 role of treasuries as safe haven in times of financial unrest and turmoil large volumes of capital often flow abruptly into treasuries this occurred for example in october 1998 following the russian default16 some would argue that this has stabilizing effect that helps to restore calm to the markets financial turmoil abroad also frequently leads to foreign capital inflows into us treasuries as foreigners look for safe haven for th eir savings although the result of these inflows is an increase in the trade deficit economists tend to believe that on balance foreign capital inflows are advantageous for the us economy since they help to offset the negative effect of the united states chronically low public and private savings rate on private inve stment reinstating the 30 year bond would enhance the role of treasuries as safe haven although the enhancem ent may be marginal since investors already have an array of treasuries at other maturities from which to choose now that the roles played by treasurie s have been defined it is useful to consider how the treasurys debt manage ment policy supports these roles and how the 30year bond fits into this picture to promote efficient capital markets the treasury must pursue number of goals including the following17httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32049crs7 neutrality bond issuance should have minimal effect on the economys natural yield curve accomplished by borrowing evenly across the yield curve liquidity the government should make treasury markets as liquid as possible by standardizing the characteristics of the bonds issued this minimizes short term volatility in bond markets following large issuance or retirement of certain type of treasury bond predictability bond issuances should be announced far in advance and follow predictable pattern for example threemonth bills are auctioned every week and the fiveyear note is issued four times year the rest of this section analyzes how the reintroduction of the 30year treasury bond would affect each of these factors effect on neutrality in the absence of government borrowing the yield curve on private bonds would be deter mined by borrowers needs and lenders preferences leading to an economically efficient outcome maintaining this economically efficient outcome requires that the government borrow in way that minimizes the effect on the marketdetermined yield curve this suggests that the government should borrow evenly across the broadest range of ma turities such that it does not crowd private borrowers out of any portion of the market reintroduction of the 30year bond should help the government to achieve this by increasing its role at the long end of the market and reducin g its effect on the short and medium range of the market furthermore some argue that the very long end of the market is undersupplied by the private sector there is signif icant demand for 30year bonds from private sector participants with longterm liabilities such as banks insurance companies and pension funds there is also significan t foreign demand for longterm government bonds particularly among official institutions such as foreign central banks yet as seen in table 1 there is little supply of very l ongterm bonds from the private sector because most corporations prefer to borrow on shorterterm basis this may be because risk premiums become unprofitably high for corporations that far into the future if the long end of the market is undersupplied reintroduction of the 30year bond can step in and fill the gap between demand and private supply clearly investors with longterm liabilities such as banks insurance companies and pension funds would benefit since it would give th em lower cost method although it is not the only method for hedging against risks related to maturity mismatchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32049crs8 18 benjamin friedman the treasury threatens corporate balance sheets harvard business review septoct 1982 p 20 jonathan fuerbringer us will end

thomson financial securities data provided to crs by the bond market association note total corporate debt includes bonds and commercial paper for this table bonds are defined as all corporate bonds with maturity of one year or greater data in the chart do not include the debt of government sponsored enterprises some argue that this reasoning is b ackwards the reason they argue that private borrowing is limited at the long end of the market is that previous treasury borrowing crowded corporate borrowers out of the longterm market they argue that 30year corporate bonds were more wi despread in the postwar period before 30 year treasuries were introduced in 197718 after the 30year bond was discontinued few corporations such as fannie mae freddie mac and ford did increase their issuance of long term bonds however 30 year bonds comprise only small portion of their total debt as can be seen in table 1 there was big jump in issuance at the long end of the private market in the year the 30year treasury bond was discontinued effect on liquidity one characteristic that makes treasuries unique is that they are significantly more liquid than other financial instruments that is primarily because government borrowing is so much larger than the borrowing of any private corporation as result treasuries are so ld at lower bidask spread than other instruments all else equal greater liquidity reduces price volatility and this reinforces the role of treasuries as risk less asset and benchm ark its high degree of liquidity is also essential to its role as safe haven because investors can move into them quickly without bearing large sses some economists argue that liquid treasury markets enhance general financial market efficiency19 during the surplus years fy1998fy2001 liquidity in the overall treasury market was maintained by focusing new issues in narrower range of maturities and discontinuing new issuances in other maturities such as the 30year bond essentially high liquidity was maintained at few key maturities by sacrificinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32049crs9 20 it should be noted that liquidity is re lative term even if few 30year treasury bonds were issued making them relatively illiquid compared to other treasury securities they could still be more liquid than corporate bonds 21 see crs report rl31414 baseline budget projections discussion of issues by marc labonteliquidity in maturities such as the 30year bond the usefulness of bringing back the 30year bond hinges crucially on two point s first whether enough 30year bonds would be issued to restore liquidity to the 30year market second whether this could be accomplished without sacrificing liquidity in tr easuries of other maturity lengths given the size of current deficits neither should be concern20 effect on predictability predictability is nece ssary characteristic of benchmark and safe haven asset predictability takes many forms such as regular issuances minimal price fluctuation and maintenance of the riskfree status reintroducing 30year treasur ies could enhance or redu ce predictability depending on the size of future budget deficits relatively small ficits could reduce predictability by spreading the treasury market too thin over too many maturity lengths but given the size of current deficits the 30year bond should increase predictability because the issuance of l ongterm debt reduces the unpredictability caused by rolling over debt as discussed above conclusion the efficacy of the decision to rein troduce the 30year treasury bond depends first on the future direction of fiscal policy if future budget deficits are sizable and longlasting as they are proj ected to be under current policy21 then it is as sensible to issue 30year bonds now as it was in th 1980s and 1990s alternatively if the budget moves quickly back to surplus because of future policy changes or errors in budget projections then there would be little purpose in reintroducing the 30year bond and the reasoning behind its disc ontinuation in 2001 would apply again with that qualification if one ssumes that current budget policy w ill follow current projections most analysts see few drawbacks to reintroducing the 30year bond and number of advantages before reviewing the proposed advantages it may be useful to note that if the treasur had deemed them important it presumably would not have discontinue d the 30year bond in 2001 from the perspective of budgetary fi nance the reintroduction of the 30year bond might lower the governments intere st costs this would depend on the government aggressively altering its borrowing patterns as interest rates change however which would be radical depart ure from current debt management policy furthermore since 30year bond yields ar typically the highest of any treasury security the occasions on which issuing 30year bonds would lower costs would be relatively limited specifically they would be limited to times in which interest rates are low and the yield curve is relatively flat or inverted some argue that debt management policy of aggressive costminimization would ultimately be selfhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32049crs10 defeating since the loss in predictability and liquidity would ultimately reduce investor demand raising bond yields there is little persuasive evidence that the reintroduction of the 30year bond could have any effect on ove rall interest rates investment levels or economic growth it is likely that the greatest benef it from reintroducing the 30year bond would lie in its effects on financia l markets assuming future ficits are large enough that reintroduction of the 30y ear bond woul d not result in less liquid markets for treasuries overall there is signifi cant demand for 30year bonds from private sector participants with longterm liabilities such as banks insurance companies and pensions funds there is also si gnificant demand for 30year bonds among foreigners notably foreign central banks yet there is little supply of very longterm bonds from the private sector because mo st corporations prefer to borrow on shorterterm basis by re introducing the 30year bond th government may step in and fill that gap before it was disc ontinued the 30year bond also played an underlying role in certain fi nancial derivatives if issu ed in sufficient quantity the 30year bond could also fulfill the role it prev iously played as financial benchmark now held by the 10year note
