bridge publications inc newsletter date resisting the mest universe now theres rule of thumb used in the mest universe which tells you at once what facsimile is if you want to trap him make him resist it make him resist it and youve got him thetan life unit starts resisting somethinga thingand that if it is mest object of course will resist back because it is following the laws of mest which are newtons laws inertia interaction acceleration life doesnt have to follow those laws at all but it starts fighting mest and it resists mest and then mest resists it and then mest being inanimate and unthoughtful can resist much harder than the individual can resist and the next thing you know the individual has accepted what he has resisted insidious l ron hubbard excerpted from the first international congress of dianeticists scientologists lectures the makebreak point of the tone scale and eating an article by l ron hubbard from the first international congress of dianeticists scientologists lectures theres only one thing for which the whole universe punishes theres only one punishment one crime and that in its fullest sense is communicating thats the one crime putting out an anchor point thats essentially communicating putting out an anchor point is the one thing for which person could get punished which tells you why the people that get to the rank of general and admiral get there its traditional in every army and navy of conservative country that person is advanced in the ration that he doesnt do anything if he commits crimes he gets there and this isnt criticism of it its just the way things operate its just the way things operate it just happens that thats the way it is and they dont want to get well and so we cant do anything about it can we well anyway the only thing that is punishable is putting out an anchor point and so you can tell how often this person has been slugged slapped hit by the reluctance he has in putting out an anchor point but there is another thing here at work it is the remaining the residual potential person has in creation of energy some people have tremendous energycreation capacity and these people can take an enormous slugging around without altering their communication level thats because theyre still up above that break on the tone scale although the energycreation potential might be differentisnt necessarily but might be differentfor every individual on earth there is this similarity amongst all individuals there is point above which they create manufacture and direct their own energy and below which they depend upon energy from exterior sources before they can operate that would be the makebreak line on our tone scale i would hazard that this is well above 20 because it is above eating if you want to run shame out of your preclear just run the shame of eating the shame of having to eat because being in very cocky state of mind knows very well he can create enough energy to run this motor and its only when he goes down tone scale that he has to start eating and he gets hectic you see eating is getting the mockup of somebody else and crowding it into close confines so as to drain the energy out of it thats eating thats stealing somebody elses mockups in order to go on living and its exterior energy so theres theoretical line above thattheoretical line above that by which body would create enough energy to keep on going without eating and i think the stomach feels the main shame about that because this is where shame on eating shows up very remarkably and i have run into little children that as soon as i processed out their general parental behavior around themthe behavior of the parentsparticularly parents forcing them to eat why the child ceased to have any stomach trouble and also ceased to eat to amount to anything at all youd say what tremendous efficiency rise this body has had this child is now getting along on two glasses of milk and couple of pieces of bread day well you figure it out chemically and you say well theres that many calories and theres this and if it were all drained downthere must be lot more energy in milk that we thought there was so that proves hes still getting but you see there is theoretical point where eating doesnt exist well person would be very hightoned he wouldnt be desiring somebody elses mockup excerpted
