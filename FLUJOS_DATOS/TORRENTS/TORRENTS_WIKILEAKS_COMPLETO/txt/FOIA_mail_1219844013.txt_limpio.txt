documentation probably should try before wgcm meeting so that david can present results the near term prediction is mip all by itself so there will be some guidance coming up hopefully in terms of ensemble size for the stuff i was involved in even one run from model was good since it increased the overall ensemble size for multi model means and estimates of variance did you analyze models individually i would be keen to hear from the group is say single 20th c run single natural only run single ghg run useless b much better than nothing vouch for b for things i was involved in but it would be good to know for which applications its gabi tim barnett wrote hi gabiin real hastepeople will use the ar5 data set for impact studies doubt about it so what will they find when they jump insame as we did trying to do the western da work with ar4a very disparate set of numbers 1some models dont give the data one would like 2some models have only 1 realizationwhich makes them useless we found that with multiple realizations one can do statistics with ensemble techniques which give lot more statistical power suggesting 10 member ensembles with less the sn can be smalleg we could not use the gfdl runs very well as they were so noisey and had few 5 realizations 3 daily data is required storage is cheap these days so at least daily data for order 100 years is desired otherwise it is finageled the current downscaling methods save one 4 the 20th century runs need to go to 2015 as suggested by idag we had to stop at 1999 and lost 8 years we would well like to have studies 5 some of the variables we needed to compare with satellite obs were largely missing eg clouds information 6 to mikes pointjust what data is going to be saved 7 i hope potential users of the data aside from the modeling groups get say in what is archived we are to the point now where policy makers want our best guesses as to what will happen in the next 20 years the people who will make those guesses are most likely not in the major model centers i invite david pierce to chip in here as he spend alot of time in the details of the data sets and associated problems sorry to be so hasty but such is life at the moment best tim hi idagies as you probably know proposal for the ar5 experiments is being circulated in the moment with comments due by september 1 this will then be presented at the working group for coupled modelling wgcm meeting in paris which david karoly will attend peter stott and i discussed the draft when i visited last week and we drafted response and suggestions from idag attached please let know if you are ok with this if i dont hear back i assume you are if you suggest changes and if you want us to add another topicconcern i would need this by next thursday to add it to comment from idag to be sent in time and then hopefully david can present this also in paris at the wgcm meeting hope you all had nice summer and still remember our next meeting in planning and your idag tasks gabi ps we were wondering also about forcing and if the forcing issue how stored synchronized should be added however given even some rich modelling groups worry about getting the mandatory experiments through we should however not hope that groups will run more than 1 single forcing set for the 20th century and arguments against synchronizing are that its not feasible for many forcings eg aerosols and that we loose quite bit of information if only single for example set of solar forcings were used and with this open the ar5 up for criticism ideally of course one center would systematically explore all the forcings but i am not sure somebody is planning to do this in that case common set of 20th century forcings may be an advantage based on some eu project forcings are synchronized for some european modeling centers we could draw attention to that if you feel strongly about thisanyway i hesitate to start discussion about this gabriele hegerl school of
