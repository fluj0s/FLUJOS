or simply the discretionary category 4 in addition parate categories currently exist for highway and mass tr ansit spending through fy2003 the other discretionary category has separate budget

act causing violation of one or more of the discretionary spendi ng limits for the ongoing fiscal year under lookback feature any breaches of the limits that occur during the final quarter of the ongoing fiscal year ie july 1september 30 would result in lowering of the applicable limits for the following fis cal year rather than withinsession sequester consistent rule of the sequest ration process has been that any violation of the discretionary spending limits is forced only in the category in which the violation occurs except that breaches of the highway and masstransit outlay limits

the house and senate usually consider at least one supplemental appropriations act during session for th fiscal year that is underway any supplemental appropriations act for fy2002 enacted prior to july 1 that violates thediscretionary spending limits for that fiscal year could trigger withinsessionsequester under the lookback feature of the process the enactment after june 30 of measure violating the limits would require the limits for the succeeding fiscal year to be reduced by the appropriate am ounts as mentioned previously however the limits on most discretionary spending under current law expire at the end offy2002 in may the house and senate appropriations committees reported supplemental appropriations measures amounting to roughly 30 billion hr 4775 s 2551 the measures include emergency designations offsets and othertechniques intended to keep sequester from occurring previous techniques for preventing sequester congress and the president have been able to avoid sequester under the discretionary spending limits since fy1992 by ensuring that annual appropriationsacts were not in violation of the stat utory goals at times congress and the president had to take advantage of flexib ility in the procedures such as the ability to designate certain spending as emergency requirements in order to achieve thisoutcome prior to the fy2002 cycle how ever congress and the president twice prevented sequester that otherwise would have occurred by enacting into lawprovisions that intervened in the normal operation of the process 17 it should be noted that legislative pr ovisions containing such techniques could violate section 306 of the 1974 congressional budget act the section bars theconsideration in the house or senate of any legislation containing subject matterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31193crs10 within the jurisdiction of the respective budget committee unless it has been reported by or discharged from that comm ittee violations of section 306 may be waived typically by special rule in the house or motion in the senate in thesenate such waivers require threefifths majority further the prohibition insection 306 is not selfenforcing member mu st raise point of order to enforce the prohibition congress and the president enacted provision in 2000 with the intent of preventing withinsession sequester unde r the discretionary spending limits for fy2000 additionally significant upward re vision of the discretionary spending limits for fy2001 was enacted to prevent sequester at the end of the 2000 session this action had been assumed in the budget resolution adopted earlier in the yearalthough the revision increased the limits more than had been assumed these two actions are discussed in more detail below fy2000 in the middle of the 2000 session the house and senate attempted to bring action on the fy2000 budget to close by considering supplementalappropriations for the fiscal year in single bill in the house or as elements incorporated into several regular appr opriations bills for fy2001 in the senate eventually the supplemental appropriations for fy2000 were merged into single regular appropriations bill the military construction appropriations act forfy2001 the measure was enacted into law on july 13 2000 as pl 106246 according to omb estimates the non emergency supplemental appropriations included in pl 106246 caused breach in the budget authority and outlay limitsfor the other discretionary category of 2359 billion and 6763 billionrespectively levels in the remaining discretionary spending categories were notchanged by pl 106246 in anticipation that the measure would become law in late june or early july congress had inserted into the bill provision barring sequester which would have been required if enactme nt occurred in june or reduction in the fy2001 limits which would have been requi red because of enactment on or after the july 1 triggering date section 5107 114 stat 582 in title v of division b of the act stated sec 5107 notwithstanding section 251a of the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 as amended there shall be nosequestration under that section to eliminate fiscal year 2000 breach or noreductions in discretionary spending limits for fiscal year 2001 that might becaused by the appropriations or other provisions in this act because the measure was enacted into law in july the lookback feature in section 251 of the 1985 balanced budget ac t would have required that the fy2001 limits for the other discretionary categor be reduced by the amounts of the breach the ultimate effect of the section in p l 106246 therefore was to prevent the reduction in the fy2001 limits fy2001 under the fy2001 budget resolution adopted by the house and senate in april 2000 total discretionary sp ending for the fiscal year was envisioned at about 600 billion in budget authority nd 625 billion in outlays well above the existing statutory limits on such spending and the assumption was made that thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31193crs11 statutory limits would be raised to accommodate the new levels the statutory limits also are adjusted from time to time by the omb director as required by law during the following six months congress considered the regular appropriations acts for fy2001 without enacting the necessary revisions in thediscretionary
