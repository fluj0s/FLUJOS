opm published revised salary tables for 2004 on its website the next day alt hough the federal pay adjustments are sometimes referred to as costofliving ad justments neither the annual adjustment nor the locality payment is based on measures of the cost of living the annual pay adjustment is based on the employment cost index eci which measures change in privatesector wages and salaries the index showed that the annual acrosstheboard increase would be 27 in january 2004 the size of the locality payment is determined by the president and is based on comparison of nonfederal and general schedule gs salaries in 32 pa areas nationwide by law the disparity between nonfedera l and federal salaries was to be gradually reduced to 5 over the years 1994 through 2002 fepc requires that amounts payable may not be less than the full amount necessary to reduce the pay disparity to 5 in january 2004 the federa l salary council and the pay agent recommende d that the 2004 locality payments range from 1945 in the rest of the united states rus pay area to 4764 in the san francisco pay area the payment recommended for the washington dc pay area was 2878 because the new locality rate replaces the existing locality rate the change in cality rates is derived by comparing 2003 locality payments with those recommende d for 2004 this comparison resulted in recommended increases in locality rate s from 2003 to 2004 of 1190 in the rus pay area to 2523 in the san francisco pay area and 1731 in the washington dc pay area the nationwide average net pay increase if the eci and localitybased

phasein of ncs survey data was approved the survey results are submitted to opm which serves as the staff to the federal salary council and the pay agent opm documents federal rates of pay in each of the pay areas and compares nonfederal and gs salaries by grade for each pay area the average salaries at each grade both federal and nonfederal are then aggregated and compared to determine an overall average percentage pay gap for each area by law the disparity between nonfederal and federal salaries is to be reduced to 5 therefore the overall average percentage pay gap for each pay area is adjusted to this level each year by opm this adjusted gap is called the target gap fepca also stipulates that certain percentage of the target gap between gs average salaries and nonfederal average sala ries in each pay area is to be closed each year twenty percent of the gap was closed in 1994 the first year of locality pay as authorized by fepca an additional 10 of the gap was to be closed each year thereafter meaning that 30 of the ga p was to be closed in 1995 40 in 1996 50 in 1997 60 in 1998 70 in 1999 80 in 2000 and 90 in 2001 in each of these years the locality pay increase has

specified that amounts payabl could not be less than the full amount necessary to reduce the pay disparity of the target gap to 5 this percentage is applied to the target gap in each pay area to determine the locality rates r ecommended by the pay agent to the president after receiving advice from the federal salary council23 the pay gaps on which the locality payments are based are 22 months old by the effective date of the adju stment thus march 2002 gaps determine the january 2004 locality payments due to the fact that the ncs surveys were not approved for use in determining the january 2000 janua ry 2001 january 2002 nd january 2003 locality payments and that the ncs survey s are being phased in for the january 2004 locality payments the gaps were determined as follows the march 2002 gaps were determined by using the most recent ocsp survey data and ncs survey data which ranged from december 2000 through october 2001 for each pay area since the bls had discontinued the ocsp program in oc tober 1996 the ocsp pay survey data for some of the largest pay areas were at least seven years old specifically the new york data were as of july 1995 the wa shington dc data were as of october 1995 and the angeles data were as of november 1995 survey data for each of the other 28 pay areas varied from january 1996 to november 1996 the data for the rest of the united states pay area we re as of november 1995 and aged to november 1996 in its report to the pay agent on the 2004 locality payments the federal salary council explaine d how the pay gaps were termined stating that to ensure that local pay disparities are measur ed as of one common date it is necessary to age the bls survey data using the eci to common reference date march 2002 before comparing it to gs pay data of th same date24 report of the fede ral salary council the council reported the following results from the application of this met hodology as of march 2002 the overall gap between gs average salaries excluding existing locality payments special rates and certain other payments and nonfederal average salaries was 3202 the amount needed to reduce this disparity to 5 as mandated by fepca averaged 2573 for 2004 in order to meet the target for closing the pay gap the council recommended locality pay raises ranging from 1945 in th rest of the unite d states rus

area the payment recommended for the washington dc pay area was 287825 because the new locality rate replaces the existing locality rate the change in cality rates is derived by comparing 2003

area and 1731 in the washington dc pay area the nationwide average net pay increase if the eci and localitybased comparability payments were granted as required by law would have been 1515 in 2004 as in previous years the council reco mmended that areas with pay gaps below the pay gap in rus receive the same adju stment as rus under the methodology which has been used since locality pay wa s first implemented in 1994 areas with low publishability did not meet bls standards for publishing data and pay gaps that were twotenths of percentage point 02 or more below rus for three surveys were to be dropped as surveyed discrete pay areas and the resources used to conduct these surveys were to be redirected to ne w survey locations the council as it has done the last four years recommended that these pay areas again be included with rus in 2004 since not all of the improvements have been completed in ncs and because the list of cities below rus varies depending on whether we use ocsp or ncs data we recommend that none of these locati ons indianapolis kansas city orlando st louis be dropped as separate pay areas at this time the council plans to consider whether some of these areas should be dropped and the resources used to increase the sample in other locations or used to add few new locality pay surveys26 basic criteria used to determine whet her county or installation would be included as part of pay area for purposes of applying locality pay were established by the council in 1993 and remain unchanged in its report the council notes that in 2000 and 2001 the council concluded that it would recommend changes in locality pay area defin itions until it had an opportunity to review new commuting pattern and populati on data from the 2000 census and the new metropolitan area definitions to be produced by the census bureau and omb in 200327 other criteria which would remain unchanged are that c ounty be contiguous to pay area contain at least 2000 gs employees and demonstrate some econo mic linkage with the pay area the council recommended an exception however in the case of barnstable county ma which was seeking to become an area of application to the boston pay area according to the council barnstable countyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31823crs8 28 ibid 29 ibid p 4 30 ibid 31 memorandum for the presidents pay agent from the federal salary

bureau of the census data on county size and land area are used in continuedis the only county on the eastern seaboard from southern maine to delaware that is not in separate locality pay area it is also cut off from the remainder of the country by the boston locality pay area and passes all our criteria except that it does not have 2000 gs employees while we do not believe this is the time to make wholesale changes in locality area boundaries the council concluded that something should be done for barnstable county therefore the council as whole voted at its october 1 meeting to recommend that the pay agent make an exception and include barnstable county ma in the boston locality pay area in 2004 in order to remedy what we consider to be an egregious situation the vice chair of the council dissented from this recommendation28 since 1994 st marys county md has been included in the washington dc baltimore md pay area it continues to meet the county criteria and the council recommended that it be included with this pay area for 2004 santa barbara county ca has been included in the angeles pay area since 1994 and new london ct has been included in the hartford ct pay area since 1998 employment in new london ct and santa barbara count ca again has fallen below the threshold of 2000 employees that one cr iterion requires th council recommended in 1997 however that once an area of pplication has been approved it should not be removed for the duration of fepcas nineyear phasein for the locality pay program 1994 through 200229 therefore the counc il recommended that new london and santa barbara continue to be areas of application for their respective pay areas for 2004 the council noted that new census data will soon be available that will affect locality pay area definitions in the future and the office of management and budget omb and the census bureau are revamping how metropolitan areas are defined according to the council it pla ns to conduct major review of all aspects of the locality pay program i n 2003 when this new information is available30 see the discussion under defin ition of metropolitan areas below monterey county ca which became an area of applicati on to the san francisco pay area in 2001 meets the criteria and is recomme nded to be included with this pay area in 2004 the state of rhode island was designated as an area of application to the boston pay area beginning in 2001 b ecause counties in rhode island are small in comparison to counties in other states r hode island cannot meet the requirement that county contain at least 2000 gs employees therefore the council recommended that full state criteria be adopted in this case under the recommended criteria states smaller than 115 percent of the av erage county size in square miles in the lower 48 states and washington dc are treat ed as single county for applying the county criteria thus rhode island is considered as single county31 the

area and significant number of the facilitys employees must be commuting from the pay area since 1994 portion of edwards air force base has been included in the angeles pay area the base longer meets the employment criteri but the council recommended that it continue to be included with the an geles pay area in 2004 for the same reasons that new london and santa barbara were recommended to continue as areas of application methodology32 the council in its report to the pay agent on the 2001 locality payments recommended that five improvements be made in the bls national compensation

and other changes and reports of the working group were discussed at two counc il meetings that were open to th public at the first meeting conducted on september 3 2003 the working group presented

were not approved fo r use in determining the 2000 2001 2002 and 2003 locality payments pr evious survey data from 1995 and 1996 have had to be aged to make them us able for purposes of the locality payments in these years in pl 106554 the consolidated appropriations act 2001 congress noted this situation and directed the presidents pay agent to prepare report for the senate and house committees

budget office measuring differences between federal and private pay washington cbo 2002 r mark musell is the author of the report the report on pp 56 includes the following explanation of the methodology for the pay comparison from the list of occupations that bls bureau of labor statistics surveyed cbo selected specific jobs with large number of federal employees conducting 253 separate comparisons involving 18 jobs and 17 localities the federal salary for each job and geographic area came from the office of personnel management in total about 50000 federal employees work in the jobs and area s covered by cbos analysis the group personnel management consultant provided th privatesector salaries data were drawn from about 500 establishments mostly in tran sportation chemical metal and other goods producing industries little information from state and local governments was included the group provided private salaries fo r jobs that matched corresponding federal employment on the basis of evaluations of th actual work that employees performed by contrast the governments pay comparisons use nonfederal salary data for jobs that match descriptions of federal work cbos approach considers the actual work that is performed 85 ibid pp 78under the methodology section81 improvements to the survey methodology are underway as discussed above the office of personnel management i ssued white paper on compensation in april 2002 which reviewed current policie s and the need for more flexibility in setting general schedule pay but did not include any recommendations82 i n november 2002 study the congressional budget office cbo compared the salaries of federal general schedule employees with the pay83 of nonfederal employees in similar jobs84 the comparison yielded the following results federal employees in selected prof essional and administrative occupations tended to hold jobs that paid less than comparable jobs in private firms for about 85 percent of those federal empl oyees their pay lagged behind private salaries by more than 20 percent by contrast about 30 percent of federal employees in selected technical and cleric occupations held jobs with salaries above those paid by private firms in general jobs in technical and clerical occupations showed much smaller differenc in pay between federal and private workers about threequarters of federal employees in this analysis held jobs in those occupations with salaries that we re within 10 percent plus or minus of private levels85 acknowledging the limitations presented by comparing only selected jobs and localities cbo concluded that the results nevertheless reinforce longstanding concern about the federal pay system it allows variation in pay raises by occupation according to cbo this presentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31823crs23 86 ibid pp 910 87 see the american federation of governme nt employees aflcio bushs budget proposals brazenly ignore the law fe b 4 2003 available on

available on th internet at httpwwwnteuorg choose press releases visited feb 28 2003 88 afge viewsthe potential result that employees in professional and administrative occupations may receive smaller pay raises than those needed to match private salaries for similar jobs and employees in technical and clerical occupations may receive pay raises that are higher than those needed to match salaries in the private sector thus even if the current system was fully implemented as envisioned in fepca it would fail in its aim to provide federal pay that was comparable to pay for nonfederal jobs granting the same percentage raise to all workers in an area will result in abovemarket salaries for some occupational groups and belowmarket salaries for others moreover the jobs that show the greatest pay disadvantage for federal workers make up an increasing share of the federal workforce from 1985 through 2000 for example federal employment in professional and administrative occupations rose from 41 percent to 56 percent of total federal civilian employment86 the cost of fully implementing fepca is another concern the pay agent estimated that the january 2004 localitybased comparability payments would cost 8830 billion if the full amount necessary to reduce the pay disparity of the target gap to 5 as required by fepc were provided in january 2004 employee views the american federation of government employees afge and the national treasury employees union nteu endorse pay parity between federal civilian employees and the uniformed military the unions criticized the presidents proposal on federal pay as inadequate and disregarding of fepca87 according to afge bushs budget issues his standard rationale for failing to uphold the federal employees pay comparability act fepca problems with the department of labors methodology in determining th comparability of federal pay with the private sector yet nowhere does he ev er describe his thodological problems i have asked repeatedly what changes in methodology would you like to implement so that fepca can go fo rward previously the methodological problems appeared to be related to the locality component of federal pay which bush has tried to eliminate for the pa st two years yet this year his methodological problems seem to have spread to the employment cost index eci
