press march 20 2003chapter or such laws relate to the powers function and duties conferred upon the attorney general at least two sets of issues arise the first is determining precisely which powers functions and du ties congress intende dt ot r n s f rt ot h exclusive jurisdiction of dhs the second is determining those areas in which both the attorney general and dhs are to have measure of authority and how those respective authorities interrelate with regard to the first set of issues it is notable that the ina itself still designates the attorney general as the indi vidual responsible for administering most provisions and programs it has been argued that only sectionbysection revision of the ina removing references to the ttorney general whenever the power is effectively held by the secretary will truly clarify the allocation of authorities between the two departments8hr 1416 the homeland security technical corrections act of 2003 reported on may 15 2003 would accomplish this end with respect to 103 and 287g of the ina9according to the house report for hr 1416 the bill improves the homeland secu rity act of 2002 and honors the original intentions of the drafters by making grammatical and technical corrections10 also with respect to the citizenship and immigration services transferred to dhs 456 of the hsa deems any referenc to another component of government in the authorities associated with the citizenship and immigration services transferred to dhs to refer to the director of the bureau of citizenship and immigration services or to the bureau of citizenship and immigration services though issues on the transition of authority may appear less thorny in the long run than issues of shared authority some controversies have arisen for example various news sources and interest gr oups reported that in december of 2002 the attorney general issued an order delegating authority to the federal bureau of investigation to exercise the powers and duties of immigration officers11the order went into effect on february 28 2003 the day before the official transfer of ins from the doj and authorizes special agents of the fbi to investigate determine the

inaina12in effect the order gave over 11000 fb i agents the authority to detain and arrest foreigners on alleged civil immigration charges in cases where its agents lack enough evidence to file criminal charges power once only possessed by immigration officials this expansion of fbi authority by the attorney general was provided in conjunction with the government s efforts to interview the more than 50000 iraqis in the us during operation liberty shield13 under 1034 of the ina the attorney ge neral has the authority to authorize any employee of the doj ie fbi employees to perform any of the duties that are imposed by the ina on employees of the ins14accordingly the attorney general was arguably within his legal capacity to issue this order since the ina had not been modified to effectively eliminate the attorney generals authority to issue such an order in february still such delegation arguably complicated the secretary of dhss anticipated responsibilities in the field of immigration enforcement and possibly raised issues of accountability for example the final rule issued by dhs on march 6 2003 clearly vests all authorities and functions to enforce and administer immigration laws in the secretary thus it appears immigration enforcement by fbi officials instituted by the attorney general after march 6 2003 would run counter to the regulation promulgated by dhs the technical ch anges provided by hr 1416 would apparently eliminate this possible conflict since it would effectively remove the attorney general from position where he may delegate immigration functions to doj officials under hr 1416 ina 1034 would read except as otherwise provided by law the secretary of homeland security may require or authorize any employee of the department of homeland security to perform or exercise any of the powers privileges or duties conferred or imposed by this act or regulations issued thereunder upon any other employee of the department amended provisions in italics shared authority current law clearly contemplat continued roles for both dhs and the attorney general under immigration law for instance all original and appellate jurisdiction over cases

can be on such matters as the imposition of fines granting of bond and granting certain discre tionary waivers historically the bia has been solely an administrative creation of the attorney general the attorney general personally retained ultimate authority to decide cases facts and law alike on request of party or on the attorney generals own initiative while the bia now has firmer statutory

involving aliens seeking to enter the united states illegally16ijs and the bia must consider evidence establishing that significant national security interests are implicated from sources in the executive branch nominally the opinion in in re dj is addressed to decisions made within the context of eoir proceedings however officials within dhs also make bond determinations that may or may not subsequently come before eoir similarly officials within dhs can make asylum decisions with respect to applicants not already in proceedings before an immigration judge while unsuccessful applicants

regulations occurs in background comments regarding temporar protected status tps program in which the attorney general not only grant ed individuals protected status but also designated which nationalities were potentially eligible for such status the background information of the final rule s tates that the duplication should not be viewed as any indication that the depar tment of justice

that of tps the rule indicates that further refinement to clarify the authority transferred to the secretary of dhs and retained by the attorney general will be necessary conclusion on march 1 2003 the department of ho meland security became responsible for securing our nations borders and managing the immigration process in the past these two important missions were bundled together within one agency the immigration and naturalization service under the primary control of the attorney general although 103a1 of the ina h as been amended to reflect this massive transfer of authority the attorney general still apparently retains some authority to affect the practices and procedures utilized by dhs as demonstrated by the aforementioned events while congre ssional measures and administrative clarifications may provide the explicit guidance to clarify delegations of authority such measures appear to demonstrate n eed for the continued cooperation between the two departments
