overnment in cases where the taxpayer has introduced credible evidence on factual issue the provision is found in section 3001 of the act and is codified at irc 7491 background historically the burden of proof has been on the taxpayer in noncriminal ta x disputes this practice arose out of common law and was not statutory edict at1 2 common law there were number of theories for assigning the burden of proof to party among these theories were that the party who has the affirmative issue should have the burden of proof that the plaintiff should have the burden of proof that the party who is alleging disfavored contention should have the burden of proof that the party alleging the least likely scenario should have the burden of proof that t he party with the knowledge about particular issue should have the burden of proof and that the burden of proo f could be allocated by statute 3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20109crs2 saltzman irs practice and procedure 2d ed 1052c 19914 martinez

increases in deficiencies staff of the joint committee on taxation gener explanation of tax legislation enacted8 in 1998 jcs 698 at 5657 nov 24 1998the general allocation of the burden of proof to the taxpayer was justified by several of the common law principles it was generally thought to be appropriate to place th burden on the taxpayer because the taxpayer usually has control of the evidence on th issues in suits for refunds it was thought to be reasonable to require the plaintiff t o4 explain why the taxpayer engaged in the seemingly inconsistent actions of voluntaril overpaying the taxes and then requesting the money back in collection suits brought by5 the government it w as thought to be appropriate to place the burden on the taxpayer for number of reasons one was that to do otherwise would place taxpayer who failed to respond to the governm ents notice of deficiency in better position than taxpayer who paid the taxes and then sued for refund another was that the taxpayer was alleging disfavore d scenario or less likely situation ie the most common scenario is that citizen owes its government so taxes and the government is not in the best position to calculate the taxes due if the citizen disagre ed with the governments calculation then the citizen should prove what the correct amount was finally placing the burden of proof on the taxpayer advanced the goal of making the tax collection system more efficient 6 in practice in noncriminal tax trial the government presented the internal revenue service determination or assessment the irs determination enjoyed rebuttabl presumption that the amount of tax owing was correct if the taxpayer did not appear or did not defend the government would win the case if the taxpayer introduce d sufficient evidence to allow reasonable judge to decide in the taxpayers favor th presumption of correctness was rebutted in order to win the taxpayer had to prove by preponderance of the evidence that the irs determination was incorrect and if th taxpayer was suing for refund the correct amount of the tax the winner of the cas would be the side that established that its interpretation of the facts should prevail ties went to the government since the burden of proof was on the taxpayer there were and are several situations in which the internal revenue code or tax court rules placed the burden of proof on the government but there was genera l7 statutory provision allocating the burden of proof in recent years there seemed to perception that the common law allocation was disadvantageous to individuals and small businesses that were forced to litigate against the irs there also seemed to be feeling8 that litigating against the irs was more like criminal than civil proceeding fo r example representative english made these remarks in urging the adoption of hr 2676 it is stunning but the irs is the only place in the merican system where citizen is guilty until proven innocent traditionally the taxpayer when notified by the irshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20109crs3 143 cong rec h10024 daily ed nov 5 19979 143 cong rec h10031 daily ed nov 5 199710that his tax payments failed in their view to satisfy his tax obligation carried th burden of proof in demonstrating that his tax payment is accurate the presumption is for the irs and against the taxpayer in my view this is just plain wrong 9 mr traficant made similar remarks in america an american citizen accused shall be considered innocent until prove n guilty and the accuser shall carry the burden of proof in that matter where ladies and gentlemen in gods name have the bureaucrats been able to seduce congress over the years to change that provision if it is good enough for mass murderers it should be good enough for mom and dad our taxpayers10 bill provisions section 3001 of the bill added new irc 7491 the general rule is that if taxpayer introduces credible evidence on factual issue in court proceeding dealing with income taxes estate and gift taxes selfemployment taxes or generationskipping taxes then the irs has the burden of proof on that issue credible evidence is according to the conference report hrept 105599 at 240241 the quality of evidence which after critical analysis the court would find sufficien t upon which to base decision on the issue if contrary evidence were submitte d without regard to the judicial presumption of irs correctness the introduction of evidence will n ot meet this standard if the court is not convinced that it is worthy of belief the taxpayer still has to comply with any subst antiation requirements maintain all records required by the code and regulations and cooperate with reasonable irs requests fo r witness information documents meetings and interviews if the taxpayer is not n individual there are maximum net worth requirements corporations trusts an d partnership s with net worth of more than 7 million are ineligible to use this provision this new provision does not override any existing code section which provides for specific burden of proof the new provision always imposes the burden on the irs in two specific situations first if an item of income was reconstructed by the irs solel through the use of statistical information on unrelated taxpayers the irs will have th burden of proof second the irs has the burden of production in court proceeding s where an individual is l iable for penalty addition to tax or additional amount under the code the provision applies to court proceedings arising in connection with examinations commencing after the date of enactment july 22 1998 if there is irs examination the provision applies to court proceedings arising in connection with taxable periods r events beginning or occurring after the date of enactment since taxpayers have to maintain records required to substantiate any item and t cooperate with the irs including providing access to witnesses and records in timelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20109crs4 eg tax court rule 91 requires parties to stipulate to all relevant matters on whic h11 complete or partial agreement can be reached regardless of whether the matters involve fact opinion or the application of law to fact rules 120 124 describe various procedures for decisions without trial including judgment on the pleadings and summary judgment fashion this provision may not have great impact on the c onduct of tax trials many tax11 disputes are settled before trial presumably those kinds of disputes will continue to be resolved as they were before however the shifting of the burden of proof might induce more taxpaye rs to risk the hazards of litigation because the balance of proof would b tilted in their favor shifting of the burden of proo f might induce the irs to favor settling more cases administratively because of the hazards of litigation if the case goes to trial the irs will have to do careful trial preparation with the governm ent bearing the burden of proof the irs will have to produce more and mor credible evidence than the taxpayer the irs will not be able to rely on statistics alone to make its case if neither the taxpayer nor the irs introduces evidence about penalties then the irs will not be sustained on the penalty issue under prior law many of th penalties were automatically calculated an d imposed based on amount owed and length of time the tax was owed because taxpayer cooperation is condition of shifting the burde n of proof taxpayers have at least as great an incentive to cooperate with the irs at the administrative level as they did under prior law it is possible the first part of any court proceeding will involve determination as to whether the taxpayer has cooperated with the irs and which party should bear the burden of proof this could add to the lengt h and complexity of trials and could create new gro und for appealing an adverse decision if the burden is not shifted to the government because of lack of taxpayer cooperation taxpayers would continue to litigate under the same conditions as under prior law if the burden is shifted to the government there may or may not be change in the trial outcomes since it is possible that courts will continue to operate much as they do now retaining presumption of correctness for irs determinations and the requirement that taxpayers produce the evidence over which they have control the shift in the burden of proof may simply mean that ties go to the taxpayer it is possible that shift of the burden of proof may cause the government to become more intrusive in its search fo r evidence and in its demands for cooperation in order to build its case congress may be asked to impose more onerous record keeping req uirements or the irs may impose such requirements on its own authority so that taxpayers could be required to generate an d keep informa tion that the irs might need should litigation arise failure to keep suc h records could give rise to unfavorable presumptions against the taxpayer increase d intrusive ness and increased record keeping burdens could affect all taxpayers not jus t those with tax disputes they are litigating against the government
