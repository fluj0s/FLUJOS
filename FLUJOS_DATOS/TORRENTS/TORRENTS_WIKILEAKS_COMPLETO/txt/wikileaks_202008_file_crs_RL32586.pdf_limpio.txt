american law divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32586paleontological resources preservation act proposal for the management and protection of fossil resources located on federal lands summary approximately 30 of the land in the united states is under the control of federal land managers much of this public land is rich in paleontological fossil resources concern has been expresse d over the management conservation and protection of these resources there is comprehensive statute or management policy for the protection or management of fossils located on fede ral lands federal authority for the management of such resources may be derived from number of general statutes relating to the protection of public propertie s the applicability of some of these statutes such as the antiquities act and the archeological resources protection act is uncertain or limited general authority for fossil protection also may be derived from general criminal theft statutes dealing with the theft of government property and from certain sitespecific statutes there may also be certain regulatory authority which is provided by the statutes governing each agencys operations in may 2000 the secretary of the interi or released comprehensive report concerning the management of fossils whic h are located on federal and indian lands the report was prepared at the request of congress and it is considered to be the authoritative study of fossils on these lands it has served as an impetus for federal legislation the report outlined seven prin ciples for the effective management of fossils which are located on federal land legislative activity concerning the prot ection of fossils located on federal lands has occurred in both the 107th and 108th congresses there have been two types of legislation one type deals with specific fossil resources at particular location the other type provides comprehe nsive management and prot ection authority for fossils located on federal lands in the 108th congress the senate passed s 546 the paleontological resources preservation act the bill has been referred to two house committees hr 2416 similar bill has been introduced in the house the two bills provide comprehensive approach to the management of fossils on federal lands providing uniform definitions pub lic programs specific prohibitions permit procedures and civil and criminal penalties the bills would not modify the general mining or reclamation laws or apply to lands other than federal landshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32586contents background and introduction 1 current

present time considerable interest commercial scholarly and legislative surrounds fossil resources1 this interest is heightening concern among federal land managers scholars legislators and the general public for the protection and management of fossil resources on fe deral lands vast tracts of land under federal management2 are rich in fossil resources and some of these resources have been and are being vandalized andor stolen with the growing interest in and commercial value of paleont ological resources resour ces on federal lands are increasingly jeopardized3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32586crs2 4 three of the big four land management ag encies are located within the department of the interior bureau of land management fish and wildlife service and national park service the fourth the forest service is in the department of agriculture other federal entities which have some oversightmanagement of fossil resources are the bureau of reclamation us geological survey and department of defense the smithsonian institution while not land management entity curates large fossil collection much which came from federal lands 5 for example federal land manager may have to deal with such issues as the protection and management of wildlife the management and protection of mineral and other valuable natural resources the safety of visitors the occurrence of natural disasters such as flood fire and hurricane and many other issues law enforcement staff in national park may have to deal with such varied issues as 1 protection of archaeologi cal paleontological and other natural resources 2 lost or injured vi sitors 3 general law enforcement activities such as policing drunk driving drug trafficking and other illegal acts 6 108th cong 1st sess 2003 passed the senate on july 17 2003 7 108th cong 1st sess 2003 8 this report does not consider fossil resources within the context of fossil energy issues the report does not examine in detail the cu lturalhistoricaltourist interest in fossil resources which visitors to federal lands may havethere is somewhat limited statutory and regulatory authority for the protection and management of fossil resources on fe deral lands protec tion and management authorities and policies vary significantly among federal land management agencies and other federal entities4 also federal land mana gers have many other management responsibilitie s in addition to the protecti on of fossil resources and the staff law enforcement or paleontologi cal assigned to the management and protection of fossil resources may be somewhat limited or at times may be focused on other land management issues5 caselaw on fossil protection is not we ll developed and is not necessarily consistent and statutory authority is incomplete there is comprehensive legislation regulating federal fossil resources as there is comprehensive management andor pr otection legislation the role of law enforcement personnel in the protection of fossils ma not be clearly defined legislation is currently pending in the 108th congress which is intended to improve the protection and management of paleontological resources on federal lands the proposed paleontological resources preservation act s 5466 and hr 24167 addresses number of significant pr otection and management issues this report examines these issues and pr ovides some background on current laws regulations and mana gement practices8 the report is limited to issues associated with the federal management of fossils located on federa l land it does not examine any state or local regulation of fossil res ources located on state or municipal lands and it does not consider the regulations ownership or c ontrol of fossil located on private property nor does the report anal yze the management of fossils located on indian lands the report will be updated as circumstances warranthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32586crs3 9 under most circumstances there is

resources which are located on federal lands again there is currently comprehensive federal statute concerning the regulation management and preservation of fossil resources on federal lands9 fossils in several sites are regulated by site specific statutes10 and regulations11 but the sites represent only fraction of the fe deral resources portions of some more general laws may apply to fossil protection in limited circumstances but coverage here remains spotty at best some laws that may apply are cited and summarized below in addition federa l land management agency policies concerning fossil resources vary considerably which furthe r complicates the management situation the antiquities act of 1906 act12 authorizes the president to declare objects of historic or scientific interest located on lands owned or controlled by the united states to be national monuments although the statute makes specific reference to fossils national monuments have been created in order to protect fossil resources13 when fossil resources are in national monument managed by the national park service as mo st national monuments are the relevant regulations penalties and prohibitions applicable to the national park system may be utilized to manage and protect the fossils also presidential declarations aside certain statutes have created na tional monuments and have expressly protected fossil resources located within them14 the act provides criminal penalties for any person who removes or destroys any object of antiquity without regard to which federal agency manages the lands15 person convicted under this provision may be fined not more than 500 or imprisoned for period of not mo re than ninety days or both16 section 3 of the act 1 authorizes the secretaries of the interior

promulgate d which divide jurisdiction over the lands among the three secretaries18 however despite the references in the act to objects of scientific interest and the use of the act to proclaim national m onuments to protect fossils there is some uncertainty how the act has been applied with respect to fossil resources themselves enforcement actions involvi ng application of the act to the removal or destruction of fossil resources as an object of anti quity have been located court decision discussed below has further lessened the effectiveness of the act to protect fossil resources still the act remains the only specific legislation with criminal sanctions that may cover paleontological materials on federal lands19 the archeological and historic preservation act of 197420 provides means for the survey removal protection and pr eservation of certain resources or data impacted by federally funded construction projects incl uding dam construction and the alterations of terrain21 the legislation provides for the preservation of historical and archeological data incl uding relics and specimens22 these provisions are applicable when federal c onstruction project or federa lly licensed project activity or program may cause the loss or destruction of significant scientific prehistorical historical or archaeological data23 it is unclear whether these provisions apply to fossil resources per or whether the fo ssil resources have to be connected with other historical or archaeolo gical data or resources as the provisions are rather broadly written it could be argued that fossil resources might fit into either the significant scientific or the prehistorical categories the statute does not provide punitive measures for noncompliance th ere appears to be clear precedent in applying the provisions of this legislation to fossil resources the archaeological resources protection act of 1979 arpa24 protects against the unauthorized removal of archaeological objects located on federal or indian lands however paleontological resources are specifically excluded from the definition of archaeological resources fo r the purposes of the arpas coverage unless the fossil resources are specifically associated with an archaeological site25httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32586crs5 26 pl 100691 102 stat 4546 1988 codi fied at 16 usc 4301 to 4310 27 16

protected cave resource the fcrpa states that the term cave resource includes any material or substance occurring naturally in caves on federal lands such as animal life plant life paleontological deposits sediments minerals speleogens and speleothems27 fcrpa does not define the term paleontological deposits nor is the term clarified in regulations at the same time fcrpa provides comprehensive

disposal without authorization of anything of value belonging to the united states may be app lied to the unauthorized removal of fossils from federal lands the national park services natural resources reference manual 77 states these statutes theft of govern ment property law were first applied to stolen federal fo ssil resources in the mid1990s with few highlypublicized pr osecutions these statutes could become effective at deterring future theft of fossils on nps and other federal lands33 one who steals government property or r eceives stolen property knowing it to have been stolen can be fined under title 18 impri soned up to ten years or both if the value of the property does not exceed 1000 the person may be fined under title 18 imprisoned for not more than one year or both it also may be possible for the united states to protect its fossil resources by instituting trespass action for the unauthorized use of its land and resources certain federal statutes address specific ty pes of trespass and pr ovide for associated penalties34 for example 18 usc 1863 provides for fine of not more than 500 or imprisonment for not more than six m onths or both for whoever

to federal property the most significant source of federal authority to oppose trespass to its property is that which the federal g overnment enjoys as property owner36 at common law the unauthorized entry of the land of another is trespass and the united states can stop trespasses on its lands37 the government could seek to recover the value of the public property unlawfully appropriate d however this course of action does not seem to have been used in the context of the unauthorized taking or use of fossil resources from fede ral lands on some federal lands such as those managed by the bureau of land ma nagement certain state law also may provide an alternative enforcement remedy38 report of the secretary of the interior fossils on federal indian lands the secretary of the interior issued report concerning the current collection storage and preservation of fossils in may 2000 pursuant to request contained in senate report 105227 for the fy1999 interior and related agencies

as the smithsonian institution in addition the us geological survey contribut ed to the report this report is considered the authoritative study and analysis of the issue40 the federal entities

pp 1921 46 id at pp 2124principle 1 fossils on federal lands are part of americas heritage actions concerning fossils should reaffirm the current use of federal fossils for scientific education and where appropriate recreational values41 principe 2 most vertebrate fossils are rare actions regarding fossil management should reaffirm the restriction on collec ting vertebrate fossils to qualified personnel fossils should remain in federal ownership in perpetuity42 principe 3 some invertebrat and plant fossils are rare actions regarding fossil management should reaffirm mission specific approaches to the management of plant and invertebrate fossils43 principle 4 penalties for foss il theft should be strengthened legislative and administrative actions should penalize the theft of fossils fro m lands under federal jurisdiction in such way as to maximize the effectiveness of prosecutions and to deter future thefts in determining penalties the value of the fossils themselves as well as any damage resulting from their illegal collection are to be taken into account strategies should emphasize edu cation of federal ma nagers prosecutors law enforcement personnel and the judiciar regarding the value of fossils and the means and techniques for the appropria protection of fossil resources44 principle 5 effecti ve stewardship requires accurate information actions should recognize the need for accumulatin g and analyzing information about the location of fossils especially the importa nt role of inventory in the effective management of fossil resources increas ed emphasis on fossil inventory should take into consideration regional approaches across agency lines and utilize modern technology in protecting fossil inventory agencies could exa mine specific issues such as the impact of erosion on the loss of resources45 principle 6 federal fossil collections should be preserved and available for research and public education actions should affirm the importance of the curation of scientifically valuable fossils as the property of the federal government but also allow for partnership with non federal institutions approaches should emphasize the use of modern technolog to improve fossil curation and access there should be sharing of information among government agencies and private businesses46 principle 7 federal fossil manageme nt should emphasize

federal government does not have the same rights of ownership or contro l over indian lands that it exercises over non indian lands the bia manages fossils as trust resource and is limited to approving leases of indian lands or agreements between indian landowners and third parties for the extraction of fossils 49 interior report at pp 813 page referen ces are to the web version of reportthe use of technology to increase the public education and awareness of the importance and the benef it of fossil resources47 the report separately considered the ma nagement of fossils which are located on indian lands48 the report set out four management goals to safeguard the intellectual and educational value of fossils and to promote their public benefits49 the first management objective involves field inventory monitoring and protecting of fossils because of different levels of acreage staff and fossil resources as well as different legislative mandates federal land management agenci take somewhat different approaches to performing invent ories and monitoring the fossil resources on land that they oversee consequently only few national parks have completed comprehensive fossil resource inventories the second management object i nvolves collection requirements the priorities in collecting scientifi cally significant fossils are based on research and education where fo ssils are located is significant agencies must also consider the impact of fossil collection on the entire environment taking into account such other factors as the presence of endangered species and related cultural resources the third management objective concerns the storage and preservation of fossils fossils are placed in museums in order to keep them safe maintain their physical condition keep the fossils and the related information together and make the fossils and their context readily available for study and for present and future educational and interpretative programs the fourth objective of fossil management concerns the management of information at the present time there is systematic approach for sharing fossil related information among agencies the report recommended that there should be greater opportunity to exchange information involving fossil resourceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32586crs9 50 499 f2d 113 9th cir 1974 51 the statute provides that any person who sh all appropriate excavate injure or destroy any historic or prehistoric ruin or monument or any object of antiquity on lands owned or controlled by the government of the unite d states would be subject to criminal prosecution and punishment 52 jurists law enforcement personnel nd legal commentators concur that the diaz holding effectively voided certain criminal penalty and enforcement portions of the antiquities act in these states the diaz holding was also contributing factor to the enactment of arpa in 1979 since the traditional protection prov ided by the antiquities act was longer available in the ninth circuit see hutt at 2327 53 499 f2d at 114 54 idcaselaw only few reported cases deal with foss il resources located on federal lands and related issues and they do not provide consistent or dispositive analysis of the applicability of existing federal preservation laws to fossil resources the few reported cases tend to be subject specific and may not have broad applicability to fossil protection issues many prosecutions for fossil theft are not published in the legal case reporting system so that it is difficult to develop broad overview of enforcement and legal analysis perhaps the leading case illustrating the state of current law as an enforcement tool is united states v diaz 50 which dealt with the application of the antiquities act act in criminal context the ninth circuit found that the language of the act51 was unconstitutionally broad the court noted that the act did not define such terms as ruin monument or object of antiquity the impact of this decision effectively ended the use of the act as means of prosecution for the theft andor destruction of archaeological objects located on federal lands throughout the ninth circuit which includes the states of aska arizona califor nia hawaii idaho montana nevada oregon and washington52 while the case did not involve fossil resources per the courts findings proba bly ended the possible application of the act to fossil resource protection and manage ment in the above states the court determined that congress had inadequately defined the term object of antiquity and that the term could have diffe rent meanings to different people53 it also found that the term antiquity not only referred to the age of an object but also to ceremonial function of the object therefore the court determined that the use of undefined terms of uncommon usage in the act was fatally vague and impeded the statutes ability to provide adequate notice and resulted in violation of the due process clause of the constitution54httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32586crs10 55 in the 107th congress two types of legislation were introduced 1 site specific legislation to create particular

received in the house on july 28 2003 and referred to the committee on resources and the committ ee on agriculture further action has been takensummary of pending legislation the 2000 interior report has served as an impetus for legislation establishing comprehensive management and protection requirements55 the bill that has received the most attention in the 108th congress is s 546 the paleontological resources preservation act s 546 passed the sena and has been referred to the house resources and agriculture committee56 following is summary of the most significant provisions of the legislation section 2 provides relevant definitions of terms including casual collecting secretary federal lands indian lands state and paleontological resource the casual collecting definition provides noncommercial exception to allow the random collection of fossil materials from certain federal lands section 3 directs the secretaries of interior and agriculture the secretaries to manage

awarene ss of paleontological resources section 5 prohibits an indivi dual from collecting paleontological resources from federal land wit hout permit however casual collecting of common invertebra and plant paleontological resources for scientific educational and r ecreational uses without permit on certain federal lands is per mitted under certain circumstances resources collected from federal lands remain the property of the united states section 6 requires that such resour ces and related information are to be placed in an approved repository section 7 makes it crime to 1 excavate remove

2003 further action has been takenillegally removed from federal lands or 3 sell or purchase paleontological resource if th person knew or should have known such resource to have been illegally removed from federal lands section 8 authorizes the assessment of civil penalties hr 241657 is substantially similar to s 546 the primary differences are that hr 2416 contains statement of findings and purposes sets out different penalty schedule and contains specific provi sions on rock collecting in national forests conclusion the public lands of the united states possess significant paleontological fossil resources the federal government mana ges some 30 of the land in the united states and fossil management is only one of many fede ral land management responsibilities there is comprehensive statute or ma nagement policy for the protection and management of fossils which are located on federal lands federa l authority for the management of such resour ces may be derived from num ber of statutes relating to the protection of public prope rties the application of some of the statutes is uncertain and the usefulness of the an tiquities act of 1906 act is limited in light of the diaz decision which found the criminal penalty provisions of the act to be unconstitutionally vague generally the archaeological resources protection act of 1979 and the native america graves protection and repatriation act are not applicable to fossil resources general au thority for fossil prot ection may be derived from general criminal theft statutes dealing with the theft of government property and from certain specific statutes such as the federal cave protection act there may also be some regulatory authority provided by statutes governing each agencys operations in may 2000 the secretary of the interi or released comprehensive report concerning the management of fossils locat ed on federal and indian lands the report was prepared at the request of congress nd it is considered to be the authoritativehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32586crs12 source on federal fossils it has served as an impetus for federal legislation the report outlined seven principles for the effective management of federal fossils there has been legislative activity in both the 107th and 108th congresses concerning the protection of fossil resour ces located on federal lands there have been two types of legislation one deals w ith specific fossil resources at particular location and the other provi des comprehensive manageme nt and protection authority for fossils located on federal
