reality in the balkans but one still with many uncertainties the ethnic albanian majority in kosovo and the kosovo government view i ndependence as the fulfillment of long held goal the united states france nd the united kingdom were among the first countries to recognize kosovo and have since been joined by total of over forty countries worldwide thes and other countries have pledged to support kosovo through new international ssions and financial assistan ce an international donors conference is scheduled for july 11 on the other hand serbia and russia vehemently oppose kosovos secession and have warned of dangerous and far reaching consequences the kosovo serb minor ity as well as leaders in serbia insist that kosovo is serbia and have pl edged never to recognize kosovos independence on the ground postindependence tensions have been greatest in the northern part of kosovo wher many ethnic serbs are concentrated kosovos serbs have largely boycotted participation in kosovo s institutions serbian protesters have frequently confronted and nato for ces on the kosovoserb border and in the northern half of the town of mitrovica the worst clash to date took place on march 17 in the aftermath of serb attempt to occupy government building in northern mitrovica unmik and nato arrests of the ccupiers prompted clashes with rioters which resulted in the death of police officer and

the time being secr etarygeneral ban kimoon has called for reconfigured presence with the eu taking on enhanced responsibilities us and european officials have empha sized their wish for friendly relations with serbia while appealing for restrain t in belgrades actions in response to kosovo particularly with resp ect to apparent serbian effo rts to harden partition in kosovo or engage its security personnel di rectly in kosovo affairs most observers recognize that for the time being the new situation presents serious strain in relations with serbia especially in the aftermath of february riots in belgrade in which violent demonstrators set fire to the us embassy and other european embassies nearby at the same time the european union has moved to advance serbias track toward eu accession in an effort to bolster support for proeuropean political forces in serbia us policy overview in 1998 and 1999 the united states and its nato allies attempted to put an end to escalating violence between ethnic albanian guerrillas and yugoslav forces in the federal republic of yugoslavias kos ovo region they were outraged by serb security forces atrocities against ethnic albanian civilians and feared that the conflict could drag in othe r countries and destabilize the region these efforts culminated in 78day nato bombing campaign against serbia from march to june 1999 yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic ag reed to withdraw his forces from the province in june 1999 clearing the way for the deployment of us and other nato peacekeepers while natos action ended milosevics depredations in kosovo it left us and other western policymaker s with many difficult issues including creating the conditions for the resumpti on of normal life in kosovo setting up autonomous governing structures and be ginning reconstruction of the wartorn province the thorny issue of kosovo s final status also loomed as critical unfinished business with important ramifications for stability in the entire western balkan region after several years us policymakers began to emphasize the need to resolve unfinished business in the balkans especially with respect to viable political settlement for kosovo in 2006 and 2007 us officials made re peated statements against maintaining an unstable status quo and in favor of resolving kosovos status in order to achieve longstanding us goals for europe whole free and at peace since 2007 president bush and other top us officials have publicly expressed us support for kosovos independence s ee us policy section below over the years us engagement in kosovo has at times been controversial proponents of us engagement say that in stability in kosovo could have negative impact on the stability of the balkans and therefore of europe as whole which they view as vital interest of the united states they believe instability in the region could produce an environment favorable to organized crime and terrorism andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31053crs3 undermine us goals of euroatlantic in tegration and coopera tion they say the ongoing involvement of the united states is critical to ensuring this stability because of its resources and unrivaled political credibility in the region increasingly many observers on both si des of the atlantic emphasize that europe has larger stake than the united states in stability in southeastern europe and that european nations should lead in ternational efforts in kosovo some critics of us engagement in the balkans say th at the situation in kosovo does not have as large an impact on vital us interests as other issues particularly the war on terrorism in the wake of the september 11 terrorist attacks on the united states and the war in iraq as well as host of other foreign policy and national security challenges reflecting international focus on the global antiterrorism campaign and other priorities there has app eared strong interest in finishing the job including an eventual exit strategy for the international civil and military administration of kosovo however residual international civ ilian and military role with an ongoing nato and us presence including an ongoing commitment of us resources is likely to stay on for some time after independence to assist with and supervise kosovos transition war in kosovo february 1998june 1999 although the war in kosovo had deep hi storical roots its immediate causes can be found in the decision of milosevic reg ime in serbia to eliminate the autonomy of its kosovo province in 1989 the regime co mmitted widespread human rights abuses in the following decade at first m eeting only nonviolent resistance from the provinces ethnic albanian majority ho wever in 1998 ethnic albanian guerrillas calling themselves the kosovo liberation army kla began attacks on serbian police and yugoslav army troops the milo sevic regime responded with increasingly violent and indiscr iminate repression from febr uary 1998 until march 1999 conflict between the kla and serb forces as well as armed serb attacks on ethnic albanian civilians drove more than 400000 people from their homes and killed more than 2500 people the united states and other western countries used sanctions and other forms of pressure to try to persuade milosevic to cease repression and restore autonomy to kosovo without success the increasing deterioration of the situation on the ground led the international contact group united states britain france germany italy and russia to agree on january 29 1999 on draft peace plan for

democratic party of kosovo pdk headed by hashim thaci another significant although smaller exkla group is the allia nce for the future of kosovo aak led by ramush haradinaj the ldk initially lost some

ldk victory with 58 of the vote provincewide the pdk won 273 and the aak 77 kosovo serbs boycotted charging that unmik and kfor have been ineffective in protec ting them from ethnic albanian violence in may 2001 unmik issued constituti onal framework for provisional self government in kosovo it called for the establishment of 120seat legislature which elects president and prime minister twenty seats were reserved for ethnic minorities including ten for serbs but serbs were not granted veto power on laws passed by the ethnic albanian majority in the body unmik retained oversight or control of policy in many areas including w enforcement the judiciary protecting the rights of communities monetary and budget policy customs state property and enterprises and external relations unmik could

initially re fused to join the government saying they wanted greater representation but finally agreed to do so in may 2002 after unmik agreed to appoint kosovo serb as an advisor on refugee returns kosovo held its second local elections on october 2002 turnout for the vote was 54 lower than in the previous two elections observers attributed the low turnout to disillusionment with the perfo

29 and the aak 855 serb turnout was particularly w at about 20 almost serbs voted in the troubled northern town of mitrovica where local authorities intimidated potential voters among those serbs who did vote in the elections the moderate povratak return coalition did poorly while hardline parties did well these results may have reflected continuing serb dissa tisfaction with their situation in kosovo and with the failure of serb moderate s to improve it in march 2004 accusations that local serb s were responsible for the drowning death of two ethnic albanian boys near th divided city of mitrovica erupted into violent demonstrations and attacks on several ethnic serb enclaves throughout the province large crowds of ethnic albanians came out in droves and set fire to serb homes churches and property in several cities and nato personnel evacuated some ethnic serbs to protected enclaves but could not hold back the crowds or counter the destruction the two days of violence on march 1718 2004 constituted the worst flareup of interethnic violence since the end of the 1999 kosovo war according to unmik the twoday period resulted in the death of 19 civilians injuries to more than 900 persons incl uding international peacekeepers and the displacement of over 4000 pe rsons mainly serbs from their homes in addition about 30 churches and mona steries 800 houses and 150 ve hicles were destroyed or seriously damaged and other interna tional officials assessed that the attacks came about in part spontaneously and in part as result of an orchestrated campaign by extremist
