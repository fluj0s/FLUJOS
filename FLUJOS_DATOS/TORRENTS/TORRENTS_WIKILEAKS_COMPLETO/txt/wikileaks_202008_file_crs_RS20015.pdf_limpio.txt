resources policy division summary in 1935 the public utilities holding company act puhca was enacted to eliminate unfair practices and other abuses by electricity and natural gas holding companies by requiring federal control and regulation of interstate public utility holding companies these abuses arose from the inability of individual states to effectively regulate the financial transactions of multistate and multilayered utility companies that evolved in the 1910s and 1920s puhca remained virtually unchanged for 50 years until the enactment of the public utility regulatory policies act purpa enactment of purpa and the energy policy act of 1992 epact increased compe tition in the electric generating sector by creating new entities that gene rate and sell electricity at wholesale without being regulated as utilities under p uhca success of these re gulatory entities was made possible by new technologies such as gas combinedcycle turbines as result of increasing competition in the industry so groups are calling for additional puhca reform or repeal comprehensive legislati on to restructure the electric utility industry including puhca reform was introduced in the 105th congress and the issue is expected to continue to be active in the 106th congress this report provides background informati on on puhca including its history and impact it also discusses how puhca

than reciprocating engines produced change of corporate structure at the same time that economies of scale encouraged utility consolidation utilities were acquiring increasing numbers of subsidiary companies some with little or relation to the utilities primary business from 1900 through 1920 the number of private electric sy stems grew from approximately 2800 to 65001 starting in 1920 the number of private electric systems declined dramatically prima rily because of consolida tion and pyramiding of utilities through holding companies not only did many operating utilities in diverse parts of the country come under the control of small number of holding companies but those holding companies themselves were owned by other holding companies as many as ten layers separated the top and bottom of some pyramids by 1932 three groups controlled 45 of the electricity gene rated in the united states although more than twothirds of th states had public utility commissions of varying powers by 1920 none of these entities had the economic regulatory power of modern public utility commission the state public u tility commissions were unable to control the multistate nature of holding companies prior to enactment of the public utilities holding company act of 1935 puhca electric and gas holding companies were characterized as having excessive c onsumer rates high debttoequity ratios selfdealing and increasingly unreliable servi ce holding company parent was able to charge its associated utilities exorbitant am ounts for services such as construction of facilities fuel supply or billing excessi ve fees charged to operating companies were passed through to consumers as higher rates holding companies incurred increasing amounts of debt to finance their interests in growing number of subsidiaries the economics of generating and transmitting elect ricity had changed dramatically since 1900 economies of scale were not been taken advantage of and the marginal costs the cost of each additional unit of genera tion were less than averag cost the classic monopoly situation existed most highly leveraged holding companies that managed to stay solvent during the prosperous 1920s collapsed after the stock ma rket crash because they could not service their debt lower demand for electricity resu lted in inadequate revenue to meet fixed obligations as more and more companie s went bankrupt service deteriorated while there were advantages to the holding company structure holding company abuses became apparent after the stock mark et crash in 1929 when investors lost millions of dollars during the sevenyear period between 1929 and 1936 53 holding companies with combined securities of 17 billion went into bankruptcy or receivership twentythree

and frequently menace to the invest or or the consumer or both as noted earlier holding companies ope rated with federa l and little state regulation the state utility commissions lacked sufficient authority and resources to control holding companies because companies operated generally in many states and had extremely complex structures the federal government decided regulatory ac tion was required the federal power act which established federal utility regulatory system was enacted at the same time as the p ublic utility act of 19354 these two acts were intended to work in tandem title

that registered holding companies and their subsidiaries must have sec approval prior to issuing securities operating utilities are forbidden from making loans to their parentholding company all loans and interc ompany financial transactions are regulated by the sec the operations of nonexempt holding companies are limited to single and integrated public utility systems and to such businesses that are reasonably incidental or economically necessary or appropriate to the operations of such integrated systems and nonexempt holding companies that are subject to sec regulation must maintain certain accounts and records which are subject to sec review the sec does allow companies to operate in several areas if this preserves the economy of operation or if the areas are located in single state adjoining states or contiguous foreign country and providing that the cr eation of such holding company does not inhibit efficient operation or effective regulation httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20015crs4

most holding companies are exempt from puhca because they operate intrastate under section 3a1 holdi ng company may be exempt from puhca if its business operations and those of its subsidiaries occur within one state exemption under section 3a2 can be granted when the holding company is public utility that operates within the state in which it is organized or within contiguous states holding companies can gain exemption from p uhca under section 3a1 or 3a2 unless the sec determines that such an exemption would be detrimental to the public interest or the interest of investors or consumers an exemption can also be revoked by the sec for the same reason companies that are cons idered exempt from puhca are still subject to state regulation holding companies th at are registered under puhca engage in interstate activity andor they are diversified into industries other than electricity and gas as of november 1 1997 151 holding compan ies with total ssets of 444 billion are exempt by

economies of scale argument which was once used as rationale for monopoly situation longer exists comprehensive legislation to restructur the electric utility industry was introduced in the 105th congress and is expected to c ontinue to be an active issue in the 106th congress proposals to increase competition in the electric utility industry involve segmenting the industry into three functions generation transmission and distribution generation would be subject to competition while transmission and distribution would be subject to federal and stat regulation respectively this type of restructuring would permit retail consumers to c hoose their electricity generators in addition most comprehensive electric utility restructuring legislation addresses purpas mandatory purchase requirements and re tail competition as well as p uhca reform see crs issue brief ib10006 electricity the road toward restructuring as the restructuring debate has evolved utilities and the sec have called for reform or repeal of puhca asserting that puhca has achieved what it wa s designed to do and it is argued puhca discourages competition ca lls for puhca reform are not new in the 1980s utilities sought to diversify in orde r to exploit the bene fits of independent power producers under purpa in 1982 the sec reco mmended to congress that puhca be repealed repeal legislation was not passed in the 1980s in part due to concerns about consumer protection in 1995 the sec concluded study of the regulation of public utility holding companie s the sec called for conditional repeal of the public utility holding company ac t with transition period the sec believes that the act puhc continues to play role in protecting energy consumers most importantly th sec can obtain audit and oversee multistate holding company systems books and records particularly in regard to affiliate transactions past efforts to repeal the act were unsuccessful largely because they failed to account for the continuing importance of this aspect of the regulatory scheme in following the repeal option prefe rred by the division sec congress would repeal the holding company act including its limits on financing and geographic and business dive rsification at the same time congress would enact new provisions to ensure access to books and records required for the effective discharge of states regu latory respons ibilities and to establish federal audit authority and oversight of intrasystem transactions the task of carrying out these provisions logically should be given to the federal agency that most directly protects energy consumers the federal energy regulatory commission8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20015crs6 8 continued httpwwwsecgovnewsstudiespuhctxt 9 for the views of edison electric

http wwwc itizenorgcmeprestructuringpuhcaotherssayhtmthe main argument for puhca reform has been that its provisions are antiquated and puhca has already achieved its goal by making holding companies manageable moreover it is argued that various other re gulations since puhcas enactment have been instituted to prevent holding company abuse an additional argument for puhca reform has been made by electric utilities that want to further diversify their assets electric utilities contend that reform would allow utilities to improve their risk profiles through diversification in much the same way as in other businesses the risk of any one investment is diluted by the risk associated with all investments utility holding companies that have been exempt from sec regulation argue that puhca discourages diversification because the sec could repeal exempt status if the exemption would be detrimental to the public interest also it is argued that puhca places consumers at disadvantage by inhibiting compe tition in the electric utility industry9 opponents of puhca repeal including some consumer groups state regulators the american public power association10 and small busin ess groups argue that until the industry completes its transition to co mpetitive market puhcas regulations are needed to protect consumers11 arguments against stand alone puhca repeal include concerns over market power large utilities with numerous marketadvantages could inhibit competition puhca guards against monopolies and anticompetitive behavior possible increased risk of crosssubs idization between regulated portion of utility holding company business and their unregulated business activities and concern that states will lack authority or resources to monitor interstateholding company activities in addition to being proposed in stand alone legislation puhca reform has been included in comprehensive ectric restructuring legisl ation some argue that if comprehensive legislation adequately deals w ith possible market power abuses that could arise under new system as well as transiti onal issues that may be created in moving from regulated generating sector to competitive deregulated generation sector puhca could be eliminated for electric utilities however if congress chooses less comprehensive approach decisions will have to be made as to how much of the current puhca might be needed to protect consumers in more competitive environment and whether conditional re peal is appropriate
