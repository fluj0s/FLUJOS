question whet her the us food safety system can keep pace1 series of recent incidents have rais ed safety concerns about many of these foods medicines and other products particularly from china the thirdlargest source of us agricultural and seafood imports in september 2008 for example us aut horities said they were more closely monitoring imports of dairy products and dairybased ingredients from china following reports that four infants died there and tens of thousands of other young children have been sickened by consum ption of milk products primarily infant formula contaminated with the chemi cal melamine re ported 13000 infants were hospitalized number of c ountries have banned various dairyrelated imports from china andor pulled chinese products from store shelves in early 2007 evidence had emerged that adulterated pet f ood ingredients from china had caused the deaths of many dogs and cats subsequent survey counted 347 cases 235 cats and 112 dogs of pets dying from contaminated pet food2 some ingredients also were fed to us food an imals although federal officials claimed that humans were not at risk in late june 2007 the us food nd drug administration fda announced that it was detaining all imports of fa rmraised seafood from china specifically shrimp catfish basa dace and eel until the shippers of these products could confirm that they are free of unapproved dr ug residues chinese importers remained subject to these conditions in 2008 while strongly defending its recor d the chinese government also has announced variety of steps to improve th safety of its food and drug exports including revisions in its regulations ne w inspections and the closure of problem plants it also signed in late 2007 memorandum of agreement with the us government pledging expanded cooperation to ensure the sa fety of many of its food and feed products the fda is moving to station some officials in china to provide closer oversight at the same time china has blocked the importation of some types of us food products ostensibly out of food safety concernshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34080crs2 3 unless noted otherwise this section was prepared from numerous press accounts published throughout september 2008 in cluding by reuters the economist the times of london food chemical news the new zealand herald and the associated pressthese and other

crisis that was tinuing to unfold in late september 2008 approximately 54000 or more young ch ildren have been sickened in china reportedly suffering from the consumption of milk powder contaminated with melamine3 reported 13000 of them were hos pitalized and four infants died according to various press reports as early as midjuly 2008 one provincial government had told chinese health fficials about an unusually high number of kidney stones in babies w ho had all consumed the sa milk product however chinese authorities did not hold news conference to announce nationwide recall of 700 tons of milk powder until september 11 2008 melamine is an industrial chemical used in the manufacture of plastic including kitchen products countertops and floor tiles when inge sted it can crystallize and cause kidney stones and ultima tely kidney damage and kidney failure pet foods made with melaminetainted wheat gluten imported from china into the united states were linked to the hundred s of pet deaths in 2006 and 2007 in the recent dairy product crisis the focus in itially was on milk powder manufactured by the chinese company sanlu of which the new zealand dairy giant fonterra owns 43 share sanlu reportedly obtains its milk from middlemen who collect it from local farmers investigators believe that these middlemen deliberately were adding melamine to boos t product protein content readings of milk that had been watered down to increase its volume chinese officials said the practice could have been under way for years smalle r traces of melamine also reportedly were found in the

countries also were samplin g and testing various dair protein product imports from china including casein caseinates milk powders whey powder and lactose powder noting that other food products such as biscuits and chocol ate which could be made from contaminated milk powder may have reached the european union eu the european commission asked the european food safety agency efsa to provide urgent scientific advice on the matter efsa issued statement on september 25 2008 saying in part estimated exposure does not raise concerns for the health of adults in europe should they consume chocolates and bi scuits containing contaminated milk powder children with mean consum ption of biscuits milk toffee and chocolate made with such milk powder w ould also not exceed the tdi tolerable daily intake which is 05 mgkg body weight however in worst case scenarios with the highest level of contamination children with high daily consumption of milk toffee chocolate or biscuits contai ning high levels of milk powder would exceed the tdi children who consume both such biscuits and chocolate could potentially exceed the tdi by more than threefold however efsa noted that it is presently unknown whether such hi gh level exposure scenarios may occur in europe5 the eu also reportedly s banned imports of baby foods containing chinese milk power and required tes ting of all products contai ning

either reexported or destroyed by the importer the agency posts these monthly refusal reports on its website but only for the most recent 12 months ie only one years worth of refusals18 the refusals for each month can be searched by country or by product category but not by both at the same time data for only 12 months from may 2006 through april 2007 appeared on the we bsite as of may 2007 when crs last tabulated it and the months were not aggregated by fda into annual figures19 for each line recorded shipment the system provides the name of the source company and the reason for refusal as noted earlier the size of each shipment in the oasis database varies therefore it is not possible to calculate the volumes of products being rejected either as an ab solute quantity or as proportion of total imports also the types or categories of imports do not necessarily correspond to the categories reported through th fas trade databases see tables 1 and 2 above mindful of these caveats crs
