warning paul has posted number of lengthy replies on the modest proposal thread in these days of us increasingly having to deal with law abiding folk who have fallen foul of the entitled poor and those who have learned how to use us to score points and exact revenge i thought it would be good idea to give out bit of general guidance for those law abiding types who find themselves under suspicion or under arrest it works for the bad guys so make it work for youcomplain firstalways get your complaint in first even if it is you who started it and you who were in the wrong if things have gone awry and you suspect the cops are going to be called get your retaliation in first ring the cops right away and allege for all you are worth if you can work racist or homophobic slant into it so much the bettermake counter allegationregardless of the facts never let the other side be blameless if they beat you to the phone ring anyway and make counter allegation against them again racism or homophobia are your friends if you are not from visible minority ethnic culture may i suggest that that the phrase you gay bastard or similar is always useful in extremis allege sexual assault it gives us something to bargain with when getting the other person to drop their complaint on quidproquo basis this is particularly good where there are independent witnesses when it boils down to one word against another and nobody is fessing up cps run mile and you my friend are definitely on walk outnever explain to the policeif the police arrive to lock you up say nothing you are decent person and you may think that reasoning with the police will help if i can only explain they will realise it is all horrible mistake and go away wrong we do want to talk to you on tape in an interview room but that comes later all you are doing by trying to explain is digging yourself further in we call that stuff significant statement and we love it decent folk cant help themselves they think that they can talk their way out wrongadmit nothingto do anything more than lock you up for few hours we need to prove case the easiest route to that is your admission without it our case may be lot weaker maybe not enough to charge you with in any case it is always worth finding out exactly how damning the evidence is before you fall on your sword so dont do the decent and honourable thing and admit what you have done dont even deny it or try to give your side of the story just say nothing confession and cps are on the back foot already they forsee trial they fear trial they are looking for any excuse to send you home freekeep your mouth shutsay as little as possible to us at the custody office desk sergeant will ask you some questions it is safe to answer these for the rest of the time say nothingclaim suicidal thoughtsa debatable one this claiming to be thinking about topping yourself has several benefits if you can keep it up it might just bump up any compensation payable later on the other hand you may find yourself in paper suit with someone watching your every movealways always always have solicitorduh brainer this one unless you know 100 for sure that your mate the solicitor does criminal law and is good at it ask for the duty solicitor they certainly do criminal law and they are good at it then listen to what the solicitor says and do it their job is to get you off without the cops or cps laying glove on you if at all possible it is what they get paid for they are free to you there is down side now decent folks think it makes them look like they have something to hide if they ask for solicitor irrelevant going into an interview without solicitor is like taking walk in tottenham with big gold rolex bad things are very likely to happen to you i wouldnt do it and i interview people for livingactively complain about every officer and everything they dodid they cuff you when they brought you in were they rude to you did they racially or homophobically abuse you didnt get fed cell too cold you are decent folk who dont want to make fuss but trust it pays to whinge and matter how trivial and or poorly founded your complaint there are people who will uncritically listen to you and try and prove the complaint on your behalf some of them are even police officers nothing like complaint to muddy the waters and suggest that you are only in court because the vindictive cops have grudge against you far fetched wait until your solicitor spins it in court and you come over as ghandishow respect to the legal system or anybody working in ityou think that if you are difficult unpleasant sneering uncooperative and rude things will go badly for you and you will be in more trouble sirree bob it seems that in fact the worse you are the easier things will go for you if horror of horrors you do end up convicted remember to fake drink problem if you havent developed one as result of dealing with us already magistrates and judges do seem to like the idea that you are basically good but the naughty alcohol made you do it they treat you better crazy i know but trueso there you go basically anything you try and do because you are decent and staightforward hurts you badly act like an habitual professional lifestyle criminal and chances are you will walk away relatively unscathed copy the bad guys its what they do for living
