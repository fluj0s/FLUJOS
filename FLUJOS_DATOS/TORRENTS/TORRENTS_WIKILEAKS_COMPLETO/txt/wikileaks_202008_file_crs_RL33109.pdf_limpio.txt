125000 cubans and 30000 haitians to south florida in 1980 while this dramatic infl ux of asylum seekers commonly known as the mariel boatlift lasted only few months it cast long shadow over us immigration policy at that time aliens arriving at port of entry to the united states without proper immigration documents were eligible for hearing before an executive office for immigration review eoir immigration judge to determine whether the aliens were admissible14 if the alien received an unfavorable decision from the immigration judge he or she also could seek administrative and judicial review of the case the goal of summary exclusion was to stymie unauthorized migration by restricting the hearing review and appeal process for aliens arriving without proper documents at ports of entr

basis the department does however reserve the right to apply the expedited removal procedures to additional classes of aliens within the limits set by the statute if in the ins commissioners discretion such action is operationally warranted it is emphasized that proposed expans ion of the expedited removal procedures may occur at any time and may be driven either by specific situations

their admission44 proponents similarly reject arguments based upon equal protection cl aims for discrimination45 protections for asylum seekers proponents of expedited re moval reference the provisions giving aliens who express fear of persecution or an intention to seek asylum the opportunity for credible fear determination they usually cite statistics indicating that more than 90 of aliens who express fear are deemed to be credible pass their credible fear hearing and are able to bring their cases to an immigration judge they also note that the us commission on international

inspection49 mandatory detention of asylum seekers as discussed iirira requires that aliens in expedited removal be detain ed and thus aliens in expedited removal who claim asylum are detained while their credible fear cases are pending50 prior to iirira most aliens arriving wit hout proper documentation who applied for asylum were released on their own recognizance into the united states and given work authorization practice which enabled inadmissable aliens falsely claiming persecution to enter the country as result many argued that the only way to deter fraudulent asylum claims was to detain asyl um seekers rather than releasing them on their own recognizance indeed the practi ce of detaining asylum seekers has reduced the number of fraudulent asylum claims51 however others contend that the polic of detaining all asylum seekers who enter without proper documentation is too harsh the position of the united nations high commission on refugees is that dete ntion of asylum seekers is inherently undesirable52 they argue that detention may be psychologically damaging to an already fragile population such as thos who are escaping from imprisonment and torture in their countries often the asyl um seeker does not understand why they are being detained additionally asylum seekers are often detained with criminal aliens from april 1 1997 through septembe r 30 2001 there were

to accelerate the removal process such as the institutional removal program60 which are efficient and do not sacrifice the aliens rights61 protection of rights when aliens are placed in expedited removal they do not have access to relief from deportati on other than asylum protections and protections under the torture convention unle ss they claim legal right to reside in the united states based on citizenship or legal permanent resident status for example those in expedited removal would not be eligible for relief from deportation under the violence against women act temporary protected status or as trafficking victims62 as discussed above aliens in full rem oval proceedings under ina 240 see appendix for discussion of 240 removal proceedings have access to more types of relief from rem oval than those in expedited removal opponents of expanding expedited rem oval argue that aliens in the united states have fundamental right to due process and other cons titutional protections and that the expansion would deprive alie ns of significant rights and safeguards including the opportunity to apply for immigration benefits for which they are eligible and would be constitutional unsound63 in addition those opposed to the expansion of expedited rem oval express concerns that since there is review by eoir and only limited judicial review the immigration officers authority to order the alien removed is almost unchecked and that there have been reports of abuse of the expedited removal procedure since its in ception including aliens with valid legal status who were expeditiously removed64 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33109crs13 65 department of justice inspection and expedited removal of aliens detention and removal of aliens conduct of removal proceedings

border 70 ibid proponents of expanding ex pedited removal point to the law which states that aliens subject to expedite d removal have not entere d the united states and therefore are not entitled to these rights in addition aliens in primary and secondary inspection do not have right to representa tion unless the alien has become the focus of criminal investigation65 proponents reiterate that all expedited removal orders are reviewed by the immigration officers supervisors providing builtin check to the system and that there are safeguards built into the expedited removal system for those who fear persecution66 cost and resources arguments for and against the expansion of expedited removal invoke the issue of resources while expanding expedited removal will increase the need for some resources it will also lessen the need for others as result it is difficult to ascertain whether the expansion of expedited removal will increase or decrease the cost of removing aliens since expedited removal accelerates the removal of aliens by limitin g the aliens access to judicial hearings and reviews it can reduce the costs of the dhs lawyers who represent the governments position in removal cases the eoir courts and tention both staff and bed space as the aliens are tained for shorter periods of time67 similarly as aliens in expedited removal are not ligible for bond they are also unlike aliens in formal removal procedures inelig ible for bond redetermination hearings68 in front of an immigration judge in addition there is evidence that the most recent expansion of expedited removal along the southwest border has decreased the apprehensions of otms along the border69 which may imply that the expansion of expedited removal has been deterrent to those trying to enter the country illegally however both the availability of detention bed space and transportation of aliens placed in expedited re moval ie transporting the liens to dete ntion facilities and returning the alien to their home country present barriers to expanding expedited removal70 aliens placed in expedited removal are subject to mandatory detention yet many of these individuals do not

that would make them subject to mandatory detention absent expedited removal since aliens under ex pedited removal are subject to mandatory detention while noncriminal liens in removal proceedings are often not detained expanding expedited removal may raise dete ntion costs including transporting aliens to the detention facilities and make fewer beds available for other aliens to go through removal proceedings71 notably ice has been at or above their detention capacity for several years72 in addition expanding expedited removal would increase the need for deportation officers to arrange the physical removal of the aliens and uscis asylum officers to conduc t the additional credible fear hearings removal proceeding delays proponents of expandi ng expedited removal note the delays imposed by immigration judges in adjudicating removal cases as well additional postponements resulting from the ppeals process which can take years73 in addition they contend that aliens us frivolous appeals to postpone deportation74 some note that any improvement that can reduce the delays in the removal process including both the courts and the actual deportation can enhance the governments ability to enforcement immigration laws75 opponents of expanding expedited removals contend that removing eoirs role in removal proceedings infringes on the rights of aliens and creates situation where there is little oversight noting that recent changes in eoir have helped streamline the removal procedures76 logistics expanding expedited removal raises questions about how the policy would be impleme nted as discussed previous ly the process of expedited removal at ports of entry is fairly straightforward but there are issues that need to be explored to expand expedited removal into th interior for example if an alien is arrested and placed in expedited removal would he have chance to collect documents or contact family or friends would the alien be released to gatherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33109crs15 77 interestingly the issue of proving eligib ility for expedited removal was addressed during the discussion of expanding expedited removal to three jails in texas under the proposed program expedited removal would only be app lied to aliens that the federal courts had affirmatively determined have entered illegally since these aliens have been convicted of illegal entry the court records and documentati on in the file will clearly establish the time place and manner of entry thereby estab lishing eligibility for expedited removal 78 kenny dhs announces unprecedented expansion of expedited removal to the interior 79 detained aliens who have been ordered removed and have not been removed within six months after the 90 removal period has expired are subject to postordercustody review to determine whether the alien can be removed in the foreseeable future if the review rules that the alien can not be removed in the forese eable future in almost all cases the alien must be released for more details on postordercustody reviews see crs report rl31606 detention of noncitizens in the united states by alison siskin and margaret mikyung lee 80 to have been subject to expedited remova l under the pilot program the aliens would have 1 either had to have been convicted of illegal entry into the united states or have had the court

aliens held in federal state and local jails 64 federal register 51338 september 22 1999 the rational for the pilot program was that each year t housands of criminal aliens had undergone removal proceedings prior to their release from criminal custody if the alien was removable the alien was removed from the country upon completion of their criminal sentence shorte ning the amount of time the alien would have to be in immigration custody and lessening the cost of detaining the alien many incarcerated aliens had been convicted of illegal entry and were given relatively short sentences that made it difficult to complete removal proceedings prior to the completion of their criminal sentences 82 federal register vol 62 44 p 10313 march 6 1997documents to prove that he is not subject to expedited removal77 since those in expedited removal are subject to manda torily detention would the alien be detained78 in addition what happens to aliens who are unable to be returned to their home countries because the country will not produce travel documents would these aliens be subject to the sa postordercustody review s as those who were given final orders of removal nd are unable to be returned to their native country79 for example in 1999 ins published an advance notice that it intended to apply expedited removal on pilot basis to certain criminal aliens beings held in three correctional facilities in texas80 the program was neve r implemented under this pilot program expedited rem oval would have only been applied when the federal courts had affirmatively determined that the alien fell within the illegal entry criteria for expedited removal81 as discussed above the ins wrote in th interim rule on ex pedited removal that the application of the expedited removal provisions to aliens already in the united states will involve more comp lex determinations of fact and will be more difficult to manage82 nonetheless expedited removal has been in practice for eight

the alien must prove that he is not flight risk or danger to society87 bond hearings are not considered part of the removal process the aliens first appearance in immigration court is at the master
