president bush to restructure social security through the creation of individual accounts moved social security reform to the forefront of the political debate although much attention has been focused on the issue there has been legislative action the spectrum of ideas for reform have ranged from relatively minor changes to the payasyougo social insurance system enacted in the 1930s to redesigned modernized program based on personal savings and investments modeled after iras and 401ks proponents of the fundamentally different approaches to reform cite varying policy objectives that go beyond simply restoring longterm financial stability to the social security systemobjectives that focus on improving the adequacy and equity of benefits as well as those that reflect different philosophical views about the role of the social security program and the federal government in providing retirement income however the systems projected longrange financial outlook provides backdrop for much of the social security reform debate in terms of the timing and degree of recommended program changes currently the social security system is generating surplus tax revenues however its board of trustees projects that the trust funds will be depleted in 2041 at which point an estimated 78 of benefits will be payable with incoming receipts under the intermediate projections the primary reason is demographics between 2010 and 2030 th number of people aged 65 and older is projected to increase by 75 while the number of workers supporting the system is projected to increase by 8 in addition the trustees project that the system will begin running cash flow deficits in 2017 at which point other federal receipts will be needed to meet benefit costs if there are other surplus governmental receipts policymakers would have three options raise taxes or other income reduce spending or borrow public opinion polls show that fewer than 50 of respondents are confident that social security can meet its longterm commitments there is also public perception that social security may not be as good value for future retirees these concerns and belief that the nation must increase national savings have led to proposals to redesign the system at the same time others suggest that the systems financial outlook is not crisis in need of immediate action supporters of the current program structure point out that the system is now running surpluses continues to have public support and could be affected adversely by the risk associated with some of the reform ideas they contend that only modest changes are needed to restore longrange solvency to the social security system during the 109 th congress 10 social security reform measures were introduced most of which would have established individual accounts during the 110th congress six social security reform measures were introduced five of whic h would have established individual accounts none of the measures received congressional action this report will be updated as legislative activity warrants

initiative by former president bush to restructure social security through the creation of individual accounts moved social security reform to the forefront of the political debate the former president advocated prefunded system in which benefits would be based increasingly on personal savings and investments through the creation of individual social security accounts he pointed to the systems projected longrange funding shortfall as driver for change in conjunction with his vision of an ownership society most democrats have supported maintaining the current program structure ie defined benefit system funded on payasyougo basis pointing to the systems projected longrange financial outlook to support their view that the system is not in crisis and that only modest program changes may be needed proponents of the fundamentally different approaches to reform ranging from relatively minor changes to the current payasyougo social insurance system to the creation of modernized program based on personal savings and investments modeled after iras and 401ks cite varying policy objectives that go beyond simply restoring longterm financial stability to the system objectives that focus on improving the adequacy and equity of benefits as well as those that reflect different philosophical views about the role of the social security program and the federal government in providing retirement income however the systems projected longrange financial outlook provides backdrop for much of the social security reform debate in terms of the timing and degree of recommended program changes for example one of the key criteria used to evaluate any reform proposal is its projected impact on the social security trust funds to place the discussion of social security reform issues into context this report looks first at the longrange projections for the social security trust funds then at the various objectives and proposals for reform currently social security income exceeds outgo however the social security board of trustees composed of three officers of the presidents ca binet the commissioner of social security and two public representatives projects that social security outgo will exceed income by 12 on average over the next 75 years 1 in addition the trustees project that the social security trust funds will be exhausted by 2041 at which point incoming receipts will cover an estimated 78 of program costs one of the primary reasons is demographics the first wave of the postworld war ii baby boom generation began retiring in 2008 and projected increases in life expectancy will contribute to an older society between 2010 and 2030 the number of people aged 65 and older is projected to increase by 75 while the number of workers whose taxes will finance future benefits is projected to increase by 8 as result the number of workers supporting each social security recipient is projected to decline from 33 today to 21 in 2035 2 social security revenues are paid into the us treasury and most of the proceeds are used to pay benefits surplus revenues are invested in federal securities recorded to the oldage survivors and disability insurance oasdi trust funds maintained by the treasury department3 social security benefits and administrative costs are paid out of the treasury and corresponding 1 the 2008 annual report

security taxes are insufficient to pay benefits the trust funds securities are redeemed and treasury makes up the difference with other receipts currently social security tax revenues exceed what is needed to pay benefits and administrative costs surplus tax revenues and interest credited to the trust funds in the form of government bonds appear as growing trust fund balances beginning in 2027 however the systems outgo is projected to exceed total income tax revenues plus interest income and trust fund assets will begin to be drawn down by 2041 the trust funds are projected to be exhausted and technically insolvent see table 1 and figure 1 beginning in 2017 the systems outgo is projected to exceed social security tax revenues income excluding interest credited to the trust funds with the emergence of cash flow deficits the system will rely on interest credited to the trust funds to meet annual expenditures because interest credited to the trust funds is an exchange of credits between treasury accounts rather than financial resource for the government from outside sources other federal receipts will be needed to meet the systems costs if there are other surplus governmental receipts policymakers would have three options raise taxes reduce spending or borrow the money from the public ie replace bonds held by the trust funds with bonds held by the public the systems reliance on general revenues is projected to be about 77 billion by 2020 and 258 billion by 2030 in constant 2008 dollars projected annual social security surpluses and deficits as well as projected annual cash flow surpluses and deficits are shown in table 1 and figure 2 today the annual cost of the system 6235 billion is equal to 1120 of workers pay subject to social security payroll taxes or taxable payroll the trustees project that the systems costs will increase at faster rate than tax income over the next several decades program costs are projected to increase sharply between 2010 and 2030 as the baby boom generation moves into retirement as share of taxable payroll the cost of the system is projected to reach 1262 in 2015 1414 in 2020 and 1641 in 2030 program costs are then projected to increase at slower rate for about five years reaching 1684 of taxable payroll in 2035 beyond 2035 program costs as share of taxable payroll are projected to remain relatively stable for several decades before gradually increasing to 1763 of taxable payroll in 2085 over the 75year projection period the average cost of the system is projected to be 1563 of taxable payroll or 12 higher than average income however the gap between income and outgo is projected to increase over the period in 2085 the cost of the system is projected to exceed income by 33 as share of gross domestic product gdp program costs are projected to increase from 43 of gdp today to peak of 61 of gdp in the 2030s over the following decade program costs are projected to decline slightly as share of gdp before stabilizing at about 58 of gdp for the remainder of the projection period the projected longrange financial outlook is reflected in public opinion polls that show fewer than 50 of respondents express confidence in social securitys ability to meet its longterm commitments there is growing public perception that social security may not be as good value in the future until recent years retirees co uld expect to receive more in benefits than they paid in social security taxes however because social security tax rates have increased to cover the costs of the maturing payasyougo system these ratios have become less favorable such concerns and belief that the nation must increase national savings to meet the needs of an aging society are among the factors behind reform efforts

security system has faced funding shortfalls in the past in 1977 and 1983 congress enacted variety of measures to address the systems financial imbalance these measures include constraints on the growth of initial benefit levels gradual increase in the full retirement age from 65 to 67 ie the age at which unreduced benefits are payable payroll tax increases taxation of benefits for higherincome recipients and extension of social security coverage to federal and nonprofit workers subsequently projections showed the reemergence of longterm deficits as result of changes in actuarial methods and assumptions and because program changes had been evaluated with respect to their effect on the average 75year deficit that is while program changes were projected to restore trust fund solvency on average over the 75year period period of surpluses was followed by period of deficits some policymakers believe that some type of action should be taken sooner rather than later this view has been shared by the social security trustees and other panels and commissions that have examined the issue in recent years wide range of interest groups have echoed this view in testimony before congress however there is consensus on whether the projections represent crisis in 1977 and 1983 the trust fund balances were projected to fall to zero within very short period within months of the 1983 reforms today the problem is perceived to be as few as 9 or as many as 33 years away lacking crisis the pressure to compromise is diffused and the issues and the divergent views about them have led to myriad complex proposals in 1977 and 1983 the debate was not about fundamental reform rather it revolved around how to raise the systems income and constrain costs today the ideas range from restoring the systems solvency with as few alterations as possible to replacing it entirely with something modeled after iras or 401ks this broad spectrum was reflected in the 1997 social security advisory council report which presented three different reform plans none of the plans was supported by majority of the 13member council similar diversity is reflected in the social security reform bills introduced in recent congresses g18g158g156g145g561g143g152g155g561g15g138g147g152g155g561g20g142g143g152g155g150g561 advocates of reform view social security as an anachronism built on depressionera concerns about high unemployment and widespread dependency among the aged they see the prospect of reform today as an opportunity to modernize the way society saves for retirement they maintain that the vast economic social and demographic changes that have transpired over the past 70 years require the system to change and they point to changes made in other countries that now use marketbased individual accounts to strengthen retirement incomes and bolster their economies by spurring savings and investments they believe governmentrun payasyougo systems are unsustainable in aging societies they prefer system that allows workers to acquire wealth and provide for their retirement by investing in individual accounts reform advocates also view it as way to counter skepticism about the current system by giving workers greater sense of ownership of their retirement savings they contend that private investments would yield larger retirement incomes because stocks and bonds historically have provided higher returns than are projected from the current system some believe that individual accounts would address what they view as the systems contradictory mix of insurance and social welfare goals although benefits are not based strictly on workers contributions many of its social benefits go to financially welloff individuals in the absence of means test others

stock market declines however may make investmentbased proposals less popular among some policymakers in the near term some who do not necessarily seek new system view enactment of longrange social security constraints as one way to curb federal entitlement spending the aging of society means that the cost of entitlement programs that aid the elderly will increase greatly in the future the costs of the largest entitlement programs social security medicare and medicaid are directly linked to an aging population proponents of imposing constr aints on these programs express concern that if left unchecked their costs would place pressure on the federal budget far into the future consuming resources that could be used for other priorities and forcing future generations to bear much higher tax burden as matter of fairness it has been pointed out that many current recipients get back more than the value of their social security contributions and far more than the baby boom generation will receive they believe that to delay making changes to the program is unfair to current workers who must pay for transfer payments that they characterize as overgenerous and unrelated to need while facing the prospect that their own benefits may have to be scaled back severely others emphasize the systems projected longrange funding shortfall and contend that steps should be taken soon eg raising the full retirement age constraining the growth of initial monthly benefits for future retirees reducing colas raising taxes so that changes can be phased in allowing workers more time to adjust their retirement expectations and plans to reflect what these programs will be able to provide in the future they maintain that otherwise more abrupt changes in taxes and benefits would be required g3g155g144g158g150g142g151g157g156g561g143g152g155g561g20g142g157g138g146g151g146g151g144g561g157g145g142g561g7g161g146g156g157g146g151g144g561g21g162g156g157g142g150g561 those who favor more restrained approach believe that the issues facing the system can be resolved with modest tax and spending changes and that the programs critics are raising the specter that social security will bankrupt the nation to undermine public support and provide an excuse to incorporate individual accounts into the system they contend that individual savings accounts would erode the social insurance nature of the current system that favors lowincome workers survivors and the disabled others are concerned that switching to new system of individual accounts would pose large transition problems by requiring younger workers to save for their own retirement while paying taxes to cover benefits for current retirees some doubt that it would increase national savings arguing that higher government debt resulting from the redirection of current payroll taxes to individual accounts would offset the increased i ndividual account savings they also contend that the capital markets inflow created by the accounts would make the markets difficult to regulate and potentially distort equity valuations they point out that some of the countries that have moved to individual accounts did so to create capital markets such markets they argue are already well developed in the united states some believe that system of individual accounts would expose participants to excessive market risk for an income source that has become essential to many of the nations elderly they say that the nation has threetiered retirement system consisting of social security private pensions and personal assets that already includes private savings and investment components they contend that while people may be willing and able to undertake some risk in the latter two tiers social security as the tier that provides basic floor of protection should be more stable they further

accounts could be very large and significantly erode the value of the accounts some say that concerns about the future growth of entitlement spending are overblown arguing that as people live longer they will work longer as labor markets tighten and employers offer inducements for them to remain on the job they state that projected low ratio of workers to dependents is not unprecedented as it

some maintain that the problem is more acute than portrayed under the traditional 75year projections that show an average 75year deficit equal to 170 of taxable payroll 43 trillion in present value terms 4 they believe this view is supported by an alternative portrayal in the trustees report that extends the projections indefinitely into the future on an infinite horizon basis the projected funding shortfall is equal to 32 of taxable payroll 136 trillion in present value terms they also point out that in 2030 the cost of the system is projected to exceed income by 32 of taxable payroll costs are projected to exceed income by 24 and that in 2085 the cost of the system is projected to exceed income by 43 of taxable payroll costs are projected to exceed income by 33 therefore on payasyougo basis the system would require more than 12 change in taxes or expenditures over the next 75 years to cover projected program costs over the next 75 years on average the cost of the system is projected to exceed income by 12 they maintain that viewing the problem as 33 years away the trust funds are projected to have balance until 2041 does not take into account the pressure social security will exert on the federal budget beginning in 2017 when annual cash flow deficits are projected to emerge and the system begins to rely on interest credited to the trust funds to meet annual expenditures at that point the government would have to rely on other resources to help cover program costs resources that could be used to finance other governmental functions 5 others express concern that the problem is being exaggerated they maintain that in contrast to earlier episodes of financial imbalance the system has immediate problem surplus tax receipts are projected for 8 years and the trust funds are projected to have positive balance for 32 years they state that projections for the next 75 years let alone the indefinite future cannot be viewed with any significant degree of conf idence and that congress should respond to the projections with caution they point out that ev if the 75year projections hold the average 4 the corresponding value is 47 trillion in present value terms if the target trust fund balance equal to 100 of annual cost by the end of the period is included 5 the trust fund projections cited in this crs report are based on the 2008 annual report of the social security board of trustees projections released by the congressional budget office cbo in august 2008 reflect similar longrange outlook for the social security trust funds cbo projects

immediately by 085 percentage point on employees and employers each while acknowledging that the cost of the system is projected to represent notably larger share of gdp in the future increasing from 43 of gdp today to peak of 61 of gdp in the 2030s they point out that gdp itself would have risen substantially in real terms moreover while the ratio of workers to recipients is projected to decline they believe that employers are likely to respond with inducements for older workers to stay on the job longer phasedin retirements are becoming more prevalent and some older workers are viewing retirement increasingly as more than an allornothing decision g18g158g139g149g146g140g561g5g152g151g143g146g141g142g151g140g142g561 in recent years public opinion polls have shown that majority of americans lack confidence in the systems ability to meet its future commitments although skepticism abated following enactment of legislation in 1983 to shore up the system it has risen again with just over half of the public expressing lack of confidence cbs newsnew york times poll june 2005 younger workers are particularly skeptical for example 62 of persons aged 1834 56 of persons aged 3544 and 49 of persons aged 4554 expressed lack of confidence in the systems ability to pay benefits scheduled under current law in the future compared with 16 of persons aged 55 and older newsweek poll february 2005 in more recent poll in which respondents were asked to describe the current financial situation of social security 66 said the system is in crisis 30 or in serious trouble 36 another 26 said the system is in some trouble 5 said the system is not in trouble and 3 said they are unsure cbs news poll october 2007 6 some observers express caution about inferring too much from polling data arguing that public understanding of social security is limited and often inaccurate they maintain that major reason confidence is highest among older persons is that they have learned more about social security because they are more immediately affected by the program some believe that the annual statements provided by the social security administration will make workers more aware of their estimated future benefits scheduled under current law and thus more trusting of the system others however suggest that the skepticism is justified by the systems repeated financial difficulties and diminished moneys worth for younger workers g6g152g158g139g157g156g561g3g139g152g158g157g561g15g152g151g142g162g514g156g561g25g152g155g157g145g561 until recent years social security recipients received more often far more than the value of the social security taxes they paid however because social security tax rates have increased over the years and the full retirement age the age at which unreduced benefits are payable is being increased gradually it is becoming more apparent that social security will be less of good deal for many future retirees for example for workers who earned average wages and retired in 1980 at age 65 it took 28 years to recover the value of the retirement portion of the combined employee and employer shares of their social security taxes plus interest for their counterparts who retired at age 65 in 2003 it will take 174 years for those retiring in 2020 it will take 216 years some observers believe these discrepancies are inequitable and cite them as evidence that the system needs to be substantially restructured 6 polling results are from pollingreportcom at httpwwwpollingre portcomsocialhtm

social insurance program serving social ends that transcend questions of whether some individuals fare better than others for example the programs antipoverty features replace higher proportion of earnings for lower paid workers and provide additional benefits for workers with families in addition current workers who will receive less direct value from their taxes compared to current retirees have in large part been relieved from having to support their parents and many elderly are able to live independently and with dignity these observers contend that the value of these aspects of the program is not reflected in comparisons of taxes and benefits g6g142g139g138g157g142g561g17g159g142g155g561g11g151g141g146g159g146g141g158g138g149g561g3g140g140g152g158g151g157g156g561 social securitys projected longrange financial outlook skepticism about the sustainability of the current system and belief that economic growth could be bolstered through increased savings have led to number of proposals to incorporate individual accounts into the social security system reviving debate that dates back to the creation of the program in 1935 all three plans presented by the 19941996 social security advisory council featured program involvement in the financial markets the first called upon congress to consider authorizing investment of part of the social security trust funds in equities on the assumption that stocks would produce higher return to the system the second would require workers to contribute an extra 16 of pay to individual accounts to make up for social security benefit reductions called for under the plan to restore the systems longrange solvency the third would redesign the system by gradually replacing social security retirement benefits with flatrate benefits based on length of service and individual accounts funded with 5 percentage points of the current social security tax rate 7 the reform that chile enacted in 1981 which replaced troubled payasyougo system with one requiring workers to invest part of their earnings in individual accounts through governmentapproved pension funds has been reflected in number of reform bills introduced in recent congresses 8 these measures would permit or require workers to invest some or all of their social security payroll taxes in individual accounts most call for future social security benefits to be reduced or forfeited similarly the three options presented by the social security reform commission appointed by former president bush in 2001 would allow workers to participate in individual accounts and would reduce their future social security benefit by the projected value of the account based on an assumed rather than the actual rate of return9 another approach is reflected in bills that would require any budget surpluses to be used to finance individual accounts to supplement social security benefits for those who pay social security payroll taxes former president clintons january 1999 reform plan would have allocated portion of budget surpluses to individual accounts supplemented by workers own contributions and government match scaled to income in addition the plan

resulting therefrom to the social security trust funds some of the funds would have been used to acquire stocks similar to the approach suggested in one of the advisory council plans and some past legislation most of these approaches would require establishment of an independent board to invest some of the funds in stocks or corporate bonds and the remaining funds in federal securities some individual account proponents believe that individual accounts would reduce future financial demands on government and reassure workers by giving them sense of ownership of their retirement savings others believe that individual accounts would enhance workers retirement income because stocks and bonds generally have provided higher rates of return than are projected from social security in conjunction with this they maintain that individual accounts would increase national savings and promote economic growth others maintain that individual accounts would prevent the government from using surplus social security revenues to mask public borrowing or for other spending or tax reductions generally proponents of individual accounts express concern that collective investment of the social security trust funds in the markets would concentrate too much economic power in governmentappointed board 10 opponents of individual accounts maintain that social securitys projected longrange funding shortfall could be resolved without altering the fundamental nature of the program they express concern that replacing social security with individual accounts would erode the social insurance aspects of the system that favor lowwage earners survivors and the disabled others are concerned that individual accounts would pose large transition problems by requiring younger workers to save for their own retirement while simultaneously paying taxes to support current retirees and would further exacerbate current budget deficits some doubt that individual accounts would increase national savings maintaining that any increase in private savings would be offset by increased government borrowing th ey also point out that the investment pool created by the accounts could be difficult to regulate and distort capital markets and equity valuations still others view it as exposing participants to excessive market risk for something as essential as core retirement benefits and unlike social security as providing poor protection against inflation many prefer collective investment of the social security trust funds in the markets to potentially bolster their returns and spread the

measured by the bureau of labor statistics bls consumer price index cpi which measures price increases for selected goods and services the cpi has been criticized for overstating the effects of inflation primarily because the indexs market basket of goods and services was not revised regularly to reflect changes in consumer buying habits or improvements in quality bls analysis in 1993 found that the annual overstatement may be as much as 06 percentage point cbo estimated in 1994 that the overstatement ranged from 02 to 08 percentage point 1996 panel that studied the issue for the senate finance committee argued that it may be 11 percentage points 12 in response to its own analysis as well as outside criticisms the bls has since made various revisions to the cpi to some extent these revisions may account for part of the slower cpi growth in recent years however calls for adjustments continue13 according to the social security administration cola reduction of 05 percentage point annually beginning december 2009 would improve the systems longrange actuarial balance by an estimated 44 cola reduction of 1 percentage point annually would improve the long range actuarial balance by an estimated 84 based on the trustees 2008 intermediate projections 14 while some view further cpi changes as necessary to help keep social security and other entitlement spending under control others view such changes as backdoor way of reducing benefits they maintain that the market basket of goods and services purchased by the elderly is different from that of the general population around whom the cpi is constructed it is more heavily weighted with healthcare expenditures which rise notably faster than the overall cpi and thus they contend that the cost of living for the elderly is higher than reflected by the cpi 15 12 toward more accurate measure of the cost of living final report to the senate finance committee from the advisory commission to study the consumer price index

developing and enforcing annual budget goals however it is federal program and its income and outgo help shape the yeartoyear financial condition of the federal government as result policymakers often focus on unified or overall budget totals that include social security when former president clinton urged that the unified budget surpluses projected at the time be reserved until social securitys projected longrange funding issues were resolved and proposed using portion of those surpluses to shore up the system social securitys budget treatment became major issue congressional views about what to do with the surpluses were diverse ranging from buying down publiclyheld federal debt to cutting taxes to increasing spending however there was substantial support for setting aside portion equal to the annual social security trust fund surpluses although budget deficits have reemerged some congressional interest remains in the concept of social security lock box for example in the 109 th congress hr 3435 savings for seniors act of 2005 introduced by representative blackburn would have established social security surplus protection account in the oasi trust f und for the purpose of holding surplus social security tax revenues and would have establishe d social security investment commission to recommend alternative investment options for surplus social security funds under the measure investment of funds held in the account would have been suspended pending enactment of legislation providing for trust fund investment in nongovernmental assets s 1730 truth in budgeting act of 2005 introduced in the 109 th congress by senator v oinovich would have established trust fund administration within the treasury department for the purpose of investing all federal trust fund revenues in nongovernmental debt instruments such as municipal and corporate bonds upon the issuance of special rate treasury obligations to the trust funds investment in stocks would have been prohibited under the measure investment fund assets would have been used to redeem outstanding special rate treasury obligations in the 109 th congress senator demint offered an amendment to the senate budget resolution for fy2007 sconres 83 that would have allowed for the creation of reserve fund for surplus social security tax revenues provided that the senate finance committee approve social security legislation that meets certain requirem ents for example the amendment samdt 3087 specified that such legislation make changes to social security benefits scheduled under current law for individuals born before 1950 and provide individuals with the option to voluntarily obtain legally binding ownership of at least some portion of each participants benefits the amendment was defeated by vote of 4653 in the 110 th congress the fy2008 budget resolution sconres 21 passed by the senate on march 23 2007 included provisions aimed at protecting annual social security surpluses

raised in the senate against c onsideration of any legislation that would increase the onbudget deficit in any fiscal year ie deficit in the part of the federal budget that excludes social security

the 19941996 social security advisory council presented three different approaches to restore longrange solvency to the system none of which was endorsed by majority of council members the first the maintain benefits plan would maintain the systems current benefit structure by increasing revenues including an eventual increase in the payroll tax and making minor benefit reductions it was also suggested that portion of the social security trust funds be invested in stocks the second the individual account plan addressed the problem mostly with benefit reductions and would require workers to make an extra 16 of pay contribution to individual accounts the third the personal security account plan proposed major redesign of the system that would gradually replace the current earningsrelated retirement benefit with flatrate benefit based on length of service and establish individual accounts funded by redirecting 5 percentage points of the current payroll tax it would cover transition costs with an increase in payroll taxes of 152 of pay and government borrowing the conceptual approaches incorporated in the three plans are reflected in many of the reform bills introduced in recent years during his last three years in office former president clinton repeatedly called for using social securitys share of budget surpluses projected at the time to reduce publicly held federal debt and crediting the trust funds for the reduction 17 in the 1999 state of the union address he proposed crediting 28 trillion of some 49 trillion in budget surpluses projected for the next 15 years to the trust fundsnearly 06 trillion was to be invested in stocks the rest in federal securities the plan was estimated to keep the system solvent until 2059 concerns were raised that the plan would be crediting the social security trust funds twice for its surpluses and that the plan would lead to government ownership of private compan ies former president clinton further proposed that 05 trillion of the budget surpluses be used to create new universal savings accounts401ktype accounts intended to supplement social security benefits in june 1999 he revised the plan by calling for general fund infusions to the trust funds equal to the interest savings achieved by using social securitys share of the budget surpluses to reduce federal debt the infusions were to be invested in stocks until the stock portion of the trust funds holdings reached 15 in october 1999 former president clinton re vised the plan again by dropping the stock investment idea and calling for all the infusions to be invested in federal bonds former president 16 during senate floor consideration of sconres 21 in march 2007 senator demint offered an amendment samdt 489 that would have allowed for the creation of reserve fund for social security reform provided that the senate finance committee approve legislation that meets certain requirements among other requirements the amendment specified that such legislation must ensure that there is change to current law scheduled benefits for individuals born before january 1 1951 and must provide participants with the benefits of savings and investment while permitting the prefunding of at least some portion of future benefits the amendment was defeated by vote of 45 to 52 senator demint offered similar amendment to the fy2009 budget resolution

again called for investing up to 15 of the trust funds in stock during his first term former president bush appointed commission to make recommendations to reform social security as principles for reform he stated that any reform plan must preserve the benefits of current retirees and older workers return social security to firm financial footing and allow younger workers to invest in individual savings accounts the commissions final report which was issued on december 21 2001 included three reform options each option would allow workers to participate in individual accounts on voluntary basis and reduce their future social security benefit by the projected value of the account based on an assumed rather than the actual rate of return the first option would allow workers to redirect 2 of taxable earnings to individual accounts and would make other changes the second option would allow workers to redirect 4 of taxable earnings up to an annual limit of 1000 to individual accounts reduce initial benefits for future retirees by indexing the growth of initial benefits to prices rather than wages and increase benefits for lowerwage workers and widowers the third option would allow workers to contribute an additional 1 of taxable earnings to individual accounts and receive government match of 25 of taxable earnings up to an annual limit of 1000 reduce initial benefits for future retirees by slowing the growth of initial benefits to reflect projected increases in life expectancy and for higherwage workers by modifying the benefit formula and increase benefits for lowerwage workers and widowers 18 during his second term former president bush continued efforts to build support for social security reform although the former president did not present detailed plan for reform he put forth guidelines for congress to consider in the development of legislation to create individual accounts within program that he described as in need of wise and effective reform during the 2005 state of the union address former president bush offered the following guidelines for reform 1 workers born before 1950 aged 55 and older in 2005 would not be affected by individual accounts or other components of reform 2 participation in individual accounts would be voluntary 3 eligible workers would be allowed to redirect up to 4 of covered earnings to an individual account initially up to 1000 per year 4 accounts would be administered by centralized government entity and 5 workers would be required to annuitize the portion of the account balance needed to provide at least povertylevel stream of lifelong income with any remaining balance available as lump sum in addition to restating support for individual accounts as part of the creation of an ownership society former president bush acknowledged that other changes would be needed to address the systems projected longrange funding shortfall he cited potential program changes that would be on the table for consideration including 1 raising the full retirement age 2 reducing benefits for wealthy recipients and 3 modifying the benefit formula at the time the only approach ruled out by former president bush was an increase in the payroll tax rate on april 28 2005 during television news conference former president bush proposed change in the social security benefit formula in which

although details of the proposal were not released white house press statement indicated that the president was referring to proposal similar to one put forth by robert pozen member of the 2001 president s commission to strengthen social security appointed by former president bush mr pozens proposal known as progressive indexing would constrain the growth of initial benefits for future retirees by using combination of wage indexing and price indexing mechanisms in the benefit formula rather than wage indexing only to apply differing degrees of benefit reduction based on the workers level of earnings 19 under progressive indexing lowerwage workers would receive benefit that is indexed closer to wage growth as under current law and higherwage workers would receive benefit that is indexed closer to price growth or inflation based on current wage and price growth projections shift from wage indexing toward price indexing would result in lower initial benefits for many future retirees compared to current law20 as the first session of the 109th congress came to close at the end of 2005 the reform debate focused on legislation introduced by senator demint s 1302 that would have established voluntary individual accounts funded with surplus social security tax revenues and reduced social security benefits to reflect account assets s 1302 is described in the following section of the report on november 15 2005 senator santorum made unanimous consent requests to discharge s 1302 and second measure s 1750 109th congress from the senate finance committee and bring those measures to the senate floor for consideration s 1750 introduced by senator santorum would have provided for the issuance of social security benefit guarantee certificates to persons born before 1950 for the stated purpose of guaranteeing their right to receive social security benefits in full with an accurate annual costofliving adjustment the unanimous consent requests provided for 10 hours of debate on each measure followed by vote on passage with amendments objections raised against the unanimous consent requests prevented further action on the measures 21 during the 2006 state of the union address former president bush expressed concern regarding the level of federal spending for entitlement programs citing projections that social security medicare and medicaid would account for almost 60 of the federal budget by 2030 the former president called for the creation of commission that would include members of congress from both parties to examine the full impact of baby boom retirements on social security medicare and medicaid in addition former president bush included in his fiscal year 2007 budget proposal for voluntary individual accounts funded with portion of current payroll taxes similar to the one he outlined in the 2005 state of the union address the fiscal year 2007 budget also restated the former presidents support for change in the social security benefit
