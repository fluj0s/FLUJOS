the new organizational structure lecture given on 9 march 1965 thank you well im glad to see you all today i dont have thing to talk to you about dont even know why im here you would probably be much better off in class someplace studying something and i probably ought to cut and run after turning the whole course upside down see i see head nodding bitter butwhats the date audience march 9th march 9th ad 15 all right very good ive been having ball an absolute ball worked during lot of my vacation trying to put together things but this is the year of the big puttogether weve got very small amount of breathing time very very small amount of breathing time and unfortunately at this particular stage of the game there is some necessity to breatheand having small amount of breathing time before the push starts biting and weve got that period of timea few months dont you see at the least weve at least got few monthsto get all the organization in shape and everything understood and everything grooved in see so it doesnt have any loopholes in it because as soon as wide push thrust boom begins this law applies on an expansion every smallest weak chink in your communication systems or systems or organizational pattern will be found out and the big ones will be found out with violence in other words all your weaknesses show up and thats why lots of people fear expansion theyre terrified of it because their weaknesses show up and in those weaknesses they havethey get totally interiorized and confused and spun dont you see ill give you an example you got registrar and she does not have the proper lines or alignment in the organization theyre almost right you see on small organization nobody ever noticed they were sour see nobody ever noticed this because there wasnt enough traffic over them you know and somebody could kind of think his way around this little point see and it just became usual you see to sort of think your way around this corner and it carried quite ably oh fortyfive interviews week see it was easy there was nothing to it now she has to handle hundred and fifty well it isnt that she cant handle hundred and fifty that little kink that everybody thought his way around every time all of sudden becomes deep wide abyss and all of her pcs and students trying to enroll fall into it dont you see expansion actually is like turning magnifying glass on something it looked perfectly all right drawn here in small scale i meansee drawn there you see it nothing much to it but now were going to make it big only it isnt just putting magnifying glass on it and looking it up thats what i have to do in straightening it up you see you make this thing big start to stretch this thing out and you find out lot of these lines and things dont connect they look like they connected but they dont connect so that pattern to be near perfect pattern should be thea basic pattern you see which could expand and expand and expand well now you get fairly decent pattern up at the topyou can test it to find out whether or not its decent pattern by seeing if you can reduce it down again now ill give you an idea once upon time there was an auditor and his name was hubbard and he lived at bay head new jersey and he had little hectograph book and people keep getting copies of this book and reprinting it for themselves and giving it to their friends and the mailbags kept getting bigger and bigger and this auditor couldnt handle the pcs because they multiplied from one to about fifteen now if you have ever tried to audit fifteen pcs about five hours week eachyou see its within the finite limitsand then try to do everything else too you begin to realize that theres little too much on your plate at that particular time it was unfortunate but group came along and said we want to make an organization out of this for you now you can get on with it and i said well all right and then the fun began then the fun began in fact all hell broke loose because there was too rapid an expansion in process of organizational fundamental and i wasnt even developing the organizational background or fundamental at that particular time you had such crazy things happening aswe had thirtysix hour intensives in week in those days you had such crazy things happening as my writing up completely out of my own very intimate experience exactly how to do thirtysix hour intensive and then it being parked in the general managers deskin his safe actuallybecause it was too valuable to release isnt that marvelous and i kept getting communications for the next year and i couldnt figure out what was the matter with auditors they all gone stupid or something of the sort they were all asking personally how you did thirtysix hour intensive nobody ever seemed to be able to get one done so finally one day i said this must be something missing here someplace so i instituted an inquiry where the devil had anybody ever seen this and nobody had ever seen it it was great revelation to i was going on the basis theyd all studied it and they were going on the basis that id never written it and there sat the manuscript in its original form and beautifully typed on very very expensive bond paper in very big safe because it was too valuable to release the lines all broke down everyplace well the missing line there was val docvaluable documentsyou see the line to valuable documents definition of valuable documents what are valuable documents mimeograph publications missing hco area secretaries were missing hcos were missing there were few things missing do you see that immediately pointed up there are lot of lines and units and parts missing in the machine see well it couldnt run of course because everybody had to wear all the hats individually and there was policy on which anybody could agree so there were routes that went any particular directions and when these guys got too hungry for money and that sort of thing and started kicking in the headi had control of the organizationi got tired of just using my personality and phzzzzzt alone to control the organization so i said to hell with you and it all went boom so i sat down and i said well now lets start this over again properly that was 1952 and weve been going well ever since dont you see so ive been taught the lesson see quite obviously that you can enter boom and enter an expansion and that if you shovetry to shove the linesif this is kicking back hard against the people that are with you in this and they havent got everything straight on their platesall it looks like to them is tremendous lot of overwork and although theyre perfectly willing to have things boomactually the reason they dont boom is because their own plates are too full and the lines are zigged where they should be zagged dont you see and it cant boom because it starts to go on out and if it does boom if its promoted too hard without organizational lines straightened up behind it why it just blows up everything in other words that rock can start rolling downhill at such speed it starts an avalanche and then theres stopping the avalanche you could have stopped the rock but not the avalanche were at that point of the game right now where its very easy to halt and change the direction of the rock dont you see so that my concentration on the matter is simply when things start entering in the various perimeters of the organization or individual auditors and so forth that they have the data and the routes in order to handle it and fortunately ive been able toto get theand pretest the organizational patterns and so forth which will be used theres not much change in the character of departments but theres slight difference of alignment in departments its under what does which come and that takes out lot of zigs and zags and so forth what ive mainly been having ball with is to write up this required the development of the philosophy of administration thats never been developed thats totally missing segment in the area of manthe philosophy of administration there are lot of administrative procedures there are lot of management associations there are all kinds of oddball characters well im selfmade man this is the way i run my business you know i dont wince like that nothing personal in that and and this is the way it is and thats it and nothing is going to change this in any way whatsoever see blyaraoo theres lot of that kind of thing dont you see but the philosophy is what hes doing the philosophy of what hes actually doing is not there theres policy or an idea of what hes doing such aslike he is being successful see well thatd be pretty broad if it were the definition you see or things are on the upgrade the charts all show an upclimb so thereforethat is the full philosophy of it and apparently hethey dont even go as far as to say is this successful they dont even get this elementary successful business is one which has its charts on steady slight or great increase see you know everybody knows you see its just full of these everybody knows everybody knows that the business chart on the wall should have ashow little bit of an increase in order to consider the business fairly healthy see population is increasing and traffics increasing generally in society so it should match that everybody knows that but who has saidyou see who has said graph on wall what i just said graph on wall should show very slight increase in order to indicate the healthiness of the business theyre at this echelon this is the graph and i bet theyve got people sitting all over the place staring at what theyve just offered them saying graph why completelydont see anyany connection whatsoever between the graph and anything that is going on so they say well theres lot of charts around here youve heard it in offices you know well theres lot of charts around here haha somebody instinctively feels there ought to be some charts but how you use them and what you do with them or even the definition of what they are is really not given in the business texts dont you see so you could say that man is sort of working on instincts andin the field of administration hes at the level of the dog turning around three times before he lies down and the dog who turns around three times before he lies down of course is really looking to find out whether or not there are any snakes in his bed and its been survival policy with dogs for long time but the dog himself in turning around three times doesnt even know what hes looking for in fact ive never had single dog tell well there are snakes there now and lie down see its whole bunch of imsupposedtos you see administration is just bunch of notunderstood supposedtos you take congresses parliamentsyou talk about the administration of state oooooh you yourself look at this sort of thing you know theres something wrong with what theyre doing and you say well its sort of unreasonable what theyre doing and so forth but actually nobody says what theyre doing is bzztbzztbzzt and what theyre not doing is bzztbzztbzzt and therefore were going to fall on our heads and the funny part of it is laying out this material in front of somebody or you can go too high with this material very quicklyyou know just go right over their heads like you do with pcbut in laying this material out in front of somebody who has any experience along this line at allhe says oh yes you know of course of course of course its like talking into steady cognition see yes yes of course well right yeah voom you know bang its been necessary to dig up the actual philosophy that underlies all these things not the ideas man has had concerning this sort of thing but what are the formulas which prompt him what are the actual formulas well you can very easily go upstairs too high you can say the formula of success in the modern world is and you can say well you get so you know what its all about and you get yourself label that means something and then you apply it and keep your nose clean and youll probably make it well i dont think anybody has said that to anybody really since about 1890 but youve given some sound advice to some young hopeful and had him sit there and look at you with completely dull eye you tell writer for instance i told wholei blew up whole writing class one time its wonder they all didnt leave school actually ithey relegated it to sort of getting the professor to reprimand it was the short story class of harvard iexcuse mehahvarrd and theythey made the mistake of having series of lectures from successful writers and each one of these gave them short series of lectures and all of these people were in class called creative writing and they were very nicely dressed children and so my lectures were very well received and so forth right up to point and on this point it all went over appetite over tin cup and into deep grave and after that i was really non persona grata atin harvard literature they probably will never even mention my name as revenge because what i told the class that caused them to completely blow up wasi said well i said when youwhen youve written few hundred thousand words why then youve got style and its taken about i think about hundred thousand words before i had any inkling of any kind of style and i suddenly noticedi looked aroundi had ai had class in front of that was in state of shock they had not just awakened they had awakened and gone into cataleptic fit and they were sitting there as though i had shot them with ray gun in the middle of their chest dont you see completely frozen and i was alert at this point and i said well whats the matter i said i only said hundred thousand words you know i got the idea quantity was wrong i only said well you have to write about hundred thousand words at least before you have any idea of having style nhaaa dlububblubudlebudlbduldtdtdt they talked to each other and talked to the professor and told that to him and walked off to the back of the room it had never occurred to those damned fools or that professor that writers write and this had nothing whatsoever to do with their education i know thats an unbelievable experience it left in state of shock well hubbards an awful bad fellow never forgave i was probably used as horrible example in that school for years i had given them data which was just too confounded far over their heads they had never come up in any gradient to writing i think that class was supposed to turn in story at the end of the year and their idea of story was maybe thousand words which they had been assidually assiduously working on for the last nine months and one of those stories of course was the equivalent of career you think im just being sarcastic its the reason the short short stories you can find short short stories all over the place everybody has got trunk full of short short stories that ever even dreamed of writing you count them up and you find out theyll go to thousand or fifteen hundred words well short story in actual fact by definition is five to six thousand words thats several short shorts its very interesting i had launched the datum that in order to be writer you have to write and the appalling concept which they couldnt confront was sitting down at table or typewriter and pounding out hundred thousand words and this just seemed so insurmountable and so incredible that they absolutely revolted against the whole idea and yet in that day and agein that day and age and so fortha writer was very often called on to get out hundred thousand words in quarter of year that was quite common and your top headliners were rolling at the rate of about eighty thousand words month so i was talking to them aboutabout months production as far as i was concerned and this didnt seem like anything to you see well hundred and twentyfive words minute or hundred and fifty minute typing speedcomposition speed ninetyfour words minutecount it up hundred thousand wordsthats nothing see you worked three hours day about three days week and spent the rest of the time standing down on the corner whistling see it wasnt even hard work you know or you wrapped both hands around dictaphone and there it was but you didnt have that barrier you werent up against this other barrier of oh you see so they hadnt been led into any kind of gradient scale of what writer would do or what was expected oror what the basic definition of writing was which is of course writing this is pretty idiotic see that if youre writer you write this had never occurred to them i think they were in the stage of being writer sort of synthetically without even any concept of what writer did do you follow that just like theres many business executives around sitting in big chair in big office with slightest concept of what theyre supposed to do and if you walked in and said your job is brrrbrrrbrrr business executive is supposed to business exec and this is how you business exec they would go waaah get out of here throw the bum out ooooo nothing could be worse oooh leave you in state of shock you say whats the matter with the fool whats the matter with the fool is hes being without doing and he is engaged in an activity which has not been defined hes administering and when you realize that one out of nineteen businesses established fail in their first year nobody has ever added up how many fail in the second you mustnt assume that because theyve lived two that theyd live forone that theyd live forever they dont at time when we see states and civilizations shrinking and perishing and so forth administration is some kind of aan odd art youre an administrator if youve gone to harvard or yale or if youve been with the firm for long time or if youve got pretty wife or if your taste in ties agrees with the managing editors or the managing directors drawing room furniture so that you always look nice to the old lady do you see and this is running civilization so you see once more were catching man out there is lot of technology around and today theres far more technology than there used to be this will amuse you very much theres lot more technology about business administration in existence today in universities by the way i must interject onethe only class notorious in universities for cheating in examinations and so forth is the business administration school theyre notorious and here wewhere weve caught man out to this degree and as i say theres more more material available today in the field of business administration than there was let us say fifteen years ago and the reason for this is the american management association copies everything we have they can get their hands on everything oh that sounds funny and theyd go in and theyd be the first people to deny it but then youre seldom given their little books but theyll take some kind of sentence out of something or other and theyll expand it out to whole magazine i checked up on this it was very hard to check up on iwe found them on ouron ouron our lines here and there and the clincher was when they issued us the program of their new york congress which was drawn up in exactly the same size format type titles seminars that we used in washington it was duplicate program it was lecture one lecture two the seminar times were the same it was the same number of days it was absolute carbon copying old nile adams over in the states says well you can pretty well tell what theyll dowhen he was speaking of general course ofof forward policy and so forthyou can pretty well tell what theyll do they copy you this was what he was using to predict with in the field of business that sooner or later they would copy something we were doing it hasntit hasnt just started yesterday you see i know this sounds awfully cheeky but when you realize the degree of alteris to which these people are capable its wonder you can recognize your stuff at all its like novelist after he sees his play or story on the screen thats mine even worse than that see now weve developed quite few things and as matter of fact several chaps who have gone through our organizations and so forth are now holding down big brass in some very interesting corporations so its wonder that this sort of thing follows but its still been without any basic philosophy of whats administration but the ball which im having is in order to put together the philosophy of administration youve got to put together the anatomy of organizations and what is basically the anatomy of organizations and this required this afternoon that i find the definitionthe formula of life now people have been naturally this is what it led back to organization is usually dedicated to the forward offorwarding of livingness or ending somebody elses livingness and you run square into this sooner or later as you go plowing around on this thing that you needjust to write up what youre doingyou actually have to have the formulathe formula not the definition as i started to saythe formula of life vital absolutely vital that you have to have that formula well lets see the hindus looked for it for fafaa and the persians looked for it and every religion weve got is some synthesis of expressing it and its been on its way for long time practically every novel that is ever written mentions in some snide or twisted way the fact the fellow is looking for the purpose of existence you see and i remember one great bestseller that finally dragged out persian carpet in the last paragraph and pointed it out to somebody that there was purpose whatsoever in the pattern of the carpet and that explained life man has run the gamut on this thing hes invented more formulas and hes invented more things but actually he really never got up to even calling it formula whats the formula of life and when you get at that level and tell somebody what the formula of life is then you do get blank look on their faces because it just doesnt make any sense at all they dont blow out the door on you they just quit they say well yeah i grant that yeah you tell somebody on the street this and thatd be yeah oh yeah everybody knows that and so on theres nothing to it they dont think youve told them anything and they cant grasp it and they feel little bit odd and it must have been what they had for lunch see it just would go sailing across the top of their heads you havent said anything it wouldnt be significant if you did say it they wouldnt make anything out of it except you actually can take this thing and redesign all there is to organizations organisms races species everything else under the sun moon and stars ill tell it to you i wont keep you on tenterhooks and so forth and some of you are just going to say oh yes of course but its simply living is having and following purpose thats all of it thats the formula of lifehave and follow purpose thats it if you do it youre living and if you dont do it youre not living and thats all there is to it ive now given you the basic fundamental of existence and that really is it here we had an operating principle of existence or common denominator to existence and we had that sort of thing told us what it was doing but remember that was what it was doing well this is the formula which underlies the doingness and it is just that and thats all it is its just having and following purpose and when you start to write this up of all the steps and ramifications and the anatomy of doing this you suddenly find that you are looking at one of these schemas that the germans are so fond of did you ever see one of these german schemas they put one little point down here and then that becomes two points and then the two points square and become four points and then theyou know and its the way they dream up their military command see commanding generaltwo four six and you got rack here that doubles or something like that every time its the pattern of an old german panzer division or something like that they call them schemaprobably mispronounced but im not giving it in german now you find yourself dealing with one of those things and you say wow you say what am i looking at im looking at the species called dog this is what this isthis is rats see this is that this is that this is organisms these are organizations these are civilizations these are states these areare this or that or the other thing and so forth and then you come back and look at it again you realize you can look over any state or organization so forth and look over these various parts find out the parts that are missing and estimate at once the degree of weakness or chaos which exists internally then you can estimate whether or not people are happy or unhappy in that state and then you actually could reform the state if it wasnt too lateits mostly too late right now with most of these civilizationsby taking certain steps buzbuzbuzbuzbuzbuz and all of sudden everybody would be happy as i say ive been having ball i kept landing into lower and lower echelons to this this is all level vii stuff im giving you actually but doesnt matter much because youre falling straight into it whether you like it or not youll suffer from it or benefit from it and so forth to the degree that its correctly followed because these are the formulasthe formulas if you please now there are certain formulasdown couple of echelons further there arethere are certain formulas whichfrom which you draw up the actions necessary to produce results which are beneficial or detrimental dont you see theres whole bunch of little formulas that follow out from this and of course you cut in along this line someplace and you look like youre dealing with fundamental youre staring at it man ill give you an idea youstaff auditor goes out and he looks at the purpose of theon the org board of athe hgc subpurpose is what it really is its subpurpose and he goes out and he looks at it this is not it but it says something like to make pcs happy and able or to make the able more ablesomething like that or to audit pcs to the highest case gain possible or something like this whatever he does he looks at that thing yes sir well thats good enough see thats good enough for him and he goes on working at this and this is fine whats the purpose that lies immediately above it well he actually could guess at this purpose if he looked at the subpurposes of the sections or units around him or the immediately adjacent departments and he could guess what probably would be up there see after hed spotted what was up there then he could guess about where it was going back there dont you see see he could probably trace one of these things back well as matter of fact people are usually quite content to ride at that point which was good thing because theres particular reason to do otherwise now this has negative proof this thing at the lower levels we examined the reactive bank very carefully and we find that the reactive bank has nothing under gods green earth in it but boobytrapped purposes and thats all its got in it its boobytrapped purposes and their locks see itreally its the boobytrapped purpose fixed up so it wont work or its backwards purpose so the guy cant have good purpose see which is thencaused jamup of subpurposes locks you see which has caused messup of his courses or policies or decisions in life which has then recorded the catastrophes which have ensued for having done so and those are the engrams of course thats really all there is in the entirety of the reactive mind but its negative proof because you get on down plumbing to the very bottom of the reactive mind and you find out there is nothing there but cockeyed and thwarted purposes its so constructed as to do just one thing excellently well and thats thwart purpose see it first gives lousy purpose and then thwarts it thats the double switcheroo of r6 well there might have been lots of other ways one could have accumulated reactive bank there might have been lot of other things that could have happened to the reactive bank but if so they never bit see there might have been lot of other things that one might of had in his reactive bank but theyre not there thats because they werent effective in holding anybody down or aberrating him and so it went out of style it isnt there there isnt even ghost of it on the track you wouldnt even find them if you looked for them do you see so actually the successful way of not living is to have purposes boobytrapped and unfollowable so if you wanted to fix up somebody so he wouldnt live why youd just give him crossedup purposes and make it impossible for him to follow those and then of course barrier out any possibility of following good purpose and you would just have him in trap and if you want to know how is living being trapped that is the full description of the furthest reaches and ramifications of trap whatever else the trap consists of it has that as its elements all of which is very fascinating because it tells us at once why you have an unhappy civilization it tells you whathow many people are in the mental hospitals it tells you why this has been very unhappy universe ever since people started accumulating reactive banks of this particular character and answers an awful lot of questions in an awful hurry but at the same time it makes it possible on more mundane and less esoteric and ivorytowered level to simply draw up the patterns of our organizations you see weve been doing it right so far andinstinctively like turning around three times to find out if there are any snakes in the bed but exactly what were we doing and that is the immediate study under hand and ii tell you since i got home i have worn out more ballpoints and japanese sign pens than you can shake stick at i mean theyevery little while clunk clunk one goes into the wastebasket its empty you know takes long time to wear them out theyre supposed to wear out forthey werethey were originally released to wear forever you know and ive driven everybody half mad trying to dig up all the white long paper in the place and so forth and just keepsdrawers keep getting empty of it and they were down to i think two reams couple of days three days ago the poor mimeograph department is of course going mad because im not taking any chance on drawing all this up in manuscript form you see thats for little bit later but drawing it all up in manuscript form and getting it well typed so it can sit on some shelf or sit on some printers desk you see we need it desperately but somebody up inin essexonkent you know hashes got thishes got this and hes got the best intentions of the world to turn it out next year you know so what im doing is that i put lot of this stuff on the general nonremimeo line which iswhats called the general nonremimeo linethat is to say key personnel and orgs get copies of itso that the technology does exist see and that lets of course mimeo here simply type them out from the written notes type them directly onto stencil run them off dont you see and make this limited number of copies and so forth and distribute them but ever since i gothave gotten home why theirtheir line is just jammed like that and i heard them in hco the other day ever since youve been home ive hardly had time to catch my breath little valerie up in london bless her tongue hanging out you know and of course theyll all try to get this in as quick as possible itll make quite stir so therefore im trying to issue it in such way that it wont make much of stir but oddly enough theyre pretty good at handling this sort of thing theyre accustomed to it and the changeorganizational pattern change which we put in in midsummeri tested it at saint hill and so forth and finally sent it out to themincome started going up at you didnt check that as factor on following up the raw data of that organization when did they receive that new pattern anyway yeah iwe were trying to trace down the reason for resurgence in order to reorganize certain org hahahow interesting we didntwe didnt take that into account anyhow this is theafter that reorganization we have now had the first booms this was just the reorganization see and it wasnt complete reorganization well weve had the first booms and the first record breakers in terms of weeks in expansion that wed had for about three years there were lot of factors could have entered into this dont you see but that change or smoothing out an organization instead of damming it up and confusing it dont you see let the lines flow faster and better that was obvious that this had done so and of course weve got the rest of the little changes because i just changed them far enough to take some major kinks out at the level they were operating on and then weve got the other clingclingcling that goes in right behind it that organizes it from the top to the bottom now we come to the basic test when you start out at the bottom and start organizing upward you can reach point in greater complexity where you have to look back at the bottom and find out if the bottom could be in any way reorganized to fit the top and when you find out that thethe smallest unit of your activity that is the smallest group or the smallest organization is unable to fit in by reducing again your big organization you realize theres lot of kinks in the line you understand could we take central organizationone of the bigbigger ones you seetake central organization and take its pattern just as weve got it and reduce it down as of this minute and wind up with very smoothly running city office could we do that could we reduce the size of it and the answer is it would look very silly because youd have somebody got laugh out of some executives the other day i said well i i said we dont want to make this look like city office org board well it wouldnt be much of joke to you unless youd ever seen city office organization org board in its earlier stages its very ridiculous affairits been in the pastbecause its got full organizational chart there dont you see and its got all of the posts but there are only about three names that repeat back and forth on all these posts dont you see and if you looked at it at distance from eight or nine feet it would look like they had quite an organization you see well of course theyre running quite different than that org board they couldnt possibly run in accordance to the org board and theyre trying to make do well that isgives you immediate clue as to whether or not youre on the ball in your big organizational pattern because if your big organizational pattern doesnt smoothly reduce it wont smoothly expand you see you can take ayou could take backwards look at all this if it doesntif you cant reduce it down without catastrophe occurring well you of course wont expand it without catastrophe so something that can be reduced or expanded and so forth must be pretty smooth fundamental setup and thats what weve done right now weve already got this and im trying to write up the various ramifications and exploring the philosophy of this to see whether or not it fits and doesnt fit and actually it does it goes right down to the bottom to city office and an organizational pattern now whether it fits an individual or not thats athats another question see so maybe it isnt perfect yet but thats pretty good weve never before been able to get it down to city office ill tell you what it is ill give you very briefvery very brief résumé here of organizational structure theres divisions 1 2 and 3 this is the new divisional structure now heretofore we have had two divisions division was hco and the central org this is the way we referred to them so it was hco and the central org you see and hco was covered by the hco secretary and the central org was covered by the association or organization secretary there were two zones and there were actually two heads of this organization but they had different functions all right well this is expanded now because in trying to fix up the org charts why there were two functions which didnt fit smoothly under either one and one function which was entirely adrift the two functions which didnt fit smoothly on the internationali mean on big organization boards were materiel and accounts and these didnt fit smoothly under either hco or the organization or association secretary they were always worrying the org sec he was always getting onto accounts and he was always getting into materiel and he was always getting here and there and the other thing so obviously there was something adrift because he was wearing another hat there very strongly and yet apparently he had materiel unit and he apparently had an accounts unit but somehow or another he was always wearing these hats well rather than blame all the personnel in sight well lets just not see if the lines are little bit in error and sure enough they are this is not intended to be very authoritative rundown on the situation but ill just tell you what its all about division 1 is hco which issues the data and policyhco thats division 1 see and then theres division 2 and division 2all they do is apply and service deliver you see with training and processing see and you could say all right well the technology is issued by hco and the training and processing are done by division 2 see division 1 issues it and division 2 uses it and you get down to division 3 and division 3 collects the money and the mest it takes care of the mest see so you in actual fact have very smooth gradient youve got the idea and the management and the pickup and the police of this thing see moving over intohere into the use of the thing moving over here into the care and preservation of the thing see which gives you three divisions and those three divisions are expressed at board level and theres an international boardregardless of how many scientology corporations there are this international board controls all of them anyhow so it doesnt matter and the international board has three divisions and each board member is the head of each division there are three board members and those three board members are of course im hco always have been so thats change mary sue always in very close communication and so forth with secretarial aspects and training and processing shes always been working in that particular field org sec and then the third onemarilyn withworking into the area of accounts and materiel with all of the mest and so forth along that line thats three divisions and then youve got an echelon which exactly matches that one below it and then youve got an echelon which exactly matches that in every continent and then youve got an echelon that matches that in every organizationevery central organization city office in other words this is repeating action if you think of it as the board level all right board level except these others are assistant boards see so theres the international board and then theres assistant boards from there on through and theyre all composed of division 1 division 2 division 3 which is answerable to the next board immediately above them which makes perfectly smooth threeway channel all the way down now these three functions are tremendously interlocked theyre interlocked on purpose dont you see so they wont separate and so forth now of course hco doesnt own its mest you see thats actually owned by division 3 same way with division 2 it doesnt own its mest thats owned by division 3 it can have its label on mest but it doesnt own it it cant sell it it cant buy it it had damn better well take care of it but hco handles everybodys communications and it doesnt matter what those communications are if theres any communications anyplace anywhere why theyre carried by hco and the third division in trying to get money in from the mailbox into the accounts office or from the registrar to the accounts office and so forth is dependent on hco keeping the line in there see and laying it in of course they supervise it and make sure that it stays in but hco makes sure that it stays in on the basis of communication policy hcos always manage to do this very well they do good job of this they sometimes get busy in some other quarters and that sort of thing neglect it for while but youll normally see somebody all of sudden perking up and alerting up and finding the lines arent running someplace or another and saying aaahr and whats that full inbasket you know ive seen full inbasket there for days and days and days and days and days what is this you know wake up and straighten it up these are functions by the way which theyve always performed oddly enough see so theres really nothing very new in this its the smooth channel of it all and then everybody and everything is trained or processed in division 2 there are staff training courses which are run outside of the academy and hgc see in other words the d of tif theres training course around why thats his baby you see it doesnt matter if its an administrative course and it doesnt matter if its technical course and it doesnt matter what kind of course it is if its training thats his babyin division 2 see if its done in that field he does it and if theres any processing aroundit doesnt matter if thats an assist by some field auditor sitting on the front doorstep and fixing up the local errand boy with touch assist man thats the d of ps see anywhere anywhere in that zone anyplace field auditors auditing pcs students auditing students in the academy or anyplace else if theresif theres any auditing being done its the director of processing thats it see this is now talking about central organization that makes this course little bit different because theres hgc at saint hill its the only thing missing around here so processing then tends to fall back onto the course or its instructors and is little hat that ive noticed everybody including tends to wear from time to time wheres somebody that really takes care of the case you know well in central orgs and so forth well we have somebody that takes care of the cases and thats the d of p so that type andof activity then of any kind that is processing thats ordered for any reason or done for any reason and so forth is done in the hgc now of course academies will be very jealous and safeguard this sort of thing from hgcs interfering or getting too deep into the academy and telling students how they must audit that sort of thing and so forth but in actual fact they are both members of the same division and thats one of these close things that they can work out so therefore if you had somebody who was supervising cases or marking folders or doing something like that in the academy he would do it slightly under an hgc hat dont you see this would be the way well we find out that academies dont mark folders very well so theres been something wrong with that line you see we find hgcs do fine job of testing and marking folders you see but academies dont so worked that way why that line can be settled out there because thats in the division so therefore hco personnel is trained by division 2 and so is division 3 personnel theyre once more trained by division 2 see theres checksheet its done by division 2 so you got your interlock of 1 2 3 and there are functions outside these things now this is an assistant board im talking about well of course thats new term there is such thing anywhere in the world as an assistant board whats an assistant board well its an assistant board thats what it is mysterious ramifications read into it it just is that and of course it has of course assistant board members well whats an assistant board member whats an assistant board well assistant board could obviously assist board in recommending resolution or it could recommend some action be taken of board nature someplace and send it to the board and get it taken dont you see and it could also be composed of assistant board members who help the board members wear their hats the board then consists of chairman secretary and treasurer on the international boardchairman being hco division 1 secretaries being training and processing division 2 treasurer being materiel and accounts division 3 very elementary so of course the chap who is in chargewell the fellow in charge of the board in the continent of zec the fellow in charge of zecs assistant board dont you see would be the assistant chairman he has authority in his own right his authority is delegated to him so hes the assistant chairman and he heads up division 1 and the other title the person would haveits very odd that itd be chairman because it would be an hco area secretary see the person would have another title and secretaryorganization secretary or association secretary would be division 2 dont you see but he would be an assistant secretary in actual fact that would be hisand hed be an assistant board member these titles he would all have dont you see and then thethe third board member would be of course the assistant treasurer and that person would also be an assistant board member do you see and that person might accumulate some other title like accounts executive or something like that you seewhich hasnt been specified by the way the others have been but assistant treasurer is so good that thats fine everybody was very happy with that one so that reflects and gives you an assistant board well the assistant board of course doesnt have any power to make resolution but it has the power to recommend one and of course in their own right on delegated authority they have the right to run their owntheir own area divisions you see well so thethats your board structure and it goes all the way to the bottom now any city office would have this same structure now the reason why this isnt all done thewellnow mans frailty in running things with boards has been the lack of certain thing he was always trying to decide before the fact on things on which two of the members were not informed so you actually always had dizzy situation where nobody who was specialized in the area could make up his mind anyway and they just got into sort of rubberstamp situation or they all had to study each others despatch lines and they were all duplicate personnel that had to read all the despatches that related to anybody you see and it was just an overwork situation so you either sat there for two or three days week holding board meetings and getting nothing done and really in the end really just rubber stamping them or you got on with your job and didnt hold any board meetings at all which is the usual way we have solved it in scientology we have tohave to take that out you see but what weve actually done in reorganizational patternswhat ive actually done is simply try really to codify and straighten out what we actually are doing and what we have done successfully its not brandnew structure its structure which is based simply on what we have been doing and trying to get it represented with some reality on the actual org boards so you of course then have two departments under hco and youve got two departments under training and processing and youve got two unitsbecause they are not production statusunder the assistant treasurer which gives you six unitdepartment activity in other words there are six parts to central organization and the seventh part is its executive board level so there are only seven basic hats theres the departmental hats and the board hats see thats roughly adding them up so there are six of them and what are the two of hco well youve seen those around all the time except the poor blokes have gotten scattered here and there and the other place and so forth well hco simply takes over all of the mimeograph machinery and the publication machinery and central files and anything that had anything to do with communications or communication recordscommunications communication equipment communication records thats the mimeograph machine thats the central files thats anything anything related see and that of course is used by the registrar and the letter registrar and thats all germane to that particular section and so forth so thats promreg department of promotion and registration and thats all one department under hco it swings right on down from the hco area secretary straight into this department because hco is on this line this way it workstheres another formula as it goyou go across parallel hco promotes the service departments deliver and the materielaccounts people collect see pdrumpowpow see so that lines up across on parallel so of course all promotion comes under hco this by the way is whats been going on for years i mean i do all the promotion and hco secretary does promotion they do the magazine must have been an awful strain sometimes having the registrar distant from this point and not being able to coordinate the registrars activities with the current campaigning and it must have been stretch i can imagine there have been such creaks thats one of these little points i say thatyou know that you look around them real quick and everybody has been looking around that curve and not really seeing what curve it is so thats the department of promotion and registration under hco and of course hco hashasis above this and below it communications unit for the whole organization you see so that communications function runs through there so theres person called an hco communicator who handles this sort of thing and then there is the book department and so forth i by the way put the mimeoi saidremember i said mimeo went under hco it doesnt go under promreg it goes under books all publications magazines hats bulletins everythingthats all publications thats all issued by the publications department you want to know where the hats are kept in the organizationnot in the hco area secretarys desk theyre kept down in the book storage department with all the rest of the books see and theyre issued the same way except theyre issued to certain people and that sort of thing and theresthatsthat book system we put onto that line well where do you get your bulletins and where are bulletins issued and who issues the bulletins and that sort of thing well theyre issued by the book department of course under the direction of the hco secretary yeah its an elementary line which actually gives these people some more personnel toto work with because it lets these personnel double apparently two functions that have been spread this way have been brought together again without releasing or dismissing any personnel so that ought to work better and you naturally gotin the middle of this line youve got the hgc and youve got the academy the academy and hgc is the seniority by the way and youve got the hgc processing all the pcs and youve got the academy training all the students but you also have the hgc supervising and handling and issuing and ordering any and all processing that happens there and that by the way was step of many many oh i dont know maybe year or two ago i said the d of p owned all of the folders in an entire area and he had all the cases and they were his well thats an extension of that thing so the hgcit doesnt matterclear out to the borders of the zone or area of the activity you know of the central organization wherever it reaches to and so forth any case in that belongs to theto the hgc see the d of pany regulation of it so an hco area secretary talking to somebody and trying to settle up this beef on the promotional line dont you see and so forth is in actual fact only doing an advisory thing whether or not this person gets any actual processing or what process is run on the person or that sort of thing would actually be decided by the hgc do you see that so somebody comes in wonders about thiswell thats referred to the hgc now the final two points there are very easy to figure out all purchasing purchasing is always getting knocked into the accounts department and out of it and into it and theyre always trying to fool around with this and materiels had an awful time it always is just trying to get something sometimes it handles purchasing sometimes accounts handles the purchasing sometimes they mix up one way or the other and they obviously are hand in glove so they are two units and theres of course the personnel in charge of each one of those two units of simply materieland thats supplies of any kind whatsoever office supplies hcos office supplies everybodys office suppliesare handled by materiel and hco gets cleaned by materiel and janitors and so forth all function under materiel and anything like grounds or buildings or anything like buying or selling buildings or anything that has anything to do with buildings tools anything else inventories and all that sort of thing my god endlessly you seethats all under materiel and so forth and accounts well that has to do with money and it has to do with contracts and it has to do with exterior legal which is where that finally wound upexterior legal and exterior legal means anybody suing you or your suing anybody else or so forth well theyve got lot of exterior legal but internal legal is hco of course of course thatsbecause thats on the policy line now hco has lot of other interrelationships in the organization but they are all very quickly and very easily defined under the headings that i have just given you see theres lot of little bits and pieces dont you see but those bits and pieces you find out snap into place very quickly and very easily seeclick click well like here at saint hill you always find reception is the person who goes aroundin times when theres lots of personnel around its usually reception that takes around the tea to personnel well reception is under hco see telephone is under hco you see that all falls together bodies walking in and out as long as theyre on lines belong to hco dont you see doing anything with it it hasnt anything to do with that see just like despatch as long as the despatch is on the lineroute to basket why it belongs to hco and the second its in the basket why somebody else is doing something with that dont you see the basket however belongs to materiel so thats the interlock and i think youll find that very smoothworking interlock well now weve had difficulty several diffthings have been difficult and one of them is getting from echelon to echelon that is to say how do you get from the echelon of continental to saint hill well you get another postand we havent yet decided exactly what this post is called but well call it for the moment one that were familiar with this is executive director and we theoretically would have assistant executive directors below each posteacheach assistant board he doesnt run things but hes the liaison for the adjacent boards above below or parallel i found out one of the reasons scientology had trouble expanding is you cant write to board and people atat the level dont you see of an assistant board well takelets take melbourne all right there are three people in melbourne theresthered bethered be your hco area sec which weve got the association sec and there would be an assistant treasurer all right theyre all in line there and they have an awful time with perth and finally it has to go to top dog status you see to have anything happen in perth and so on well what is the line into that board well you make person you call him assistant executive director melbournethis probably is not the term well use im just using the familiar oneand hes the guy that you route anything to above below down around but not to the organization heres board here at saint hill but it hasit has board under it well the saint hill board really messes everything up like mad if it addresses the saint hill organization do you see but it hasif it has an executive director if the international board has an executive director and the saint hill assistant board has an assistant direcexecutive director then those two boards can communicate otherwise they cant because they are multiple things and of course see those two echelons cant communicate unless theres channel through which they communicate so you have an assistant executive director saint hill who has orders over the saint hill staff to amount to anything because thatsthats yourthats your boards see thats your councils you might say they go back forth up down parallel and so forth through that post well itd be the assistant executive director cape town who would be the one who you communicated to and through when you wanted to get to the board or when it wanted to attachitsit wanted to get something settled with durban and it would get in touch with the assistant executive director durban dont you see its probably just board officer is what it really is and its an assistant board officer thats all and it just passes these lines but doesnt work like man works now heres the main principle thats been discovered here is that if you monkey around in board meeting to get everybodys agreement youre governing by agreement and by god theres nothing more dangerous in the human race that you ever had anything to do with it because the thing that is mainly there to get agreed with is the reactive bank and if everybody has got the same bank you know very well what they will eventually develop theyll develop earth nothing more need be said you dont want this what you want this is board actionthis is board or committee action that it has members who have functions and they are perfectly free to do what they please with full board or assistant board permission until checked or stopped by the assistant board action and thats true of each member of the board or assistant board in other words hes perfectly free to run his job and to run his division hes perfectly free to run his departments and to decide and have his decision he canthes not perfectly free dont you seehco isnt perfectly free to run division 2 they can kick division 2 around if it isnt following along certain hco lines but theyre not freethe board member you see of division 1 really isnt free to upset the staff of division 2 dont you see thatsvuuuuhthats what you get when you have all these board meetings you see you got every board member is trying to wear every hat divisionyou got an assistant board member who is division 1 thats the hco area secretary she got two departments and she runs them and she runs them any damn way she pleases and makes any decision she pleases as long as its successful and forwards the basic purpose of the organization and scientology and the departments you see fine right up to the moment when there is aan assistant board meeting and the two members say you must not do you understand its tacit approval of everything everybody does except they see them doing something they dont like and then they can by majority vote knock them in the head but they cant cancel it if its referred in other words the hco area secretary of division 1 has got recourse because its not unanimous so it goes to the next upper board for decisionnext upper assistant board for decisionthrough its assistant executive director so in actual fact the top dog of each lower assistant board is actually the assistant executive director of an upper board if you look that over very carefully you will see thats very tricky and trying to get it through your head exactly how that works out may give you headache but its very simple when you see it on an org board and you really hadought to plot it on an org board because actually it means that the person who is the assistant executive director of the continental assistant board of australia and the person who sayswho would ordinarily be looked to to tell that assistant board to get in line happens to be at saint hill and the person who tells the perth assistant board to get in line is actually located at the continental assistant board and is the assistant executive director on that board maybe miles and miles away and boy thats good thing because it gives totally dispassionate view of the situation without an embroilment in local personalities and then we lay down this that he can only go on raw statistics he cant go on rumors he cant go on any of that stuff raw datathats all he wants thats all he wants he doesnt want anybodys opinion oh you say hco is doing an awful bad job out in perth huh well well well all right this is maybe too hot to handle i dont want to handle this because i cant remove one or all of them but i wontill look this over and see if i recommend that something be done to that person you know and this is the only thing hes permitted to judge on whats the statistics not is she nice girl not is bessie ann in accounts mad at her not has somebody who is the assistant gardener written vicious letter to ron concerning her that has nothing to do with it nothing to do with it its justwhat are the statistics of division 1 perth so many committees of evidence requested so many given so many bulletins received and issued so many flubbed so many books sold so many books not sold you got the idea how much traffic has been driven aroundin on the organization what promotion campaigns what is the proportional signup of the registrar registrar has fortyfive interviews week signed up twelve people on an average is that good or bad you get the idea seems to have spent tremendous numberamount of money on books and hasnt sold many lets look it over in other words weve got the raw statistics of that department sitting right there under our nose because its got two production departments and very easy to evaluate see is it running or isnt it running and the moment that you trust interpersonal relations into the upset or handling or managing of the peace here in the absence of fact youre tampering with the environment you have the board of directors of luminum aluminum flushboxes incorporated and theyve got beautiful dining room and they heard this wonderful tale about this young genius who is out in bukwuk because their aunts told them so they make him the general manager of bukwuk this is how you destroy empires and taking the sayso of the most entheta character in the organization as the proper opinion of the people in charge of the organization of course puts everybody at risk instantly immediately and at once so you just say oh bill zugzug wrote bad report on mamie huh well thats very very interesting whats the via lines whats the via linebill zugzugs via lines whatwhatlets see heslets see hes assistant to the assistant to the assistant to the assistant janitor all right and hes in division 3 and mamie is inshes typist over here in promreg what routing did you get the despatch ontelepathy what value does the thing have dont you see has value at all now you want to know who should be putting thesomebody is recommending that you beput somebody in charge of typing pool someplace or another and so forth well its very simple how many letters did they get out if this is what theyre in for why thats your action line how many letters should be gotten out how many letters were gotten out over what period of time what was thewhat was the period thats all and this sounds awfully brutal and it sounds like somebody is being very mechanical what somebody is doing is just cutting the throat of all these rumor entheta tanglefoot lines and letting us get on with the job see thats the only thing that makes any difference because you find out this is coordinative factor you find out if anybody was sitting at typewriter doing the job over shortcertain space of time they would have gotten out so many letters dont you see if they get out more than the average why very possibly they could persuade somebody else to get out some letters if after we put her in charge of the typing battery why the typing battery production falls off and goes into complete spin we try to find out if that reason is traceable to itssome of the other causes but it went into complete spin so we decide at that moment that that was the wrong person to put in charge of the typing battery and her appointment was only temporary anyway so we put her back get the idea not whether or not she was very charming to the org sec see thats high crime not high crime funny definition but its do you see now of course actually this person has to be personable one way or the other and this person has to be persuasive and the person certainly has to be either screaming genius on the subject of policy or follow policy one way or the otherto have gotten the quota out because it of course confirms basic policy or not this is very simple then well your organization can live then as long as people are following the basic purpose and it isnt too impeded and the organization will live and people in itll be happy if thats done otherwise theyll be very unhappy and very miserable so it sounds very very robot you know what are the statistics give the raw data on that you want what whats the data youve just had letter from josie huh well all right fine im very glad youve had letter from josie and she says that the association secretary should be shot well thats very very interesting im very very fascinated and so on was it written in chinese or russian whats the statistics of the organization oh its been on steady rise there hasnt been any falloff of any kind whatsoever go get lost we have some emergencies on another continent that doesnt happen to be an emergency got the idea so if you do good job why youre let get on with it if you do real good job why you get kicked upstairs simple elementary if youre personality whiz kid great itll show up in the statistics you understand and thats basically how civilization is killing itself today is not lettingnot setting up any system by which its basic purpose is forwarded by its personnel and choosing the people who forward its basic purpose and thats how theyre killing themselves they choose people because their ties match the managing directors wifes piano scarf you know or wouldthat they hold good liquor the united states navy in actual fact chooses officers solely on the basis of whether or not their wives are socially acceptable and i wont say agreeable but its gone to pieces completely had nothing whatsoever to do with organizational pattern well ive had to dig all this stuff up and ferret it all out and i found it very very interesting and i didnt know i had to reach that far back and dig into the very woof and warp of the universe just to find out how to get us running org but ive had to do so and its been fairly successful and i hope the information will be of some help to you and make things easier for you as you go along thank you
