implications for the united states updated april 4 2006 bruce vaughn coordinator analyst in southeast and south asian affairs foreign affairs defense and trade division wayne m morrison specialist in international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade division congressional research service the library of congress chinasoutheast asia relations trends issues and implications for the united states summary southeast asia has been considered by some to be region of relatively low priority in us foreign and security policy the war against terror has changed that and brought renewed us attention to southeast asia especially to countries afflicted by islamic radicalism to some this renewed focus driven by the war against terror has come at the expense of attention to other key regional issues such as chinas rapidly expanding engagement with the region some fear that rising chinese influence in southeast asia has come at the expense of us ties with the region while others view beijings increasing regional influence as largely natural consequence of chinas economic dynamism chinas developing relationship with southeast asia is undergoing significant shift this will likely have implications for united states interests in the region while the united states has been focused on iraq and afghanistan china has been evolving its external engagement with its neighbors particularly in southeast asia in the 1990s china was perceived as threat to its southeast asian neighbors in part due to its conflicting territorial claims over the south china sea and past support of communist insurgency this perception began to change in the wake of the asian financial crisis of 199798 when china resisted pressure to devalue its currency while the currencies of its neighbors were in free fall today chinas charm offensive has downplayed territorial disputes while focusing on trade relations with southeast asia which are viewed by some as the catalyst for expanding political and security linkages in november 2004 china and the association of southeast asian nations asean includes brunei burma cambodia indonesia laos malaysia philippines singapore thailand and vietnam agreed to gradually remove tariffs and create the worlds largest free trade area by 2010 china is also beginning to develop bilateral and multilateral security relationships with southeast asian states this report explores what is behind this shift in chinaasean relations and how it may affect american interests in the region the key policy issue for congress is to assess how the united states should view chinas expanding posture in southeast asia and decide what is the best way to react to this phenomenon contents americas interests in the region 4 chinese interaction with southeast

projections for asean countries china the united states and the world various years 19 chinasoutheast asia relations trends issues and implications for the united states americas global and regional interests are linked in southeast asia decision makers have observed that the most important bilateral relationship of the 21st century is likely to be that between china and the united states and that the likelihood of conflict and economic trauma will be great if it is poorly managed but that the benefits in terms of economic prosperity and world peace will be great if it is handled well1 moving from the global to the regional level of analysis others have observed the following with regard to southeast asia chinas ultimate strategic purpose remains subject of debate and speculation among interested observers southeast asia however is the sole region adjacent to china in which chinese influence can most easily expand benign interpretation would see china as simply cultivating the sort of stable peaceful and prosperous regional environment that china requires for its own successful modernization more skeptical view sees china playing longterm game designed to curtail american influence and weave closeknit economic and security community with china at the center2 chinas economic growth is dramatically changing its economic and political relations with the world including southeast asia an area where the united states has strong economic political and strategic interests this report will discuss issues related to chinas rapidly expanding ties with southeast asia few major international relationships have changed as much or as quickly in recent years as has the relationship between china and the association of southeast asian nations asean3 many observers see that relationship as having been transformed from one of suspicion and fear driven at first by ideology and then largely by ongoing territorial disputes to one of increasing cooperation and collaboration particularly in the area of trade4 this shift in the geopolitical 1 prepared statement of the honorable james leach chairman subcommittee on asia and the pacific house international relations

the 10 asean states have population of approximately 500 million and gdp of approximately 737 billion 4 alice ba china and asean renavigating relations for 21st century asian survey continued crs2 orientation of southeast asia is part of what some see as larger shift in the international balance of power which puts the rise of asia in general and china in particular on scale equivalent to the rise of western europe in the 17th century or the rise of the united states at the beginning of the 20th century5 some view the united states as unprepared to deal with this restructuring of the global balance of power others have observed in the southeast asian context that there has not been time when the us has been so distracted and china so focused6 this distraction is largely due to the us focus on the war in iraq such fundamental change has the potential to affect american interests many analysts expect that chinas history and culture will play key role in shaping chinas external relations in this view china is engaged in drive to regain its rightful place this drive has two key components the first is the drive for unity which involves the control of taiwan tibet and xinjiang which are outside the scope of this report the second drive is to restore chinas traditional influence among its neighbors china appears to view southeast asia as potentially the most fruitful and receptive region for the projection of chinese influence7 this drive could potentially but not necessarily bring american and chinese interests into competition andor conflict in southeast asia chinas relations with southeast asia have been described by some analysts as either part of traditional confucian tribute system or more recently as part of more western concept of sphere of influence8 the united states has both sought to engage china and viewed china as strategic competitor the george w bush administration moderated its initial view which emphasized china as strategic competitor this shift has been explained by the need for chinas cooperation in the war against terror and on other issues while the war against terror has changed the dynamics of the relationship it has not changed the underlying factors that led many in the united states to view china as strategic competitor also while the united states has adopted more cooperative policy towards china in recent years japan the principal us ally in asia appears to be increasingly wary of chinas power with some in japan viewing it as potential military threat9 4 continued julyaugust 2003 5 fareed zakaria americas big

crs3 chinas embrace of marketled economic development may mitigate against past assertive postures in the region and lead to more multilateral and cooperative approaches chinas increasingly active diplomacy towards southeast asia can be viewed as benign outgrowth of its efforts to achieve economic development for the betterment of its people or as part of an assertive foreign policy chinas embrace of multilateral initiatives such as the 2003 treaty of amity and cooperation with asean the east asia summit and efforts to forge chinaasean free trade area which was advanced in november 2004 are variously viewed as evidence of nonthreatening tradefocused china or as part of an evolving grand strategy that will rely on formal and informal mechanisms strengthened multilateral institutions and strong economic ties respectively of interdependence as facto strategy for restraining the united states10 for further information see crs report rl33242 east asia summit issues for congress by bruce vaughn chinas rise also creates concern about how beijing will use its growing economic and military power militarily china is the dominant regional power in asia and one of the worlds emerging great powers some analysts view the emergence of new great power onto the world stage as causing likely disruption to the existing balance of power which could lead to conflict others see the potential to manage such shift in the balance of power in peaceful manner how china engages southeast asia may tell us much about the nature of chinas rise in the view of one analyst with regard to asia china seeks to promote an image of being able to handle its greater economic and strategic clout responsibly china wants to play constructive role in regional economic and political affairs perhaps with view to building stable foundation for greater influence in the future11 for others there is concern that as chinas power grows so too will chinas ambition and assertiveness12 there are some recent signs that china may seek to expand its economic and political influence in southeast asia into the security realm as well while chinese efforts to expand its economic and political influence are regarded as benign by many views of chinas overall posture in the region may change if it seeks to develop new militarytomilitary relations with southeast asian states some analysts feel that such an expansion of influence would likely raise broader concerns in defense policy circles and could be viewed as challenge to americas posture in the region 10 yong deng and thomas moore china

trends and us interests december 12 2001 crs4 americas interests in the region how chinas growing assertiveness may impact american regional interests in southeast asia depends on how us interests are defined the following are traditionally considered to be americas key regional interests13 promotion of stability and balance of power with the strategic objective of keeping southeast asia from being dominated by any hegemon prevent being excluded from the region by another power or group of powers freedom of navigation and protection of sea lanes trade and investment interests support of treaty allies and friends promotion of democracy rule of law human rights and religious freedom another more recent addition to the list is preventing the region from becoming base of support for terrorists the us national security strategy statement calls on china to act as responsible stakeholder that fulfills its obligations and works with the united states and others to advance the international system it goes on to state that if china pursues transformative path of peaceful development the united states will welcome the emergence of china that is peaceful and prosperous and that cooperates with us to address common challenges and mutual interests14 to promote its interests relative to china in southeast asia the united states has generally followed strategy that maintains balance of power in the region through our alliances and military presence while also engaging china to encourage simultaneously its responsible integration into international affairs 15 assistant secretary of state for east asian and pacific affairs james kelly in testimony before the house international relations committee in june 2004 stated that this is time of transition in the region and emphasized that at the top of our list of policy priorities is waging the war against terror before he identified the philippines and thailand as well as japan south korea and australia as traditional allies and strategic partners in and beyond the region singapore was also identified as an effective partner for building regional security he also 13 see also robert kerrey chair and robert manning project

initiative eai which seeks to strengthen americas relations with asean under eai the united states is seeking to develop free trade agreements with southeast asian states singapore was the first to sign an agreement with the united states16 discussions with thailand have followed despite these initiatives and statements of us goals some analysts perceive the united states as distracted by iraq and afghanistan and as result not sufficiently focused on southeast asia beyond its status as the second front in the war against terror this has led some to view us policy as unnecessarily narrow in focus17 in the view of one observer china is seen by some to be slowly filling the vacuum left behind by the united states in the political economic and security spheres in the region18 these perspectives differ with official us pronouncements us officials have stated our relationships in the region including five treaty allies and numerous friendships are as strong as ever19 chinese interaction with southeast asia chinas historical involvement in southeast asia as well as cultural affinity for china in many southeast asian states will likely influence how china is viewed by regional states20 historically china has exerted much influence in southeast asia this can be seen in chinas past cultural influence in and past dominance of vietnam as well as today through its increasing presence in burma while chinese influence has extended through its contiguous borders with continental southeast asia there was brief period from 1405 to 1433 when china sent vast fleets under the command of zheng he through southeast asia and into the indian ocean littoral to exact tribute for the ming dynasty21 the chinese diaspora has also led to significant ethnic chinese minority populations in burma thailand malaysia the philippines and indonesia vietnams relationship with china differs from other asean states unlike other southeast asian states vietnam was ruled by china for lengthy period of its history during the cold war china supported communist parties or insurgencies in every southeast asian state with the exception of 16 james kelly assistant secretary of state for

burma this was ended in the 1980s22 currently between 30 and 40 million ethnic chinese reside in southeast asia23 the degree to which ethnic chinese have been integrated into southeast asian societies has varied greatly across the region with chinese being relatively better integrated in nonmuslim states than muslim majority states while ethnic chinese have been subject to past abuses and discrimination the trend line for earlier waves of chinese immigration has been towards greater levels of integration into their respective new homelands most of the chinese of southeast asia come from guangdong and fujian province the over two million ethnic chinese in singapore make up approximately eighty percent of singapores population and make it the only country in southeast asia with an ethnic chinese majority ethnic chinese are largely assimilated in thailand predominantly buddhist country whose ethnic chinese population of over five million constitutes over 10 of the population ethnic chinese have not assimilated to the same degree in the muslim states of southeast asia as they have in thailand or cambodia while ethnic chinese in malaysia which also number over 5 million and constitute 28 of the population have prospered they are subject to laws that discriminate in favor of bumiputeras who are the ethnic malays and indigenous peoples of malaysia it is reported that much of the antichinese sentiment has subsided in southeast asia24 events such as the recent opening of new chinese language university demonstrate increasing acceptance of ethnic chinese in malaysia indonesia has the largest ethnic chinese population in southeast asia with some 8 million having chinese ancestry between 500000 and 15 million indonesians were killed in the wake of failed coup in the 1965 many of these were ethnic chinese members of the communist party of indonesia a1967 law subsequently banned public displays of chinese culture this abuse and negative attitude towards ethnic chinese in indonesia has been reversed with the chinese new year officially recognized in indonesia in 200325 recent waves of chinese immigration into southeast asia particularly in burma and thailand are playing key role in chinas economic engagement with southeast asia in recent years the chinese community in burma has grown to over two million out of total population of approximately 50 million26 twenty percent of the population of mandalay and half the population of lashio are thought to be 22 dalpino and steinberg 200203 p48 23 catharin dalpino and david steinberg eds southeast

ethnic chinese from yunnan27 these more recent immigrants to the region are thought to have closer ties to china than earlier waves of the chinese diaspora chinas dispute with taiwan is perceived as driving new naval buildup that will also influence chinas maritime posture in southeast asia chinas increasing dependance on energy imports may also lead it to seek the naval capability to secure those supplies chinas navy conducted its first circumnavigation of the globe in 2002 which coincided with russias final withdrawal from the former us naval base at cam ranh bay vietnam28 some see these developments as not only focused on taiwan but also as the beginning of chinas efforts to develop blue water navy that can defend its strategic sea lines of communication which transit southeast asian waters chinas regional objectives chinas regional objectives in southeast asia appear to be tied to chinas overall strategic posture while some analysts take zero sum approach to rising chinese power and american power in the region others point to the emphasis in china on the policy of peaceful rise or peaceful developmentand take more benign view of chinas objectives both globally and within regional context in southeast asia chinas peaceful rise potentially represents significant departure from earlier policy which sought to erode americas power in the region29 evidence of chinese unease with americas presence in asia continues to some chinese commentators americas expanded international posture since the september 11 terror attacks has led to an american encirclement of china30 others take view that chinas foreign policy towards southeast asia is derivative of its traditional imperial tribute system31 since the mid 1990s china has been actively seeking to develop its relationship with southeast asia through more cooperative approaches this is particularly evident in the period from the financial crisis of 199798 to the present the following regional objectives for southeast asia are seen to stem from chinas larger strategic agenda maintain stable political and security environment particularly on chinas periphery that will allow chinas economic growth to continue 27 dalpino and steinberg 200203 p49 28 gary klintworth chinas blue water naval aspirations asiapacific defence reporter october 2002 29 robert sutter asia in the balance america and chinas

emphasis to asean plus three china japan and south korea as opposed to the asia pacific economic cooperation apec framework which includes the united states and movement towards an aseanchina free trade area all mark fundamental shift in relations between china and asean this emphasis on economic and diplomatic ties is significant departure from previous military confrontation as demonstrated by past border and territorial disputes chinas offer of aid to thailand in the wake of the asian financial crisis of 1997 and chinas decision not to devalue its currency during the financial crisis were key events that began to more positively affect regional perceptions of china chinas actions indicate to some that it is interested in more than just expanded economic and trade ties with the region china has been working to establish security policy conference within the framework of the asean regional forum arf such conference would establish new security forum where china could be key player further such grouping would have multilateral focus and present an alternative to an asian security architecture that has traditionally been dominated by us bilateral alliances32 chinaasean trade and economic relations some analysts are becoming concerned that china and southeast asia may form bloc that will have the effect of excluding us trade with the region what appears from the data is that chinas trade has been rising rapidly though from low baseline while americas trade though still high in absolute terms is relatively stagnant chinas trade with asean increased by an average 75 per year over the period 1993 to 200133 in november 2002 asean and china signed the framework agreement on comprehensive economic cooperation to create an aseanchina free trade area acfta within 10 years34 in november 2004 the two sides signed the agreement on trade in goods of the framework agreement on comprehensive economic co operation between the association of southeast asian nations and the peoples 32 international institute of strategic studies strategic survey 20034 an evaluation and forceast of world affairs london oxford university press 2004 p 226 33 dalpino and steinberg 200203 p50 34 the agreement included an early harvest provision to reduce and eliminate tariffs on number of agricultural products such as meats fish live animals trees dairy produce vegetables and edible fruits and nuts the agreement called for both parties to begin implementing the cuts beginning in 2004 thailand negotiated an agreement with china to eliminate tariffs for various fruits and vegetables effective october 2003 crs9 republic of china which included schedule of tariff reductions and eventual elimination for most tariff lines beginning in 2005 between the two sides35 for example for the relatively more developed asean6 nations brunei indonesia malaysia the philippines singapore and thailand most tariffs of over 20 fall to 20 in 2005 12 by 2007 5 by 2009 and zero by 2010 certain sensitive products have longer phaseout periods36 the two sides are also seeking agreements in number of other areas as well such as liberalizing trade in services and investment the agreement would create one of the worlds largest trading blocs the combined populations and economies of asean and china in 2005 were approximately 19 billion people and 30 trillion nominal us dollars respectively combined country exports and imports equaled 14 trillion and 12 trillion respectively37 overview of trade trends data provided in tables 1 and 2 indicate the rapid rise in trade flows that have occurred between china and the asean countries over the past few years38 chinas combined exports to asean countries rose by 2200 from 20002005 and by 293 in from 20042005 these rates of increase are very close to the percentage increases in chinas overall exports during these periods overall the percentage of chinas exports going to the asean countries rose from 70 in 2000 to 72 in 2005 the trend in chinese imports is somewhat different chinas combined imports from asean countries rose by 2395 from 20002005 compared to 1933 from the world as whole and by 192 in from 20042005 versus 177 from the world chinas imports from asean as percent of its total imports rose from 98 in 2000 to 114 in 2005 35 the acfta would implement most tariff reductions between china and the asean 6 nations by 2010 cambodia laos burma and vietnam would complete implementation of most tariff reductions by 2015 36 bureau of national affairs international trade reporter october 6 2005 p 1590 37

more from asean than china did while china exported 118 more to asean than the united states 2005 was the first year in which chinese exports to asean were larger than us exports data indicates that chinas trade with asean is growing at significantly faster 39 these data should be interpreted with caution countries differ significantly in the way they measure trade data for example the united states reports imports on customs value basis which is the purchase price of the imported good while china and most other countries use the cost insurance and freight cif basis which is includes the purchase price of the import plus the costs of bringing the good into the country such as freight costs and insurance in addition china transships significant amount of its exports through hong kong large share of which china records as exports to hong kong while the country of final destination records them as imports from china not hong kong therefore there are likely to be major discrepancies

us direct investment abroad trends and current issues by james k jackson 42 asean secretariat asean statistics available at httpwwwaseansecorg crs16 possible implications for the united states of an acfta the implications of closer economic ties between china and asean on us firms and investors that have business interests in the asean countries are difficult to determine on the one hand some us businesses may benefit if reductions in trade barriers boost economic growth due to efficiency gains in china and the asean countries which in turn could boost their demand for foreign imports including those from the united states an acfta could boost overall economic efficiency in both china and asean reducing their production costs and lowering prices of various goods exported by these countries to the united states43 in addition an acfta would benefit us firms over the long run if the reduction in trade barriers agreed to by the two sides were later extended to all members of the world trade organization wto as part of multilateral trade agreement on the other hand an acfta could hurt us firms in number of ways bilateral and regional ftas are discriminatory by nature since they extend preferential benefits only to the parties of the agreement thus for example many us exports of goods and services to asean could face higher tariff and nontariff trade barriers than those faced by similar products and services exported by china to asean thus giving chinese firms competitive advantage over us firms this could lead to trade diversion where us firms even if more efficient than chinese firms lose some level of trade and investment opportunities in the asean countries or lose out to asean firms in china this is because the lower trade barrier eg tariff faced by chinese company in an asean country may offset its less competitive position visavis us company which faces higher trade barrier in addition trade liberalization produces both winners and losers and there is the possibility that closer economic integration between china and asean could produce economic welfare losses in some countries both within and outside the acfta thus diminishing their growth44 finally such regional ftas could produce large trading blocs that seek to promote further internal economic integration rather than seek multilateral agreements within the wto45 for example japan and south korea are also attempting to form trade agreements with asean in addition in december 2005 asean members china japan south korea india australia and new zealand held an east asian summit to discuss among other things closer economic integration46 43 this arguably would improve consumer welfare but could injure some us domestic firms 44 economic welfare concerns the optimal allocation of inputs among industries and the optimal distribution of commodities among consumers hence welfare losses occur when distortions such as tariffs promote inefficiencies for example consumers pay more than they normally would production shifts to less competitive firms etc 45 see congressional budget office the pros and cons of pursuing freetrade agreements july 31 2003 46 see crs report rl33242 east asia summit eas issues for congress by bruce vaughn crs17 2001 study performed by asean on the effects of an acfta47 estimated that it would raise chinas real gdp by 027 or 22 billion the analysis examining the impact on asean included 6 of 10 asean nations indonesia malaysia the philippines singapore thailand and vietnam together combined real gdp of these six countries was projected to rise by about 09 or 54 billion all of the countries would experience an increase in real gdp the study further predicted us gdp would decline by 004 or 26 billion and total world gdp would fall by 00248 combined exports of these asean countries to china were predicted to rise by 130 billion with an acfta while those to the united states were estimated to fall by 7991 million chinese exports to these asean countries were projected to rise by 106 billion while us exports to this group would drop by an estimated 21 million49 in addition us exports to china were projected to fall by 5010 million while chinese exports to the united states would fall by 8133 million50 exports by the six asean countries to each other were expected to decline by 31 billion overall according to the asean study the agreement would boost the six asean countries total exports to the world by 56 billion or 15 higher chinas overall exports would rise by 68 billion overall total us exports would decline by 2797 million51 total world exports were projected to increase by 105 billion thus based on this model the acfta boosts world exports but at the same time appears to cause some level of trade diversion away from more efficient producers outside acfta while the economies of china and asean would be better off several economies outside the agreement would be worse off such as the united states and japan see table 952 the economic model used in this analysis has number of limitations for example it does not included all asean countries in addition the model is based on the world economy in 1995 and estimates the changes that would occur if asean and china removed all tariffs however the economies of asean and china are much different than they were 10 years ago in particular china since joining the wto in 2001 has substantially reduced its tariffs on variety of products 47 aseanchina expert group on economic cooperation forging closer aseanchina economic relations in the 21st century

while us exports to china and asean as whole declined us exports to japan and the rest of the world increased by total 2234 billion and exports from japan and the rest of the world to the united states increased by total of 8757 million 52 for example under this model us exports would decline by 280 billion this implies that if the acfta were open to all countries real world gdp would

increasingly dependent for energy imports at present oil accounts for 22 of chinas energy consumption with third of that coming from imports it is projected that oil will rise to 31 of chinas energy consumption by 2020 this will likely lead to increasing naval modernization and continued expansion of energy related trade deals with regional states64 south china sea dispute in addition to the fact

the dispute disputes over the islands and reefs of the south china sea were major cause of tension between china and southeast asia in the 1990s conflicting claims over islands in the spratly group led to naval clashes between vietnam and china in 1988 that killed 70 vietnamese naval personnel in 1995 china seized mischief reef which is claimed by the philippines more recently china has acted in more cooperative fashion than it did in the 1990s the asean regional forum played limited role in trying to defuse the situation in the south china sea which led to china signing the declaration on the conduct of parties in the south china sea in 200267 in march 2004 both vietnam and china reasserted their sovereignty over the islands through public statements68 chinas increasing demand for energy resources may lead to increasing pressure to develop plans to exploit reserves in the south china sea this may be done in cooperative fashion as appears to be the case with the philippines or it may be done in return to more assertive posture joint peaceful exploitation of natural resources can be done while agreeing to disagree on issues of sovereignty chinas strategic outlook may lead it to seek to more directly secure the raw materials that will fuel continued economic growth this could lead it to once again take an confrontational stance in the south china sea69 recent developments in chinas dispute with japan in the east china sea where china has recently begun drilling in the shunqiao gas field has led to increased air and naval patrols in the area and to what some analysts

neighbor china burma maybe viewed by some in china as key to chinas efforts to prevent its potential encirclement by the united states burma has the potential to give china greater access to the indian ocean and from there to the oil rich middle east this is particularly valuable to china as it seeks to raise levels of development in its western interior which has experienced much lower rates of development than chinas eastern coastal areas china has helped burma build road linking yunnan province with port on the irrawaddy river73 the isolation of the military regime in burma due to its record on human rights has had the unintended consequence of encouraging ties with china which could give china key strategic access as well as economic access to the indian ocean which could have an impact on the geopolitical balance with india74 us policy towards burma is largely driven by human rights concerns while chinas foreign policy towards burma appears to be driven by geostrategic and geo economic considerations human rights concerns have led to legislation that restricts the extent to which the united states can engage burma this is in sharp contrast with the broadbased chinese engagement of burma china provided burma with 200 million loan in the aftermath of the 2003 us sanctions against burma for human rights violations china has also written off much of its past loans to burma and has provided much military equipment to the regime china is also the largest foreign investor in burma75 it is thought by some that aseans 1997 decision to include burma was in part inspired by desire to limit chinas growing influence there76 china has continued to develop trade and military ties with burma during recent visit to burma chinas deputy prime minister wu yi pledged to expand

be relatively comfortable with expanding ties with china according to one poll in 2003 76 of thais said that china was thailands closest friend as opposed to 9 who named the united states87 for several reasons this shift has not been as much foreign policy departure for thailand as it has for other southeast asian states in the past thailand has shared geopolitical interest with china on limiting vietnamese influence in cambodia and thailand has well integrated sinothai ethnic minority which includes prime minister thaksin shinawatra88 from the thai perspective chinas prompt offer of financial assistance in the wake of thailands financial difficulties in 1997 contrasted sharply with the united states response the lack of territorial disputes between china and thailand also helps

ships in the gulf of thailand possibly due to chinese objections91 despite this thailand continues to seek positive relations with the united states at the same time that it is developing ties with china this can be viewed as part of thailands traditional foreign policy of seeking to balance external powers to preserve its independence the philippines much has changed in the bilateral relationship between the philippines and china from the 1990s when the philippines was thought to be deeply suspicious of chinese activity in the south china sea and in particular on mischief reef

indonesias relations with china while improving significantly start from less than close base line largely due to past ideological differences indonesian suspicion of china was fueled by the latters support of the communist party of indonesia in the 1960s and former president suhartos belief that indonesian communists were behind an attempted coup in 1965 that subsequently led to the killing of over 500000 indonesians many of whom were ethnic chinese affiliated with the communist party diplomatic relations which had been severed in 1967 were reestablished in 1990 intercommunal tensions arose again during the transition from the suharto regime when antichinese rioting occurred in 1998 in 1999 then president wahid sought to improve relations with china as part of strategy to balance americas preeminent position in the world diplomatic relations between indonesia and china were further strengthened by former president megawatis 2002 visit to china95 chinas educational exchange

chinas relations with other southeast asian states vietnam gained its independence from china in the year 939 after over 1000 years of chinese rule china again ruled vietnam briefly from 1407 to 1428 during the ming dynasty100 during the cold war china sought to limit vietnamese influence in cambodia vietnam had close relations with the former soviet union at time when relations between the soviet union and china were cool tensions rose to height in 1979 when china and vietnam fought border war relations improved somewhat with the normalization of diplomatic relations in 1991 despite these improvements tensions have remained over conflicting claims to the spratly and paracel islands in the south china sea over which vietnam and china came into conflict in 1974 and 1988101 talks were held in early 2004 to resolve outstanding border demarcation issues102 that said trade relations between china and vietnam are adding new weight to the bilateral relationship chinas exports to vietnam

issues that appear to place limits on the extent of chinas increasingly cooperative posture relative to southeast asia some analysts have interpreted chinas recent rebuff of incoming prime minister lee hsien loong for traveling to taiwan as message to other asean states not to follow singapores policy of welcoming the united states as balancing influence in the region in addition to sending signal on taiwan105 some view singapore as part of grouping including japan south korea taiwan and australia that are closer to the united states than china would prefer106 some in china are thought to be concerned that such ring of countries could be used to encircle china singapore reportedly sees in its relationship with china the potential for mutual gain economic competition and potentially conflicting strategic aims singapore is thought to advocate developing constructive relationship with china while hedging against potentially revisionist regime107 the united statessingapore

influence its southeast asian neighbors at least over the issue of taiwan it has also been reported that singapore conducts military training in taiwan and that this displeases china one singaporean official reportedly stated they china are trying to make us define our core interests subordinate to their core interests110 australia there are signs that one of americas closest allies australia is re calibrating its external posture in way that places increased emphasis on asia and in particular china111 this it appears is being driven by the growing geoeconomic importance of china to australia as well as domestic australian public opinion that is perceived to have grown less comfortable with the australian liberal governments extremely close identification with president bushs foreign policy including iraq112 it should be noted that australias growing relationship with china is based on trade while its relationship with the united states is based on shared values the anzus alliance and largely common world view australias exports to china rose from 12 billion in 1990 to 59 billion in 2003 while its imports over the same period rose from 15 billion to 103 billion113 as result it appears to be the aim of australian foreign policy to avoid situation where the united states and china are in conflict because australia wishes to pursue enhanced economic ties with china while preserving its close strategic alliance relationship with the united states events that point to this potential shift include australias desire for free trade agreement with china the 2004 statement by foreign minister downer on taiwan the 2003 visit of premier president hu jintao to australia and desire by the australian opposition labor party to not be perceived as an unthinking and uncritical subordinate of the united states by regional countries while this recalibration does seek to establish degree of independence it starts from baseline of almost major foreign policy differences between the government of john howard and the administration of george bush which is built on strong personal relationship between the two leaders and national elites the decision to give chinese president hu jintao platform in parliament the day after president bush addressed the australian parliament is viewed by some as symbolic repositioning of australia in the world114 that gives the appearance of increasing parity in australias relations with china relative to the american alliance this may be driven by the growing importance of china to australia in economic terms australias exports to china increased from 12 billion in 1990 to 59 billion 110 barry wain singapore david and goliath tussle far eastern economic review august 5 2004 111 rowan callick carry on john far eastern economic review

over the period 1999 to 2003119 recent high level visits also attest to the new importance being placed on the relationship prime minister howard has traveled to china four times which is more than any other australian prime minister and chinese presidents hu jintao and jiang zemin have both been to australia120 during his visit to beijing in august 2004 australian foreign minister downer remarked that the anzus treaty did not require australia to fight with the united states in the event of conflict over taiwan121 this is potentially significant departure for australia nation with record of fighting along side the united states in almost all of its conflicts and can be viewed as an example of how regional states are influenced by china to take political and strategic positions pleasing to china as they seek to develop trade relations australia is currently seeking free trade agreement with china chinas integration with the greater mekong subregion the mekong river begins high in the mountains of southwest china where it is known as the lancang river and winds through yunnan province before crossing southeast asia to complete its 4800 mile journey in the south china sea the mekong basin includes some 70 million people of which 80 depend on the river for their subsistence 122 the greater mekong subregion gms was formed in 1992 with encouragement and assistance from the asian development bank its members include china burma laos thailand cambodia and vietnam the gms does not have regulatory function this is distinct organization from the mekong river commission mrc formed in 1995 that includes cambodia laos thailand and vietnam chinas decision not to join the mrc is thought to stem from its reluctance to give downstream nations voice in its decisions to dam the upper mekong 115 institute for international economics statistics as referenced in perlez p a5 116 the dragon and the eagle the economist october 2 2004 117 hungry dragon the

milton osborne the mekong turbulent past uncertain future new york atlantic monthly press 2000 crs31 regional integration between southern china and southeast asia holds the prospect of bringing the nations of southeast asia and china closer together through regional economic development environmental concerns stemming from the damming and channeling of the mekong river may become source of tension between china and its downstream neighbors one issue that may provide insight into chinas attitude towards southeast asia is the damming of the upper mekong in yunnan with little regard to the impact on its downstream neighbors two hydroelectric dams have been completed with an additional two under construction while four more are planned these dams are part of chinas attempt to meet its energy needs and to develop its relatively underdeveloped western interior problems associated with these dams have angered some downstream as fish habitat is reportedly being degraded dam construction also limits the flow of silt which is needed to replenish the fertility of downstream agriculture on mekong flood plains some have called for the issue of water resource management to be made part of the aseanchina agenda123 the heads of government of the greater mekong subregion signed memorandum of understanding on cross border transport and agreed on plan to establish regional power grid that would coordinate the various hydroelectric projects in the river system at the november 2002 summit in phnom penh124 expanding transportation links between yunnan and southeast asia will likely enhance chinasoutheast asian interaction china is building roads south from yunnans capital kunming which will link up with three routes from laos and burma125 air routes are also being established such as between chiang mai and jinghong126 it is envisaged that the linkage of these roads and air routes will serve to create northsouth economic corridor from south central china into southeast asia one possible consequence of higher levels of regional integration could be increased levels of drug and human trafficking and the spread of aids throughout the region greater levels of economic integration between china and southeast asia in the mekong region hold the prospect of improving the standard of living of millions it may also lead to chinas enhanced regional influence cambodias environmental concerns over chinas upstream dam building are quite significant an estimated 70 of cambodians protein comes from fisheries related to the river many of the fish in the mekong river are migratory fish that spawn upstream projected dam construction in china will limit the ability of fish to spawn upriver in addition the great lake of cambodia the tonle sap is connected to the mekong by tributary of the same name during the flooding season the tributary which normally runs from the great lake reverses flow and empties in to the great lake this greatly expands and deepens the lake and creates vast 123 barry wain river at risk far eastern economic review august 26 2004 124 lyall breckon china caps year of gains center for naval analysis december 2002 125 m

back to the mekong the fish catch in cambodia in both the 200102 and 200203 fishing seasons declined by 15 this was followed by further decline of 50 in 200304127 some have speculated that chinas upstream manipulations of the flow of the mekong which led to unprecedentedly low river levels in 2004 may lead to the collapse of the mekong system fishery128 some view such large scale declines when combined with cambodias reliance on the resource as not only an environmental problem but also security problem cambodias displeasure with the situation with the mekong may be in part offset by chinese assistance in november of 2003 china and cambodia signed an agreement for military training and equipment china is also reportedly helping cambodia build railway that will help link yunnan to the sea129 regional security architectures some observers fear that the future evolution of regional security architectures in southeast asia will lessen the central role of the united states while enhancing that of china none of the multilateral machinery130 that deals with security issues in southeast asia has the degree of coherence as the north atlantic treaty organization that said there has been much effort devoted to regional security over time the united states now defunct southeast asian treaty organization seato was an early attempt to forge such unity in way that gave the united states central role the five power defense arrangements fpda which include the united kingdom australia new zealand malaysia and singapore is another security grouping on the periphery of southeast asia is the 1951 anzus treaty it includes the united states australia and new zealand though the new zealand leg of the alliance has lapsed since nuclear disputes in the mid 1980s more recent fora such as the asean regional forum arf the asean europe meeting asem the asean post ministerial meeting and the track two council for security cooperation in the asia pacific cscap have all dealt with regional security issues aseans difficulty in dealing with regional security was demonstrated by its limited response to the crisis in east timor it has been asserted that the asean way principle of nonintervention has limited aseans ability to play an active role in preserving regional peace and security as result aseans neighbor australia played the leading role in containing the violence

concept of security communitiesor enhanced regional cooperation in 2001 that was not well received by southeast asian states131 there was concern by states with strong bilateral relationships with the united states that such grouping would lessen their relative relationship with the us there was also concern that such grouping would be viewed by china as seeking to contain china apec though explicitly focused on economic issues has also played role in the field of security as demonstrated by its role in the crisis in east timor and more recently for its discussion of the impact of terrorism on the region despite this apec has not developed to the point where it explicitly and comprehensively is focused on regional security this is due to degree of resentment by some regional states of the united states efforts to transform apec which is viewed by many as economic grouping to focus on security issues an asean security community was put forward at the october 2003 asean meeting in bali indonesia which added new areas of cooperation such as counter terrorism and maritime security132 indonesia proposed the security community concept for asean in which it would presumably play leading role this and an indonesian proposal to establish an asean peacekeeping force by 2010133 did not receive much enthusiasm from other asean member states who do not favor the evolution of asean security dialogues into actual defense cooperation other more recent security initiatives include chinas efforts to develop asean 3 and strategic relations with the region such chinafocused east asian community that would exclude the united states would have the potential to limit the united states future influence in the region134 it has been asserted that one of the reasons for recent force modernization measures by southeast asian states has been the need for increased self reliance due to perceived reduction of the u s commitment to southeast asia135 china is positioning itself to be able to play more active role in southeast asian security in 2003 china and asean signed the joint declaration on strategic partnership for peace and prosperity which calls for coordination in the areas of foreign and security policy136 china also signed the treaty of amity and 131 satu limaye minding the gaps the bush administration and ussoutheast asia relations

200304 p14 crs34 cooperation with asean in late 2003137 the joint declaration has been interpreted as an early step towards incorporating southeast asia in an east asian economic political and security community led by china138 some view chinabacked asean security community asc as means of shifting asean security discussions away from fora where the united states participates such as the asean regional forum arf or asia pacific economic cooperation apec139 while asean states see benefit in developing relations with china it does not appear that the relationship will be developed in isolation but rather in tandem with other key extraregional relationships such as with the united states japan india and australia while it is not evident exactly how the new security architecture will evolve what is of concern to some analysts is that the current direction has the potential to move towards the creation of new asian centric architecture which reduces the central role that the united states has played and may have china at its center while it has been pointed out that such grouping may not pose any more of threat to the united states regional interests than the european union does in europe such grouping could challenge american interests if ignored or mishandled140 implications for american interests how one perceives the implications of the rise of china in southeast asia depends to great extent on whether the rise of china is viewed in zero sum or expanding sum terms relative to american interests zero sum perspective holds the potential to create strategic rivalry as any gain for china in either economic diplomatic or strategic terms would be viewed as diminishing americas regional posture such perspective could lead to policies by the united states that china would view as seeking to contain its rise which could lead to more assertive chinese policies an expanding sum approach holds the prospect of constructively engaging china in way that would have it act without military force not only in the region but beyond such perspective could focus on those areas where us and chinese interests converge such as fighting organized crime drug smuggling counter terrorism stabilizing indonesia maintaining regional stability and promoting energy security141 while china has pursued more cooperative policy in southeast asia there exists the possibility that it could revert to more aggressive posture such policy shift could be triggered by the issue of taiwan in such an event chinas enhanced presence in southeast asia could challenge american interests in the region 137 peaceful rise the economist june 24 2004 138 iiss p266 139 regionally challenged asian security the economist july 10 2004 140 brad glosserman changing asia needs

chinas increasing dependence on imported energy particularly from the middle east could serve as key shared strategic interest with the united states as both states will place increased importance on maintaining the sea lanes through which the oil will flow chinas increasing dependence on middle east based energy resources is demonstrated by the recent signing of memorandum of understanding between china and iran for the purchase by china of 10 million tons of liquified natural gas each year over the next 25 years142 conversely the rapid rise in oil consumption by asia which is projected to grow by 80 from 2001 to 2025 could lead to increasing competition for the resource143 energy is key resource for economic growth which has been key source of legitimacy for the chinese government some analysts have taken the view that regional states view the united states as being largely focused elsewhere in the world particularly iraq and afghanistan and that to the extent to which the united states is engaged in southeast asia it is engaged primarily through the prism of its war against terror and to lesser extent with human rights chinas recent foreign policy toward the region has stressed trade and not human rights this policy stance is relatively well received in many southeast asian capitals that said some southeast asian states are thought to quietly welcome the balancing effect of the united states strategic presence in the region144 some have viewed the emerging correlates of power of asia as resting on three key interactive forces all of which are evident in the southeast asian context these are the ability of the united states to remain committed to the region and play leading role in creating new security architecture the rise of china and deteriorating arc of instability in asia145 from this perspective the ability of the united states to remain committed to the region beyond narrow focus on the war against terror is an important factor which will likely influence how regional states react to the rise of china if regional states perceive the united states as unwilling or unable to play an active role across the economic diplomatic and security spectrum in southeast asia they may be increasingly drawn to china as chinas influence grows southeast asian states may seek to balance that influence in new ways particularly if they perceive the united states as reluctant to be comprehensively engaged in the region if american priorities such as the war against terror place limits on the attractiveness of renewed ties southeast asian states may look to india australia japan or to new asean based initiatives which could be led by indonesia to balance the rising influence of china 142 matt pottinger china and iran near agreement on huge

implications past us policy towards southeast asia has sometimes been viewed as ad hoc episodic and reactive146 some feel stronger commitment by the united states to long term engagement with the region across the full spectrum of issues of concern not only to the united states but also to regional states would add depth to americas regional presence and could positively shape regional states perceptions of the united states strategic posture some analysts are of the opinion that the united states could actively work to channel chinas emergence as great power along the path of the peaceful rise in their view the united states could reassure china that it will not oppose chinas efforts to attain higher levels of development to better the lives of its people while the united states could reserve the right to promote its economic and other interests in the region some regional states displeasure over united states policies associated with the war on terror create perceived distance in southeast asian states relations with the united states which it is thought creates space for enhanced relations between southeast asia and china the region appears to some to be increasingly uneasy with perceived american unilateralism while at the same time increasingly at ease with chinas concurrent shift to more multilateral approaches to security expanded use of multilateral and soft power approaches by the united states by enhancing dialogue with regional states across range of issues could according to some create greater levels of cooperation amongst regional states and the united states renewed emphasis on apec and american involvement in mekong subregion development are also viewed as two possible avenues for expanded multilateral cooperation streamlining the visa application process for southeast asian students and expanding scholarship opportunities to cultivate southeast asias next generation of leaders are other opinions under consideration other analysts feel that greater flexibility to induce or persuade the regime in burma to promote human rights and political freedom could be used as way of engaging burma with asean states to provide burma with an alternative to an increasing reliance on china as one analyst has put it if the current relationship between the united states and china develops into more overt competition the realpolitik of great power rivalry could oblige it the united states to change its policy towards burma and seek more neutral if not closer relationship147 others are of the opinion that the united states can expand existing military exercises with regional allies such as exercises tandem thrust with australia balikatan with the philippines and cobra gold with thailand to enhance americas defense ties with regional states148 and enhance american credibility as an alliance partner the united states could also develop military to military ties training regional defense modernization and regional access

appear that china was reverting to more assertive regional posture the united states could work with japan and australia and possibly india to assist southeast asian states in balancing chinese
