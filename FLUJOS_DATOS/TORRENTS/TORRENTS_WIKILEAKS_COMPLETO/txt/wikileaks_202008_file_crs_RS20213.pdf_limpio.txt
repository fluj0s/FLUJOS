goldich cr s report rl 30177 complete list of crs products on kosovo can be found t httpwwwlocgovcrskosovohtml introduction striking aspect of the cur rent conflict in kosovo to some western observers is the extent to which both sides in the struggle use history sometimes reaching into the distant past to sanction their right to control the region and just ify whatever actions are necessary to secure that control for example many serbs claim kosovo as the cradle of serbian civilization ethnic albanians insist that they have lived in kosovo longer than the serbs and now form the overwhelming majority of the population there however it should be noted that many historical claims need not be taken at fac value for several reasons one is that they often distort or falsify historical events related reason is that they may not be sufficient explanation for why the conflict i s occurring indeed they may serve in large part as pretexts for political leaders seeking to enhance their power and wealth finally such arguments sometimes lead observers t believe that the history of the region is one of centuries of unceasing ethnic conflict while there has indeed been much conflict in kosovos history it should be noted that historical account s particularly those favored by nationalists often focus on change and conflic t among political leaders they do not always reflect centuries of everyday peacefu l coexistence and cooperation among ordinary people httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20213crs2 albanians spell the name of the region as kosova the serbian spelling kosovo is used by1 us officials as well as by most us and international mediaearly history serbs and other slavic tribes migr ated into the balkans including kosovo in the 6th century ad serb historians assert that few if any ancestors of the albanians lived i n1 kosovo at this time albanian historians say that albanians are des cended from the ancient dardania n and illyrian inhabitants of the region the latter are mentioned in texts b ancient greek historians as early as the 3 century bc the region saw variety of ethnicrd groups vying for control in the waning centuries of the roman empire in the late 12 century king nem anja of serbia took advantage of the weakness ofth the byzantine empire to seize what is now ko sovo and other territories kosovo became the center of the serbian state nemanja and his successors built many churches an d monasteries some of which re main key serb holy sites today they made pec the seat of the serbian orthodox church medieval serbia reached the zenith of its power unde r king stefan dusan from 13311355 his kingdom included all of kosovo norther n albania macedonia and much of greece he established his capital at prizren however serbias strength soon d eclined due to squabbling among stefan dusans successors and the increasing power of the turkishled ottoman empire in the battle of kosovo polje on june 28 1389 forces of serbian prince lazar were defeated by turkishled army many details of the batt remain obscure but some historians say that it is quite possible that there were serbs and albanians fighting on each side while the historical reality of the battle may have been more complicated than has sometimes been suggested th conflict has nevertheless passed into serb historical legend as the decisive battle tha t ushered in over 400 years of turkish domination celebrated in an epic passed on b serbian bards for hundreds of years in 1689 austrian forces temporarily seized kosovo from the ottom ans local serbs joined forces with them to fight the turks the austrians were routed near kacanik on january 2 1690 serbian orthodox patriarch arsenije and more tha n 40000 refugees fled kosovo for hungary another austrian expedition into kosovo in 1737 was also forced to retreat touching off another wave of rb refugees serb historians claim that the shift from predominately serbian population to mainly ethnic albanian one began at thi s time as albanians migrated from the poor mountainous regions of northern albania onto the more fertile plains of kosovo other historians say the shift started much earlier and occurred more gradually most ethnic albanians in kosovo converted from christianity to islam although largely roman catholic minority continues to exist today man conversions were undertaken not due to religious fervor but in order to avoid higher taxes and other discrimination that nonmuslims in the ottoman empire faced the rise of modern serbia and kosovo after uprisings from 1804 to 1815 parts of serbia near belgrade became semi autonomous principality within the ottoman empire by 1833 serbia received ful l autonomy and more territory as result of an agreeme nt reached with the ottomans under russian

prizren in june 1878 with the aim of consolidating albanianinhabited lands into one province within the ottoman empire at the congress of berlin in july 1878 other great powers alarmed at russias gains in the region forced reduction in the size of bulgaria and took albanianinhabited land s away from serbia and montenegro and gave them back to the tur ks however serbia and montenegro were permitted to keep other territories they had seized serbia receive d formal independence from the ottoman empire the demands of the league of prizren to group all albanianinhabited lands in one state

turkish forces were d ecisively defeated and virtually the entire balkan peninsula was liberated from ottoman control serbian and montenegri n forces seized kosovo and part of what is now albania on june 28 1913 bulgaria angry at its meager territorial gains in the conflict attacked greece and serbia in th second balkan war and was defeated by late july after pressure by several great powers serbia and montenegro were forced to disgorge some territory and an independen t albania was created in part at russias urging kosovo remained in serb hands serbia nearly doubled in size as result of its gains in the balkan wars on june 28 1914 austrohungarian archduke franz ferdinand was assassinated by serb nationalist gavrilo princ ip in sarajevo austriahungary declared war on serbia in july touching off world war i after offering stubborn and effective resistance fo r over year the serbian army was defeated when bulgaria joined the war in septembe r 1915 in hopes of avenging its losses in the second balkan war the serbian army made last stan d in kosovo and the army and many serb civilians retreated across th mountains of rthern albania to the adriatic sea under conditions of extreme hardship remnants of the army were evacuated by allied warships to the greek island of corfu kosovo in yugoslavia after the victory of the allies in world war i and the collapse of the austro hungarian empire in 1918 kosovo became part of the new kingdo m of serbs croats and slovenes ruled by serbian king as one of the victors in the war and the only people in the kingdom to have had st

effort to dilute the ethnic albania n majority in the region king aleksandr declared dictatorship in 1929 and renamed th country yugoslavia he was assassinated in 1934 by macedonian terrorists italy occupied albania in april 1939 shortly before the outbreak of world war ii germany invaded yugoslavia on april 6 1941 yugoslav army resistan ce collapsed within ten days most of kosovo was included in greater albanian puppet state part of the rest went to bulgaria while areas with valuable mineral resources remained in german occupied serb ia some kosovars rejoiced at their union with albania and supported the new state like many areas of yugoslavia kosovo became the site of bloody fightin g among serbian royalist chetniks communist partisans german and italian occupatio n forces and ethnic albanian armed groups often allied with the germans and italians atrocities against both serbian and ethnic albanian civilians were common in 1944 the partisans seized kosovo they soon had to crush an uprising from ethnic albanian rebelshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20213crs4 who did not want kosovo incorporated in what they saw as serbdominated communist yugoslavia in 1945 the victori ous communist government under josip broz tito gave kosovo its current borders and made it one of two autonomous provinces within serbia the largest republic of the new sixrepublic socialist federal republic of yugoslavia despite its new nominal autonomy kosovo remained under serb domination unti l 1966 when secret police chief aleksandr rankovic serb and the key architect f repression in kosovo was removed from office by tito tito then began to shift his policy toward ethnic albanians in kosovo from repression t conciliation however the process did not move quickly enough for some ethnic albanians in 1968 in demonstration s throughout kosovo ethnic albanian protesters called for kosovo to be given the status of republic within yugos lavia and thus full equality with serbia some demonstrations turned violent and police and army troops were c alled in to quell them resulting in several deaths in 1974 yu goslavia adopted new constitution capping efforts since 1966 t increase kosovos rights within yugoslavia the new constitution gave kosovo in many respects facto republic status and therefore equal footing within the yugosla v federation with serbia ethnic albanians took over leading posts in the local government and economy kosovo received large subsidies as part of federal plan to equalize th sharp difference in levels of development between rich and poor area s of yugoslavia more kosovar voices demanded secession from serbia and status as full republic withi n yugoslavia in addition to achieving greater representation in federal bodies and formal equality with serbia republic status would hav given kosovo the right at least in theory to secede from yugoslavia few even proposed union with albania although mos t kosovars recognized that they were freer and economically better off than thei r compatriots in albania who suffered abject poverty under the exceptionally rigi d communist regime there while nationalism rose amo ng ethnic albanians the resentment of the serb minority in kosovo at the albanianization of kosovo increased serbs charge that ethni c albanians used discrimination intimidation and violence to drive serbs out of the area in hopes of creating an ethnically pure kosovo ethnic albanians say serbs left because of the areas poor economic outlook and the serbs discomfort at the shift in power from the serbian minority to the ethnic albanian majority rapid popul ation growth among rural kosovars also contributed to the population shift while estimates of the extent of th emigration vary there is little doubt that it was significant in 1961 serbs made up 236 percent of kosovos population on the eve of the present conflict they were under 1 0 percent kosovo and the collapse of yugoslavia after tit death in 1980 the highly decentralized political system he put in place gradually began to fail and there were increasingly open power struggles within th yugoslav political elite ethnic albanian nationalism remained strong in 1981 student protest against poor conditions at pristina university escalated into riot protesters at the university and throughout the province called for republic status for kosovo some demonstrators called for union with albania the demonstratio ns and riots were put down by serb police and the yugoslav military resulting in several fatalities the riots reinforced serb fears that the ethnic albanians wanted to secede from yu goslavia more serbs called for the reassertion of serb control over the province httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20213crs5 by 1987 one serbi an leader seized on the kosovo issue as springboard to power during visit to kosovo polje on april 24 serb communist party official sloboda n milosevic gave rousing s peech to serbs in kosovo vowing that one should dare to beat you the speech which tapped into waxing serb national resentment launche d milosevic as major political figure he was elected serbian co mmunist party leader later that year in this post and later as president of serbia milosevic moved to take control of kosovo in 1989 the serbian parliament passed amendments to the serbia n constitution sharply limiting kosovos autonomy the kosovo parliament under heavy pressure by serbian security forces did likewise in 1990 serbia approved furthe r measures that eliminated kosovos autonomy and abolished kosovos parliament an d government over 10 0000 ethnic albanians in government the police enterprises media educatio nal institutions and hospitals were fired and replaced by serbs serbian polic arrested hundreds of ethnic albanians for allegedly engaging in nationalist activities occasional ly beating them fatally another element of serbian strategy was to encourage serbs to settle in kosovo through jobs and financial inducements however fearing war and economic deterioration serbs did not take up the governments offer in larg numbers milosevics destruction of kosovos autonomy provoked unease in slovenia croatia and other republics in the yugoslav federation which had not approve d milosevic s crackdown in federal government institutions many in the other republic s feared that they could be the next victims of milosevics nationalist policies for thi s reason many analysts say that with his moves in kosovo milosevic lit the fuse tha t eventually resulted in the breakup of yugoslavia in 1991 ethnic albanians reacted to this seizure and monopolization of public institutions by boycotting them and building their own parallel set of political and social institutions kosovos parliament and government refused to be dissolved and went underground kosova rs established their own schools hospitals and clinics although these wer desperately short of resources massive layoffs at enterprises now run by serbs made an already poor economic situation even worse some kosovars coped by emigrating r receiving aid from ethnic albanians overseas slovenia and croatia seceded from yug oslavia in june 1991 milosevic who wields facto control over the yugoslav army and federal government conceded slovenias indepen dence after brief skirmish but the conflict escalated in croatia ethnic serb s joined with yugoslav army troops to seize onethird of the country feeling tha t autonomy within yugoslavia was longer viable option ethnic albanians held referendum on independence for kosovo in september independence was approved by an overwhelming margin and the underground kosovo parliament proclaimed the regions independence on october 19 1991 after the united states and european community rec ognized bosnia hercegovinas independence in april 19 92 bosnian serbs and yugoslav army troops seized large parts of bosnias territory and expelled nonserbs in may kosovars went to the polls to elect new president

leaders had looked to the international community to improve their situation however in 1995 the dayton peace agre ement brought an end to the war in bosnia but kosovo was not dealt with in the negotiations internationa l sanctions against serbiamontenegro were lifted some kosovars concluded tha t rugovas policy of nonviolence and seeking international support for kosovo had been failure and
