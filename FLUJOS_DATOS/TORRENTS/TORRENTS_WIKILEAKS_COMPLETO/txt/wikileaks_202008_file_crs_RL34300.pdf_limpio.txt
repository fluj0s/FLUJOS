payasyougo paygo procedures play an important role in enforcing budget policies with respect to the consideration of revenue and direct spending legislation generally the purpose of paygo procedures is to discourage or prevent the enactment of legislation that would cause or increase deficit or reduce surplus paygo procedures are not comprehensive means of budget enforcement because they do not apply to discretionary spending which is provided in annual appropriations acts such spending is subject to other budget enforcement procedures further paygo rules deal only with the budgetar impact of legislation considered during session they do not address changes in direct spending and revenue levels under current law stemming from changes in the economy demographic trends and other factors over the years several different paygo procedures have been used for budget enforcement purposes the paygo procedures have been based in statute as well as congressional rules statutory and rulesbased paygo procedures have been in effect simultaneously at times while at other times only one form of paygo procedures was in effect the scope and effect of paygo procedures have varied depending on

amended an underlying law the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 the paygo requirement was established as section 252 of the 1985 act1 under the requirement legislation proposing new direct spending or decreasing revenues for fiscal year could not result in net cost for that year the paygo requirement generally was intended to preserve the sizeable deficit reduction that had been achieved by the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 and to keep an onbudget deficit from being increased or an on budget surplus from being reduced the paygo balances for each fiscal year were maintained on rolling paygo scorecard that accumulated the budgetary effects of laws enacted during the session and in prior years the threshold test for paygo sequester dealt with how legislation affected the net cost for fiscal year on the paygo scorecard not how it changed the surplus or deficit for that fiscal year in the federal budget the sequestration process established by the 1985 balanced budget act and initially used to enforce the acts annual deficit targets was retained by the bea of 1990 as the means of enforcing the paygo requirement as well as the discretionary spending limits in section 251 of the 1985 balanced budget act2 under the sequestration process the director of the office of 1 the bea of 1990 was title xiii of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 pl 101508 november 5 1990 see 104 stat 1388573 through 630 2 for more detailed discussion of the sequestration process see crs report rl31137 sequestration procedures under

the presidents budget was submitted to congress the preview report midway through the congressional session the update report and within 15 days after the end of the session the final report if the omb directors final sequestration report indicated that enacted direct spending and revenue levels had incurred net cost for the fiscal year beginning on october 1 the budget year on the paygo scorecard then the president was required to immediately issue sequestration order to remedy the violation through automatic largely acrosstheboard spending reductions if sequester under this process was required it had to occur within 15 calendar days after congress adjourned at the end of session and on the same day as any sequestration tied to enforcement of the discretionary spending limits the sequester had to eliminate any net positive balance on the paygo scorecard for the budget year and the prior fiscal year the current year combined caused by the enactment of legislation during the session and in prior years the purpose behind adding in the balance for the current year was to fully capture the budgetary effects of any direct spending and revenue legislation enacted into law after the final sequestration report for fiscal year had been issued but before the next congressional session got underway thereby closing any enforcement loophole as extended in 1993 and 1997 the paygo requirement applied to legislation enacted through the end of fy2002 but it covered the effects of such legislation through fy2006 3 the paygo requirement effectively was terminated in december 2002 by the enactment of pl 107312 which set all remaining balances on the paygo scorecard to zero4 the omb director issued 12 final sequestra tion reports under the paygo process for fy1992 fy2003 the final combined balances on the paygo scorecard for all years as determined by the omb director either were negative amounts reflecting net savings or zero accordingly paygo sequester was required for any fiscal year during this period while the omb directors final determina tions indicated compliance with the paygo requirement in all years in some cases the balances reflected adjustments due to emergency requirements provided for under the process or directed scorekeeping provisions in law that intervened in the normal operation of the process in order to prevent sequester section 252 of the 1985 balanced budget act provid ed that any provision of direct spending or revenue legislation could be designated by the president and congress as an emergency requirement the budgetary impact of any provision so designated was not scored on the paygo scorecard although the emergency desi gnation was used often for discretionary spending provisions in annual appropriations acts it rarely was used for direct spending or revenue provisions the most significant emergency designation under the paygo process applied to the job creation and worker assistance act pl 107147 which removed net costs of nearly 89 billion from the paygo scor ecard over the peri od covering fy2002fy2006 3 the paygo requirement was extended through fy1998 by the omnibus budget reconciliation act obra of 1993

operation of the paygo process largely to deal with two different types of problems first in some years the enactment of deficit reduction measures would have resulted in large negative balances on the paygo scorecard that were not intended the savings reflected in these balances could have been used to offset direct spending increases or revenue reductions that were not contemplated by the budget resolution second in more recent years the budget resolution recommended significant reductions in revenues coupled with increases in direct spending that would have incurred substantial positive balances reflecting net costs on the paygo scorecard as result of these two concerns congress and the president enacted provisions in at least seven different laws intervening significantly in the normal operation of the paygo requirement the interventions involved scorekeeping directions to the omb director that prohibited him from counting direct spending or revenue changes in certain legislation on the paygo scorecard or that instructed him to reduce balances on the paygo scorecard or to set them to zero the seven measures containing directed scorekeepi ng provisions did not make adjustments in the fy1991fy1993 balances on the paygo scorecard for fy1994fy2000 the net effect of the adjustments each year was to remove savings balances from the scorecard or to not count savings provisions in legislation these nets effects ranged from 13991 billion for fy1999 to 140221 billion for fy1998 the cumulative effect of all provisions to remove or not count savings through fy2006 was 628980 billion for fy2001fy2006 the net effect of the adjustments each year was to remove cost balances from the scorecard or to not count cost provisions in legislation these net effects ranged from 9214 billion for fy2002 to 150790 billion for fy2004 the cumulative effect of all provisions to remove or not count costs through fy2006 was 731527 billion proposals have been made from time to time to restore the statutory paygo requirement but disagreements have centered on whether it shou ld apply to both direct spending and revenue legislation as originally framed and generally favored by democrats or only to direct spending legislation as generally favored by republicans in the 108 th congress president george w bush submitted draft legislation to congress the spending control act of 2004 that would have restored the discretionary spending limits and the paygo requiremen t for direct spending legislation only the house budget committee reported bill hr 3973 hrept 108442 march 19 2004 reflecting the presidents proposal comparable measure hr 4663 was considered in the house on june 25 2004 but failed to pass by vote of 146268 in the 110th congress interest was renewed in restoring comprehensive paygo requirement5 section 508 sense of congress regarding extens ion of the statutory payasyougo rule of the fy2008 budget resolution sconres 21 stated i t is the sense of congress that in order to reduce the deficit congress should extend paygo co nsistent with provisions of the budget enforcement act of 1990 similar provision was included as section 515 in the fy2009 budget resolution sconres 70 5 the house budget committee held hearing on the matter perspectives on renewing statutory paygo on july 25 2007

consideration of revenue and direct spending legislation in the senate the original rule section 12c of the fy1994 budget resolution hconres 64 was intended to prevent the deficit reduction expected to be achieved in subsequent reconciliation bill from being used to offset the costs of any new direct spending or revenue legislation6 specifically it prohibited the consideration of any direct spending and revenue legislation that would increase the deficit in the fy1994 budget resolution for an fiscal year through fy1998 or would increase the deficit for any other fiscal year through fy2003 in this initial form the senates paygo rule had expiration date following the establishment of the paygo rule in 1993 the senate modified the rule several times for different reasons including establishing and extending an expiration date expanding the rules application to curtail potential evasion allowing onbudget surpluses to be used to cover revenue reductions and direct spending increases and providing for exemptions to the rule7 in may 2007 during the first session of the 110th congress the senate revised its paygo rule as part of the fy2008 budget resolution section 201 of sconres 218 in its current form the senate paygo rule prohibits the consideration of direct spending or revenue legislation that would cause or increase an onbudget deficit in either of two time periods 1 sixyear period consisting of the current fiscal year the budget year and the four ensuing fiscal years and 2 an 11year period consisting of the current year the budget year and the ensuing nine fiscal years enforcement of the rule is monitored by the maintenance of paygo ledger that records the budgetary impact of direct spending and revenue legislation considered during the session determinations regarding the cost of legislation for purposes of enforcing the paygo rule are made by the senate budget committee based on the baseline used in the most recently agreed to budget resolution waivers of the senates paygo rule require the affirmative vote of threefifths of the membership 60 votes if seats are vacant the current expiration date of the rule is september 30 2017 the revised senate paygo rule is buttressed by another rule in the fy2008 budget resolution section 203 of sconres 21 that would prohibit th consideration of legislation increasing the deficit by more than 5 billion in any of the four 10year periods covering fy2018fy2057 both the paygo rule and the longterm deficits rule can be waived only by the affirmative vote of threefifths of the membership 60 senators if seats are vacant 6 see the joint explanatory statement in hrept 10348 p 47 the reconciliation bill enacted later that session pl 10366 the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 was
