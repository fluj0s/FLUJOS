fillers to include explosive chemical biological or hazardous material s improvised explosive d evices may range in size from cigarette pack or carton to large vehicle the only limitation s an enemy bomber faces are availab ility of resources personal ingenuity and the degree or extent of know how required to facilitate construction and in some cases application of an improvised explosive device improvised explosive device s are nonstandard and usually fabricated from common materials the m ass quantities of cached captured enemy ammunition cea and stockpiled munitions within the i raq and afghanistan theaters of operation provide the explosive materials to would be enemy bomber s general m itigat ion measures in relation to the ied threat 1 trust your instincts if something does not

pictures of themselves 4 before each and every convoy or patrol brief your personnel on the latest ied threat intelligence brief your personnel each and every time ascertain what types of items are
