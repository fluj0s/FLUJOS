pursuing ftas with the united states to assure access to the immense us market th ey have preferential access now under unilateral us programs see following section but that access is scheduled to expire at the end of december 2006 an ft would lock in those preferences and additional dutyfree treatment the andean g overnments also want to attract foreign investment and see an fta with the united st ates as way to establish more secure economic environment and in crease foreign investment within the andean countries however there is broad grassroots opposition to free trade with the united states opponent s argue that any economic benefits from increased trade under an fta will be rea lized by only small segment of the economy worsening the separation of the cla sses they also argue that large part of the andean population is poor farmers who are especially vulnerable and cannot compete against increased agricultural im ports from the united states which some andean officials claim are heavily subsidized the development group for alternative policies states that one of the few remaining mechanisms protecting family farmers in the andean region is the andean communitys price band system which they argue has served to cushion farmers from the vagaries of international commodity prices17 further argument is that an fta would mean reduced revenues for the

and thus hurts poor people another ipr issue was the socalled biopiracy andean negotiators wanted ipr provisions to go beyond those containe d in the wto they wanted protection against the use of

original one under the patent it also wanted protection against parallel impor ts which are products legitimately made in one foreign country but importe d into another country without the approval of the ipr holder the and ean countries opposed these us positions worker protections and human rights some unions and labor rights groups pr otested against trade negotiations with ecuador and colombia because they claimed that these countries have unacceptable records on worker rights and permit violence against trade unionists for example an official with the international confederation of free trade unionists icftu criticized colombias president for negotiating with paramilitary forces who are the killers of trade unionists according to the icftu official and said that the more union

north american freetrade agreement38 that chapter allowed private investors from one signatory country to seek binding arbitration against the government of another signatory such provisions environmental groups argued in their letter could allow foreign companies to comp letely bypass domestic courts to challenge public interest safeguards on the other hand us negotiators sought such

may not be renewed it indicates that reciprocal mutually beneficial arrangement must take the place of the unilateral access41 senior us trade official recently said that the us trade agreements with colombia and peru are likely to be treated as separate agreements by the congress thereby narrowing the possibility of standalone andeanus fta42 under current deadlines in the trade promotion
