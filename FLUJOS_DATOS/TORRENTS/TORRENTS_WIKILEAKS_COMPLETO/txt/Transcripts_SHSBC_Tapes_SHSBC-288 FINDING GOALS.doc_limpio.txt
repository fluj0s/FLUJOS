finding goals lecture given on 25 april 1963 thank you you keep that up ill feel youre glad to see geewhiz all right what is this 25th of april male voice yes ad 13 and saint hill special briefing course all right well were at that time of scientology when the gates are crashing open and open sesames are occurring all over the place and the reasons why it has not been easy to get pc rocket reading or started down the channel are gradually emerging im doing an even more fundamental goals pattern and fifteen fifteenth goal three hundred and five trillion and the early track is quiteits much greater in magnitude of charge late track you get one of these ris and you pull all the black cotton wool off the top of it and take look at it be about two three inches in diameterquite tiny thats all the late banks and that sort of thing that have crushed in on it and all that sort of thing one of these earlier track ones and so forthyou know what mine looks like one of these big spherical mines thats about the size of it its right in that order of magnitude and charge is about hundred to one over late track tells you why you shouldnt be pulling pc through one of these early goals even if you get your hands on it and you get goalyou see most of these early track goals are fairly standard there are certain goals that are standard to every case and the rest of the pattern is different but certain of themeverybody has certain goals you got goals about cause and goals about create those are common youll have goal something about game or something like that thatll be in common and these are all awfully early track these are along about tenth twelfth fifteenth goals see theyre way back i dont think pc could live through one i mean if you just grabbed him by the hair of the head and said everybody has got the goal to create all right lets find the top oppterm creation that fires yawww its an interesting invitation to do so the lecture im giving you however is about goals not so much about running the bank now the first thing you should know about finding goal is that the goal you will find will be the one offered by its wording thats the most likely most likely goal is the one offered by its wording and the less offerish goals wording is the longer its going to take you to find it now weve gone previously on the basis that the goal to be hidden would be much harder to find you see than some other goal and the easy goals to find were the neutral goals that didnt try to hide themselves and otherwise but remember thatnow this is new datum to youseventyi could tell you lot about this in later days philosophers will philosophize on this subject i can see tomes now that you cant see over being compiled and lectured over you see i can see it now harvard the harvard study group you seeyouve probably written some of these textbooks you see and they philosophize on subjects such as this and let just tell you that theres plenty there to philosophize on seventyfive percent thats rough figure but just to give you the order of magnitude seventyfive percent of the ris are antiself in gpm leaving somewhere between fifteen and twentyfive percent of them beneficial from the goal now thats interesting isnt it theres in other words theres just this little percentage guy postulates the goal you see to be such andso and soandso and he makes this postulate and this only carries him and the beneficialthe items beneficial on itare less than twenty i can give you almost exactly the finite number of ris or will be able to in another couple of days in any goal its number that wont vary but its somewhere around the eighty to hundred area closer to eighty than hundred now only the first few of these are driving the goal along towards successand you might say selfbeneficial only that few now the remaining lot all that tremendous column which is only one third of the terminals as you go up the linetwo thirds of those then are deadagainst it thats the terminals and then the whole of the oppterm column is against it all fortyplus of them isnt that interesting that means that you could make this loose statement that three quarters of the ris are against the thetan and inhibit his livingness and only about quarter of them have any slightest possibility of assisting and of course they dont assist either because theyre fixations now this tells you that if you were just running out somebodys goals so that you could free up his attention you would be justified in freeing up his attention but you might run into the interesting crossargument well whats he going to do without his goals every once in while thetan thinks of this well whats he going to do without his goals whats he going to do without these seventyfive percent antiself ris thats the question well the answer is hes going to do because he sure as the dickens hasnt been done in any other way than down you see quantitatively then seventyfive percent of the ris contained in the bank are against self and have nothing to do with assisting this goal but only impeding the goal and the individual something for you to recognize thats fantastic different percentage youd say well fifty percent of themit should be this way you know aristotelian theres just so much good in the world and theres just so much bad in the world and all things achieve balance of the mean you see and if there are fifty devils therefore there must be fifty angels and all this sort of thing you know and all things come down to mean emerson you see carrying on this philosophy could explain to you how if youre going to have five days of bad weather you of course then are going to have five days of good weather you go out here and talk to anybody around sussex about the weather and they may sooner or later bring this on you well weve had an awfully wet spring so it should be dry summer you see this is the idea of averages now that idea of averages carries through into the normal view of ones own goals that if its done you some bad its done you some good you see and it was really all for the best in this best of all possible reactive minds you see this youd look at it and possibly up to this instant you yourself may have looked at it as sort of fiftyfifty proposition you see well those arent the averages this is something like the odds in vegas slot machine iin yacht club one time i had the job of ordering according to the boards dictatesgot the small job of ordering some gaming devices and so forth for club members and i was fascinated listening to this checker suited tough mug who was giving da lowdown on dese here machines see now what we want what we want did we want da twenty percent payoffs see of course you could fix it up so it was payoff too see theres little devices in the back of these machines so that it can be adjusted so that they pay off on different percentages and the average machine that you walk up to innocently and throw something in and pull the lever on is rigged for twenty percent payoff see dats da law of averages see the reason the public plays them is they believe implicitly in the law of averages they think fifty percent of the time you pull that handle you should win actually its only twenty percent well this view carries forward instinctively rather into view of the reactive bank if fellow went to all this trouble to have bank and so forth it must be fifty percent good and fifty percent bad and and behold the actual figuresthis isnt my opinion seethe actual figures on the thing show that the payoff is very little bit better than the vegas slot machine you might have had goal to be beautiful well that means that youve got something on the order of twenty or so because those upper ris really arent very assistive an exhausted beauty you know something like that so youve got about twenty there that would give you the idea that you should be beautiful see and that leaves eightyplusor pardon its somewhere between sixty and eightythat just determine that the last thing in the world you want to have anything to do with is being beautiful thats the slot machine the slot machine percentage now undoubtedly professors in times to come will tell youtell thenot you but tell the public this or future scholars this in very flowery language and will deplore any comparison to crude devices and practices but actually there is crude device or practice amongst man which is quite as rigged against man as the reactive bank hes got goal there to be bright twenty percent of those ris tell him to be bright in varying degree mostly decline and the remaining ris make him absolutely gzrrr on the subject of anything bright or being bright or anything else this is basically the overt actmotivator sequence at work now im investigating the early track to find out whats this regularity thats made very suspicious frankly i havent learned too much in terms of the basic philosophy of scientology and axioms and that sort of thing out of running goals i knew all these already but i have discovered few new things and one of them give you an idea is quite important if it werent for this totally agreedupon overtmotivator sequence if it werent for thiswhich is one of the fundamentals of the bank and which gives us this overpowering antiself percentage of risand if it werent for the bank which resulted from ones considerations of the overtmotivator sequence the process of living would be therapeutic now the mystic the mystic has been saying that you have to do some living too every once in while youll find some scientologist he never quite got it out of the corner of his skull he i tells you well its all right to be processed but youve got to do some living too you see they say this atthey say this aboutmostly after theyve just met pretty girl or something like that now the onlythe only idea ive had thatrun into in running banks that suddenly reversed my concept of things on any point has been this general observation that ive looked this over and it rather makes popeyed if it werent for the bank and you wanted to feel better youd live few days and you would feel better now to some degree thetan is always doing this i touched on this at the congress but very very lightly thetans always doing this well in few days he willthe wound will heal you see and the bruise will go away he counts on this you see well the thing that defeats it is the bank and the overtmotivator sequence this other computation is defeated by this if you wanted to be clear if you didnt have banksounds very funny i meanall youd have to do is live for few years this is quite remarkable its quite revelatory to it doesnt sound like much of point and as it stacks up against things like the axioms and factors and things like this it isnt much of point but its rather surprise to to find out that it is therapeutic to live in this universe that comes to as terrific shock reverses my ideas entirely in the absence of bank in the absence of aof all these gpms why if you wanted to be bright you would live few years and if you wanted to be brighter youd live few more see and if you wanted to be talented you would live few more years and then youreal talented youd just live few more years you see sort of take it easy on the line and youd wind up better because the process of familiarization as you know very well is highly therapeutic process youll get somebody running touchreach and withdraw from car and he can drive the car better well why doesnt this work in life you add it up youve seen it under your own hands as an auditor that touch assist has banished some bruises and that sort of thing well why doesnt this work in life well the thing that keeps it from working in life is fundamentally the overtmotivator sequence which underlies the bank and the existence of the bank the fact that bank has been built and maintained and added to works against just achieving higher levels of beingness in the process of livingness and that is all that prevents it and this is quitewas quite revelatory to youd say this is not much of point and its true enough it isnt much of point its one of these elementary things that doesnt change around the basic concepts of scientology any but it does this it does this it puts different complexion on this universe and it puts different complexion on what you might care to do and it puts different complexion on your future for the next two hundred trillion see this changes that your concept that the only thing you could do is get to point where you could get totally out of this universe or something like thatif you had such conceptthe only way you could ever win is to just get away from all this mest and space and so forththose concepts are apparently invalid which is very hopeful happy note i feel like certain pollyanna idiocy taking over you see the thing to do after youve been cleared is live where here why because its therapeutic marvelous now of course the technology with which you are dealing from standpoint of processing has not existed before the laws or the put togethers or anatomies of things have been existing through the trillennia these things as they are dont you see what is the composition of time track what is the behavior of an engram what is the human behavior factor given certain stimuli what response will you get all of this data is invariable what are the laws of beingness as you find them in the factors and you find them in the axioms these things are strictly in concrete although they have not been known although they have not been known in general they have been adhered to and they are in that relative sense they are truth they are the true things which have existed back of human behavior reaction livingness beingness all these other factors now what you are handling that is new and that hasnt existed in the universe before is the knowhow of handling this material the knowhow of knowing and handling this material the knowhow of handling another thetan the knowhow of putting together bank the knowhow of running an assist things like the auditors code and that sort of thing these are new now people in their confusion of course say well when ron dreamed up all these factors and so forth when he dreamed up those basic axioms and its mighty wicked of him to do that you see well its all very well for to say well i didnt dream those up i didnt i was there amongst you but you had your share man i distinctly remember when the vote was taken i distinctly remember your loud clear aye shall there be general agreement on the subject of the overt motivator seq i remember your aye clearly it was shattering well those basic laws we have had to dig up all the way along the line but they are dug up now you should look at the other side of the fence what has been invented in scientology what has actually been originated what have i originated and so forth and thats your technical handling of the materials which have been discovered an auditing session the handling of the preclear the this and that youre entered in new track there and it frankly only to some degree is restimulative because itll bing in on somebodys goal somebodys goals will get in his road one way or the other in auditing seldom assistive because of this 2080 even if the goal you see was to audit pcs then youd have eighty items you see that would say these damn pcs cant be audited and itll kill see so therefore these things do not assist when theyre in place of course when theyre pulled up youve got all the experiential track available and they suddenly are of tremendous value gone theyre valuable here theyre nothing all in place they are nothing so auditing pc is something youre doing that is not former action and therefore should be clean clear and learnable and the more you work at it regardless of the aberrations of the bank why the better you ought to get at it and when you get bank gone or two or six or ten all slicked up theyll be just nothing in your road at all theres very little standing in your road of auditing pc except piece of bank here and there rock slam on something or other thats locked onto the top of the bank but these things all can be overcome you recognize that everything that has been done in scientology has been done in spite of the bank you see its just been done on the basis ofwell hell it can be done theres reason to be aberrated and theres reason to react to it somehow or another with the scruff of the neck why you pull yourself out of thewell you find yourself unreasonably angry about something or other and you start nipping and snarling around about one way or the other grab yourself by the scruff of the neck and say well even though i dont know what might be biting this is certainly aberrated conduct and do otherwise now in auditing in auditing you get consistent hammer and pound in routine 3 and routine 2 now of your own bank as an auditor because youre handling the bank materials to which you have to be risen superior all the time you are handling them well that takes some doing you understand what i mean dont you you see youre handling and restimulating the very materials which you must rise superior to and the only thing i can point out to you along that particular line is its been done it can be done and is done more often than you think mary sue and i are having bad time on some of this bankplotting if you think its easy to sit in the middle of bank andnot knowing its pattern it is already too crushing to have much to do with and not just find the item that fires but then list enough additional items to crosscheck to make sure that the ri has been knocked out you see on the basis that you wont get another item on that subject firing or with similar wording firing if youve got the ri in the middle of the cluster that i showed you the other day and you wont either so you not only have to find the ri but you have to make sure there isnt any other ri in that position see and that causes more listing and theresyouve already got your item see and things are going creak and falling apart and your skull is starting to slip along the center cleavage of it dont you see and somebodymass is already too tight because youve missed whole band above this and you dont know why and now somebody says you have to list few more youre just about feeling relieved just having gotten rid of that one you see and you have to tackle it again something like that or theres little more charge here or something like this you know and cross checking while getting better well of course tempers can get rather sharp under these circumstances arc breaks can become quite exclamatory and auditor blows and pc blows and so forth could very easily be reached under these circumstances and things were going worse to worst by tuesday night they were getting pretty rough things were pretty rough everything was going by the boards so she and i took look at each other and straightened it all out and so forth and it wasgot it all sailing again not because wed audited anything out dont you see because we said oh hell allits just bank you know lets get the show on the road see get the idea dont think then that what youre going through is uncommon or is peculiar i would say this the only reprehensible thingit is not reprehensible to have arc breaks its not reprehensible to miss somebodys goals and get so restimulated to do this to do that something or other have arc breaks and blow for twentyfour hours and lie quietly in the shrubbery sobbing knowing you will be dead any day now knowing its all gone too far and that nobody is ever going to help you and ron was wrong you know and all this kind of thing sad sad sad the only thing reprehensible is not doing that but when you have done itpicking yourself up by the scruff of the neck sooner or later in that period and putting yourself back on the rails again knowing that you can rise superior to it and surmount it see thats the only thing thats reprehensible its not doing that sooner or later you see blow explode and break up all the furniture see thats all very well but if in week or so at the absolute outside you havent gotten yourself by the scruff of the neck just realize youre not rising superior to your bank and the only thing that got us where we are is just rising superior without even any thetan bootstraps to grab hold of see its quite important to know that because the road is stony and goals being an entrance point can get very thoroughly in ones way now the goal you think you are going to find on the pc reverting to this nowthe goal you think you are going to find on the pc would be neutral goal right would be thisthe lie in there actually that is the hardest goal to find the length of time it takes you to find goal on pc is monitored by two things first and foremost is the degree he is not rising superior to his bank now that firstthat first is very embracive statement it looks like small statement when you first look at it but its very very broad statement hes not rising superior to his bank now lets take the full gradient of thisthe full gradient person who has goal that has the capability of driving him mad if not risen superior to would bring about madness correct so the bird down in the loony binin the spinbinwho is mad has not risen superior to his bank you understand now its the degree of charge and the significance is what makes bank hard to handle first and foremost degree of charge on the bank thats primary and then the significance of what the bank consists of is secondary those are the two points those are two subpoints not the two points i just mentioned moment ago you see thats what keeps person from rising superior to his bank thats and b under point 1 i want to repeat that because it sounds terribly terribly simple and youre liable to bypass it and say oh yes of course but this means great deal to you as an auditor its the amount of charge bywhat do we characterize as charge well its actually electrical thought impulses and there can be an ergs worth or kilowatt worth dont you see its measurable you measure it on your meter all the time you know what have we got hundred and twenty volts going through the power lines or two hundred and fifty volts all right well thats just quantity of flow but is there enough power coming through that line to light fifteenhundredwatt lamp or only enough to light flashlight in such general terms we are speaking of charge see lots of power and force or little power and force see and thats primary and the other one is significance now confound you dont get those reversed dont get those two importances reversed because if you do youll have beenbe continuing mistake which we have been making for number of years we were giving charge secondary importance and giving significance primary importance fellow had goal see fellow had the goal to spit all right another fellow had goal to spit one spat all the time and the other didnt spit at all you say well hes in different parts of the bank the fellow who isnt spitting is not necessarily in different part of the bank but that goal may not be very heavily charged see the restimulative locks and the overts hes committed and so forth all might be insufficient to hold tremendous quantities of charge there now secondarily one of them just doesnt spit and we can assume the fact that he just doesnt you see or the fact that he has the goal to spit and hes running the negative oppterms so we can say that but hes not worried about it either and the other one has goal to spit and he just spits all the time and there we are and so forth and nothing can stop him of it and hes been to the mayo clinic to have his spitter repaired and so forth you know theyve done practically everything for him they could theres thethats difference of charge see ones got very chargedup goal and the other same goal see and its not very charged up all right now significance is secondary but still important still important this is very much in the running now this becomes important to you from number of ways if you can discharge bank matter how then the dramatization of the bank will drop if you just take the significance out of the bank without removing the charge the dramatization will continue therefore youre going to be very puzzled someday youre going to see somebody that some has has run full bank on and this is the bank to fly and hes run this full bank and yet the person talks about flying all the time and flaps his wings and tells everybody he has goal you know i have goal you know to fly thats my goal you know thats my goal and hes flapping his arms all the time and running up and down the street thats why i do this you know that isnt why he does this the other hidden part of the thing is its very heavily charged so that his effort not to do it inflicts considerable pain and pressure upon him the bank contains selfpunishing mechanism and when he doesnt obey the bank and its dictates then he gets pain and he gets all kinds of spinniness and sen and he gets sick and the way not to get any of these things he hopes is to run up and down the street and flap his arms in other words this thetan is protecting his body and beingness from the amount of pain shock pressure incident to that bank and if he disobeys these ris he goes up against this shock and pressure and if he sort of tries to go along with it it doesnt drop on his head do you see that now some peoplethis is very early thing ivetelling suzie last night thisthis was academy material of 1951 wichita there are two things that thetan can do with an engram and one of them is dramatize it in full and the other is get sick from it i hadnt connected the two things up thoroughly you see yet i could see sort of that if he didnt dramatize it hed get sick from it so the actual taught statement wasis engrams have either mental or physical compulsion and some engrams have physical compulsion and the same engram in somebody else will have mental compulsion and thus you have some odd difference thetan to thetan well actually you dont necessarily have an odd difference thetan to thetan but youve certainly got difference in the charge in other words the same engram heavily charged causes person to be physically ill which in somebody else would cause him to dramatize only see he doesnt become ill from it or even hurt from it he simply dramatizes because of it now it is basic difference in the being the being is unwilling to face confront or stand up to that much charge he feels overwhelmed by it and feeling overwhelmed by it therefore obeys it and therefore you get mental dramatization so you can either be sick or crazy wide choice fortunately there is third which is rise superior to it now oddly enough you can rise superior it isnt all mechanical the way the scientist would love you to think you can rise superior to almost any quantity of charge if your intention to rise superior to it ishas as much charge on it as the charge you are facing you got it and you dont have to dramatize it mentally or suffer from it physically particularly but its certain that in the process of rising superior to it because you are bucking against it there is going to be certain amount of physical reaction see you might escape the mental reaction totally but the physical reaction you probably could never as long as youve got body and so forth never get totally away from youd say all right ive got this ive just got this idea that ive got to walk down the street sedately to hell with it im not going to go on walking sedately down the street youve noticed that youre always being sedate when walking down the street seenoticed this about yourself well youve got some kind of an item see its not necessarily as fundamental as goal ityou can actuallya sedate walker or something on the goal to walk you see and you say well im not going to do that not going to do that anymore im going to walk anyway i please and after youve gone fifteen or twenty paces youve got an awful pain in your side and you wonder where that came from and you say well i must be walking too fast i must be getting short of air youve refuted you see the dictates of that ri and it starts to key in physically because youre exciting and protesting against the charge of it the reason bank comes into action then is basically the eighteen buttons are being disobeyed in the physical universe in other words wholethats true of the whole reactive bank is the eighteen buttons its not much more than the eighteen there are lot of nuances and so forth but you could practically clean one with these the eighteen buttons are being dismayed see youre invalidating you know suppressing protestingthe items that are connected with the bank you see and those things then being pushed back out of sight and so forth various physical and mental reactions occur now the pcthis is lesscould be more tightly connected to the subject of goals but i just want to give you an idea of exactly what you are looking at there you see your next consideration then recognizing that somebody can rise superior to charge is recognize that nobody in black sphere ever sees the outside of it if hes in it he never sees the outside of it it really isnt necessary for him to crawl out of this black sphere to know he is in it however but the goal you want is the one the pc is in which therefore is capable of exerting against him the most charge and is therefore capable of making him dramatize it to the degree that he dramatizes it and your best trickand hear nowyour best trick in goal finding is to attain and maintain high state of morale in the pc during the finding of goals in such wise he can rise superior to his bank now the number of goals which you have seen rr on an upset chopped up cantneverfindmygoaltype pc are exactly nil it isnt the pc is incapable of rring but the pcyou could almost go over the top of his goal could practically read it straight into his teeth he hasnt ever collided with this yet without getting any muchvery much needle activation his reality is too low on it if he goes up against this goal if he ceases to dramatize it mentally or physically in any way hes going to get kickback from it so he plays it safe he doesnt rise superior to his bank and uhh uhh to catch catfish not really that goal blah nothing to do with it will however fortunately tick it never gets quite all the way out see itll tick what microscopic tick sometimes sometimes you get clang and then tick and then it disappears and you cant make it read but because it did something peculiar you keep your interest on the thing and you start putting in your big mid ruds now what are you doing these contain the buttons which going out in life create bank so running these things out on the subject of that goal permits the person to rise superior to it even fleetingly enough to get reality on it and make it read now if you understand that you will see why you have to do what you have to do in order to find goal and you could actually predict how goal will work or run under your hands as an auditor its creepy thing because you know that if you were just to get it on long list and read the list in very disinterested tone of voice with the pc not interested in it and nothing much interested anyplace anyhow and session in progress the pc not being assisted by you as the auditor to hold his head up and so forth about existence and he had reality on it doing anything for him anyhow you know and this old wah wah wah you could read it right on down the list and youd probably go right on over the top of it and it wouldnothing would happen and itd never react oddly enough little bit later maybe minute maybe page pc starts to get nasty but you could say possibly he could be so unreal on the subject that he wouldnt even have an arc break so you cant count on that either its good indicator but its not perfect one so what state do you find this goal in based on the remarks ive been making to you here what state is this goal in its quite interesting that you can find one at all because it is the least confronted the most dramatized point in the present time area but fortunately its also the most charged and maybe the pc is so overwhelmed that he doesnt react much but you can sometimes see the goal go sssswww like youre letting the air out of tire sometimes you can find goal that isnt ready to be run its an earlier track goal that is pulled up toward present time not ready to be run at all its not on the pcs goal channel dont you see and you hit the thing and the pc sort of cognites on it and the air goes out of the tire and the pc feels much better and the tone arm action goes down and everything is fine and now you cant make the goal fire thats fairly common its terribly beneficial because its opened the track and improved the pcs reality you let the charge of the thing off like letting the air out of balloon and it probably had the line blocked and the pcs confront blocked it wasnt the goal but you were likely to find the goal soon afterwards you might have two three four of these things even five of them in the process of looking for pcs goal in other words charge then also can apply to the solid goals line lets just consider list of twenty goals that the pc has got twenty banks or something like that and the listlets handle this as bank and it has only the significance of goals and just neglect the ris entirely just forget whats under all these things and just treat him as concatenation of goals unless you let some charge off the subject of goals youre not going to find goal so once again charge goes down and then the significance can emerge because charge can totally mask significance and is practically the only thing that does mask it although significance tells the pc how to be aberrated it is charge and his inability to rise superior to it that causes him to act aberratedly or suffer physically from having bank so you see you can actually go up and down the parade of pcs goals lists every once in while hit one of the goals on these channels or some lock goal on top of that goal now lets say its the goal to catch catfish and hes given you the goal to bait fishhooks and this to bait fishhooks is goal of one of the ris you know and it goes pssswww see something like that you get nice blowdown it all looks pretty it all looks very nice its all beautiful how interesting but it wasnt his goal and you cant make it read after that if it reads for while with rocket read and continues to read and wont ever go out and keeps coming in and going out and you just cant ever get rid of the thing its probably his goal you should certainly test for top oppterm and that sort of thing on it if you cant get rid of it forever and you cant find his goal but normally the whole subject of goals will release some charge then looking for any old goal if you do it well as an auditor holding up the pcs morale so that he can rise superior to his bankwill release charge and therefore permit significance to be viewed or confronted and then getting goals of particular kind will bleed some more charge off the bank and all of sudden youre sitting there looking at the pcs goal how long does it take you to accomplish these actions you possibly look on the finding of goals as matter of luck well after my experience in this line i find out i have been more spoiled by luck than assisted by it i found quite few goals in fifteen minutes on pc leaves you in this kind of frame of mind what the hell is wrong with auditors that they cant find these goals see i got my comeuppance took two years to find one goal pretty good so i had to get down and study this subject whats this subject all about fortunately it took two years to find it because i did make the study then and i got quite interested in it and eventually toward the end of that period of time was sufficiently informed on the subject so that if i had to find that persons goal again it would probably only take twenty five fifty hours see and whats all this about well the pc is not out here someplace four or five feet away looking at this point which is his goal and just wont give it to you that is not the pcs situation or position the pc is in the middle of this goal being this goal is this goal and the last thing he could look at is himself the old philosophers used to say physician heal thyself know thyself all this sort of thing itobviously the last thing you could see was yourself well even with the help of mirrors its sometimes difficult so youre actually not finding goal as your best statement of what youre doing youre actually discharging bank on the subject of goals and improving the confront of the pc until he can recognize what goal he is sitting in with your assistance and then you find the pcs goal and thats how you find goals now the assistive character of goal causes it to present itself the goal which is hidden causes it to present itself to hide you see why its gotits got all these oppterms that tell it to present itself theyd beactually are the easiest goals to find theyre the ones that pop up at once well theyve got eighty ris that say they should be found you see they say they should not be hidden and they only got twenty that said they should hide little more difficult goal to find is one which says find because its only got twenty saying find and its got eighty saying things that get found are damned good see so your neutral goal however your neutral goal is the hardest one to find it doesnt get blown into view by any of its significance it is as heavily charged but its usually quite abstruse compared to the pcs behavior youll swear this pcyoull swear this pc has goal to ride horses see youll just swear that the pc must have such goal because the pc just talks all the time about horses cant get off the subject of horses cant get off of horses hates horses gets walked over by horses see for aw man you say well whats about horses here whats about horses something about horses animals must be fifth dynamic goal you figure yourself wild you see youll eventually find out when you do find it why you will say well ill be of gun you see youll say one day say what was all that about horses and all of sudden youll cognite see well itll be something like to never go anyplace way the guy is executing his goal is to be fond of horses see you know death on cars death on airplanes you know telling everybody old methods of transport are best see thats just method of never going anyplace and itll be so trying to track goal down by the significance of the bank is one of the most thankless activities you can engage upon by all means engage upon it but just recognize that it is thankless activity its lots of fun its like playing charades or something but always be prepared to be knocked off your pins on how far you were out because youre never deadon itll beitll be something which is as wide as to never go anyplace and to ride horses see it looks quite wide you see and you just never would guess it and the auditor that thinks goal finding consists of large series of guesses and is guessing game and that he will find the goal if he is lucky and wont find the goal if he isnt lucky you understand misunderstands to degree what he is doing but because these other things are so attractivethe significance of it all is so attractive because of these other odd bits into the situation the pcs talk you see the pcs dramatizing the pcs this the pcs that and you start following down look at his 212 list and you find out he just says nothing but children children children children children on the 212 list i wonder if this pc doesnt have goal to have children do you suppose so to be child so on so on so on so on so on so on so on you finally find out the pc has goal to like new things its just way out man always and you just never would guess it because the pc is of the least possible assistance you recognize then that the significance channel is limited to simply giving him the significance of items to list goals from so as to bring him in close and the significance of items which occur on lists to list goals from and the significance of listing questions like the most nonsurvival goal you can think of you see to list from very assistive list questions can be used and so forth trying to guess the pcs goal however is very thankless task and very time wasting and very exasperating and the auditors liable to become extremely exasperated trying this he should recognize that these two things monitor whether or not you get the goal its the charge on the thing and the pc getting the charge off or rising superior to it see hes got to rise superior to this charge or youve got to take some of the charge off and actually you do both you do both it makes great deal of difference for pc to find out where hes located in the bank even though hes located too early in the bank you very often will find that you have to walk pc forward to present time just as fast as you can get him there through the banks you dont dare go back you dont dare go earlier dont go into any earlier banks because hes already handling one thats too much for him if he actually is handling bank that is far too much for him it is better for you to do the goal oppose list and move in to an earlier bank before you do anything more you can actually move pc up and down his goals channel by doing goal oppose what goal would oppose list you see what goal would you found the goal to ride horses what goal would oppose to ride horses and youll move him right up into his next bank but theres more air for the next goal when you do that and its easier to do it with the charge off so your first choice is to handle the goal that you got your hands on but if its just obviously impossible for him to handle this goal you just cant make it any way shape or form dont struggle around with it move him up the bank ways recognize that the goal youve got was the one which was most offerable or unofferable according to its wording not because it was closest to present time and therefore you will move him forward and you very well may find that you were looking for an inert goal it doesnt offer itself it doesnt refuse to offer itself so therefore there it is you see itll be some kind of an inert goal of some kind or another which is to be happy theres an absolute killer to try to find that goal is around but it just sort of never turns up now when you find goal which is neutral goal you want to kind of pat yourself on the back because it wasit was found by taking charge off and by being good auditor not because the goal walked up and said hey whhitt whhitt heyhey here i am here here here oh to be here all right there you are thats the way you find goals any pc that doesnt put his goal immediately on the list is either bucking an auditor who isnt raising his morale or hes just so charged up in all directions its almost impossible to do anything for him the speed with which pcs goal is found then is monitored by the amount of charge the significance and the degree that the auditor can raise his morale and discharge the general charge off the subject of goals and youll find its easy thats the way you find goals the fast way to find goals is not by magic significance but by very smooth clever cleverness must not be gainsaid smooth clever auditing that keeps the pc winning all the time on the subject of goals raising his morale getting him to confront them getting charge off that goals bank finding on little short lists of page or two goal thatll blow blow the tone arm down and then finding another one that will and so forth and he goes on and he removes charge and all of sudden as the pcs morale is coming up why all of sudden the pc says heh heh what do you know what do you know heres goal ive been sitting right here its to be here ho ho ho here it is fine great youve got the goal thats what goal finding consists of and its monitored by the character of the bank goals ride over as layer over the whole of the gpm and the subject of goals then lies as layer over the whole of the reactive bank and you can stick little pins in it here or there and get the charge off and get the pc alert and get him seeing things better and hold hishold him up and carry him forward and the next thing you know youve got the pcs goal its not because you guessed it its not because you guessed it we cant rule out luck entirely but so far as possible is you should just neglect it as factor itbecause youll find that pcs goal to the degree that you get the charge off get the pc to confront the bank and as you are assisted in the significance of the goal and of course as you hold the pcs morale up and keep him confronting and keep him happy about it and not frantically looking oh my goodness what are my goalwhats my goal whats my goal oh ill just die if i dont have my goal by tomorrow some auditors well i havent gotten your goal yet whats the matter with you why havent you put your goal on the list and so forth hmpf you realize youre making look bad you know everybodys looking at us hour after hour month after month goal whats the matter with you you see thats not the way to find the pcs goal because it violates the morale factor and it doesnt get the charge off it just caves the pc in further thing to do is cheer him up about how much progress were making with his state of case and how much better he looks now that weve been over few goals lists keep leading him and next thing you know bang theres his goal to be here okay thank you very much good night
