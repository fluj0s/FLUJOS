anywhere in federal securities laws single definition of the term appears to be used by industry participants but perhaps one of the most useful definitions of hedge fund is that it is any pooled investment vehicle that is privat ely organized administered by professional investment managers and not widely available to the public1 hedge funds have received great deal of media coverage in the past several years because large sums of money have been gained or lost in relatively short time by some hedge funds some members of congress believe that the sec should be given specific statutory authority to require the registration of hedge funds or their advisers2 arguments for other kinds of regulation or for regulation have also been urged3 in 2004 the sec issued rule4 which resulted in requiring many hedge fund advisers to register with the sec as investment advisers5 under the investment advisers act6 the hedge fund rule first defines private fund as an investment company that is exempt from registration under the investment company act7 because it has fewer than one hundred investors or only qualified investors8 allows its investors to redeem their interests within two years of investing and markets 1 presidents working group on financial markets hedge funds leverage and the lessons of longterm capital management 1 1999 another useful definition of the term is an entity that holds pool of securities and perhaps other assets whose interests are not sold in registered public offering and which is not registered as an investment company under the investment company act

adviser9 the rule goes on to state that these private funds for purposes of section 203b3 of the investment advisers act 15 usc 80b3b3must count as clients the shareholders limited partners members or beneficiariesof the fund10 because hedge fund advisers had for the most part before the rule been exempt from registration so long as they had fewer than fifteen clients11 hedge fund advisers referred to collectively as goldstein brought suit to challenge the equation under the rule of client with investor goldstein argued that the sec misinterpreted sect ion 203 of the investment advisers act which exempts from registration any investment adviser who during the course of the preceding twelve months has had fewer than fifteen clients 12 in response to goldsteins argument the sec argued that because the investment advisers act does not define client the term is therefore ambiguous the sec in its argument for authority to issue the hedge fund rule relied upon the discussion in chevron usa inc v natural resources defense council 13 that ifthe court determines congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue the court does not simply impose its own construction on the statute footnote omitted as would be necessary in the absence of an administrative interpretation rather if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue the question for the court is whether the agencys answer is based on permissible construction of the statute footnote omitted14 the sec argued in goldstein that because the investment advisers act does not define client it was permissible construction of the statute for it to issue the hedge fund rule equating client with investor the district of columbia circuit in threejudge panel unanimously found that this argument with respect to the secs hedge fund rule did not mesh with an amendment by congress to section 203 and that it was counter to interpretations that the sec itself had made over the years about hedge fund advisers and investors 15 according to the court 1970 amendment in which congress eliminated separate exemption from registration under the investment advisers act for advisers who advised only investment companies and explicitly made the fewer than fifteen clients exemption unavailable to such advisers16 would have been unnecessary if the shareholders of investment companies could be counted as clients the court went on to state that another section of the investment advisers act suggests that congress did not intend shareholders limited partners members or beneficiaries of hedge fund to be considered clients in its definition of investment adviser as any person who for compensation engages in the business of advising others either directly or through publications or writings as to the value of securities or as to the advisability of investing in purchasing or selling securities 17 the investment advisers act does not cover hedge fund 9 17 cfr 275203b31d1 10 17 cfr 275203b32a 11 exempted from registration is any investment adviser who during the course of the preceding twelve months has had fewer than fifteen clients and who neither holds himself out generally to the public as an investment adviser nor acts as an investment adviser to any investment company 15 usc 80b3b3 12 15 usc 80b3b3 13 467 us 837 842843 1984 14 id at 843 15 goldstein v securities and

the fund and not to give investment advice if according to the court the person controlling the fund is not an investment adviser to each individual investor each investor cannot be client of that person the sec itself before issuing the hedge fund rule had apparently argued that an investment adviser of an entity like hedge fund does not directly advise others in 1997 the sec stated that client of an investment adviser typically is provided with individualized advice that is based on the clients financial situation and investment objectives in contrast the investment adviser of an investment company need not consider the individual needs of the companys shareholders when making investment decisions and thus has obligation to ensure that each security purchased for the companys portfolio is an appropriate investment for each shareholder 18 the court then discussed united states supreme court case to buttress further its position the case lowe v securities and exchange commission 19 held that certain financial newsletters were not investment advisers after looking at the legi slative history of the investment advisers act the court held that the existence of an advisory relationship depended primarily upon the character of the advice given an investment adviser provides personalized advice attuned to clients concerns20 according to the court in goldstein the advisermanager of hedge fund is concerned with the funds performance and not with the financial condition of each investor the district of columbia circuit concluded that the commission has in short not adequately explained how the relationship between hedge fund investors and advisers justifies treating the former as clients of the latter21 and held that the secs hedge fund rule was arbitrary and vacated and remanded the rule on august 6 2006 chairman cox stated that the sec would not seek banc review of the court of appeals decision and would not petition th united states supreme court for writ of certiorari on december 13 2006 the sec voted unanimously to issue proposal for new antifraud rule under section 206422 that would prohibit an investment adviser from defrauding investors in hedge fund or certain other pooled investments according to chairman cox this proposal by the sec responds to the goldstein decision23 on july 11 2007 the sec unanimously voted to approve new rule 20648 under section 206 of the investment advisers act24 the rule passed in the wake of goldstein would clarify the commissions authority to pursue fraudulent misconduct by hedge fund advisers only
