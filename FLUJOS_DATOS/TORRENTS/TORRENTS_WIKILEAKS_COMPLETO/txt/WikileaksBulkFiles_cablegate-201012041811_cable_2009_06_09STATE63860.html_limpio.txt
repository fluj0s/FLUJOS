afternoon of june 18 transitional federal government tfg minister of national security omar hashi was killed by suicide vehicleborne improvised explosive device while in the medina hotel in beletweyne former somali ambassador to ethiopia abdikarim farah was also reported to be dead initial open source reports from local hospital indicate the attack resulted in 20 casualties later reporting shows more than 50 dead and 100 injured group has publicly claimed responsibility for the attack but an intelligence report of limited credibility alleges alshabaab operatives are to blame 13 snf dstiaita notes this is first suicide attack in beletweyne and if alshabaab operatives are indeed responsible it further suggests the group is altering tactics in its fight against the tfg specifically to incorporate the use of suicide operations recently received ethiopian intelligence suggested alshabaab operatives were preparing to use number of car bombs in suicide attacks against various targets in mogadishu in late june 14 snf suicide bombs are increasingly common in somalia according to press reports 30 lethal suicide bombings have occurred since five went off in october in somaliland tearline from may 26 stated the somali extremist group alshabaab employed the use of suicide bomber against tfg soldiers in mogadishu on may 24 resulting in at least six soldiers and one civilian killed the attack was the first suicide attack against supporters of moderate islamist president sheikh sharif sheikh ahmed8 the death of hashi in addition to the june 17 killing of bandadir region police chief ali said will likely demoralize and impair the struggling tfg in the near term as could alshabaabs possible increasing willingness and ability to utilize suicide attacks on tfg leadership

government service originating from suspected fabricator as of midjune the iranian revolutionary guard corps irgc was planning an unspecified attack in the united arab emirates iranian agents allegedly shipped four weapons to the port at jebel ali circa march with final destination to the emirate of ajman additionally the irgc planned to conduct attacks in saudi arabia kuwait and bahrain using different teams further information was provided regarding these alleged operations 16 snf dstiaita agrees with the cia assessment included in the full report which states the information is likely fabricated concern over possible iranian sleeper cells is nothing new for gulf governments volume of reporting illustrates the mistrust of sunni regimes in the region regarding their shia communities however dstiaita assesses it is unlikely tehran will conduct major or attributable operation against us western or gulfnation interests lacking significant regional event such as military strike against iran appendix source 7 17 snf sca india lt member shafiq khafa possibly preparing for operations tearline reports hussein an indiabased lashkaretayyiba lt member continued operational

earlier credible tearline suggests khafas network is striving to stand up two teams in southern india that rely on the support of lt members based in india sri lanka pakistan and nepal although specific details of planned lt attacks remain unknown latemay intelligence indicates khafas cells were engaged in surveillance activities of potential targets likely in southern india earlymay

highlights the unfccc aims to commit developed nations to plan for reducing ghg emissions usprc talks are in progress to reach consensus on new ghg emission requirements dos personnel have been targeted with socially engineered climate changerelated email it is probable that receipt of climate changethemed socially engineered messages will persist as negotiations continue 23 u source paragraph china and the us failed to achieve breakthrough at their latest round of climate talks on wednesday june 10 raising the stakes in the global effort to fight global climate change the two countries responsible for almost half of the worlds greenhouse gas ghg emissions ended three days of negotiations in beijing8 24 sbu ctad comment in june 1992 united nations conference on environment

stabilization of ghg concentrations in the atmosphere at low enough level to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system8 was produced the unfccc primarily focused on the voluntary stabilization of ghg emissions by industrialized countries was ratified and put into effect march 21 1994 in order to evaluate the progress of unfccc signatories the parties involved gather annually in meetings dubbed conferences of the parties cops at cop3 held in kyoto japan in december 2007 protocol to the unfccc called the kyoto protocol8 was adopted outlining in part legally binding commitments for the reduction of ghg emissions for developed nations the terms of this protocol are set to expire in 2012 and the goal of this years cop15 which will be held december 1 to 18 in copenhagen denmark is to establish new agreement among concerned nations prior to the kyoto protocols end 25 snf ctad comment currently the us and peoples republic of china prc two of the worlds largest contributors of ghgs are conducting specific negotiations on the topic in attempts to come to an agreement on what level of cuts in ghg emissions should be attained as these negotiations have been underway evidence of an attempt to gain unauthorized entry to computer systems operated by dos personnel involved with climate issues has surfaced though the incident has not been attributed to any known hostile actor the event appears to be targeted spearphishing attempt and may be indicative of efforts to gather intelligence on the uss position on climate change issues 26 sbu ctad comment on june 1 ctads technical analysisspecial operations monitoring detected malicious email massage targeting five dos individuals employed within the division of ocean affairs office of the special envoy for climate change the socially engineered message had the subject line china and climate change8 and was spoofed to appear as if it were from legitimate international economics columnist at the national journal in addition the body of the email contained comments designed to appeal to the recipients as it was specifically aligned with their job function and signature block with contact information for the spoofed sender was present attached to the message was pdf file also titled china and climate change8 which harbored malicious code designed to exploit the adobe collab geticon javascript vulnerability cve20090927 this vulnerability if executed successfully would have allowed malicious actors to remotely execute arbitrary code on victim computer the pdf document also contained the poison ivy remote administration tool malicious software program that provides remote user with nearly complete control over comprised system however since the dos users targeted in this intrusion attempt were operating with currently patched versions of adobe software there was neither compromise nor data lost as result of this incident for technical information about the incident see ctad report tr09034 27 cnf ctad comment dos employees dealing with sensitive diplomatic matters are often targets of socialengineering schemes conducted by actors seeking to harvest sensitive information from dos computer systems and networks as negotiations on the subject of climate change continue it is probable intrusion attempts such as this will persist ctad recommends personnel involved with climate change issues or topics relating to the upcoming cop15 continue to remain aware of the elevated risk of targeted socially engineered email and report any suspicious messages to their information systems security officer isso financial times httpwwwftcom biggest emitters fail to show the way forward8 june 10 2009 appendix source 19 28 u suspicious activity incidents 29 sbu sca uzbekistan vehicle with two occupants was parked across the street from us embassy tashkent june 2 during the cited period vip visitors arrived at post for meeting with the ambassador the diplomatic police were asked to check the vehicle but they did not act five minutes later the vehicle moved about 80 meters from the embassy and parked after several more requests the police finally walked over to the car and spoke to the driver he indicated he was waiting for his friend who was visiting8 the consular section shortly afterward the vehicle departed the area without picking anyone up 30 sbu rso actionassessment it is possible this was some sort of surveillance activity by the host government or others all relevant information was passed to the police however it is highly unlikely the embassy will hear anything the uzbeks do not share information or reveal the results of their investigations 31 xxxxxxxxxxxx secretfginoforn full appendix with sourcing available upon
