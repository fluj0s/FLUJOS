eric weiss specialist in financial economics government and finance division fannie mae and freddie mac changes to the regulation of their mortgage portfolios summary this report analyzes the costs and benefits of the fannie maes and freddie macs retained portfolios while they remain under conservatorship increasing numbers of homeowners are threatened with foreclosure because of interest rate resets on subprime mortgages combined with stagnant or falling home prices congress responded to this situation by passing the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 hr 3221 pl 110289 which uses the congressionally chartered stockholderowned governmentsponsored enterprises gses fannie mae and freddie mac to lead the market in providing more affordable mortgages the gses have retained mortgage portfolios with combined value of more than 14 trillion the size of the portfolios past management problems risks to the financial system and potential cost to the taxpayer led in part to provisions of the housing and economic recovery act that changed the rules governing the activities and regulation of fannie mae and freddie mac the bill created the federal housing finance agency fhfa and authorized it to regulate the size of the gses retained mortgage portfolios it also raised the conforming loan limit in certain highcost areas thereby allowing the gses to purchase larger mortgages in these areas previous regulatory actions have affected the gses portfolios in 2006 following discovery of accounting and management problems the gses agreed to restrictions on their retained portfolios in 2007 the office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo now the federal housing finance agency fhfa denied requests from both fannie and freddie to raise or eliminate the caps but these restrictions were relaxed shortly afterwards on september 6 2008 the gses were placed in conservatorship government management one condition of the conservatorship set the portfolio limit to 850 billion as of december 2009 with 10 yearly decline until the portfolios reach 250 billion the gses portfolios include mortgages and mortgagebacked securities mbs that are subject to financial risks when these risks are not managed properly or if market movements turn dramatically against the gses the government faces two unsatisfactory alternatives either let the gses go into default and work to control the financial repercussions or step in and assume payments on the gses debt at significant cost to taxpayers the gses and their supporters argue that the profits generated by the investment portfolios enhanced the gses ability to support affordable housing programs and reduce mortgage interest rates this report will be updated as warranted by significant developments contents background

fannie mae and freddie mac changes to the regulation of their mortgage portfolios background increasing numbers of homeowners are threatened with foreclosure because of interest rate resets on mortgages in the subprime and alta mortgage markets and falling home prices in formerly rapidly appreciating markets the economic stimulus act of 2008 pl 110185 temporarily increased the conforming loan limit which established the maximum size of mortgage that fannie mae and freddie mac two congressionally chartered stockholderowned businesses can purchase1 the gses which are prohibited by law from directly making mortgage loans to homeowners purchase mortgages from the original lenders who can then make more loans fannie mae and freddie mac add their guarantee of timely payment of the mortgages and bundle them into mortgagebacked securities mbs which they either keep in their portfolios or sell to investors the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 pl 110289 created new regulator the federal housing finance agency or fhfa and gave it broad authority to regulate the gses assets including their retained mortgage portfolios the legislation could help homeowners by making affordable refinancing more available and by increasing the conforming loan limit on september 7 2007 regulators placed fannie mae and freddie mac under conservatorship which gives fhfa control over their operations fhfa increased the limit for gses portfolios to 850 billion each until december 31 2009 and then requires the gse to reduce their portfolios by at least 10 annually until they reach 250 billion each 1 the nationwide conforming loan limit the maximum size mortgage that fannie mae and freddie mac can purchase was modified by the economic stimulus act of 2008 pl 110 185 from 417000 to add 729720 limit in high cost areas this increase expires december 31 2008 the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 pl 110289 makes the high cost exception permanent but revises downward the maximum mortgage size to 625500 these limits are revised annually based on house prices reform of the regulator of fannie mae freddie mac and the federal home loan banks is contained in title i of the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 signed by the president july 30 2008 unless stated otherwise all bills in this report were introduced in the 110th congress fannie mae and freddie mac are known as governmentsponsored enterprises gses this report will refer to them as gses there is third housing gse the federal home loan banks fhlbanks that have not created large portfolios and are owned by members not the public this report does not discuss the fhlbs for additional information on them see crs report rl32815 federal home loan bank system policy issues by edward v murphy crs2 absent conservatorship the housing and economic recovery act could encourage the gses to purchase mortgages that refinance homeowners out of subprime and other troubled mortgages by adding new funds to support mortgages for distressed homeowners the high cost exception to the conforming loan limit could allow certain homeowners in these high cost areas to benefit from the lower interest rate that conforming mortgages have compared to jumbo mortgages2 the fhfa with financial support from treasury established conservatorship and as part of the conservatorship agreement temporarily raised portfolio limits to 850 billion portfolio limits are then gradually reduced by at least 10 annually until each portfolio is less than 250 billion the temporary increase could allow the gses to provide more liquidity to mortgage markets during the current financial turmoil but the gradual reduction could address concerns about systemic risk3 treasurys financial support allows the gses to buy more mortgages than they would otherwise be able to in turbulent financial markets if the gses respond by acquiring more mortgages then the gses would assume the risk of default by the homeowner at the time that the gse conservatorship was announced treasury announced that it had signed contracts to provide financial support for fannie mae and freddie mac treasury agreed to make shortterm collateralized loans to the gses with interest rates set at the london inter bank offer rate libor plus 50 basis points 05 purchase new gse mbs on the open market and purchase senior preferred stock from the gses if their liabilities exceed their assets in return treasury received from each gse 1 billion in new senior preferred stock and warrants to purchase 80 of the common stock at nominal price prior to conservatorship accounting and management problems at the gses led fhfas predecessor the office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo to restrict the gses activities by limiting the size of their mortgage portfolios these problems at both of the gses came to light after they agreed to register one class of stock with the securities and exchange commission sec by law the gses were exempt from filing financial statements with the sec nevertheless both agreed to register one class of common stock4 this irrevocable decision made them 2 jumbo mortgages traditionally have been defined as mortgages that are larger than the conforming loan limit with the combination of national conforming loan limit currently 417000 and highcost area exception 729750 until december 31 2008 different people who use the termjumbo either refer to loans above 417000 or above 729750 in any case mortgages not eligible for gse purchase are typically more expensive than those that the gses can purchase 3 systemic risk is the risk that problems in one area or one company could spread throughout the system in potentially catastrophic ways 4 12 usc 1717c1 exempted fannie mae from registering with the sec and 12 usc continued crs3 subject to requirements to file reports with the sec on their finances and on changes in insider stock holdings while preparing to register its stock freddie mac announced in january 2003 that it had understated its earnings and it began to revise its financial statements and to install management controls to ensure accurate financial reporting in the future5 in restatement issued november 2003 freddie mac increased its net income for 2002 and earlier years by total of 50 billion freddie mac paid 125 million in civil fines and 50 million to settle sec charges that it fraudulently misstated earnings in addition freddie mac has paid more than 410 million to settle investor lawsuits unable to file required financial statements with the sec until its accounting problems were resolved freddie mac filed its first timely quarterly report 10q with the sec on july 18 2008 fannie mae registered its common stock with the sec on march 31 2003 and thus became subject to sec reporting requirements in september 2004 ofheo charged that fannie mae had failed to follow generally accepted accounting principles gaap6 fannie mae responded that its disagreement with ofheo involved differences in interpretation of very technical rules rather than improprieties after investigating the sec announced that fannie maes financial reports and management were inadequate and directed the gse to restate its earnings for the previous five years fannie mae was unable to file required financial statements with the sec until its accounting problems were resolved in december 2006 fannie mae released restated financials for 20012005 that reduced its earnings by 63 billion and fannie mae subsequently paid 400 million in civil penalties fannie mae resumed timely sec filings on november 9 2007 because of concerns over the gses management and controls ofheo proposed in 2006 that fannie mae should not increase its retained mortgagerelated portfolio to more than the amount held on december 31 2005 727 billion fannie mae agreed separately freddie mac agreed in letter to ofheo to limit its annual portfolio growth to 2 or approximately 28 billion without these agreements the gses would have been able to increase their retained portfolios as desired on august 11 2007 ofheo denied requests from both gses to relax the limitations on their portfolios ofheo stated that sufficient progress had not been made to resume timely financial reporting including annual 10k and quarterly 10q filings with the sec and that management controls were not adequate for more growth approximately one month later on september 19 2007 ofheo announced that it was making several changes that would have the effect of allowing the gses 4 continued 155g exempted freddie mac section 1112 of pl 110289 ended that exemption 5 crs report rs21567 accounting and management problems at freddie mac by mark jickling contains more details 6 crs report rs21949 accounting problems at fannie mae by mark jickling crs4 to increase their retained mortgage holdings to 735 billion each and to grow beyond this7 first it gave each gse the same portfolio cap as of july 1 20078 second it agreed that fannie mae could increase its portfolio at the same rate as freddie mac not more than 2 per year and not more than 05 per quarter this would allow each gse to increase its portfolio by 147 billion annually or 37 billion quarterly third for the fourth quarter of 2007 octoberdecember 2007 each gses portfolio could grow by up to 1 but the 2 annual cap would still apply this would allow each gse to increase its portfolio size by 74 billion in the last quarter of 2007 fourth ofheo imposed additional reporting requirements on both gses the gses have lost money every quarter starting in the third quarter of 2007 fhfa placed the gses in conservatorship on september 7 2008 in reaching its decision the fhfa cited continuing troubles in the mortgage credit environment in general and the inability of the gses to raise significant capital in particular9 as part of the conservatorship the gses agreed to new rules for their portfolios initially the gses would be allowed to expand their retained portfolios without additional capital requirements to 850 billion each until december 31 2009 after that the conservatorship agreements call for portfolios to decline 10 per year until they reach 250 billion each10 the gses can create and sell an unlimited amount of mbs without additional capital gse risks although lenders had been informed that the gses bonds were not backed by the us government many thought that there was an implied guarantee that the federal government would back the gses if necessary there was some basis for this belief because tax laws were revised in 1982 to help fannie mae avoid becoming insolvent11 the conservatorships with their continued bond payments and treasury financial support add to this justification as does testimony by fhfa director james b lockhart before the senate committee on banking housing and 7 office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo provides flexibility on fannie mae freddie mac mortgage portfolios september 19 2007 available at httpwwwofheogovnewsroomaspxid388q10q20 8 historically fannie maes retained mortgage portfolio has been larger than freddie

carryback and carryforward rules for federal national mortgage association crs5 urban affairs on october 23 200812 this section discusses potential financial risks that the reorganized gses are likely to confront during and after the conservatorship the conservatorship and the agreements with treasury have placed an all but explicit guarantee behind the gses bonds although stockholders were not protected under the agreements signed with treasury the gses risks are effectively transferred to the federal government treasury has agreed to purchase 100 billion of new preferred stock on an as needed basis from each gse13 in other words if gse were to become insolvent the government would invest up to 100 billion in the gse the government will receive warrants to purchase common stock for nominal cost if it purchases the preferred stock treasury can increase one or both ceilings with new agreement with conservators if the gses are unable to sell new mbs the treasury has agreed to purchase them using the federal reserve bank of new york as its fiscal agent the only limit on the amount of mbs purchased is the debt ceiling treasury announced that it has begun to purchase mbs but it has not announced the volume of these purchases14 treasury has attempted to minimize the risk by requiring collateral for loans and obtaining first claim on any funds available for dividends to conserve gse funds the conservators have suspended dividends on common and preferred stock after this announcement the price of the gses common and preferred stocks declined if conservatorship ends or dividend payments resume the prices of the various types of stock are likely to increase conservatorship may affect the gses portfolios because it gives them access to new source of funds the governmentsponsored enterprise credit facility gsecf and allows treasury to purchase new gse mortgagebacked securities this assures fannie mae and freddie mac access to relatively inexpensive funds to finance their portfolios and ready market for mbs if they decide to sell them following standard financial risk analysis gse risks are broken down into credit risk prepayment risk interest rate risk and operational risk these risks are discussed as they apply to the gse how various legislative options would affect these risks is discussed in the analysis section which follows 12 testimony of fhfa

fannie and freddie buy mortgages and combine them into mbs they guarantee that the loans will be repaid on time in 2005 according to media reports standard poors and most other major observers concluded that because of the different maturity dates loantovalue ratios private mortgage insurance and geographic diversification credit risk was not serious problem15 in hindsight default rates on loans increased in many places in the country at the same time for many classes of mortgages so geographic diversification proved to be less of protection for the gses than many assumed it would be16 prepayment risk prepayment risk is the risk to an investor that mortgage will be paid before its full term is concluded leaving the investor to find another investment perhaps when interest rates have decreased prior to the current housing cycle prepayment risk was considered more likely to be serious than credit risk homeowners prepay for two major reasons moving and to obtain more favorable terms many subprime borrowers took out their mortgages anticipating prepaying prepayment risk falls on the ultimate holder of mortgage or mbs since 1986 the gses have offered multiclass mbs which divide prepayment risk among the different classes they are customized for investors to match their tolerance and preference for prepayment risk versus anticipated yield when gses keep the mbs they also keep this risk interest rate risk interest rate risk comes from financing the mbs portfolios by borrowing money issuing bonds and is related to prepayment risk the gses face much higher interest rate risk for mortgages held in portfolio than for mortgages that they issue as mbs to finance the longterm loans held in their portfolios the gses use shortterm bonds and financial derivatives when interest rates increase the gses must roll over their bonds with higherrate ones when interest rates decrease homeowners prepay their mortgages and the gses buy new ones at lower rates between july 2007 and july 2008 fannie maes gross mortgage portfolio rose from 730 billion to 758 billion fannie maes mortgage guarantee business through mbs was much larger rising from 22 trillion to 26 trillion during the same period17 interest rate risk can be very serious many savings and loan associations became insolvent in the early 1980s because of it during that time fannie maes portfolio was poorly hedged while he was treasury secretary john w snow testified that fannie mae became insolvent on marktomarket basis only combination of legislative tax relief regulatory forbearance and decline in interest

httpwwwfanniemaecomirpdfmonthly2008073108pdf crs7 rates allowed fannie mae to grow out of its problem18 despite stateoftheart hedging with financial derivatives some believe that the gses portfolios continue to have significant interest rate risk if the gses have to make large adjustments to their portfolios only very large financial institutions will be able to handle the other side of the financial transactions if these financial institutions are unwilling or unable to take the other side of the financial transaction the gses could be unable to refinance or adjust their retained mortgage portfolios19 operational risk operational risk is the risk of loss due to inadequate or failed internal procedures and systems fannie maes and freddie macs accounting and management problems have raised questions about internal controls accounting systems provide the basis for portfolio adjustment decisions if the accounting system is providing inaccurate information the resulting portfolio adjustment decisions are likely to be incorrect the role of portfolios under conservatorship fhfas conservatorship announcement cited five reasons for the action safety and soundness issues including capitalization current market conditions financial performance and condition of each company funding difficulties and the critical importance each company has in supporting the residential mortgage market in this country20 the issues of current capitalization financial performance and condition and the inability of each gse to fund itself directly arguably relate to problems created by financing longterm mortgages with shortterm borrowing arguably with smaller portfolios their need to raise capital would have been less and their capitalization 18 us department of treasury testimony

most likely would have been reduced on the other hand without their portfolios the gses over period of time arguably would have been less profitable and might have experienced financial difficulty sooner fannie mae reports that as of the end of august 2008 approximately one week before being placed under conservatorship it had portfolio of 760 billion and freddie mac reports that its portfolio at the end of august 2008 was 761 billion21 fannie maes portfolio grew at relatively slow 44 annualized rate in the month of august but freddie macs portfolio decreased at an annualized 562 rate both gses appear to have been slowing their portfolio growth rates since february 2008 but this has not been smooth monthtomonth decline delinquency rates on mortgages steadily increased between july 2007 and august 2008 some might conclude from this that in response to financial market conditions the gses were both trying to limit or reduce their portfolio sizes one advantage of reducing portfolio size is that it both raises capital and reduces the need for capital as cushion against delinquency and losses the governments financial support and the elimination of capital requirements allow each of the gses to increase its mortgage portfolio by approximately 90 billion very inexpensively it can also sell new mbs without any reserve against losses this could increase profitability gse mortgage portfolios this section analyzes the benefits and costs of proposals to alter the limits on the gses portfolios as discussed above the conservatorship agreements with gse have temporarily increased gse portfolio limits to 850 billion each with this amount declining gradually to 250 billion each furthermore the terms of the conservatorship do not require the gse to hold capital against increases in their portfolios or new mbs sold absent the conservatorship the recently enacted gse reform bill delegated authority to the fhfa to regulate the gses portfolios this section discusses the issues involved in either increasing or decreasing those limits linking limits to subprime refinances during the legislative debate on gse regulation some proposals to increase the gses mortgage portfolios contained requirement that large percentage which varied depending on the proposal would be devoted to providing subprime borrowers with way to refinance out of their high interest rate mortgages into more affordable ones22 the homeowners would benefit because they would keep their 21 fannie mae monthly summary august 2008 available at httpwwwfanniemaecom irpdfmonthly2008083108pdf freddie mac

and refinance into mortgage with lower monthly payments some investors holding the subprime mortgages could benefit as they get out of subprime mortgages that have higher probability of defaulting and causing losses other investors such as those expecting interest payments in later years would suffer losses because of the prepayments the gses could benefit because the new mortgages might be profitable and the increase in their mortgage portfolios could provide additional profit subprime mortgage can have fixed rate or an adjustable rate fixed rate subprime can have an introductory reduced payment before becoming fully amortizing at the agreed upon fixed rate an adjustablerate subprime mortgage also can have an introductory teaser period typically two or three years before becoming fully amortizing and adjusting based on some interest rate on stated schedule news story highlighted the case of subprime borrower whose mortgage interest rate will increase in 2008 from 82 to 14 the monthly payment will increase from 3700 to 800023 the idea is that many subprime homeowners who cannot afford the subprime mortgage after the reset could afford the monthly payments of traditional 30year mortgage for calendar year 2007 even before changes to ofheos policy the gses could purchase and retain in portfolio approximately 320 billion in mortgages to replace those being paid off by borrowers fannie mae could purchase and retain in portfolio 124 billion in mortgages and mbs24 likewise for calendar year 2007 freddie mac could purchase and retain in portfolio 196 billion of mortgages and mbs 168 billion would replace those being paid off by borrowers and 28 billion would be allowed by the 2 growth25 in addition fannie mae and freddie mac can purchase without limit mortgages that they assemble in mortgagebacked securities mbs add their guarantees of timely payment of principal and interest and sell to investors loans related to public policy goal the portfolio limits could be tied to purchases of loans that are related to the gses public mission examples of other policy goals might include mortgages for 22 continued primer on current lending and

httpwwwfreddiemaccominvestorsvolsumpdf0607mvspdf crs10 higherrisk lowincome borrowers jumbo mortgages energy efficient mortgages elderly reverse mortgages or mortgages targeted to other populations often these policy goals involve mortgage instrument without long track record or with which the gses or the investors who buy the gses mbs have little experience the gses historically have kept some types of nontraditional loans in their portfolios because they apparently are hard to package and to sell in mbs at price that the gses find attractive the gses with their experience have found them more profitable to retain than to sell allowing the gses to retain loans related to another policy goal in their portfolios would then result in lower interest rates to borrowers who meet the policys criteria26 also the gses might be willing to purchase nontraditional mortgages related to another policy goal if there were other provisions that would make the overall change profitable after adjusting for risk and increased goodwill for example statistical analysis of combined enterprise profitability reveals that between 1983 and 2001 each 1 million of mbs outstanding added 2200 to net income profit but each 1 million in retained mortgages or mbs added 5300 to net income27 in other words dollar in their retained portfolios generated more than twice as much profit as dollar of mbs sold to other investors arguably this increased profit from retaining mortgage in portfolio might be sufficient to induce the gses to buy nontraditional mortgages but only if the nontraditional mortgages could be retained in portfolio allowing the gses to retain these mortgages would benefit nontraditional borrowers the gses would either expand existing lending programs such as nontraditional mortgages targeted to fulfil their housing goals or create new programs the interest rates on these loans would be higher than on prime mortgages the higher rate would compensate for the higher risk of default but the rates would be less than on mortgages financed outside the gses structure even so not every nontraditional borrower would qualify under the gses underwriting standards in light of fhfas statements detailing the reasons for placing fannie mae and freddie mac under conservatorship the future of the gses policy oriented mortgage purchases housing goals and contributions to the housing trust fund and capital magnet fund is unclear with the need to conserve capital to survive one could argue that these programs should be suspended one could also argue however that with the federal governments backing the need for capital is reduced and that the amount of capital that would be expended for these programs is relatively insignificant 26 in the secondary market investors bid on mortgages taking the contracted interest rates as given if investors want higher yield they offer lower price for mortgages investors might demand higher yield because the interest rates on alternative investments have increased or because risk has increased 27 this relationship breaks down after 2001 the reason appears to be in part due to the restatement of earnings by the gses and in part to net interest income almost doubling between 2001 and 2002 data source office of federal housing enterprise oversight mortgage markets and the enterprises in 2006 crs11 risk elements prior to conservatorship the costs of increasing the gse portfolio caps were mainly the costs of increased risk to the financial system28 it is difficult to compare potential costs against concrete benefits of increasing portfolio caps the gses manage many risks common to many businesses in the financial sector these risks can affect the companies stockholders employees bondholders and business partners and because of their size the gses risks can also affect the nations financial system and the economy these risks can be analyzed using the four categories discussed previously under conservatorship any losses in excess of the gses capital will be direct cost to the treasury while treasury states that it anticipates that the shortterm gse credit facility loans and mbs purchases will be profitable there is way to guarantee this suspension of dividends has saved funds for the gses at the cost of the stockholders who would have received them conclusion the gses portfolios include mortgages and mortgagebacked securities that are subject to credit risk prepayment risk interest rate risk and operational risk if these risks are mismanaged or if market movements turn unexpectedly against the gses the government faces two unsatisfactory alternatives either let the gses go into default and try to control the financial repercussions or step in and assume payments on the gses debt at taxpayer expense on september 7 2008 the government chose to assume gse obligations at taxpayer expense the issue of portfolio size will likely continue to be debated as policymakers consider what form the gses should take when they emerge from conservatorship 28 crs report rs22307 limiting fannie maes and freddie macs portfolio size by n eric weiss covers the risks from the gses portfolios in more detail for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34236
