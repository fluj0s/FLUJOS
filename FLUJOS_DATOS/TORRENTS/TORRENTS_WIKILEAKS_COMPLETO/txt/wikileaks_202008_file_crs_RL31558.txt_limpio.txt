united states updated december 15 2005 vladimir n pregelj specialist in international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade division congressional research service the library of congress normaltraderelations mostfavorednation policy of the united states summary in international trade the term mostfavorednation mfn treatment has meaning at variance with what it appears to mean the expression means equal rather than exclusively favorable treatment and is often used interchangeably with nondiscriminatory to make this distinction clearer and avoid possibly misleading interpretation of the mostfavorednation term legislation was enacted in 1998 to replace it in us law with the term normal trade relations or ntr in this report both terms are used interchangeably with nondiscriminatory the united states accords general mfn treatment as matter of international obligation as well statutory policy to all trading partners however mfn tariff treatment of several countries has been suspended under specific legislation virtually all such suspensions initially applied to 21 countries or political entities took place under the mandate of the trade agreements extension act of 1951 and two more under countryspecific legislation mfn tariff treatment of countries suspended under the 1951 law can be restored and maintained in effect for oneyear periods by using the procedure provided under title iv of the trade act of 1974 for such restoration to nonmarket economy nme countries under this procedure an nme country needs to conclude with the united states trade agreement containing reciprocal mfn clause and be in compliance with the criteria of the jacksonvanik jv freedomofemigration provision of that act the two countries whose mfn status was suspended by countryspecific legislation could and did have it restored by presidential action under conditions specified in the suspending law trade agreements with nme countries must be approved by joint resolution and are triennially selfrenewable but their renewal is also subject to presidential confirmation to maintain in force the compliance with the jv criteria and the mfn status such compliance must be either determined semiannually or waived annually by the secretary of state and such determinations or waivers are annually subject to possible disapproval by joint resolution repeated past legislative action to disapprove some waivers particularly those for china has been unsuccessful and ntr treatment contingent on waiver has invariably remained in effect permanent restoration of ntr status of any country generally requires specific legislation of the 29 countries todays successors of countries or areas originally subject to the 1951 suspension 15 had their permanent ntr status restored by specific legislation five directly and ten after period of conditional restoration under the jacksonvanik amendment one poland by the president under then existing statutory authority and one east germany administratively through unification with west germany the status of seven of them is still temporary subject to the determination of fullcompliance with the jacksonvanik amendment and of three of them under the jacksonvanik waiver provision two countries cuba and north korea are denied ntr status altogether the ntr status of two countries suspended by individual legislation has been restored permanently by presidential action as authorized by the suspending legislation this report will be updated as warranted contents what is normaltraderelations

normaltraderelations mostfavorednation policy of the united states what is normaltraderelations mostfavorednation treatment in international trade the expression mostfavorednation usually abbreviated mfn status or treatment has specific meaning quite different from what it appears to mean while suggesting special and exclusive privileges granted to one country it means in reality equal treatment of all countries granted the mfn treatment defined in more specific detail in article i of the general agreements on tariffs and trade gatt 1994 an integral part of the world trade organization agreement the term denotes the reciprocal extension of any concessions privileges or immunities granted or yet to be granted by country in trade agreement or in some other way to one country which is or would be the most favored in this respect to all countries to which it accords mfn treatment as consequence all countries to which country extends mfn treatment are or would be treated by the extending country equally or in nondiscriminatory fashion the understandable misinterpretation of the mostfavorednation term in its literal meaning particularly in the context of us trade policy of the mid1990s toward china gave rise to legislation1 to replace the often misleading term most favorednation treatment in the seven instances in the existing and in all future us legislation with the term normal trade relations ntr or another appropriate expression the mfn term however has remained universally in use in international trade relations including trade agreements to which the united states is party because of this fact and for reasons of historical continuity both terms mfn and ntr are used in this report with the identical meaning and also interchangeably with the term nondiscriminatory term also often used in us trade legislation in practice the principal benefit country gains from being accorded mfn status by another country is that the latters imports from the former are dutied at concessional rates often referred to as mfn rates and listed in the us tariff schedules as general rather than full rates thus the extension of mfn treatment to country can often mean significantly lower cost and hence greater competitiveness of its products in the extending countrys markets than would otherwise be the case in this report the mfn ntr treatment is discussed in the specific context of tariffs because of the origins and historical development of the 1 see pp 7 and 8 crs2 concept in the us law and practice particularly the denial or restoration of such treatment to nonmarket economy countries evolution of us mostfavorednation policy there are three basic often overlapping ways in which the united states accords general mfn treatment to its trading partners one is by means of bilateral compact eg friendship commerce and navigation or similar treaty or an executive trade agreement in which mfn status is accorded reciprocally another much broader in its reach is through being member of the world trade organization wto which as rule carries with it the obligation of according mfn treatment to all other members in addition the united states specifically accords to all foreign countries any concession on tariffs or other import restrictions agreed to in reciprocal negotiations with any trading partner by its own law first enacted in 1934 and now contained in section 126 of the trade act of 1974 19 usc 2136 us legislation provides specific procedure for extending mfn status to country except in the case of restoration of the status to nonmarket economy countries discussed below nor is there an official list of countries with mfn status all countries other than those to which mfn treatment is specifically denied by law as listed in general note 3b of the harmonized tariff schedule of the united states have mfn status the policy of general application of mfn treatment was modified when the president in 1951 and 1952 suspended2 the application of mfn tariff rates to the soviet union and to all countries or areas then under the control of international communism in practice the suspension applied to all countries of the then sinosoviet bloc but not to yugoslavia this action resulted in the increase of customs duties assessed on the us imports from the countries involved from the concessional levels resulting from trade agreements with third countries to considerably higher levels as enacted by the highly protectionist tariff act of 1930 the communist countries and areas initially denied mfn tariff treatment under section 5 were albania bulgaria china any part under communist domination or control czechoslovakia estonia germany soviet zone and soviet sector of berlin hungary indochina any part of cambodia laos or vietnam under communist domination or control korea any part under communist domination or control kurile islands latvia lithuania outer mongolia poland and areas under polish domination or control rumania southern sakhalin island soviet union tanna tuva and tibet3 2 the suspension was required by section 5 of the trade agreements extension act of 1951 65 stat 73 and implemented by presidential proclamation 2935 16 fr 2635 and subsequent trade agreement letters applying it to individual countries 3 us congress senate committee on finance trade reform act of 1974 report together with additional views on hr 10710 srept 931298 washington us govt print off november 26 1974 p 201 crs3 subsequently polands mfn tariff status was restored by the president in december 1960 while cubas was added to section 5 suspensions by law in may 1962 also in 1962 list of communist countries all section 5 countries except poland to which mfn tariff status was being currently denied was included in the newly revised tariff schedules of the united states enacted by the tariff classification act of 1962 and thereby the denial of mfn treatment to individual countries became part of the us law rather than of implementing regulations as theretofore section 231 of the trade expansion act of 1962 pl 87794 76 stat 876 applied the section 5 suspension to any country or area dominated by communism and thereby placed in jeopardy mfn tariff status of yugoslavia as well as of poland the implementation of this directive was delayed and the law was later amended by allowing any country with mfn status at the time of its enactment december 16 1963 to retain it if the president determines it to be in the national interest such determination was made on march 26 1964 for both countries 29 fr 4851 or 4913 procedure for restoring ntr treatment to nonmarket economy countries the trade expansion act of 1962 also made the restoration of mfn tariff status to country subject to section 5 suspension possible only by legislation while restoration of permanent ntr treatment can take place only through legislation enacted under general legislative procedure ntr treatment as such can be restored to nonmarket economy nme country subject to section 5 suspension on temporary basis by specific procedure provided in title iv of the trade act of 1974 while section 401 of the act requires the continuation in force of the then existing suspensions of mfn tariff status it also in other provisions of its title iv authorizes the president to restore nondiscriminatory status to nonmarket economy country and maintain it in effect on temporary basis by specific procedure the key elements of the procedure for temporary restoration of the mfn status to an nme country are 1 conclusion of bilateral trade agreement containing reciprocal grant of the mfn status and additional provisions required by law section 405 trade act of 1974 19 usc 2435 and approved by the enactment of joint resolution4 considered under specific fasttrack procedure set out in section 151 of the trade act of 1974 19 usc 2191 and 2 compliance with the freedomofemigration requirements jacksonvanik amendment section 402 19 usc 2432 the latter requirement can be fulfilled either by presidential 4 originally approval of trade agreement concluded with an nme country was to be effected by the adoption of concurrent resolution the type of approving resolution was changed with some delay to joint by section 132b2c of pl 101382 of august 20 1990 as precautionary consequence of the june 23 1982 decision of the us supreme court in us immigration and naturalization service v chadha which found legislative vetoes by means of onehouse resolution unconstitutional crs4 report to congress that the country is not in violation of in effect is in full compliance with the freedomofemigration criteria of the statute or by presidential waiver of such compliance under specified conditions neither the initial presidential determination of full compliance with the jacksonvanik amendment requirements nor his initial waiver of full compliance with them requires positive congressional approval however the initial presidential determination of full compliance with such requirements but not the initial waiver is subject to congressional disapproval by joint resolution5 of either house enacted under specific fasttrack procedure laid out in section 152 of the trade act of 1974 19 usc 2432 following the main steps of the procedure the disapproval resolution whose language is prescribed by law is referred respectively to the house ways and means committee or the senate finance committee and must be reported within 30 days of session or else the committee considering it is subject to discharge motion the resolution may be amended only with respect to its country applicability and the debate on the resolution and any procedural motions is subject to limits the resolution must be adopted within 90 days of session after the date the presidential determination is delivered to congress and enters into force thereby in effect denying the nondiscriminatory treatment and other trade benefits to which it applies on the 61st day after its enactment if the president vetoes the resolution the veto must be overridden within the 90 days or within 15 days of session after the receipt of the veto message whichever is later the date of the override is considered as the date of enactment after the enactment of legislation approving the bilateral agreement restorations of nondiscriminatory treatment are implemented by presidential proclamation which in the case of permanent restorations usually sets the date of their entry into force whereas temporary restorations enter into force on the date the exchange of notices of acceptance of the agreement by the two countries takes place the continuation in force of an nme countrys temporary mfn status is contingent on 1 automatic triennial extensions of the underlying trade agreement and 2 periodic renewal of the authority of the jacksonvanik amendment the agreement usually concluded for threeyear initial term itself provides for automatic threeyear extensions which do not require congressional approving action but is subject to termination by either party upon notice at least 30 days before the expiration of any threeyear term the continuation in force of the agreement is also subject to the requirement of section 405b1b of the trade act of 1974 19 usc 2435b1b under which any trade agreement concluded under title iv is renewed triennially if satisfactory balance of concessions has been maintained during the life of the agreement and the president determines that actual and foreseeable reductions in united states tariff and nontariff barriers resulting from multilateral negotiations which benefit the country in question unilaterally 5 before the us supreme court decision in chadha see footnote 4 this disapproval procedure involved simple resolution crs5 because of its mfn status are satisfactorily reciprocated by the other party to the bilateral agreement periodic renewal of the jacksonvanik amendment authority by the president must take place 1 in the case of full compliance with the requirements of the amendment by semiannual reports by june 30 and december 31 by the president to congress that the country continues to be in effect in full compliance with the freedomofemigration requirements of the statute and 2 in the case of waivers by presidential recommendation which must be made by june 3 of every year that the overall waiver authority and the existing individual country waivers be extended for another 12month period through july 2 of the following year in either case the renewal is automatic unless the yearend but not the mid year report of full compliance or the annual recommendation of waiver renewal is disapproved by the enactment of joint resolution considered under specific fast track procedures that under section 152 see previous page for yearend renewals of the determination of full compliance and separate one under section 153 of the trade act of 1974 19 usc 2433 for midyear renewals of the waiver authority the procedure under section 153 differs in its major steps from that involving year end determinations of full compliance only in that the deadline for the committee report is of 30 calendar days and that the resolution must be adopted and transmitted to the president by august 31 of the current year ntr action through the 105th congress shortly after its enactment january 3 1975 title iv of the trade act of 1974 was used to extend mfn treatment an annually renewable basis under the waiver provision to romania august 1975 followed by hungary july 1978 china including tibet february 1980 and czechoslovakia november 1990 romania however as of july 1988 renounced the continuation of its mfn tariff status subject to the conditions of title iv with the legislation for conditional restoration of nondiscriminatory tariff treatment to nme countries already on the books polands mfn tariff status was suspended again in october 1982 after the polish martiallaw government increased its repressive measures but was restored in february 1987 after most such measures had been repealed6 in january 1986 afghanistans mfn status was suspended by specific law which also provided for its eventual restoration under specified conditions by executive action without congressional involvement section 118 pl 99190 18 usc 2434 note in 1989 the designation communist countries was omitted from the title of the list of countries denied mfn tariff treatment in the newly enacted harmonized tariff schedule of the united states7 htsus and the 6 both actions were taken by presidential proclamations respectively 4991 47 fr 49005 october 27 1982 and 5610 52 fr 5425 february19 1987 7 general note 3b rates of duty column 2 htsus 19 usc 1202 duty rates in column 2 of the htsus are full nonmfn rates mostly as set by the tariff act of 1930 crs6 designation of the countries themselves was streamlined to reflect the actual post world war ii international border changes this streamlining did not affect the baltic countries estonia latvia and lithuania which remained listed individually since their incorporation into the ussr had not been recognized by the united states the suspension of east germanys mfn tariff status automatically ended with the unification of the two germanies on october 3 1990 by the end of 1990 mfn status had also been restored on june 1 1990 the united states and the soviet union signed bilateral trade agreement providing among other benefits reciprocal mostfavorednation treatment implementing legislation was introduced with some delay october 1991 and enacted on december 9 1991 pl 102197 because of the dissolution of the soviet union in late december 1991 the agreement did not enter into force for the soviet union but became the master agreement for subsequent extensions of mfn treatment to the 12 individual newly independent republics the baltic republics excepted formerly constituting the ussr appropriately retitled with the required technical changes and signed in each individual instance it entered into force for each former soviet republic upon the exchange of notices of acceptance see below much activity related to mfn tariff status of us trading partners took place during the 102nd through 105th congresses 19911998 mfn status was restored temporarily under the waiver provision of title iv to bulgaria and mongolia in november 1991 and permanently by law in december 1991 to previously nonmfn countries estonia latvia and lithuania after they declared their independence from the soviet union and in april 1992 to czechoslovakia as of january 1 1993 split into the czech republic and slovakia and hungary both of which already had mfn status under title iv after the dissolution of the soviet union in late december 1991 the suspension of mfn tariff status continued in force individually with respect to the soviet unions other than the three baltic 12 former constituent republics most of these had their mfn status restored within the next two years under the waiver provision of title iv and by acceding to the ussoviet trade agreement of june 1 1990 modified to apply to each individual republic thus annually renewable mfn status was restored to armenia in april 1992 russia and ukraine in june 1992 moldova in july 1992 kyrgyzstan in august 1992 belarus and kazakhstan in february 1993 georgia in august 1993 turkmenistan in october 1993 tajikistan in november 1993 and uzbekistan in january 1994 azerbaijan was the only former soviet republic whose mfn status had not been restored under title iv by the end of 1994 since the agreement was still awaiting since april 1993 the approval by that country during the same period mfn tariff status also was regained under title iv waiver provision by albania november 1992 and romania november 1993 following the september 1992 refusal for the second time of the house to restore it mfn status of bulgaria and the russian federation restored earlier under the waiver provision see above was continued in force by presidential determinations of full compliance with the freedomofemigration requirements made respectively in june 1993 and september 1994 crs7 although president bush issued in october 1992 notice of intention to restore mfn status to afghanistan suspended in 1986 see p 5 the restoration did not take place until june 2002 see p 12 also in october 1992 legislation pl 102420 19 usc 2432 note was enacted to withdraw mfn tariff status from serbia and montenegro constituent republics of yugoslavia in its reduced size the status could be restored by the president to either republic 30 days after he certifies to the congress that such republic had ceased its warlike activities in the former yugoslavia see also p 16 in the 104th congress mfn tariff status was extended in april 1995 to azerbaijan under the jacksonvanik waiver provision and permanent and unconditional mfn tariff status was restored in late 1996 by specific law to three countries bulgaria and romania both of which at the time already had mfn status under the fullcompliance provision of the jacksonvanik amendment respectively by pl 104162 and presidential proclamation 6922 effective october 25 1996 and pl 104171 and presidential proclamation 6951 effective november 12 1996 and cambodia then still nonmfn country but considered as not being subject to title iv by pl 104203 effective october 25 1996 upon the reciprocal exchange of notices of acceptance of the bilateral trade agreement of october 4 1996 61 fr 56256 measures introduced in the 104th congress to restore mfn tariff status either temporarily or permanently to number of other countries were not given further consideration nor were measures denying or restricting mfn status of certain countries in variety of circumstances the senate did however approve in september 1996 bill to substitute in all us statutes the often misunderstood term most favored nation treatment with normal trade relations similar house bill using the term standard trade relations remained pending see next page also suggested during the consideration of this change were other replacement terms among them some technically more accurate terms such as standard tariff relations and standard tariff treatment in 1996 the president renewed his determinations of full compliance with the jacksonvanik amendment requirements for bulgaria romania both subsequently granted permanent mfn status see above and russia and made in september the initial such determination for mongolia by the end of 1996 104th congress the president as required by section 405b1b of the trade act of 1974 see p 4 also confirmed threeyear extensions of trade agreements with 17 of the 19 nme countries that required such action in several instances with considerable delays such determinations were published for two countries upon the lapse of the initial threeyear term provided in the agreement itself and unconditional nondiscriminatory treatment was accorded by legislation during the same period to two countries subject to title iv thus eliminating the need for their triennial determinations during the105th congress several bills affecting the mfn status of us trading partners were introduced but none enacted most legislative action involved bills to permanently restore mfn tariff status to mongolia passed by the house and crs8 favorably reported in the senate and laos favorably reported in the senate introduced but not further considered was bill granting permanent nondiscriminatory status to kyrgyzstan and one that would grant under certain conditions permanent mfn status to any country still without it on the other hand bills also were introduced but not acted upon which would withdraw mfn tariff treatment from certain countries the president at the appropriate times extended all the existing jacksonvanik waivers made the initial determination of full compliance with the freeemigration requirements by all but two countries belarus and china then still subject to the waiver8 and subsequently reconfirmed such compliance the president also issued in april 1998 the initial jacksonvanik waiver for vietnam joint resolutions to disapprove this waiver were introduced in both houses and reported unfavorably whereupon the house resolution was defeated allowing vietnams waiver to remain in force9 presidential determinations of satisfactory reciprocation of concessions see previous page however were published during the 105th congress nor since except for vietnam in 2004 see p 16 providing for the triennial renewal of the relevant trade agreements with six more nme countries whose initial or earlier renewed agreements had meanwhile lapsed this lapse however has not in practice affected the ntr status of the countries involved since they are all still treated as having ntr status apparently solely on the basis of the standard provision for automatic triennial renewal contained in the trade agreements themselves during the entire period from mid1989 to the statutory extension of pntr in 2001 the most controversial issue of the us mfn policy has been the mfn status of china the presidents annual renewals of chinas jacksonvanik waiver and mfn status faced strong opposition in congress nevertheless joint resolutions introduced every year in the aftermath of the june 1989 tiananmen square incident to disapprove such renewals were not adopted two bills to subject chinas mfn status to additional restrictions passed during the 2nd session of the 102nd congress were vetoed by the president and in both cases the veto was upheld by the senate similar legislation as well as joint resolutions disapproving chinas waiver in subsequent congresses were not enacted without actually affecting the practical effect of mfn treatment legislation first introduced in 1996 see previous page was finally enacted in 1998 section 5003 of the internal revenue service restructuring and reform act of 1998 pl 8 armenia azerbaijan georgia moldova and ukraine on june 3 1997 and albania kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan on december 5 1997 9 this waiver did not of itself restore nondiscriminatory treatment to vietnam since the other required element of such restoration the conclusion and congressional approval of bilateral trade agreement was still lacking p 10 the waiver did however open up vietnams access to other benefits subject to jacksonvanik criteria credit operations of the exportimport bank and investment guaranties of the overseas private investment corporation provided the requirements of the agencies organic legislation have been complied with crs9 105206 19 usc 2481 note to replace the term most favored nation in seven specific statutes in which it appeared with normal trade relations or another similar appropriate term eg nondiscriminatory and required the new term to be used in all subsequent trade legislation the term most favored nation however continues to be used in international practice and in us trade agreements with other countries occasionally in conjunction with the new term in view of the thenprospective accession of the kyrgyz republic kyrgyzstan to the world trade organization which eventually took effect on december 20 1998 and the obligation of wto member to accord permanent and unconditional mostfavorednation treatment to all wto members the united states on october 9 1998 invoked article xiii of the wto agreement the article allows the nonapplication of the entire wto agreement and not merely of one part of it which had been possible under the comparable article xxxv of the gatt 1947 between any current wto member and the acceding member upon written notice to the wto by either before the latters accession without invoking article xiii the united states would have been in violation of its wto mfn obligation toward the kyrgyz republic because of the latters at the time nonpermanent and conditional mfn status subject to the jacksonvanik amendment identical action had been taken in similar circumstances on july 11 1996 with respect to mongolia then candidate for wto membership after mongolias accession to the wto january 29 1997 and the eventual extension of permanent mfn status to mongolia by the united states see below us recourse to article xiii with respect to mongolia was rescinded by the united states on july 7 1999 developments during the 106th congress in the 106th congress legislation was enacted and implemented to extend permanent nondiscriminatory status to mongolia albania kyrgyzstan georgia and china and the required semiannual reports of full compliance with the requirements of the jacksonvanik provision by ten former soviet union republics were made by the president as was the renewal of jacksonvanik waivers for belarus china and vietnam joint resolutions to disapprove the latter two extensions introduced in both houses failed to be enacted extensions of permanent nondiscriminatory tariff status were enacted and implemented as follows 1 mongolia enacted june 25 1999 by section 2424 of the miscellaneous trade and technical corrections act of 1999 pl 10636 19 usc2434 note and implemented by presidential proclamation 7207 effective july 1 1999 64 fr 36549 2 albania and kyrgyzstan enacted may 18 2000 respectively by sections 301 and 302 of the trade and development act of 2000 pl 106200 19 usc 2434 note and implemented by presidential proclamation 7326 effective june 29 2000 65 fr 41547 subsequently september 18 2000 the united states crs10 withdrew the october 9 1998 invocation of wto nonapplication article xiii with respect to kyrgyzstan see p 9 3 georgia enacted november 9 2000 as title iii of the miscellaneous trade and technical corrections act of 2000 pl 106476 9 usc 2434 note and implemented by presidential proclamation 7389 effective december 29 2000 66 fr 703 4 china enacted october 10 2000 as title i of pl 106286 normal trade relations for the peoples republic of china 19 usc 2431 note and implemented by presidential proclamation 7516 effective january 1 2002 67 fr 479 the delayed entry into force of pl 106286 was due to the provision of section 102 of the law which precluded the actual extension of permanent ntr to china before chinas accession to the world trade organization which eventually took place on december 11 2001 the tiein between the us grant of permanent ntr treatment to china and chinas accession to the wto ran in both directions on the one hand although chinas very comprehensive trade agreement with the united states was negotiated outside the working party for chinas accession to the wto it became part of chinas protocol of accession on the other hand mostfavorednation treatment of china by the united states was required by the wto agreement as reciprocal obligation of wto members such obligation could have been avoided only by the united states or chinas invocation of wto article xiii which allows reciprocal nonapplication of obligations under the wto agreement including the mfn treatment between current and the acceding wto member cf kyrgyzstan p 9 invoking article xiii would have meant that the united states would be precluded from benefitting not only from chinas comprehensive concessions in its 1999 bilateral agreement with the united states but also from those in the agreements with other wto members such action would have meant that the united states benefits from trade with china would have remained limited to those of very general nature contained in the much less comprehensive bilateral agreement concluded in 1979 provided china did not decide to renounce even that in accordance with the provisions of that agreement itself the bilateral trade agreement with china had been signed on november 15 1999 after protracted negotiations even before the president clinton transmitted the agreement to congress for approval in message on march 8 2000 hdoc 106 207 the house ways and means committee held hearing february 16 2000 on the uschina trade agreement and chinas accession to the wto shortly thereafter legislation approving the agreement containing in title i permanent restoration of ntr treatment was introduced in both houses s 2277 march 23 hr 4444 may 15 2000 both bills authorized the president to determine that the provisions of title iv of the trade act of 1974 providing for temporary conditional restoration of nondiscriminatory treatment should longer apply to china and to proclaim the extension of permanent nondiscriminatory treatment to china before making such determination however the president was to certify to congress that the terms and conditions for chinas accession to the wto are at least equivalent to those contained in the uschina agreement of november 15 1999 crs11 both bills were reported favorably hr 4444 amended on may 22 2000 hrept106632 by ways and means committee and on may 23 hrept 106636 by rules committee and s 2277 unamended on may 25 srept 106305 by finance committee hr 4444 as amended was passed by the house on may 24 in rollcall vote of 237 to 197 and in the houseapproved version by the senate on september 19 2000 by vote of 83 to 15 it was signed by the president on october 10 2000 pl 106286 s 2277 was not voted on entry into force was delayed until january 1 2002 see below developments during the 107th congress also signed during the 106th congress july 13 2000 was comprehensive trade agreement with vietnam which however did not enter into force until december 2001 see developments during the107th congress the agreement was in many ways similar to the one with china and contained among many other provisions reciprocal grant of nondiscriminatory mfn ntr status all required presidential semiannual determinations of continued full compliance with the requirements of the jacksonvanik amendment due in mid and late 1999 and 2000 were made although occasionally with some delay since in the meantime several countries had been granted permanent ntr treatment the endof2000 determination january 20 2001 involved only nine countries all former republics of the soviet union armenia azerbaijan kazakhstan moldova the russian federation tajikistan turkmenistan ukraine and uzbekistan on june 3 1999 the president recommended oneyear extensions of jackson vanik waivers for belarus china and vietnam triggering the introduction

nondiscriminatory treatment had already been enacted see p 10 nevertheless mid2001 extension of the waiver was necessary to maintain in force the temporary ntr treatment under title iv based on the 1979 agreement because of the statutorily mandated delay in the actual extension of permanent ntr treatment to china section 102a of pl 106286 precluded such extension before chinas accession to the world trade organization which was then being negotiated but foreseen as unlikely to take place before the expiration in mid2001 of chinas 2000 oneyear waiver cf p 9 waivers for belarus and vietnam

status see p 9 on january 8 2001 the september 30 1999 recourse by the united states to article xiii with respect to georgia whose accession to the wto took effect june 14 2000 was rescinded upon the implementation of permanent ntr for that country in view of the impending accession of moldova to the wto eventually approved by the wto general council on may 8 2001 and taking effect on july 26 2001 the united states on may 2 2001 invoked the application of article xiii with respect to moldova the invocation is still in effect since moldova is still subject to the conditional mfn treatment under title iv of the 1974 trade act similarly on december 9 2002 the united states invoked wto article xiii with respect to armenia at the time in the last stage of accession to the wto but not beneficiary of unconditional mfn treatment by the united states see also p 17 crs14 based on determination by the us trade representative under section 301 of the trade act of 1974 that ukraine failed to adequately protect us intellectual property rights prohibitive imports duties of 100 percent in addition to an earlier suspension of ukraines designation as beneficiary developing country for dutyfree imports under the generalized system of preferences were imposed as of january 23 2002 on imports under 23 tariff items in total annual value of approximately 75 million many of them normally free of duty 67 fr 120 this action in effect rescinded in part the nondiscriminatory treatment applicable to ukraine under the provisions of title iv of the trade act of 1974 it did not however affect the us general mfn obligation under the wto since ukraine is not wto member see also p 17 developments during the 108th congress great deal of legislative activity to restore pntr to number of countries took place in the 108th congress but in few instances ntradverse action also was initiated except for two pntrgranting measures in favor of armenia and laos all proposed legislation died in the relevant committees as move apparently preliminary to some of the pending and prospective extensions of pntr the chairman of the house trade subcommittee on march 5 2003 announced request for comments on the extension of pntr to armenia laos and moldova the received comments were published on april 21 2003 as ways and means committee print 1088 written comments on extension of permanent normal trade relations status to armenia moldova and laos 218 p on february 4 2003 one day before armenia acceded to the wto hr 528 was introduced to extend permanent nondiscriminatory treatment to that country an

section 2005 of pl 108429 see above added during the conference on that measure its operative provisions are identical to those of the three measures referred to in footnote 11 the provision entered into force on february 4 2005 pursuant to ustrs federal register notice published on february 11 2005 70 fr 7319 as an ntradverse action hr 3228 introduced on october 2 2003 would rescind chinas ntr treatment and prohibit its restoration in the future moreover s 1586 and hr 3364 introduced respectively on september 5 and october 21 2003 would in effect nullify chinas ntr status by imposing on any import from china 275percent ad valorem duty in addition to any other duty unless the president certifies to congress that china longer manipulates the exchange rate between the us dollar and chinese yuan and that the latter is valued in accordance with accepted marketbased trading policies12 in the same context hr 3058 and s 1758 introduced respectively on september 10 and october 20 2003 would require the secretary of the treasury to determine whether china manipulates its yuandollar exchange rate compute the rate of manipulation and submit report thereon to congress the secretary would be authorized to impose on all imports from china an additional duty at the rate equal to the rate of manipulation13 ntradverse action also was initiated against laos hr 3000 prohibiting the united states to enter with laos into trade agreement providing for reciprocal extension of mostfavorednation treatment was introduced on november 18 2004 by that date however such agreement had already been long signed see footnote 11 and legislation providing for laos pntr was in its final stages of enactment in the general context section 41biv of s 1861 sanctions policy reform act introduced november 14 2003 listed the imposition of increased tariffs including the denial revocation or conditioning of nondiscriminatory trade treatment as sanction falling within the scope of the legislation 11 continued published by the us trade representative in the federal register that the comprehensive us trade agreement containing reciprocal extension of unconditional mostfavored nation treatment concluded on august 13 1997 and signed on september 18 2003 has entered into force 12 despite recent minor adjustments the value of the yuan is maintained in an arbitrary exchange rate to the dollar rather than floating freely in response to the situation on the foreign exchange market 13 the enactment and implementation of any of these measures would in normal trade circumstances be likely to open the united states to accusations of violating the wto agreement and the uschina bilateral trade agreement crs16 except as indicated above concerning armenia and laos all of these bills died in the committees of referral on january 29 2003 the president transmitted to congress the 2002 yearend report on full compliance with the freedomofemigration requirements of the jacksonvanik amendment

president by proclamation 7860 effective january 7 2005 70 fr 2321 january 12 2005 extended permanent nondiscriminatory trade treatment to armenia pursuant to section 2001b of pl 108429 see p 14 and subsequently on february 2 2005 the united states rescinded the invocation of wto article xiii with respect to armenia see p 13 and effected full application of the wto agreement between the two countries on june 1 2005 the secretary of state issued public notice 5120 extending the overall jacksonvanik waiver authority and the waiver for vietnam for one year 70 fr 36998 in addition the acting assistant secretary of state for legislative affairs transmitted to congress reports continuing in force the jacksonvanik waivers for belarus turkmenistan and vietnam and on july 7 2005 also the semiannual report on full compliance with the jacksonvanik requirements by seven former soviet republics omitting armenia which in the meantime had been extended permanent nondiscriminatory treatment thereby continuing in effect for one year their conditional ntr status with effect on august 30 2005 the us trade representative terminated the 100percent ad valorem duties placed in early 2002 on imports of products under 23 tariff items from ukraine see p 13 thereby restoring to ukraine full if still conditional nondiscriminatory trade treatment 70 fr 53410 september 8 2005 crs18 present status in view of the statutory general applicability of permanent mfn status to us trading partners under section 126 of the trade act of 1974 there is official specific list of countries with mfn status all countries other than those to which mfn tariff status has been specifically denied by law or extended conditionally under title iv of the trade act of 1974 have permanent and unconditional mfn status the united states also extends permanent mfn treatment to membercountries of the world trade organization on the basis of the obligation of general mostfavored nation treatment under article i of gatt 1994 excepted from this obligation are wto members with regard to which the invocation of the nonapplication article xiii of the wto agreement is in effect at present moldova see next page countries to which mfn tariff status is denied altogether are cuba and north korea and its restoration requires congressional action through either direct legislation for permanent ntr status or use of title iv of the trade act of 1974 for conditional ntr status countries to which mfn tariff status is at present being extended after having been conditionally restored temporarily under the provisions of title iv are 1 under the waiver of jacksonvanik amendment requirements which must be renewed annually and the renewal of which is subject to disapproval by joint resolution of congress belarus turkmenistan and vietnam see p17 and 2 under the determination of continued nonviolation ie full compliance with the jacksonvanik amendment criteria which after the initial one must be renewed semiannually and is subject to disapproval by joint resolution of congress at the time of yearend renewal azerbaijan kazakhstan moldova russia tajikistan ukraine and uzbekistan see p 16 permanent or temporary nondiscriminatory treatment can normally be restored to any country by direct legislation enacted under regular legislative procedure or if qualifying for title iv procedure under that procedure likewise requiring legislative action legislation is pending for direct restoration of unconditional and permanent nondiscriminatory treatment to ukraine recent exception to this norm effective as of december 4 2003 has been executive restoration of pntr status to formerly yugoslavia under the already existing specific authority see p 15 presidential determinations of satisfactory reciprocation of concessions which the law requires for renewing the triennial terms of bilateral trade agreements with nme countries see p 4 have in the past been published with delays or in recent years not at all at present renewal determinations regarding agreements with all nme countries still subject to the renewal requirement other than the recently renewed agreement with vietnam see p 16 have technically lapsed this lapse however has not in practice affected the ntr status of these countries since they are all still treated as having ntr status apparently solely on the basis of the standard provision for automatic triennial renewal contained in the trade agreements themselves crs19 although moldova has been member of the wto since july 26 2002 the wto agreement does not apply between it and the united states because the united states has invoked the nonapplication article xiii of the wto with respect to moldova due to the still conditional and temporary ntr treatment of moldova by the united states subject to the jacksonvanik amendment in similar circumstances article xiii had been invoked also with respect of armenia which acceded to the wto on december 9 2002 and was disinvoked on february 4 2005 after the legislative extension by the united states of pntr to armenia pntr treatment of china would be either rescinded or in effect nullified by legislation to impose additional duty on all imports from china to counteract chinas manipulation of the us dollarchinese yuan exchange rate in one measure 275 percent duty would be imposed unless the president certifies that china longer manipulates the us dollarchinese yuan exchange rate in another the secretary of the treasury would be authorized to impose the duty at rate equal to the percentage rate of exchange manipulation see p 15 the term most favored nation has been replaced in us legislation by law in all seven instances in which it appeared with the expression normal trade relations or another appropriate term and is to be so replaced in all future legislation the mfn term however is still being used in practice internationally and in us trade agreements in some of the latter both terms are used in parallel see pp 89 crs20 appendix legislation note all measures authorizing the extension of permanent normaltrade relations treatment to ukraine contain functionally
