government and finance division july 24 2008 abstract this report provides an overview of corporate tax issues and discusses potential reforms in the context of these issues with particular attention to some of the recent research concerning large behavioral responses and their implications for revenue and distribution the ﬁrst section reviews the size and history of the corporate income tax and discusses an important issue that has been given little attention by those who propose deep cuts in the corporate tax its role in preventing the use of the corporate form as tax shelter by wealthy business owners this section also discusses the potential eﬀect of behavioral responses on corporate tax revenues the second section examines the role of the corporate tax in contributing to progressive tax system and discusses claims that the burden falls on workers the third section reviews arguments relating to eﬃciency and revenue yield and traditional criticisms of the corporate tax as one that causes important behavioral distortions one aspect of this discussion is the question of how the tax might be viewed diﬀerently in more global economy the ﬁnal section examines options for reformhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34229 order code rl34229 corporate tax reform issues for congress updated july 24 2008 jane g gravelle senior specialist in economic policy government and finance

char b rangel of the house committee on ways and means includes corporate tax revisions trading lower rate for broader tax base as part of the revenue ne utral reform package some participants at recent treasury conference and some discussions by economists in opinion pieces suggest there is an urgent need to lower the corporate tax rate but not necessarily to broa den the tax base arguments for lowering the corporate tax rate include the traditional concerns about economic distortions arising from the corporate tax and newer concerns arising from the increasingly global nature of the economy some claims have been made that lowering the corporate tax rate would raise revenue because of the behavioral responses an effect that is linked to an open economy although the corporate tax has generally been viewed as contributing to more progressive tax system because the burden falls on capital income and thus on higher income individuals claims have also been made that the burden fa lls not on owners of capital but on labor income an effect also linked to an open economy the analysis in this report suggests that many of the concerns expressed about the corporate tax are not supported by em pirical data claims that behavioral responses could cause revenue s to rise if rates were cut do not hold up on either theoretical basis or an empirical basis studies that purport to show revenue maximizing corporate tax rate of 30 rate lower than the current statutory tax rate contain econometric errors that lead to biased and inconsistent results when those problems are corrected the resu lts disappear crosscountry studies to provide direct evidence showing that the burden of the co rporate tax actually falls on labor yield unreasonable results and prove to suffer from econometric flaws that also lead to disappearance of the results when corrected in those cases where data were obtained and the results replicated similarly claims that high us tax rates will create problems for the united states in globa l economy suffer from misrepresentation of the us tax rate compared to other countries and are less important when capital is imperfectly mobile as it appears to be while these new arguments appear to rely on questionable methods the traditional concerns about the corporate ta x appear valid while an argument may be made that the tax is still needed as backstop to individual tax collections it does result in some economic distortions these economic distortions however have declined substantially over time as corporate rates and shares of output have fallen moreover it is difficult to lower the corporate tax without creating way of sheltering individual income given the low rates of tax on dividends and capital gains number of revenueneutral changes are available that could reduce these distortions allow for lower corporate statutory tax rate and lead to more efficient corporate tax system these changes incl ude base broadening reducing the benefits of debt finance through inflation indexing and reducing the tax at the firm level offset by an increase at the individual level this report will not be

developing for some time in november 2005 presiden t george w bushs advisory panel on tax reform reported on variety of proposal s for major reform of the tax system including those for corporate and business income taxes1 hearings were held on these proposals in 2006 but further action occurred on july 16 2007 the wall street journal published an opinion article by tr easury secretary henry m paulson addressing concerns that the us corporate tax rate is high rela tive to other countries and announcing conference to be held july 26 that would examine the us business tax system and its effects on the economy2 on july 23 the treasury department released background paper hereafter the treasury study that addressed several issues associated with the corporate tax 1 special tax provisions that narrow the corporate tax base 2 the efficiency effects of the tax distortions in the size and allo cation of investment 3 the size of the unincorporated sector and 4 comparison of corporate taxes in the united states with other countries3 the paper however did not discuss important justifications for corporate tax such as its role in the progressivity of federal taxes assuming the burden of the tax falls on capital and the n eed for corporate tax to avoid the use of the corporate form as tax she lter by high income individuals while the treasury study focused largely on

falls on labor in addition to theoretical argument s he cited an empirical paper by kevin hassett and aparna mathur of the american enterprise institute5 his article also discussed empirical evidence suggesting that the us might raise revenue by cutting corporate tax rates because of large behavioral responses6 hubbard concludes by suggesting that cutting the corporate tax rate would reduce tax that is largely or even fully borne by labor nd that behavioral responses would offset much of the static revenue cost during the conference discussions in cluded whether business representatives would trade tax preferences for lower rates whether reform should take the form of lower rates or writeoffs of investments and methods of avoiding the corporate tax by income shifting in global economy some participants complained that the corporate tax is outdated too complex di storts decisions and undermines the ability of firms to complete in global economy echoing some issues raised in hubbards article kevin hassett indicated that the corporate tax was not an effective way to raise revenues and suggested that lowe ring the rate would raise revenues7 prior to the 2007 conference congress held hearings in 2006 on the advisory panels proposals with ge neral hearing followed by one concentrating on business tax issues in the 110th congress attention to capital income taxes has

expresse d about the size of the corporate tax rate current corporate taxes are extremely low by historical standards whether measured as share of output or based on th effective tax rate on income12 in 1953 thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34229crs4 12 continued httpwwwcbogovftpdoccfmindex7731type0corporate tax accounted for 56 of gdp and 30 of federal tax revenues in recent years the tax has fluctuated round 2 of gdp and 10 of revenues reaching low of 12 of gdp in 2003 and standing at 27 in 2006 the tax is projected to continue to raise revenues of around 2 of gdp today it is the third largest federal revenue source lagging behind the individua l income tax which is about 8 of gdp and the payroll tax which is about 65 it is much more significant however than excise taxes which are slightly over 05 and estate and gift taxes at 02 note that the income tax share is expected to grow and will exceed 10 if the 20012003 tax cuts are not made permanent estate and gift tax revenues will also rise slightly much of the historical decline arises from legislated reductions in the corporate effective tax rate on the return to new investment which has fallen from 63 of corporate profits in 2003 to about 30 toda these changes include reduction in the top statutory rate from 52 to 35 nd much more liberal depreciation rules the total tax burden on corporate source income has declined even more due to lower rates on dividends and capital gains at the sh areholder level and the increased fraction of stocks held in tax exempt form while large fraction of the decline in corporate tax revenues is associated with these changes in rates and depreciation ot her causes may be more liberal rules that allow firms to obtain benefits of corporate status such as limited liability while still being taxed as unincorporat ed businesses and tax evas ion particularly through international tax shelters the treasury report documents the significant rise in the share of total business net income recei ved by unincorporated businesses since 1980 from 21 of total net income to 50 wh ile the share of proprietorships which have limited liability has declined slightly from 17 to 14 the share of subchapter s firms firms that are incorporated but are allowed to elect taxation as an unincorporated business rose from 1 to 15 these changes followed dramatic increase in the number of shareholders allowed for the election the limit of 10 was raised to 35 in 1982 to 75 in 1996 and to 100 in 2004 partnerships including limited liability corporations and limited liability partnerships increased from 3 to 21 with most of the increase occurring after 1990 this growth reflects in part the growth of limited liability corporations estab lished under state law the first state adopted such provisi on in 1982 which qualify as unincorporated business for corporate tax purposes while s ubchapter s firms are constrained by the shareholder limit partnerships are not although it has declined considerably in importance the corporate tax remains major source of federal revenue and significant change in individual income taxes would be required to offset substa ntial reduction in cor porate taxes current pressures to find revenue sources to pa for relief from the amt make an overall corporate tax cut difficult to envision fo r that reason the bush administration has proposed trading off rate reductions or possibly broad investment subsidies that reduce the effective burden on new inves tment for base br oadening through reduction of corporate tax preferenceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34229crs5 the role of the corporate tax in backstopping the individual tax measuring corporate tax revenue falls shor t of describing the full role of the corporate tax in contributing to federal revenues because the corporate tax protects the collection of individual income taxes as long as taxes on individual income are imposed significant corporate income tax is likely to be necessary to forestall the use of the corporation as tax shelter without corporate tax high income individuals could channel funds into corporations and with large part of earnings retained obtain lower tax rates than if they operated in partners hip or proprietorship form or in way that allowed them to be taxed as such as suggested by the growth in unincorporated business forms above w ealthy business owners may be quick to take advantage of tax rate differentials which currently tend to favor unincorporated businesses since 1986 when individual ta x rates were lowere d dramatically the corporate tax rate has been high relative to the individual tax rate the treasury study indicated that 61 of the income of unincorporated busin esses was associated with taxpayers in the top income tax bracket although the top tax rate on corporations is equal to the top individual rate 35 the corporate tax is graduated consequently for high income taxpayers there is an advantage to shifting part of ones income into corporation because corporate tax rates are graduated 15 on the first 50000 and 25 on the next 25000 and are lower than the top marginal tax this opportunity however is restricted by 1 limiting to one the number of corporations income can be shifted to 2 the amount on which rates are graduated and 3 disallowing graduate d rates for personal service corporations there are over 600000 cor porations with earnings less than 50000 according to internal revenue service statistics suggesting some shifting occurs in recognition of the potential use of the corpora tion as shelter tax law has in the past contained tax on accumulated earnings as long as dividends were taxed as ordinary income and the accumulated earni ngs tax was strict enough it was difficult to use the corporate form to shelter great deal of income this tax shelter constraint on lowering the corporate rate is arguably more binding today because of the lower rate s on dividends and capital gains enacted as part of the administrations co rporate relief package in 2003 table 1 calculates the effective tax rate for operating through corporation versus an unincorporated business for an individual in the 35 tax br acket if dividends are taxed at 15 and the corporate rate is lowered to 27 as suggested in the treasury conference the tax rate in the corporate form would be less than the tax rate on unincorporated businesses in fact with 15 rate on di vidends corporations that distributed less than 73 of their income would present tax shelter opportunity with 27 tax rate this outcome would occur even without th benefit of gradua ted rates and could potentially benefit labor income as well as individual capital income moreover although there are rules restricting accumulated earnings it is common for corporations to reinvest significant fraction of their earnings this unlimited sheltering option would not exist as long as the corporate tax were as high as the individual tax and its scope would be limited if dividends and capital gains were taxed at higher rateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34229crs6 13 excise taxes can be set at more than 100 and still yield revenue taxes on real capital income in excess of 100 can also yield revenue s because inflation is an implicit tax on the holding of cash some reforms might address these shelter issues directly including raising tax rates on dividends and capital gains at the i ndividual level while lowering the rate at the firm level eliminating th graduated rate structure and more formal methods of integrating the individual and corporate income taxes table 1 tax rates for alternative forms of organization under alternative rate structures individual at 35 rate 100 of income distributed50 of

that there are behavioral responses to the corporate tax even aside from the tax she ltering issues indicated above and that these responses have important implications for the efficiency of the economy and the burden of the tax the issue of revenue maximizin g tax rate popularly associated with the laffer curve has ra rely entered into the discussion laffer curve graphs revenue against the tax rate and is based on the tion that revenue is zero at zero tax rate and zero at 100 tax rate at least with respect to some taxes13 in laffer curve the revenue first rises with the tax rate and then falls and at the point it reverses direction is the revenuemaximizing tax rate laffer curve for the corporate tax has been proposed or alluded to recently in several articles in th popular press one is the article by gle nn hubbard cited above in national review kevin hassett discusses the laffer curve and presents chart that he indicates is an illustration that appears to show negative

this illustration persuasive proof another discussion of this issue appeared in an editorial in the wall street journal which also presented chart with number of oecd countries on it15 in this chart the editors simply drew curve which passed through couple of points there was statistical fitting to the data and informative value to such an anal ysis moreover the two points through which the freehand curve was drawn were questionable one was the united arab emirates with tax which is neither typical c ountry nor in the oecd and the other was norway whose corporate tax revenue tends to be high because of oil the bulk of the data showed obvious trend16 the hubbard and hassett articles do how ever cite some more sophisticated research hassett referred to paper by kimberly clausing17 and hubbard referred to paper by michael devereux18 in addition alex br ill and kevin hassett also prepared statistical analysis examining the change in the relationship over time19 cross country study was also prepared by mintz20 clausing who is referred to in the hassett article is quoted as claiming that the united states is likely to the right of the revenue maximizing point on the laffer curve but this statement presumably from an earlier draft is not found in her published article th at article finds revenue maximizing tax rate of 33 in her simple specification but as she added variables and accounted for other features the revenue maximiz ing tax rate seemed to rise as indicated in table 2 large countries and count ries that are less open suchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34229crs8 21 the 33 tax rate is from the simplest regression the other regressions which include other variables or control for country si ze andor openness lead to higher revenue maximizing rates 22 hence most of the variation is across countries which as discussed below is potentially serious problemas the united states have revenue maximizing tax rate of 57 much larger than the combined federal and state rate

same specification as clausing he finds only weak evidence of relationship between tax rates and co rporate tax revenues as percentage of gdp many of his specifications do not yiel d statistically significant effects brill and hassett find rate of around 30 which has been fa lling over time mintz finds rate of 28 but his data span only few years 2001200522 in the remainder of this section we firs t discuss theoretical expectations of this relationship and then examine these empirical studies both the theoretical and empirical assessments suggest that the results of these analyses are questionable theoretical issues the issue of laffer curve has not been part of the debate because the notion of revenue maximizing tax rate other than at very high tax rates is inconsistent with most of the models of the corporate tax traditionally the main behavioral response associated with the corporate tax was the substitution of noncorporate capital for corporate capital within an economy where the amount of capital was fixed imposing corporate tax in excess of th noncorporate tax caused capital to earnhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34229crs9 23 an invariant tax base would occur when both production and utility were of the cobb douglas form that is unitary factor subs titution elasticities and unitary product substitution elasticities at 100 tax rate corner solution would be presumably be reached where the corporate sector would entirely disappear but only at that extr eme rate would such an effect occur 24 brill and hassett revenue maximizing corporate income taxes p 6a lower return in the corporate sector and to flow out of that sector and into the noncorporate sector thereby lowering the return in the noncorporate sector and raising the return before taxes in the corporate sector the higher pretax return on capital also caused prices to go up in the corporate sector and fall in the noncorporate sector causing shift towards noncorporat sector total production the corporate profits tax base therefore had two opposing forces the amount of capital was falling but the profit rate was rising the taxable ba could therefore either increase as tax rates increased or it could decrease the direction depended on the substitutability of capital and labor in the corporate sector the centr tendency of most models with unitary elasticities suggested however that the tax base was relatively invariant to tax rates and revenues would always rise with the tax rate consequently under any reasonable set of assumptions there would either be revenue maximizing tax rate or an extremely high one23 if behavioral responses caused the total capital in the us economy to contract the outcome could be different one such model the open economy model appears to be motivation for the belief in relatively low revenue maximizing tax rate brill and hassett discuss elasticity estimates of foreign capital flows to after tax returns in the range of 15 to 3 they also cite recent study with an elasticity of 33 in their paper that finds revenue maximizing tax rate of around 30 they conclude that these high elasticities are consistent with the view that reductions in corporate rates could lure signifi cant enough amount of economic activity to locality to create laffer curv in the corporate tax space24 as shown in the appendix however one cannot achieve this tax rate even with infinite elasticities in the most extr eme case where 1 th country is too small to affect worldwide prices and rates of return 2 capital is perfectly mobile and 3 products in international trade are perfectly substitutable the re venue maximizing tax rate would be the ratio of the labor sh are of income to the factor substitution elasticity assuming fairly common values for model without depreciation of 75 for labors share of income and factor substitution elasticity of 1 the tax rate would be 75 far above the rate s of around 30 reported by br ill and hassett this rate could rise as these conditions are relaxed if the us is assumed to have 30 of world resources the rate rises to 81 if imperfect s ubstituta bility between investments across countries and between foreign and dom estic products is allowed it would rise further although it is possible to have reve nue maximizing tax rate that does not asymptotically approach 100 it is pr obably not possible to find rate that maximizes revenues as percentage of gdp because gdp falls as well as tax revenues in this case we are back to th same circumstances as in the reallocationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34229crs10 25 the treasury study provides data on the gr owth over time in unincorporated business forms and suggests that the large share of this income in the united states relative to other countries is due to the ability to avoid the corporate tax and still retain limited liability in the united states the growth in subchapter s income partnerships that can elect to be taxed as corporations corresponds to increasing limits on the number of permissible shareholders and the growth in partnership in come to the growth in the number of states allowing limited liability companies that do not fall under the corporate tax proprietorship income shares have changed very little in any case this growth occurred during period when the corporate tax was constant or falling of capital in the closed economy with itary elasticities the corporate share of income is constant relative to gdp and with other elasticities it can rise or fall related circumstance where capital can contract would be in model where savings responds so powerfully that the savi ngs supply is infinitely elastic that is when tax is imposed the capital stock must contract so much and the pretax rate of return rises so much that the aftertax return comes back to its original value this extreme savings response model yields the same revenue maximizing tax rate as the extreme open economy 75 and probably revenue maximizing tax rate for revenues as percent of gdp moreover the slowness with which the capital stock adjusts most models allow 150 years for full adjustments means that the revenue would be affected by tax rates in the past the result of this discussion makes it clear that revenue maximizing tax rates cannot arise from physical reallocations or cont ractions of capital nor are they likely to arise from substitution between debt and equity since the debt share has changed very little despite significant changes in the relative tax burden and estimates of elasticities that do exist are small remaining source of different outcome is profit shifting this could involve firms maintaining the same activity and shifting the form of operation to unincorporated businesses this could be possibility although the point of revenue maximization would be much too low because much of the tax has not disappeared but rather has shifted but at least in the united states this shift is probably less the result of high corporate tax rates and more the result of increasingly loose restrictions on operating with limited liability outside the corporate form actions that have not been taken by other countries25 the other profit shifting issue is the shifting of profits rather than activity to foreign c ountries such effects are possible but it would seem unlikely that tax avoidance coul d be of this magnitude

be discussed subse quently the incidence of the corporate tax on wages in add ition to these direct estimates there are numerous empirical studies th at examine underlying relati onships such as the effect of the user cost of capital which incorporates the tax rate along with other variables on investment most of these studies have found modest effects on domestic investment and have employed times series estimates within the united states30 one recent study on investment djankov et al31 is similar to the other studies in that it employs cross country data base and an independent va riable reflecting the tax rate to directly estimate estimate the effect of the corporate tax rate on investment emtrepreneurship and other variables the study found effect on investment for statutory tax ra tes but very large effects fo r constructed first year and five year cash flow tax rates this study unlike the others discussed in this paper is single cross section so there is way to introduce fixed country effects theoretical issues several difficulties arise in the djankov anal ysis first the cash flow tax rate variable they construct is hypothetical one for hypothetical firm which is not representative of the capital stock or the firm size in country or in all countries the denominator is income measured before labor income taxes paid by the firm such as social security taxes in the ited states and economic depreciation the first is very problematic because the capita l income tax rate increases as the labor income tax rate falls whic h is relationship that seems to have obvious economic justification it also measures taxes on cas h flow basis for the fi rst year or the first five years in an alternative scenario rather than over the life of the investment an examination of scatterplots of their data suggest that the results are highly affected by outliers particularly bolivia which has very high tax rate and very low investment rate and mongolia w tax country where investment has been flowing in recently due to mining the tax rate for bolivia is about twice the typical tax rate and is inconsistent with the corporate rate in bolivia according to the authors the tax rate reflects an alternative transactions tax however transactions tax is not tax on corporatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34229crs15 32 jane g gravelle and kent smetters does the open economy

quarter of income is capital incomes the tax should be reduced by 75 as with the laffercurve estimates the results of this study at least for the united states are not plausible according to their estimates 10 percentage point drop in corporate tax increased investment by 22 percentage points according to an open economy model developed by gravelle and smetters32 however us capital would increase maximum of 07 pe rcentage points with the elimination of corporate tax with more reasonable asticities it would increase by 03 percentage points this study was directed at the question of tax incidence and will be discussed in more detail in the section below which addresses distributional issues and the burden on labor moreover th effects may understate the investment effects because they do not take into acc ount debt thus their results suggest an investment increase that is at least 11 times too large and that could be 25 or more times too large empirical analysis while the issue of fixed effects would cause this study to remain problematic in any case this section explores the effects of the tax rate changes and of specifications that include multiple control variables the

university center for business taxation may 2008distributional effects second issue that was focus of th hubbard article but was not in the treasury report was the distribu tional effects of the corporate income tax if the corporate tax falls on owners of the co rporation or on capital in general it contributes to progressive tax system si nce higher income individuals have more income from capital than from labor based on tax data for taxpayers with incomes up to 100000 over 90 of income is bor income while for those over 1000000 less than third is labor income33 the traditional analysis of the corporate income tax indicates that the burden generally spread to all capital but does not fall on labor income most government and private agencies that routinely do distributional analysis allocate the corporate tax to capital income34 hubbard refers to three studies in his article one working paper by economist arnold harberger35 one working paper by w illiam randolph of the congressional budget office36 and one recent empirical cross country study using data similar to the studies discussed above by hassett and mathur37 three other empirical studies that use cross country data have so been released recently by felix38 by desai hines and foley39 and by arulampalam devereux and maffiini40 mankiw refers to the randolph and arulampalam devereux and maffinni studies

policy and analysis vol 6 1 2006 mobility and perfect product substitution the burden of any source based capital income tax falls on labor whereas for residence based taxes that is taxes that apply to domestic owners of capital regardless of where they are domiciled the burden would fall on capital the corporate tax s some aspects of source based tax and some of residence based tax both the harberger and the randolph studi are based on this simple model of perfect substitution altered to account for th united states as large county which lowers the elasticities and to account fo r multiple sectors randolphs study does not so much predict the burden of the tax as explore incidence in certain types of models he acknowledges that less capital mobility causes the burden to shift from labor to capital harbergers model has four sectors corporate and noncorporate tradeable sectors and corporate and noncor porate nontradeable sectors he assumes that the corporate tradeable sector is more capital intens ive that the average industry which leads to burden of greater than 100 of the tax falling on capital despite the vision of the manufacturing sector as highly capital intensive it actually is not housing services which are 100 capital accounts for over third of the capital stock in the country and many other industr ies such as utilities and agriculture are also more capital intensive than manufactur ing using the same assumptions about mobility but with less capital intensiv manufacturing sector randolph finds 70 of the corporate tax burden falls on labor to permit other than perfect substitutability much more complex computable general equilibrium model would be required which ne ither harberger nor randolph has provided such model has been developed by gravelle and smetters41 who find with reasonable elasticities that cap ital still bears most of the burden about 80 while the gravelle and smetters model is very complex it still abstracts from some important features of the corporate tax there are two other factors that would further push the corporate tax burden towards capital first the current corporate tax has elements of residence based tax nd the burden of resi dence based tax falls on capital second the current corporate tax actually subsidizes debt finance at the firm level and if debt is much more substitutable than equity total capital would be less likely to be exported indeed raising the corporate tax could cause capital to flow in finally note that as long as countries tend to choose tax rates similar to each other which appears to be the case the world becomes like the original closed economy model stressed by harberge r with the burden falling on capital according to the treasury study the us combined state and federal corporate statutory rate is 39 the g7 average is 36 and the oecd average is 31 effective tax rates which should govern the movement of capital are even closer together and in some cases are lower for the us than for other countrieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34229crs19 42 these issues surrounding savings are discussed in greater detail in crs report rl32517 distributional effects of taxes on corpor

incidence of the tax on labor income passing the burden corporate tax incidence in open economies by rachel alison felix november 2006 finds smaller effe cts than hassett and mathur but ones that are still too large to be predicted by theoretical model this study has problems similar to those that are discussed subsequently and in addition do not control for country fixed effectsan argument is often made that the burden of any capital income tax tends to fall on labor because it reduces savings an effect that would also occur in closed economy while one model pr edicts that the entire burde n of capital income tax eventually falls on labor this model re quires some extreme assumptions about human behavior such as perfect information an infinite planning horizon perfect liquidity and asexual reproduction models allowing for finite lives such as the lifecycle models find results that vary but if the revenue loss is made up by higher taxes on labor there is little or ffect some economists belie ve that these models are inappropriate as they assume too much information and skill on the part of individuals they suggest that individuals use rules of thumb such as fixed savings rates or targets instead these rules of thumb suggest that cut in capital income taxes either has effect on saving or reduces savings these economists also point out that most empirical evidence does not point to an increase in savings historically savings rates do not appear to respond to reduced tax rates42 the hassett and mathur study while the theoretical models do not provi much support for the corporate tax burden falling on labor hubbard also refers to an empi rical study by hassett and mathur that uses the corporate tax rate to explain differences in manufacturing wages they find statistically significant result that indicates 1 increase in the corporate tax causes manufacturing wages to fall by 08 to 1 these results are impossible however to reconcile with the magnitudes in the economy through competition wage changes in manufacturing should be reflected in wages throughout the economy implying that 1 rise in corporate revenues would cause an 08 to 1 fall in wage income however co rporate taxes are only about 25 of gdp while labor income is about two thirds these results imply that dollar increase in the corporate tax would decrease wages by 22 to 26 dollars an effect that model could ever come close to predicting43 the lack of theoretical reasonableness of the results may be explained by statistical issues the hassett and mathur study used data from 72

data for shorter periods 45 their independent or explanatory variables ta ke their value from the beginning of the five year period over which wages are averaged it should also be noted that hassett and mathur calculate the fiveyear average with nominal wages that is they are not corrected for inflation 46 see appendix b for description of the timation method visual inspection of the hassett and mathur data uncovered some errors with their 5year averages of wage rates some averages were based on 6 years of data and others were based on less than 5 years of data we corrected the errors so that each 5 year period for each country contains 5 years of data some of the averages are based on less than 5 years of data because of missing values in the wage series most of the missing valued are in the 2001 to 2005 period 47 the specific test of statistical significance of the coefficient estimates is the ttest this is test of whether or not the estimate is qual to zero the null hypothesis is the estimate is equal to zero the significance level indi cates the risk of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is in fact true significance leve l of 5 indicates that the null hypothesis will be inadvertently rejected only 5 of the tim significance levels commonly used in empirical social science work are the 1 5 and 10 levelsdeveloping countries fo r the 1981 to 2003 pe riod44 for their analysis their dependent variable is the logarithm of the fiveyear average of the average manufacturing wage they justify their us of the fiveyear average wage by 1 noting that due to capital adjustment costs the economic effects of corporate tax rate changes show up over longer time periods and 2 arguing that this may control for possible measurement error induced by the business cycle45 the wage rates for all countries were converted to us dollars using annual exchange rates hassett and mathur include the price leve l of consumption as an expl anatory variable to capture cost of living differences across countries the main explanatory variable of interest is the logarithm of the top corporate tax rate hassett and mathur also use the average effective and marginal effective corporate tax rates in logarithms as explanatory variables in some specifications we repeated the hassett and mathur basic estimation exercise the results are reported in the first row of table 6 46 the coefficient estimate reported in the first column 0759 suggests that 10 increase in the top corporate tax rate will lead to an 76 decrease in th average manufacturing wage rate this estimate is statistically significant at the 5 level47 the results are not as strong the estimates are closer to zero when using alternative measures of the corporate tax rate see the next two columns of table 6 the exchange rate between two curre ncies reflects the relative supply and demand for those two currencies and is affected by financial markets and government policies exchange rates ma not be good indicators of the relative buying power of wage rates in two count ries purchasing power parities ppps however are specifically designed to equalize the internal purchasing power of the currencies

evidence of corporate tax rates havi ng negative influence on wage rates in manufacturing the effect is smaller and less robust than reporte d in the hassett and mathur study hassett and mathur averaged wages over 5 year periods they justify using 5 year averages by arguing that it helps to control for possible measurement error induced by the business cycle but because of missing values in the wage data 66 observations have the average wage ba sed on less than 5 years of data 60 observations use only 2 consecutive years of data for the calculation of the average which would likely not affect any meas urement error the bottom panel of table 6 reports the estimation results when these 66 observations are excluded from the analysis leaving 153 observations in ll cases the coefficient estimates for all measures of the corporate tax rate are not statistically significant averaging the wage data over five years and using the beginning of period value for the explanatory variables however eliminates much of the variation in wages and tax rates thus throwing away much of the information needed to estimate the economic effects the statis tical analysis is repeated using annual data and including various lagged values of the corporat tax rate as explanatory variables48 the results are reported in table 7 the first column of the table displays the coefficient estimates for the current value of the corporate tax rate labeled t in the first column and the values for the previous five years t1 to t5 which allows for longer term effects of tax rates on wages in each cas the coefficient estimates are negative but very close to zero none are statistically significant at the conventional confidence levels furthermore all the tax rate variables in column 1 are not jointly statistically significant the next six columns report the results when the corporate tax rate values current and lagged are entered individually in every case the coefficient estimates are close to

of corporate income tax on wages oxford iversity centre for business taxation may 2008 income which they measure by the interest rate and labor income in their model labor and capital burdens are restricted to the total of taxes and they impose cross equation restriction on the estimated burdens they find the share of the burden falling on labor income to fall between bout 45 and 75 of the total number that is not inconsistent w ith theoretical expectations this approach however s the fundamental theoreti cal problem that wages at an individual firm should not reflect tax burdens at an i ndividual firm in deriving model that assumes it does th ey assume that the price level of their goods is fixed and base their results only on their sample of firms which is comprised solely of multinational corporate sector firms this approach creat both econometric problems in their analysis and also means that their results cannot be construed as reflecting actual burdens in any of their economies as discussed in more detail in appendix c they have also represented equity retu rns through the interest rate under the assumptions that investors equate net of risk debt and equ ity returns if these assets are generally substitutable the increase in corporate tax should cause portfolios to shift toward debt and drive the interest rate up while driving the equity return down moreover the tax burdens on bt and equity differ at th individual level and those differences depend among other things on any special tax rates for dividends and capital gains the deferral advantage of capital gains and the inflation rate aside from these theoretical problems an important issue with their study is that it appears that their results are forced by the cross equation restriction bill randolph discussant at recent confer ence found that if the restriction is eliminated there are statistically significant results from their study52 i n n example he presented the estimates of the wage effect was 48 of the burden with standard error of 18 in the original st udy in regression without the restriction the share was 19 with standard error of 10053 randolph considered number of other specifications including excl uding the largest countries but found statistically significant results he also suggested that only manufacturing subsidiaries be considered since other subsidiaries may be involved in tax sheltering operations in the case where he consider ed only manufacturing subsidiaries the sign reversed indicating labor benefitted from the tax but it was not

for business taxation april 2007 56 one can trace an infinite series of tax changes through lagged dependent variable for example if there is an effect of the tax rate in this year and an effect of the wage rate last year then the wage rate last year is function of the tax rate last year and the wage rate two years before which is in turn function of tax and wage rates by continuous substitution the taxes can be traced back infinitely long and converge on long run effect run the same authors had earlier versi on of their study with smaller sample55 although the authors control for firm leve l fixed effects they do not control for countryspecific effects the premise of this study is quite di fferent from the premise of the other empirical studies or the theoretical literature on the incidence of the corporate income tax the authors present bargaining model where capital and labor split the excess profit profit over normal required return thus the theoretical motivation is not driven by shifts in capital in response to changes in return but by other factors that do not have implications for capital income distortions the study reports for the preferred sp ecification that labor bears 96 of an increase in tax in the short run and 92 in the long run these numbers were considerably different in an earlier versi on of the study which found that labor bore 54 in the short run and 176 in the long run at least for the specification that the authors reported there are several reservati ons about this study with the estimation results the plausibility of the findings and the underlying theory and execution perhaps the most serious of these reservations is in translating from the motivating theory to the actual estimation process the theory addresses bargaining division of excess profits including the taxes on those exce ss profits between bor and capital as steady state longrun relationship but the actual empirical implementation examines the change in wages as function of the chan ge in output and taxes it does not allow for normal profit or taxes on normal profit or for possible changes in options it is thus an estimate of the short run incidence of tax change that could fall on both normal return and excess profits not th longrun sharing of the tax on rents traditionally economists have assumed that the burden of the corporate tax falls on owners of the firm in the short run since capital cannot be easily shifted even though it is technically possible to derive longrun elasticity if the regression includes lagge d dependent variables56 these shortterm data are unlikely to be useful as longrun specification the estimating relationship is deeply flawed because the factors that determine the incidence of the tax on normal returns which are held fixed in the model can also change for this part of the tax the burden on labor arises from general quilibrium effects in the economy and the effects on wages in particular firm bears relations hip to the tax burden of that firm to the extent that the study is measuring the shortrun effects the results as reported are not plausible to expect th at labor would bear all of the shortrunhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34229crs26 57 the tests used by the authors to determin their preferred speci fication are not without problems see david roodman how to do xtabond2 an introduction to difference and system gmm in stata center for globa l development working paper 103 december 2006 58 for example reason is presented for us ing dynamic specification or the specific number of lagged variables and the number of instruments was not reported burden of corporate tax in bargaining model would seem unreasonable there are implicit or explicit multiyear contracts that likely make shortrun adjustments of this nature difficult in the more intermediate term if all firms are considered labor is free to move from the firms with high taxes per worker to those with lower taxes at the same time it is not clear that the results do imply such large share is born by labor the regression is estimated in logarithms for reasons that are not apparent such as specification is not consistent with the model presented and implies burden that rises as the wage rises relative to taxes change in wages due to change in taxes equals the estimated coefficient multiplied by the rate of wages per worker to taxes per worker times the change in taxes the authors report the value calculated at the median if one took such formula literally it would imply that burdens for more labori ntensive firms would be more than 100 of the change an implausible outcome for bargaining the normal way to report results of this nature is to measure them at the mean in this case the short run incidence would fall from 96 to around 52 based on data reported in the study there are also some important reserv ations about the econometric methods panel data with short time periods where persistence effects can be serious and the need to control for firm specific effects face some si gnificant econometric problems the authors use number of different speci fications with widely varying results which suggest that the results are not robust57 there are several other aspects of the econometrics that are not transparent58 overall it is not clear what relations hip or phenomenon the study is measuring we are interested ideally in how an exoge nous tax change affects incomes yet for some of the countries that constitute larg share of the data there were changes in tax rates in others tax rate changes were virtually all declines with most of those declines occurring during the growth peri od of the late 1990s when productivity and output was rising it is possible that the results are capturing that phenomenon economic efficiency issues the traditional criticism of the corporate tax as spelled out in the treasury study is that the tax causes distortions and that these distortions are exacerbated by corporate tax preferences that prevent fo r given level of ta x revenue lower tax rate the issues discussed in this section include allocation of capital within the domestic economy savings effects and international capital flows httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34229crs27 59 these estimates are reported in crs report rl33545 the advisory panels tax reform proposals by jane g gravelleallocation of capital within the domestic economy traditionally the efficiency concern about the corporate tax is related to the misallocation of resources between cor porate and noncorporate production including owneroccupied housing over time effici ency issues have also encompassed differential taxation of the returns to assets of different physical types and financial distortions which affect the debtequity ra tio payout choice and decision to realize capital gains some efficiency costs including those that alter the mix of firms physical assets arise not so much from the existence of corporate tax but from its design table 8 captures the effects of the two most significant generally available provisions that affect tax burdens on diffe rent assets depreci ation rules and the recently enacted production ac tivities deduction which in ffect allows lower tax rate on certain domestic activities that are deemed production manufacturing construction etc the tax rates in this table account only for th corporate tax that is they do not include the benefits of deduc ting interest or the tax at the individual level on interest dividends and capital gains they are also forward looking and marginal they estimate the share of the return on prospective investment that is paid in tax if income were correctly measured and taxed that share would be the statutory rate most assets face lower tax rates the variations within column illustrate the distortions firms face in choosing the mix of capital within firm overall the variations not only distort the mix of capital within firm but also the allocati on of capital across diffe rent industries in general the most favored major industry is oil and gas extraction where large fraction of investment is ducted when incurred other things equal firms eligible for the production activities deduc tion and firms that have larger share of their capital stock in equipment than average will be favored in the aggregate the tax rate on equi pment is estimated at about 25 full 10 percentage points below the statutory tax rate while structures covering the last seven rows of table 8 are subject to 30 rate inventories are subject to 37 rate and the overa ll rate on reproducib capital is 2959 the treasury study reports aggregated asset specific data which provide similar result indicating that equipment is favored their measures include the total tax burden including the bene fit of deducting interest and individual level taxes they estimate tax rate of 25 on equipment 34 on structures and 33 on land and inventories these estimates are somewhat overstated because they do not include intangible investments such as research and advertis ing some research and experimentation expenditures are expensed leading to zero tax rate on those expenditures and eligible for credit as well leading to negative rate but only intangiblehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34229crs28 expenditures however are eligible sp ending on advertising is expensed and subject to zero rate even though so advertising has future benefits table 9 reports the types of distortions that are an artifact of the corporate tax as separate tax these estimates unlike those in table 8 take into account all levels of taxes one of the complications of estimating these tax rates is whether the estimates should consider the significant over 50 fraction of individual passive income that is held in tax exempt fo rm through pensions iras life insurance annuities and nonprofits in some ways these sources can be viewed largely as not affecting marginal investment for example overall savings because they are capped or not controlled directly by the investors and in other ways they affect choices such as debt or equity of pension funds for this reason in addition to the estimates presented by treasury two sets of crs estimates are provided which assume either tax exempt investment or half is tax exempt within the corporate sector in addition to asset differences there is larger differential with respect to debt versus equity finance the aggregate tax burden on debt is slightly negative while equity is taxed at close to 40 if economic income were measured correctly interest would be subject to the individual income tax rate which is typically slightly bove 20 debt is subsidized at the firm level however because nominal interest is deducted including the inflation premium while corporate profits before this deduction ar effectively taxed at rate below the statutory rate on real income the result is that at the firm level equity is subject to tax rate of around 30 while debt is subsidized at about the same level negative 32 tax rate at the individual level the tax on interest for taxable recipients is higher than the statutory rate because nominal interest is taxed which pushes the overall tax rate towards small but negative ratehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34229crs29 table 8 differential tax rates

report rl33545 the advisory panels tax reform proposals by jane g gravelle evidence on the size of this distortion is limited but since there appears to be limited substitution between debt and equity it is probably less than 5 of corporate tax revenue60 some simple measures however could significantly reduce this distortion such as indexing interest paym ents for inflation lower corporate tax rates would also reduce this distortion the distortion that has probably received the most attention by those studying the corporate tax is the misallocation of capital between the corporate and noncorporate sectors one source of the distortion arising from the corporate tax system is the taxation of corporate business at around 30 while unincorporated business is taxed at only 20 the higher corporate tax also contributes to larger wedge between corporate production nd owneroccupied housing which is generally taxed at negligible rate the magnitude of the estimated distortion produced by having separate corporate ta x varies depending on the model used and ranges from less than 10 of corpor ate tax revenue to about third61 since the deadweight loss varies with the square of the tax rate the recent decline in the differential due to lower tax rates on dividends and capital gains suggests thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34229crs31 62 the distortion is proportional to the square of the wedge between pretax returns which is where is the corporate tax rate and the unincorporated tt t tcc 11 tc t the corporate tax fell from about 44 in the mid 1980s to 32 today while the noncorporate tax fell from 22 to 20 and the rate on owner occupied housing remained about the same roughly zero holding the af tertax return constant the wedge between corporate and noncorporate capital fell by over half and the square of the wedge by 80 calculation for owneroccupied housing suggests that the wedge fell by 40 and the deadweight loss by two thirds for the largest deadweight loss estimates virtually all of the distortion was due to the corpor ate noncorporate differential so that the current deadweight loss would be only 20 as large while for the others both assets played an important role 63 estimates of 004 to 011 of consumption translate into 1 to 4 of corporate revenues see gravelle the economic effects of taxing capital income p 89 with the reduction in tax rates of almost 50 and the we lfare cost proportional to the square of the tax wedge the welfare cost woul d be about 30 of its former value or less than 1 there is also welfare cost from the realizations response of about 1 but recent evidence has shown this response to be small about the same size as the payout distortion 64 see jane g gravelle income consumpti on and wage taxation in life cycle model continueddistortion relative to revenue would be smaller probabl more than 4 to 7 of revenue62 distortion not captured in table 9 is the one that affects corporate payouts given that appreciation in stock values is not taxed until realized there is benefit to retaining earnings there is dispute about what determines payout ratios and what the consequences of the tax are but in general the welfare cost is small there is also some distortion due to the lockin effect for capital gains realizations63 considering all of these distortions toge ther they are probably in the range of 10 to 15 of corporate tax revenues ma gnitude that could be considered as significant component of the burden of the tax however given the revenue needs of the government there would also be di stortions perhaps smaller associated with alternative taxes ways to reduce th distortions may however be worth considering savings effects much of the treasury studys disc ussion emphasized effects on savings although this is not normally the focus of efficiency concerns about the corporate income tax this distortion is not unique to corporate income taxes but occurs with all capital income taxes there are many difficulties with analyzing this issue the first is that as noted above in the discu ssion about the potential effect of savings on the wage rate the economic distortion depends on the beha vioral response of savings to tax changes and what tax replaces them some ec onomists have strong view that taxes on the rate of return are always distorting but these views are based on dynamic infinitehorizon models that may not be very realistic with lifecycle models the distortions depend on what revenue substitute is provided substituting taxes on wages for taxes on capital the most likely substitute in the us tax system could potentially increase distortions depe nding on the responses in the models64httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34229crs32 64 continued separating efficiency from redistribution american economic review vol 81 4 september 1991 pp 985995 65 this reduction of two percentage points was based on the estimates for the production activities deduction relative to corporate revenues presented in the paper 66 the issues of efficiency in international taxation are discussed in much more detail in continuedin models of bounded rationality where savings are based on rules of thumb such as fixed shares of income or fixed targets th ere is response or only an income effect which would not produce distorting effect international capital flows tax rules can affect the efficiency of allocation of capital around the world and if the us rate is different from other c ountries it can cause misallocations of capital despite claims that the u s tax rate is much higher th an other countries its rate of 39 including state and local rates is only slightly above the g7 rate of 36 according to data in the treasury study since the production activities deduction acts in the same way as statutory tax rate reduction the actual us rate is not 39 but rather about 37 virtually the same as the g7 average65 the g7 rate would be higher if weighted by gdp the us rate is below the 38 rate in germany and 40 rate in japan the two largest of the g 7 other than the us in addition it is at the same rate as italy just above the 36 rate of canada and slightly above the 30 rate of great britain the 19 oecd c ountries had an average of 31 but this average would be higher if weighted by country size because larger countries have higher rates if ireland with 13 tax rate were eliminated the average would be 33 although these rates put the united st ates rate close to those of other large developed countries the repor t also indicates that seve ral countries in particular germany are planning to cut their corporate tax rates the treasury study also reports effective marginal tax rates on equipment investment which accounts for tax preferen ces such as depreciation the effective tax rate for the united states at 24 was the same as the g7 average and just 4 percentage points above the 19 oecd country average for debt finance the us had higher negative rate 46 and thus more beneficial tax treatment than the g 7 average at 39 and the average for 19 oe cd countries of 32 if the measure is simply the average tax rate corporate tax dividend by corporate surplus which accounts for various corporate preferences the us average rate is 17 which is below the oecd average of 22 these data do not indicate the us is high tax country with respect to investment and would probably not become so even if some reductions occur in the future in other countries the main sour ce of international di stortion therefore is probably the increased investment that ccurs in low tax and tax haven countries because the united states and other develope d countries do not tax that income at all or tax it on deferred basis this inefficiency is not due to the corporate effective tax rate but rather is due to the provision of tax bene fit for investment abroad66httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34229crs33 66 continued crs report rl34115 reform of us internati onal taxes alternatives by david l brumbaugh and jane g gravelle 67 the purpose of most of the provisions is self explanatory note however the property sales source rule also known as the title passage rule is effectively an export subsidy percentage depletion benefits independent oil and gas producers and mineral and coal producers and allows deduction of costs based on percentage of receipts rather than the actual costs even when tax rates diverge the efficiency costs may not be significant because the evidence suggests as noted in previous sections limited mobility of capital as result of varying tax rates potential revisions in the corporate tax there are variety of potential revisions that could be made to the corporate tax to permit lowering the rate the revisions discussed here include 1 broadening the corporate tax base and using the revenues to reduce the rate or to provide investment incentives 2 correcting interest deducti ons and income for inflation and 3 increasing the individual level tax to permit lower tax at the firm level eliminating corpor ate tax preferences one type of revision that would pr obably be supported by most economic analysts is to eliminate corporate preferences in exchange for lower statutory corporate tax rate the treasury study estimates that eliminating corporate preferences would allow the tax rate to be lowered to 27 table 10 shows

production activities duction 210 billion both provisions are captured in effective ta x rates cited above other significant provisions worth over 100 billion each in these years include the exclusion of interest on state and local bonds the research and experimentation tax credit and the deferral of income from foreign sources wh ich is probably responsible for much of the international distortions67 interestingly their list does not include graduated rates for small corporations which costs slightly over 4 billion per year and would allowing for growth raise over 50 billion in revenue over the period if were eliminate d since owners of small corporations are typically as wealthy or more wealthy than owners of large ones there appears to be little economic justification for

country of ow nership while the present international tax system results in distortions it is not clear how moving to territorial tax would reduce these distortions and even less clear how it would improve tax compliance and profit shifting for more detailed discussion see crs report rl34115 reform of us international taxes alternatives by david l brumbaugh and jane g gravellethe treasury study also discussed the possibility of using this base broadening to provide an investment incentive such as partial expensing such provision would have larger effect on lowering the tax rate on new investment than is the case for rate reduction it is difficult howev er to design investment subsidies in fashion that is both neutral across types of assets and ge nerates an even revenue loss pattern over time historically investment subsidies have been restricted to equipment the provision used most frequen tly in the past is the investment tax credit which if allowed at flat rate favors shortlived assets partial expensing is neutral across investments if allowed for all types but its revenue loss is very large in the short run accelerated depreciation can be designed to be neutral but it also has an uneven revenue loss pa ttern and cannot be applied to nondepreciable assets such as inventories benefit of lowering the statutory rate is that it reduces the incentive to shift profits abroad to tax vens although that incentive would probably be considerably lessened in any case if ferral of taxation of foreign source income were ended the ending of deferral might be c ontroversial provision and indeed some pressure has been exerted to move in th other direction toward territorial tax69 there are however some more limited approaches for example the presidents advisory panel proposed to exempt divide nds of active businesses but disallow costs such as interest to the extent income is exempt and as proposed in hr 3970 one could also defer interest ductions associated with ferred income without making any other changes or direct re strictive rules to tax havens interest deduction inflation correction if the inflation premium were disallowed for interest deductions assuming that about half of interest is inflation the savings would eventually be 30 billion per year at the corporate level which would be offset by about 10 billion loss at the individual level this could allow 25 pe rcentage point reduction in the corporate tax rate the important aspect of this change is that it would virtually eliminate the distortion between debt and equity which is responsible for significant portion of the overall distortion in the corporate tax while maintaining the overall corporate tax burden reducing tax at the firm level and increasing individual level taxes given the value of lowering the corporate tax rate to reduce the shifting of income into tax havens nd concerns over the us pos ition among other countries one change that would allow this reduction is to raise the tax at the individual level and use the revenues to lower the corporat tax rate since i ndividual taxes tend tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34229crs37 70 details of these proposals ar provided in crs report rl34115 reform of us international taxes alternatives by david l brumbaugh and jane g gravellebe collected regardless of where income is earned these taxes are neutral with respect to international allocation this approach also allows more scope for lowering corporate tax rates without creating sh eltering opportunities for high income individuals if the 2003 tax changes that lowered rates on divide nds and capital gains to 15 were rolled back the federal cor porate tax rate could be reduced to 3170 taxing capital gains at full rates as wa s enacted in 1986 and remained largely in place until 1997 would allow two or three more percentage points in reduction one could go even further by taxing corporate capital gains on an accrual basis which would yield dramatically more revenue this type of change would also eliminate distortions arising from payout policies nd realizations response even lower corporate rates could be achie ved by taxing nonprofits enoug h to offset their savings from the lower corporate rates change that would leave them unaffected but would simply shift the source of tax collection these latter proposals would arguably be broad enough to move much of the way towards an integration of the corporate and individual income taxes conclusion is there an urgent need to lower the corporate tax rate as some recent discussions and analyses have suggested on the whole many of the new concerns expressed about the tax appear not to st and up under empirical examination the claims that behavioral res ponses could cause revenues to rise if rates were cut does not hold up on both theoretical basis and an empirical basis studies that purport to show revenue maximiz ing tax rate of 30 cont ain econometric errors that produce biased and inconsistent results when those problems are corrected the results disappear crosscountry studies to provide direct evidence showing that the burden of the corporate tax actually falls on labor yield unreasonable results and prove to suffer from econometric flaws that also lead to disappearance of the results when corrected similarly claims that high us tax rates will create problems for the united states in global economy suffe r from misrepresentation of the us tax rate compared to other countries and are less important when capital is imperfectly mobile as it appears to be while these new arguments appear to re ly on questionable data the traditional concerns about the corporate tax appear valid while many ec onomists believe that the tax is still needed as backstop to individual tax collections it does result in some economic distortions these econo mic distortions however have declined substantially over time as corporate rates and shares of output have fallen there are number of revenueneutral changes that could reduce these distortions allow for lower corporate statutory tax rate and lead to more efficient corporate tax

statistical tests indicate that these problems exist with the data we obtained consequently we estimate the parameters of the model using the fixed effect estimation procedure allowing for an ar1 error structure75 identification neither brill and hassett nor clausing offer any justification in their studies for using ols rather than the fixed effects thod to estimate the pa rameters of their model wellknown drawback of the fixe d effects method is variables that vary across countries but not across time within country cannot be included in the estimation that is the parameters associated with these variables are not identifiedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34229crs42 76 michael p devereux developments in the taxation of corporate profit in the oecd since 1965 rates bases and revenues university of warwick working paper may 2006 p 20devereux 2006 claims changes in the st atutory corporate tax rate within country are comparatively rare in practi ce as found by clausing 2006 there is not enough variation within country to identify an effect of the stat utory rate conditional on country fixed effects76 to check the correctness of this statement and the justification for using ols we directly examine the variation of the corporate tax rate acr oss countries and over time table b1 displays the results for the data from the three studies we reanalyzed the first row displays the relevant explanator corporate tax rate variable used in the study the second row reports of mean of the variable the third row reports the standard deviation measur of variation of variable of the corporate tax rate variable the last two rows decompose the standard deviation into the between country component and the within country co mponent if there is variation in the variable over time within countries then the within component of the standard deviation will be zero consequently the effect of that variable on the dependent variable is not identified conditional on fixed effects t hat is it cannot be estimated using the fixed effects procedure as can be seen from the table there is almost as much variation within countries the with in component as ther is between countries the between component table b1 standard deviation of corporate tax rate variables in the three data sets brill and hassett dataclausing datahassett and mathur data variable corporate tax rate corporate

addition we find that all oecd countri changed their corporate tax rate at least once between 1979 and 2002 four c ountries ireland norway spain and switzerland changed their corporate ta x rate only once during this period in contrast luxembourg changed their cor porate rate 12 times over this period on average oecd countries changed their co rporate tax rates once every five years therefore we can find evidence to suppor t the argument that the effect of the corporate tax rate on corporate tax reve nues is not identified conditional on fixed effects httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34229crs43 appendix c modeling problems of the desai foley and hines study this appendix explains in further deta il the modeling problems associated with the desai foley and hines study hereaf ter dfh study which include the failure to recognize price variability this means that their crossequation restriction is not justified and that restriction is what gives rise to their results the dfh study also fails to correctly interpret their results gi ven that other sectors exist in the economy the dfh model effectively begins with an equation that forms basic part of any general equilibrium model namely that percentage change in price is weighted average of the percentage in costs for small changes in the case of an imposition of tax that is 1 pr w ατ α 1 where p is price r is rate of return w is the wage rate is the tax rate and is the τ α share of capital income the hat notation refers to percentage change except in the case of the tax variable where the hat means the change in tax rate divided by one minus the tax rate beginning with tax world that variable is simply this dτ relationship can be derived from profit maximization problem dfh derive such an equation to motivate their seemingly unrelated regression model they then assume that p the price of the good doe s not change which produces an equation of the form 2 01 ατ α rw since is an exogenous variable this equa tion indicates that the change in the tax τ would be shared by interest rates and wages and this is the basis for the two seemingly unrelated regressions where the dependent variables ar r and w and the coefficients are constrained so that the burden will add up to one the argument for keeping the price fixed is that such good would have its price fixed due to trade eg all commodities have to sell at the same price there are two difficulties with this assumption first if consumers in di fferent countries have different preferences for goods based in pa rt on country of origin ie they do not consider french wine and german wine to be perfect substitutes these prices will not be fixed indeed this phenomenon is widely recognized and the price responses are referred to as armington elasticities and they have been estimated empirically second their observations are the weighted average of firms in each country but the firms themselves produce heterogeneous pr oducts and all of these product prices cannot stay fixed b ecause they have different capital inte nsities and because the products will vary from one count ry to another indeed the trading of heterogeneous products means that fixed prices cannot be assumed because in such model countries could not produce consume and trade numerous products with differential taxation because such world economy woul d be characterized by corner solutions ie internal equilibriumhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34229crs44 this problem means that there is another variable price that is affecting the results and presumably is correlated with the error term that is the price would tend to be higher when the tax rate is higher making the regression suspect and that the coefficient restriction is not appropriate even if these problems did not exist there is an additional problem with the interpretation of their findings namely that they did not adjust for other sectors in the economy including nontraded sectors and s ectors not subject to the corporate tax incidence results must be adjusted for the fact that the tax is only partial one to illustrate in the simplest fashi on suppose the remaining sector of the economy is noncorporate nontraded sector of the economy whose price is denoted by capital p 3 pr w ββ 1 this commodity has taxes and if we estimate the effects on r and w those can be used to determine the change in p what we ultimately want to determine is the fraction of the tax rkcwheredτ kc is the capital in the corporate traded sect or that falls on labor that is what share of ldw where l is total labor in the economy is of rkc dτ to derive the real change in wages we want the change in nominal wage divided by the change in total price level in the economy or if the corporate sector is responsible for 1 of output in the economy the percentage change in real wage θ which we denote with capital w can be expressed as follows 4 ww p p 1θθ if s is the share of the burden falling on labor income from equation 1 and rs d 1 τwsd ατ α1 and by substitution of these values into 3 and in turn into 4 and allowing the initial price level to be normalized at 1 we obtain the equation for incidence in the economy noting that equals rkcwlc α α 1 5ldw l l s s s rk d cc θ βθ αβα τ 11 1 the first term total labor divided by labor in the tax sector reflects the increased burden from the spread of the nominal fall in wages to the other sector while the negative terms inside the next parenthesis reflects the rise in real wages due to the fall in the price of the untaxed sector whet her the burden rises or falls depends on variety of factors as the capital intensity of the untaxed sector rises the burden falls at the extreme when becomes 1 the firs t term collapses to 1 and the second term β is less than s so the total burden on labor is less in the economy than it is in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34229crs45 estimation this possibility is more importa nt than it might initially appear because one of the most important uses of capital not subject to the corporate income tax is in housing in the united states
