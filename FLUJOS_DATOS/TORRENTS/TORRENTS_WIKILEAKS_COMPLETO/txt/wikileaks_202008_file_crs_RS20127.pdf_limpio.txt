responding to the requirements of sections 489490 of the foreign assistance act of 1961 pl 87195 as amended president clinton certif ied on february 26 1999 that mexico had fully cooperated with the united states in drug control efforts in 1998 several members of congress criticized t he presidents decision in hearings by the senate caucus on international narcotics control the house committee on governmen t reformsubcommittee on criminal justice drug policy and human resources and the house international relations committeewestern hemisphere subcommittee i n accordance with congressional

1999 with an additional provision that would extend the period fo r congressiona l consideration by providing rule of construction that any action would be considered to have been enacted within the 30 day period following presidentia l certification arguments for passage of resolution of disapproval 1 mex icos performance does not demonstrate fully supportive efforts t contr ol drug trafficking despite president clintons certification of mexica n cooperation the state departments march 1999 intern ational narcotics control strategy report incsr and recent congressional testimony of thomas constantine adminis trator of the drug enforcement administration dea state that mexic continu to be major transit point for about 60 of the cocaine entering the unite d states from south america they so report that mexico is the source of 1429 of the heroin being used in the united states and major source of marijuana an d methamphetamine they state that mexican trafficking organizations have major role in the distribution of cocaine heroin and methamphetamine in the united states and are heavily involved in money laundering activities according to the 1999 incsr report mexican seizures of cocaine were down 35 in 1998 while seizures of opium were down 54 compared to 1997 although seizures of heroin marijuana and methamphetamine were up for last year total drug arrests i n 1998 were less than in 1997 and mexico had limit ed success against the major traffickers during much of the year mexican officials threatened to indict and seek the extradition of us customs and treasury agents who were involved in the antimoneylaunderin g undercover endeavor called operation casablanca on grounds that they were t adequately informed while mexican authorities determined that there were grounds for charges against the us agents mexican courts refused to extradite five banker s wanted in connection with the operation during the ear mexican officials obtained only one conviction under the new antimoneylaun dering laws in mexico despite an increase in opium poppy eradication the inscr report shows that there was an increase in th total area of poppy cultivated in mexico in 1998 and that there was decline in th amount of marijuana eradicated httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20127crs3 see john ward anderson and douglar farah mexico strains drug ally status washingto n2 post february 10 1999 p

generals office washington post february 20 1999 p a182 mexico has failed to take adeq uate action against corruption and major drug traff ickers over the years many allege that mexico has failed to adequatel prosecute highlevel officials charged with corruption and drug traf ficking crimes although some ma jor figures have been arrested while the amezcuacontreras brothers leaders of the colima cartel were arrested in 1998 the charges against them were dropped i n mexico and they are being held solely on us arrest warrants with extradition to th united states uncertain even with approval from the mexican foreign ministry despite numerous requests mexico has extradited very few mexicanborn t raffickers to the united states on drugrelated charges among the recent cases of alleged corruption and drug trafficking mentioned i n public sources are 1 mario villanueva th governor of the state of quintana roo who has been reported to be protecting th transit of drugs through the yucatan region for the juarez cartel although he denies the charges 2 defense minister general enriqu e2 cervantes who was reported to be in league with the tijuana cartel although th e3 mexican government has denounced this charge and the united states government s expressed confidence in him 3 miguel caroquintero the alleged head of the caro quintero cartel who is reported to operate openly without danger of prosecution in the town of caborca in sonora state 4 arrests of elite members of the antidrug specia l4 prosecutor for crimes against health feads office in february and october 1998 for ties to drug cartels and 5 the alleged c apture and release of drug lord humberto garcia5 abrego by the mexican attorney generals organized crime unit in october 1998 although the attorney generals office has strongly denied the allegation 6 3 passage of resolution of disapproval would send message an d encourage the mexican government to take more fo rceful actions the threat that mexico would not be fully certified seems to have encouraged mexican cooperation i n drug cont rol efforts analysts note in 1996 as the decision on certification approached mexico arrested and expelled drug lord juan garcia abrego to the united states and it agreed to create the bilateral high level contact group hlcg on narcotics control in 1997 as the certification decision approached mexico promised greater cooperation in extraditing drug lords shutting down moneylaundering operations and attackin g corruption in government in 1998 as certificati on approached the countries released the united statesmexico binational drug strategy although the strategy had been underway for some time in 1999 as certificatio n approached the countries agreed on performancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20127crs4 measures of effectiveness to gauge progress with the joint antidrug strategy mexic committed 400500 million to new high technologyoriented antidrug interdictio n program and mexico ended the investigation against us agents in operation casablanca given the seeming effectiveness of the threat of less than full certification it could b argued that congressional disapproval even if subsequently waived by the president could stimulate additional cooperation and greater determination to attack corruption arguments against passage of resolution of disapproval 1 passa ge would be seen as unilateral punitive and confrontationa l approach rather than bilateral cooperative approach to rela tions with mexico passage of resolution of disapproval could be seen as placing blame solely upon mexico for the flo w of drugs to the united states mexico and other producer and transi t countries point out that the drug traffic is fueled by the tremendous profits associated with the continuing demand from the united states if the united states could reduce th demand for drugs and eliminate the corruption associated with the distribution of drugs in the united states the flow from producer and transit countries would diminish the argue passage of resolution of disapproval could also be seen as belittling mexican efforts to control drug trafficking often with considerable loss of life by mexican w enforcement and military personnel since president zedillos inauguration in december 1994 there has been campaign to reform the judicial system and to create new antidrug agencies with specially screened agents legislation was enacted to criminalize mone laundering to establish controls on chemical diversion and to permit use of moder n investigative techniques electronic surveillance witness protection against organize d crime in l998 mexicans convicted and imp risoned several key traffickers and associates including former drug czar general jesus gutierrez rebollo and it extradited to th united states for the first time mexican citizen who was wanted on murder and dru g trafficking charges according to recent plans mexico will be devoting highe r percentage of its governmental budget to antidrug activities than the united states in terms of usmexico cooperation in the last three years mexico signed financial information exchange agreement and an asset sharing agreement i t significantly increased militarytomilitary cooperation accepted us counternarcotics assistance and extradited mexican citizens to the united states for the first time most importantly it held broad range of bilateral consultations under the rubric of the high level contact group hlcg on narcotics control leading to joint strategy fo r controlling drug trafficking and agreed upon performance measures of effectiveness s well as methods to coordinate law enforcement efforts passage of resolution f disapproval of mexico would be likely to put some of these joint efforts in jeopardy and damage the good will and cooperative arrangements established in midfebruary 199 9 when president clinton visited mexico 2 passage of resolution of disapproval might have negat ive us effects and might not work to encourage mexican coo peration on counternarcotics efforts since the waiver mechanisms in hjres 35 and hjres 43 would permit the president to avoid the impos ition of sanctions including the withholding of us foreign assistance and us support for multilateral development bank loans for mexico it is unlikely tha t us aid would be suspended in the event of decertification the amount of standar dhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20127crs5 foreign assistance is limited 149 million in fy1999 excluding counternarcotic s assistan ce and much of it is for programs the united states might wish to continue t support these include programs for health hivaids and tuberculosis prevention environmentally sound use of resources and strengthening of democratic institutions even if the president exercised the permitted waiver passage of resolution f disapproval would be seen by mexico as very negative antimexico action that would damage relations and potentially affect trade and investment between the countries mexico is the united state s third most important trading partner overall and since 1997 has been the second most important country in terms of us export s considering exports and imports the two countries had trade rnover of over 174 billion in 1998 so loss of trade would have negative consequences on both sides of the border given mexicos past history with the ited states and its determination to maintain sovereignty in domestic and foreign affairs it could not be assumed that mexico woul d comply with us wishes if resolution of disapproval were passed this history includes the loss of texas and the us southwest states in the 19th century the suspicions over us business domination that emerged in the mexican revolution of 1910 and led to the expropriation of us oil companies in the 1930s mexican diplomatic opposition to us policies toward cuba and central america from the 1960s to the 1980s and mexica n restrictions on us trade and investment until the 1980s mexico has taken steps to control drug trafficking and to enact political an d economic reforms because it finds these measures to be in its own self interest th positive steps in usmexican drug control efforts mentioned above took place during the salinas and zedillo years when the countries were cooperating on range of issues not when the united states was criticizing mexico some analysts argue that if mexico feels that the united states is being punitive it is likely to reduce cooperation with th united states in drug control areas with results that might be less satisfactory than th current efforts they add that decertification of mexico might even weaken presiden t zedillo politically and effectively strengthen the drug traffickers or those less interested in routing out drugrelated corruption 3 passage of resolution of disapproval may negatively affect other areas of cooperation since mexico and the united states cooperate on wide range of issues if mexico were to decide to reduce or end cooperation as result of passage of resolution of disa pproval this decision could have negative consequences in number of areas other than the drug control area in the economic reform and trade area mexico has reduced the size of it s government t hrough privatization and macroeconomic reforms and it has opened the economy to trade and investment through nafta and other measures th economic r eforms and the nafta agreement give the united states access to an important market and provide opportunities for in vestment and the sale of products to the government in the immigration area mexico has cooperated wi th the united states in number of ways acting through the binational commission working group meetings mexico has worked to curtail criminal trafficking in migrants and to ensure saf operation of border bridges and crossings the countries completed binationalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20127crs6 study on migration in november 1997 and agreed to establish cooperativ mechanisms against border violence in february 1999 with regard to border affairs the united states and mexico coo perate on numerous environmental and law enforcement issues among the most important are th following cooperation in the north american commission on environmenta l cooperat ion established in the environmental side agreement to nafta alon g with cooperation in t he two other institutions that focus particularly on the border region the border environmental cooperation commission becc whic h generates environmental projects and the north american development ban k nadban k which funds the projects the countries also cooperate on wate r issues through the international boundary and water commission ibwc and on environmental projects through the paz border xxi and border visio n programs in february 1999 t he countries agreed to cooperate on prevention and control of forest fires and tuberculosis cooperati on on labor rights issues through the north american commission fo r labor cooperation established in the labor side agreement to nafta cooperation on foreign policy issues such as 1 peaceful transitions in haiti and guatemala 2 resolution of the peruecuador conflict 3 implementation of the agendas of the miami and santiago summits of the americas 4 efforts t negotiate free trade area of the americas f taa and 5 assistance to central american countries after hurricane mitch without the cooperation of mexico in these and other areas there is serious limit to the efforts that the united states can pursue to advance these goals those opposing resolutions of disapproval argu that cooperation through dialogue and discussion rather than sanctions seems likely to produce greater results in relations with mexico and t send message throughout the hemisphere that the united states i s pursuing cooperative rather than punitive approach toward countries in the region
