from michael mann mannmultiproxyevscvirginiaedu to tim osborn tosbornueaacuk subject re comparison with our existing reconstructions date fri 16 mar 2001 142557 0500 est cc scott rutherford srutherfordvirginiaedu mike mann mannvirginiaedu dear tim scott on the road w tenous email connection so have to be brief this sounds good hoping we can have agebanded connections by the end of tnext week so i can show in nice scott can you rectify the comparisons that scott is producing w your own comparisons that show more of discpreapancy thanks mike fri 16 mar 2001 tim osborn wrote dear mike scott attached is traditionalps comparing the 14041855 ie preinstrumental regem reconstruction with our existing osborn et maps and briffa et quasihemispheric series see refs below neither the regem nor the existing reconstructions use the agebanded trees so low frequencies are suppressed scott thanks for the new agebanded results but i probably wont get to them till next week due to other commitments the time series comparisons are as you see quite good thought youd expect this as were comparing two methods but identical data red is regem black is from the osborn et existing reconstructions then averaged into quasihemispheric means while blue is from briffa et where we average the treedensity into regionshemisphere before calibrating against regionalhemispheric temperature blue black agree quite closely so all correlations and var explained are between red and black timeseries are 090 full spatial average over each of our existing maps 070 full spatial average over each of the regem maps masked indicates regem maps are masked by the timedependent coverage of our existing maps land2090 or land2070 indicates only land grid boxes north of 20n are averaged treeboxes indicates only those grid boxes that contain treering sites are averaged together the pattern correlations range from 02 to 08 with mean of 06 approx fairly consistent then the pattern of temporal correlations is reasonable ranging from 00 to 09 with mean of 06 approx comments 1 time series generally have less variance in regem especially early on though masking of data brings them closer to our time series 2 getting the mean level correct ive converted regem to behave like anomalies from 196190 mean helps with the variance explained considerably 3 the temporal correlations are poorer for boxes containing trees than those that do not the decreased variance early in the regem comment 1 is i guess because the fewer the records with data the earlier the truncationweighting function kicks in etc and therefore the less the variance that is reconstructed as the skill of regem decreases the more the values are filled in with something near to their mean i seem to recall this raises the question that the early values might be biased towards the observational mean if so it might be better to replace box values by missing values when their expected skill becomes fairly low comment 3 can be explained two ways in the nontree boxes our two methods regem and principal component regression have similarities and given the common input data one would expect similar reconstructions which the high correlations indicate in the tree boxes however the difference is our approach uses only local information while regem still uses nonlocal information too so either i our reconstructions are poorer because were ignoring nonlocal information or ii regem reconstructions are poorer because real local variations are partly masked by regionalscale variations it might be possible to choose either i or ii as preferred explanation using verification or other consideration but id prefer to stick with i and ii as being equally possible and therefore justifying both approaches this is politically better too what i get out of the comparison is that the regem is producing variability that is highly correlated with our method given the same input data the main concern is the difference in variance and hence absolute anomalies we should look at this again when ive compared the agebanded stuff too another long email but i hope that this is useful especially for egs and will form the basis of comparion of methods paper have good weekend tim briffa kr osborn tj schweingruber fh harris ic jones pd shiyatov sg and vaganov ea 2001 lowfrequency temperature variations from northern treeringdensity network journal of geophysical research 106 29292941 osborn tj briffa kr schweingruber fh and jones pd 2001 annuallyresolved patterns of summer temperatures over the northern hemisphere since ad 1400 from treeringdensity network in preparation _______________________________________________________________________ professor michael mann department of environmental sciences clark hall university of virginia charlottesville va 22903 _______________________________________________________________________ email mannvirginiaedu phone 804 9247770 fax 804 9822137 httpwwwevscvirginiaedufacultypeoplemannhtml
