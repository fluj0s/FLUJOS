due to the potentially significant amounts of lead they contain and the large numbers in which they are generated state concerns specific to the landfill disposal or incineration of ewaste are largely due to its increasing volume and of ten bulky nature zardous constituents such as lead and mercury it may contain its high cost of recycling and the inability of interested stakeholders such as elect ronics retailers and manufacturers to reach consensus on how to voluntarily implement national ewaste ma nagement system states have responded to this concern by enacting their own ewaste management laws requirements of those laws range from ban only on the landfill disposal or incineration of designated ewastes to the implementation of full ewaste collection transportation and recycling system to date 14 states have enacted some fo rm of ewaste management law as many as 20 states proposed ewaste laws in 2006 and 2007 although the goal of each law is similar to avoid landfill disposal and incineration of certain types of ewaste approaches taken to achieve that goal differ significantly however most state laws and proposals have certain broad elemen ts in common such as specifying the electronic devices covered under the law how collection and recycling program will be financed collection and recycling criteria that must be met to minimize the impact to human health and the

states have the option to implement requirements that are more stringent than those specified under rcra many states have opted to do so partic ularly with regard to the management of certain hazardous wastes generated by households households and certain small businesses are essentially exempt from rcra2 this means that under federa l law hazardous wastes ge nerated by those entities may be disposed of in municipal solid waste landfills or incinerators one category of household hazardous waste that many states are choosing to regula more strictly is electronic waste commonly referred to as ewaste there is universally accepted definition of ewaste but it generally refers to obsolete broken or irrepara ble electronic equipment such as televisions computers and computer monitors laptops printers cell phones vcrs dvd players copiers fax machines stereos and video gaming systems state and local agencies particularly municipal waste management agencies have become increasingly

enacted some form of legislation or regulations that will affect ewaste recycling and disposal practices as more states propose such legislation potentially regulated stakeholde rs particularly electronics manufacturers and retailers have expressed concern that they will be required to comply with patchwork of state requirement s throughout the united states in 2005 two congressional hearings were he ld to explore issues associated with ewaste and the congressional ewast working group was formed one goal common to both the hearings and the establishment of the working group was to explore potential national solutions to the ewaste management issue with increased legislative activity in the states it is anticipated that stakeholders will increase their call for federal legislation regarding ewaste management to illustrate the issues associated with individual state action this report discusses the key issues that have led to state action describes common elements in state waste laws and proposals and provides an overview of each enacted state law issues leading to state action the volume and bulky nature of ewaste the proliferation of and increasingly rapid technological advances in electronics means that the volume of ewaste generated in the united states is large and growing until recently data regarding electronic produc ts sold stored recycled disposed of and exported in the united states were limited in 2007 epa completed study that attempted to gather more data4 according to that study as of 2005 of electronic products sold in the united

million tons were discarded primarily in landfills although epa timates that ewaste comprises about 2 of the municipal solid waste stream it is anticipated that this percentage will grow as consumers continue to re place old and outdated electronic equipment and discard equipment in storage this will be the case particularly after the transition from analog to digital television broadcasts 5 and with the increased use of flatscreen televisions and computer monitors in addition to the bulky nature of elect ronic devices such as televisions and computers the increasing volume of ewaste concerns some states particularly state and municipal waste management agencies because these items have the potential to be reused or recycled some states have become increasingly interested in diverting such waste from municipal landfills hazardous components in ewaste the potential presence of various toxi c or hazardous components is another reason that ewaste is concern fo r example cathode ray tubes crts6 computer central processing units cpus and ot her electronic devices generally contain significant quantities of lead7 crts contain an average of four pounds of lead but may contain more

infused with lead to protect users from radiation emitted from the tube flame retardants are added to plastics to prevent the heated electronic vices from catching fire alt hough flat panel monitors are replacing crts those monitors often need mercury to operate efficiently the continued use of certain zardous substances makes the need for recycling options greater if the goal is to minimize the dis posal of those substances in landfill or incinerator the cost of recycling electronics there are various elements that contribute to the cost of state recycling program the recycling infrastructure itself includes the cost of collecting transporting and sorting the devices there is also cost associated with recycling the devices themselves recyclers and refurbishers often charge fee for their services because their costs outweigh the revenue received from recycled commodities eg glass metals or reus able components or from the sale of refurbished units although they will rec over certain amount of usable scrap from ewaste they will also likely incur expenses when they have to handle and dispose of any hazardous components also unlik household consumers recyclers will be regulated under rcra and are subject to the more stringent requirements applicable to hazardous waste storage transportation and disposal some stakeholders argue that one met hod of lowering the cost of processing electronics is to improve economies of scale through increased volume until recently the primary sources of electronic devices for recycling have beenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34147crs5

and shipping them to the manufact urer themselves or they must drop off their used electronics at often inconvenient locations also often for fee if the consumer does not pay for recycling any recycling fees would likely be absorbed by the state or local agency collecting the device most stakeholders agree that if ewaste is to be recycled it must be as easy for consumers to recycle electronics as it is to buy them14 many local and state agencies retailers and elect ronics manufacturers have wo rked with epa to sponsor pilot programs providing convenient free recycling services to consumers the success of those programs demonstrated how successful ewaste recycling programs can be if they are convenient and inexpensive15 however most states do not want to bear the full financial burden of establishing an ewaste management program one factor driving states to develop ewaste laws is to implement system that will provide financing for an ewaste collecti on transportation and recycling system the inability of stakeholders to agree on national system for several years interested stakeholders have debate d how to best address the ewaste management issue those stakeholders include electronics manufacturers and retailers local and stat governments particularly waste management and water treatment agencies recyclers environmental organizations and

system that impasse divided the group into two camps those who believed that collection and recycling program should be financed through consumerpaid advance recycling fee arf assessed at the pointofsale of designated electronic devices and those who advocated producer pays model wherein electronics manufactur ers either took back their own ewaste and recycled it or paid for system that

certain consumer products such as clothes washers or microwave ovens mechanism to fund the program in attempting to reach consensus among the various stakeholders determining who pays for ewaste collection and recycling programs has been the most contentious issue many potential methods exist for funding an ewaste collection and recycling program20 most current state programs fall into two broad categories consumerpaid system or produ cer or manufacturerpaid system21httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34147crs8 22 see the washington state department of ecology washington r ecycles electronics establishing return share list web page under 2009 return share information orphan list at httpwwwecywagovprogramsswfaeproductrecyclereturnsharehtmlunder any financing scheme it must be determined who will pay to manage orphan waste orphan waste is waste for which manufacturer can be identified or for which the manufacturer is longer in business given the high rate of turnover in the electronics business the large numbers of foreign manufacturers that may be difficult to track down and the large numbers of white box products electronic products put together by co mponent assemblers without brand name affixed to the device the proportion of orpha n waste is potentially substantial for example as part of its ewaste program washington state identified more than 1200 orphan brands of electronics potentially sold or likely to appear in the states ewaste stream22 the consumer pays model one method of financing an ewaste collection and recycling program require s consumers to pay an advanced recycling fee arf at the pointofsale of designated electronics proceeds from the arf would be used to implement the states ewaste collection infrastructure and recycling programs the collected funds may be managed by state commission or private thirdparty organization tpo suggested arfs are generally between 6 and 10 depending on the size of the device this amount is less than the cost of recycling individual ceds however because more products ar sold than enter the waste stream the cost of establishing recycling infrastructure may be paid for at less than the perunit recycling price portion of the funds may pay for local collection so that the government does not assume the cost of developing and running the recycling infrastructure also retailers collecting th fee may keep certain percentage of the fee to cover their administrative costs the arf approach has been adopted in california and is favored by certain electronics manufacturers suppor ters of this system argue in part that it would immediately and reliably create stainable source of funding for recycling infrastructure pay for recycling all returned products including orphan waste be simple and could be imp lemented efficiently and include fee that is transparent to consumers and may contribute to consumer awareness of the need to recycle stakeholders opposed to this approach argue in part that it would not be easily applied to internet sales presenting competitive disadvantage to retailers assessing the fee it would not provide manufacturers with an incentive to produce more environmentally benign produc ts or to design products that may be more easily recycled and if the collected funds exceeded recy cling costs those funds could be taken by the state and used for other purposes httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34147crs9 the producer pays model this approach requires manufacturers to implement or finance collection and recy cling program that ta kes responsibility for their share of returned ewaste and shar of orphan waste gen erally assessed based on the companys total market share in the state this is often referred to as an extended producer responsibility epr or producerpays approach some models allow the producer to address its share of waste by establishing its own recycling program or one in cooperation with other manufacturers or paying the state for the collection consolidation and r ecycling costs of its share to date all state ewaste programs except californias implement some version of the producerpays model stakeholders in favor of this appro ach include environmental organizations retailers and certain manufacturers that ve already established recycling programs for their products some of their argu ments to support this approach include the system places limited responsib ilities on retailers and consumers and avoids the creation of new taxes on consumers manufacturers implementing their own recycling programs have the flexibility to design their recycling program as they see fit and making manufacturers responsible for recycling their own products may make them more likely to sign products that are easier to recycle or that would ve fewer toxic components stakeholders opposed to this approach argue in part that the allocation of disposalrecycling costs to given manufacturer would likely require costly sorting to identify the appropriate manufacturer existing manufacturers would be respons ible for the cost of recycling orphan waste and the internalization of recycling costs may ultimately cost consumersmore than an arf once the recycling costs are subject to markup as the product moves through the distribution process another variation on the producerpay s model involves ma nufacturers paying flat fee to sell their products in that stat the collected fees are used to create grant program for local governments to implement an ewaste recycling program maryland is currently the only state with such program collection and r ecycling criteria state ewaste programs do not specify how ewaste must be collected that is they do not specifically require curbside pickup municipal drop off centers retailer collection or producerestab lished dropoff centers however each state program includes certain provisions regarding ewaste collection and recycling criteria that are intended to protect human health

discussion regarding the calif ornia and minnesota programs below in other cases implementation of an waste collection and recycling program is required before landfill ban takes effect see discussi on regarding the connecticut program below state specifically requires consumers to recycle therefore if landfill ban is in place the responsibility generally fa lls solely on the municipal government to collect ewaste and ensure that it is prope rly managed ie not sent to municipal landfill restrict ewaste exports according to the department of commerce much ewaste possibly 50 to 80 is sent overseas for recycling because it is more costly to recycle in the united states and most consumer electronics manufacturers who provide the market for materials r ecovered from recycled electronics have moved overseas23 also in states that ban the disposal of crts in landfills and incinerators within their borders ewaste can be recycled disposed of outside of the state or exported if recycling infrastructure is not present before disposal ban takes effect exporting ewaste may be the most likely choice even if there are recyclers present in given state recyclers manage significant percentage of the waste they receive by exporting it most often the exported ewaste is sent to nations such as china or developing countries of asia environmental organiza tions and certain other stakeholders are concerned that those countries do not enforce environmentally sound waste management practices or recycle in ma nner that would protect workers handling toxic materials24 these practices potentially expos vulnerable populations to toxic chemicals with few if any worker prot ections or framework to protect the local environment some states have responde d to these concerns by banning ewaste exports set recycling standards some state programs address potential environmental concerns by attempting to ensure that the law does not exchange one potentially harmful disposal method eg disposal in solid waste landfill for another eg recycling in manner that may harm employees or the environment they may do so by directing their state nvironmental protection agency to develop
