president and all civ il officers of the united states shall be removed from office on impeachment for and conviction of treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors usconst art ii 4 douglas inquiry rep gerald ford conduct of associate justice douglas what then is an impeachable offense the only honest answer is that an impeachable offense is whatever majority of the house of representatives considers to be at given moment in hist ory conviction results from whatever offense or offens twothirds of the other body considers to be sufficiently serious to require removal of the accused from office again the historical context and political climate are important there are few fixed principles among the handful of precedents i think it is fair to come to one conclusion however from our history of impeachments higher standard is expected of federal judges than of any other civil officers of the united states the president and vice president and ll persons holding offi ce at the pleasure of the president can be thrown out of office by the voters at least every 4 years to remove them in midtermit has been tried only twice and never donewould indeed require crimes of the magnitude of treason and bribery other elective officials such as membershttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98898crs2 of the congress are so vulnerable to public displeasure that their removal by the complicated impeachment route has not even been tried since 1798 but nine federal judges including one associate justice of the supreme court have been impeached by this house and tried by the nate four were ac quitted four convict ed and removed from office and one resigned during trial and the impeachment was dismissed in the most recent impeachment trial c onducted by the other body that of us judge halsted l ritter of the southern dist rict of florida who was removed in 1936 the point of judicial behavior was paramount since the cr iminal charges were admittedly thin in joint statement senators borah lafollette frazier and shipstead said we therefore did not in passing upon the fact s presented to us in the matter of the impeachment proceedings against judge halsted l ritter seek to satisfy ourselves as to whether technically crime or crimes had been committed or as to whether the acts charged and proved disclosed criminal intent or corrupt motive we sought only to ascertain from these facts whether he had c onducted himself in way that was calculated to undermine public confidence in the cour ts and to create sense of scandal there are great many things which one must readily admit would be wholly unbecoming wholly intolerable in the conduct of judge and yet these things might not amount to crime senator elbert thomas of utah citing th jeffersonian and col onial antecedents of the impeachment process bluntly declared tenure during good behavior is in sense guaranty of life job and misbehavior in the ordinary dictionary sense of the term will cause it to be cut short on the vote under special oath of twothirds of th senate if charges are first brought by the house of representatives to assume that good behavior means anything but good behavior would be to cast reflection upon the ability of the fathers to express themselves in understandable language 116 congrec 11912914 remarks of rep gerald ford 1970 special inquiry subcommittee both concepts would allow judge to be impeached for acts which occur in the exercise of judicial ffice that 1 involve criminal conduct in violation of law or 2 that involved serious dereliction from public duty but not necessar ily in violation of positive statutory law or forbidden by the comm on law sloth drunke nness on the bench or unwarranted and unreasonable impartiality sic manifest for prolonged period are examples of misconduct not necessarily criminal in nature that would support impeachment when such misbehavior occurs in c onnection with the federal office actual criminal conduct should not be requisite to impeachment of judge or any other federal official while such conduct need not be criminal it nonetheless must be sufficiently serious to be offenses against good mo rals and injurious to the social body both concepts would allow judge to be impeached for conduct not connected with the duties and responsibilities of the judici office which involve criminal acts in violation of law

inquiry staff report two points emerge from the 400 years of english parliamentary experience with the phrase high crimes and misdemeanors first the particular allegations of misconduct alleged da mage to the state in such forms as misapplication of funds abuse of official power neglect of duty encroachment on parliaments prerogatives corruption and betrayal of trust second the phrase high crimes and misdem eanors was confined to parliamentary impeachments it had roots in the ordi nary criminal law and the particular allegations of misconduct under that heading we re not necessarily limited to common law or statutory derelictions of crime in any event the interpretation of the g ood behavior clause adopted by the house has not been made clear in any of the judicial impeachment cases whichever view is taken the judicial impeachments have involved an assessment of the c onduct of the officer in terms of the constitutional duties of his office in this respect the impeachments of judges are consistent with the th ree impeachments of nonjudicial officers each of the thirteen american imp eachments involved charges of misconduct incompatible with the official position of the officeholder this c onduct falls into three broad categories 1 exceeding the constitu tional bounds of the powers of the office in derogation of the powers of another branch of government 2 behaving in manner grossly incompatible with the proper f unction and purpose of the office and 3 employing the power of the office for an improper purpose or for personal gain impeachment is constitutiona l remedy addressed to seri ous offenses against the system of government the purpose of impeachment under the constitution is indicated by the limited scope of the remedy removal from office and possible disqualification from future office and by the stated grounds for impeachment treason bribery and other high crimes and misdemeanors it is not controlling whether treason and bribery are criminal more important they are constitu tional wrongs that subvert the structure of government or undermine the in tegrity of office and even the constitution itself and thus are high offenses in the sense that word was used in english impeachments the framers of our constitution conscious ly adopted particular phrase from the english practice to help define the constituti onal grounds for removal the content of the phrase high crimes and misdemeanors for the framers is to be related to what the framers knew on the whole about the eng lish practice the broad sweep of english constitutional history and the v ital role impeachment had played in the limitation of royal prerogative and the control of abuses of ministerial and judicial power while it may be argued that some ar ticles of impeachment have charged conduct that constituted crime and thus that criminality is an essential ingredient or that some have charged conduct that was not criminal and thus that crimin ality is not essential the fact remains that in the english practice and in several of the american impeachments the criminality issue was not raised at all the emphasis has been on the significant effects of the conduct undermining the integrity of the office disr egard of constitutional duties and oath of office arrogation of power buse of the governmental process adverse impact on the system of government clearly these effects can be brought about in ways not anticipated by the criminal law criminal standards and criminal courts were established to control individual conduct impeachment was evolve d by parliament to cope with both the inadequacy of criminal standards and the impotence of courts to deal with the conduct of great public figures it would be anomalous if the framers having barred criminal sanctions from the impeachme nt remedy and limited it to removal andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98898crs4 possible disqualification from office intende d to restrict the grounds for impeachment to conduct that was criminal it is useful to note three major presidential duties of broad scope that are explicitly recited in the constitution to take care that the laws be faithfully executed to faithfully execute the office of president of the united states and to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states to the best of his ability the first is directly imposed by the constitution th second and third are included in the constitutionally prescribed oath that the presid ent is required to take before he enters upon the execution of his office and are therefore also expressly imposed by the constitution not all presidential misconduct is suffici ent to constitute grounds for impeachment there is further requirementsubstantiality in deciding whether this further requirement has been met the facts must be considered as whole in the context of the office not in terms of separate or isolated events because impeachment of president is grave step for the nation it is to be predicated only on conduct seriously incompatible with either the constitutional form and prin ciples of our government or the proper performance of constitutional duties of the presidential office impeachment inquiry staff report constitutional grounds for presidential impeachment house comm on the judiciary 93d cong 2d sess 7 178 267 1974 attorneys for president nixon the english impeachment precedents clearly demonstrate the criminal nature and origin of the impeachment process the fr amers adopted the general criminal meaning and language of those impeachments while rejecting the 17th century aberration where impeachment was used as weapon by parlia ment to gain political supremacy at the expense of the rule of law in light of legislative and judicial usage american case law and established rules of cons titutional and statutory constr uction the term other high crimes and misdemeanors means great crimes against the state finally review of american impeachment precedents shows that while judges may be impeached for something less than indictable offenses even here the standard is less than conclusive all the evidence points to the fact that the president may not he may be impeached only for indictable crimes clearly set forth in the constitution this is the lesson of history logic and experience this is th meaning of treason bribery and other high crimes and misdemeanors any analysis that broadly construes the power to impeach and convict can be reached only by reading constitutional authorities selectively by lifting specific historical precedents out of their precise historical context by disregarding the plain meaning and accepted definition of technical legal terms in short by placing subjective gloss on the history of impeachment that results in permitting the congress to do whatever it deems most politic the intent of the framers who witnessed episode after episode of outrageous abuse of the impeachment power by the selfrighteous english parliament was to restrict the political reach of the impeachment power those who seek to broaden the impeachment power invite the use of power as means of crushing political adversaries or ejecting them from office 1 tocqueville democracy in america 11115 p bradley ed 1945 the acceptance of such an invitation would be destructive to our system of government and to the fundamental principle of sepa ration of powers inherent in the very structure of the constitution the framers never intended that the impeachment clause serve to dominate or destroy the executive branch of government in their wisdom they provided adequate and proper methods for change the misuse of the impeachment clause was not one ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98898crs5 them an analysis of the
