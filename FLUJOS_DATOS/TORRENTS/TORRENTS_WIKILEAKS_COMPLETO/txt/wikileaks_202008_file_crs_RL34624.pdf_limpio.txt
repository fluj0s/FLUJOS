programs legal and constitutional developments august 19 2008 david h carpenter legislative attorney american law divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34624governmental drug testing programs legal and constitutional developments summary constitutional law on the subject of g overnmentally mandated drug testing is primarily an outgrowth of the four th amendment prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures judicial exceptions to traditional requireme nts of warrant and individualized suspicion for administrative searches have been extended to random drug testing of public employees and school students where the government is able to demonstrate special need beyond the demands of ordinary law enforcement in the public employment setting however special needs analysis has largely been confined to relatively narrow circumstances directly implicating compelling public safety law enforcement or national security interests of the government more generalized governmental concerns for the integrity or efficient operation of the public workplace have usually not been deem ed sufficient to justify interference with the reasonable expectation of privacy of wo rkers or other individuals to be tested additionally warrantless suspicionless drug testing programs that serve primarily criminal law enforcement purpose are likely to be unconstitutional the constitutional parameters of special needs analysis is outlined in series of supreme court rulings in skinner v railway labor executives association the us supreme court upheld postaccident drug and alcohol testing of railway employees after major train accidents or incidents and it approved the testing of us customs employees seeking promotion to cer tain sensitive jobs involving firearms use drug interdiction duties or access to classified information in national treasury employees union v von raab these decisions established that compelling governmental interests in public safety or national security may in appropriate circumstances override constitutional objections to testing procedures by employees whose privacy expectations are diminished by the nature of their duties or workplace scrutiny to which they are otherwise subject in veronia school district v acton the supreme court first approved of random dr ug testing procedures for high school student athletes holding that was subsequently extended in board of education of independent school district 92 of pottawatomie county v earls to permit random drug testing of students participa ting in nonathletic ex tracurricular activities however the court placed limitations on th special needs doctrine when in chandler v miller it voided georgia law requiring drug testing of candidates for state office for lack of governmental need

governmental drug testing programs legal and constitutional developments introduction one outgrowth of the nations war on drugs has been proliferation of governmental initiatives at the federal state and local levels to detect and deter illegal drug use in the workplace the sc hools and by r ecipients of public benefits since the late 1980s the federal governme nt has conducted r andom drug tests of executive branch employees in sensitive job positions and has implemented similar procedures for public and private employees in transportation and other safety or securityrelated industries aiding these efforts are state and local governmental testing programs for police officers firefighters prison guards teachers and other personnel with public safety responsibil ities bey ond employment states and localities have required other individuals to submit to drug testing such as students in public schools constitutional challenges to suspici onless or random governmental drug testing most often focus on issues of personal privacy and fourth amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures generally speaking the government is required by the fourth amendment to obtain warrants based on probable cause in order to effectuate constitutional searches and seizures an exception to ordinary warrant requirements has gradually evolved however for cases where special need of the government not related to criminal law enforcement is found by the courts to outweigh any d iminished expectation of privacy invaded by search in 1989 the us supreme court upheld postaccident drug and alcohol testing of railway employees after major train accidents or incidents in skinner v railway labor executives association 1 and of us customs employees seeking promotion to certain sensitive jobs i nvolving firearms use drug interdiction duties or access to classified information in national treasury employees union v von raab 2 these rulings make clear that compelling governmental intere

abridge the fourth amendmentprocess clause of the fourteenth amendment11 thus while private actors are not directly affected the actions of governme nt as an employer are subject to fourth amendment scrutiny12 governmental conduct will ge nerally be found to constitute search for fourth amendment purposes where it infringes an expectation of privacy that society is prepar ed to consider reasonable13 if search or seizure has occurred the court must then determin whether the governments action was reasonable under the circumstances what court determines to be reasona ble depends on the nature of the search and its underlying governmental purpose probable cause supported by warrant is the usual constitutional prerequisite for criminal search14 even in circumstances where warrantless searches are permitted they ordinarily must be based on probable cause to believe that violation of the law has occurred15 nevertheless the supreme court has determined that neither warrant nor probable cause is invariably required and has under certain circumstances approved of or let stand suspicionless searches ch as sobriety checkpoints16 border searches17 and metal detector screening18 the fourth amendment protects against both civil and criminal investigatory processes though the need for protection against government intrusion decreases if the investigation is entirely unrelated to criminal law enforcement19 in such circumstances rule less restrictive on the government based on reasonable suspicion of civil or regulatory law violation has become the constitutional norm however an exception from even this less demanding standard has been recognized for administrative searches by the gove rnment to enforce compliance with regulatory scheme by persons engaged in highly regulated industry on the theory that the very existence of the regulatory program diminishes reasonable expectationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34624crs4 20 donovan v dewey 452 us 594 600 1981 21 reasonable suspicion is lesser standard than probable cause there is reasonable suspicion when there is some articulable ba sis for suspecting that the employee is using illegal drugs put another way there is reasonable suspicion when there is some quantum of individualized suspicion as opposed to an inarticulate hunch reasonable suspicion may be based on statements made by other employees and

the court this special needs approach appears to confer optimal power on the government to search where compelling reason exists and correspondingly less protection to the individuals diminished expectation of privacy even prior to skinner and von raab there was virtual unanimity among the federal courts that governmental drug testing constituted search that could constitutionally be ju stified on reasonable suspicion grounds21 there is less consensus however as to the constitutional propriety of mandatory testing in other circumstances and par ticularly where random testing is imposed as deterrent to illegal drug use by public employees or for some other governmental objective unrelated to criminal law enforcement alt hough not random testing cases the special needs analysis of skinner and von raab was subsequently applied by the lower federal courts to justify suspicionless random testing provided that the requisite nexus between an employees duties and public safety or other compelling governmental need was demonstrated workplace drug testing and the us supreme court as noted the us supreme court has ru led on fourth amendment issues raised by workplace drug testing pro cedures on severa l occasions skinner v railway labor executives association22 upheld postaccident drug and alcohol testing of railway employees involved in major train accidents and incidents while program of onetime testing of us customs employees who apply for promotion to sensitive jobs involving ca rriage of firearms and drug interdiction duties was approved in national

drug testing of candidates for state office because special need substantial enough to warrant suspicionless searches was shown random testing pro cedures applied to student athletes and participants in extracurricular public school activities have also been approved by the court each of these cases is discussed indepth below in skinner panel of the ninth circuit had voided on fourth amendment grounds federal railroad admin istration fra regulati ons requiring breath blood and urine tests of railr oad workers who are involved in train accidents25 the supreme court ruled that the entire testin g regulation even portions applicable to certain employee rule infractions that were merely permissive rather than mandatory upon the railroads carried sufficient govern ment encouragement endorsement and participation to implicate the fourth amendment26 on the merits the majority held that because the collection and sting of urine intrudes upon expectations of privacy that society has long recognized as reasonable fra testing for drugs and alcohol was search that had to satisfy constitutional standards of reasonableness27 the special needs of railroad safety however made traditional fourth amendment requirements of warrant and probable cau impracticable in this context28 nor was individualized suspicion deemed by the majority to be constitutional floor where the intrusion on privacy interests are minimal and an important governmental interest is at stake29 according to the court covered rail employees had expectations of privacy as to their own physical condition that were diminished by reasons of their participa tion in an industry that is regulated pervasively to ensure safety30 in these circumstances the majority held it was reasonable to conduct the tests even in the absence of warrant or reasonable suspicion that any employee may be impaired31 the court also rejected another line of attack against the challenged tests which proceeds from the generally accepted scientific and judicial view that standard test protocols are capable indicators only of prior drug use but are not measure of current job impairment or drug influence because of this fact number of lower federal courts had voided cer tain drug tests for not being reasonably related to legitimate governmental interests in assuring employee fitness or competence32

ation provided by the tests to be valid investigative tool which may allow the fra to reach an informed judgment as to how particular accident occurred33 in addition the government may take all necessary and reasonable regulatory steps to prevent and deter forbidden drug use by the covered employees34 in the von raab case handed down on the same day as skinner the supreme court upheld drug testing of us custom s service personnel who sought transfer to certain sensitive positions namely thos involving drug interdiction carrying firearms or access to classi fied information without requirement of reasonable individualized suspicion the testing pro cedure was administered once the employee sought transfer to the sensitive positi on upon five days notice by the customs service thus the drug test in von raab was conditioned on the employees own action in seeking transfer and adverse consequence flowed from later withdrawn transfer application35 according to the court the governments compelling interests in preventing the promotion of drug users to positions where they might endanger the integrity of our nations borders or the life of the citizenry outweigh the privacy interests of those who seek promotions to those positions who enjoy diminished expectation of privacy by virtue of the special physical and ethical demands of those positions36 neither the absence of any perceived drug problem among customs employees nor the possibility that drug users can avoid detection with ease by temporary abstinence would defeat the program because the possible harm against which the government seeks to guard is substantial and the need to prevent its occurrence furnishes an ample justification for reas onable searches calculated to advance the governments goal37 the courts rulings in skinner and von raab established several constitutional standards potentially re levant to the random testing issu first reasonable suspicion was not constitutional threshold for all g overnmental drug testing and therefore may not preclude carefully crafted random testing in the public sector equally important the balancing test in those cas based on the special needs of the government for assuring tran sportation safety and the in tegrity of the federal drug interdiction effort may as readily be transposed to other regulatory environments where public employees or perhaps app licants for other governmental benefits may enjoy diminished expectation of pr ivacy third as noted above the court rejected earlier decisions that had faulte d drug testing methodologies due to their inability to detect present drug impairment as opposed to simple past drug usehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34624crs7 38 chandler v miller 520 us 305 1997 39 id at 31819 40 id at 319 41 id at

for suspecting drug usebeyond detection it appears the government may have legitimate interest in deterring employee drug use and that drug test evidence may be relevant to compelling governmental concerns conversely the court in chandler v m iller38 disapproved 1990 georgia statute requiring candidates for governor lieutenant governor attorney general the state judiciary and legislature and certain other elective offices to file certification that they have tested negatively for illegal drug use the majority opinion noted several factors distinguishi ng the georgia law from drug testing requirements upheld in earlier cases first there was fear or suspicion of generalized illicit drug usage by state elect ed officials in the laws background that might pose concrete dang er demanding departure fro m the fourth amendments main rule39 the court noted that while not an invariable constitutional prerequisite evidence of historical drug abuse by th group targeted for testing might shore up an assertion of special need for suspicionless general search program40 secondly the law did not serve as credible means to detect or deter drug abuse by public officials since the timing of the test was largely controlled by the candidate rather than the state legal compliance could be achieved by mere temporary abstinence41 final telling difference between the georgia case and earlier rulings stemmed from the relentless scrutiny to which candidates for public office are subjected as compared to persons working in less expos ed work environments any drug abuse by public officials is far more likely to be detected in the ordinary course of events making suspicionless testing less necessary than in the case of safetysensitive positions beyond the public view42 employee drug testing after skinner and von raab federal courts in the wake of skinner and von raab have generally approved random or other periodic testing of public em ployees or workers in heavily regulated industries provided that the specific jobs covered are directly related to compe lling public safety national security or drug interdiction functi ons of the government and testing is undertaken pursuant to plan that avoids arbitrary application43 generalized desire for workplace integrity absent heightened governmental interest has usually been found insuffici ent to warrant random or other routine testing of governmental employees in the absence of individualized suspicion httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34624crs8 44 harmon v thornburgh 878 f2d 484 dc cir 1989 45 connelly v newman 753 f supp 293 297 nd cal

postaccident testing of office of personnel management employees who drive motor vehicles45 us coast guard drug testing regulations requiring random screening of all private employees aboard commercial vessels46 and postaccident testing of any teacher aide or clerical workers injured on the job47 what emerges is pattern of casebycase judicial decisionmaking as to the reasonableness of testing in the circ umstances presented consequently broad based testing programs that fail to account for distinctions among employees in terms of the public safety or national security sensitivity of their duties are less likely to pass constitutional scrutiny national security courts have upheld random testing programs that were designed to protect sensitive information in the justice department case harmon v thornburgh 48 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia ruled that protection of sensitive information one of the gove rnmental interests cited in von raab justified the departments need to test employees with top secret clearances but not all federal employees involved in grand jury pr oceedings the court elaborated whatever truly sensitive information in cludes we agree that it encompasses top secret national security informa tionwe do not believe however that the governments interest in preserving all its secrets can justify the testing of all federal prosecutors or of all employees with access to grand jury proceedings we recognize that every employee within the three categories will have access to information which he is dutybound not to

house employees50 in unanimous decision the appellate panel found that the employees ri ghts to be free from random drug testing was outweighed not only by the governments need to protect the president but also by the governments need to assure the public that it is protecting the president the public interest the government is seekin g to protect is undoubtedly of the utmost importance few events debilitate the nation more than the assassination of the president51 the court noted the link between th risk posed by drugusing oeob permanent passholder and the potential harm to the president or the vice president was direct and immediate52 it likened the situation to that of an employee with access to topsecret information where si ngle incident could be disastrous to highlight this direct connection the opinion observes it is possible that drugusing oeob passholder could be blackmailed into using his access to the building to assist in an attack on the president given the importance of protecting the presidents safe ty this is all that is required to make this particular search reasonable it therefore does not violate the fourth amendment53 public safety the governments compelling interest in public safety may also justify suspicionless random testin g in certain circumstan ces for example after von raab the customs service drug testing program was expanded from frontline drug interdiction personnel to c over random testing of employees in traditional office environments who had access to database s targeting contraband shipments and inspections

uding that there is requirement of individualized suspicion when testing empl oyees whose duties are fraught with risks of injury to others67 the seventh circuit in taylor v ogrady68 held that the

access to firearms to submit to annual drug testing without advanced warning as to the specific timing of the testing the program was unconstitutional as applied to other personne l since those officers with only administrative or clerical duties or otherwise lacking contact with the jail population do not threaten claimed dangers if impaired while on duty and since the record does not show they are able to sm uggle drugs to the prisoners the department gains nothing by testing them69 random or other periodic sting of police and other public safety officers also has been approve d by

contexts may be rendered entirely reasonable by the operational realities of the workpl ace72 valid and compelling public interests mu st be weighed against the interference with individual liberty this meant that mandatory testing had to be limited to sensitive positions and hedged with procedural safeguards such as giving notice to individuals that they may be randomly tested in this case however evidence was presented to show which positions are considered safety sensitive and which are not or whether the policy at the elementary school would differ from that at high school nor was any evidence presented to show whether employees in safetysensitive positions had notice that they would be subject to random drug testing or what kind of notice they received or even if the custodian had received notice73 preemployment drug testing based on the rationale that applicants for employment do not have the same expectations of privacy as current empl oyees the courts have often permitted preemployment testing as cond ition of public employment the von raab case itself presented preemployment issues in that the testing there was required as part of the application process for drug enfo rcement duty federa l appellate decisions since have generally appr oved preemployment and proba tionary testing rules for public employees or workers in federally re gulated industries pecially for safety sensitive positions74 however lower courts often have re jected more broadlybased applicant screening programs for example federal district court in georgia association

all applicants for state jobs in the state of georgia because it defied the special needs approach of skinner and von raab stating the court finds it difficult to even begin applying that balancing test however because defendants have failed to specific ally identify any governmental interest that is sufficiently comp elling to justify testing all job applicants moreover defendants remain oblivious to von raabs and indeed the fourth amendments sic requirement that it connect its interest in testing to the particular job duties of the applicants it wishes to test instead defendants attempt to justify their comprehensive drug testing program based on generalized governmental interest in maintaining drugfree wo rkplace defendants position is untenable because neither von raab nor its progeny recognize such generalized interest as sufficiently compelling to outweigh an individuals fourth amendment rights76 student drug testing in the public schools courts have interpreted the fourth ame ndment as providing more leeway to test students for drugs in the school setting as compared to testing adults in the public employment context in veronia school district 47j v acton 77 the high court first considered the constitutionality of student drug testing in the public schools at issue there was school district program for ra ndom drug testing of high school student athletes which had been implemented in response to perceived increase in student drug activity all student athletes and thei r parents had to sign forms consenting to testing which occurred at the seasons beginning and randomly thereafter on weekly basis for the seasons duration st udents who tested positive were given the option of either participating in drug assistance program or being suspended from athletics for the current and following season78 6 to 3 majority of the court upheld the program against fourth amendment challenge central to the majoritys rationale was the custodial and tutelary relationship that is created when children are committed to the temporary custody of the state as school master in eff ect permitting degree of supervision and control that could not be exercised over free adults79 students had diminished expectations of privacy by virtue of rou tinely required medical examinations factor compounded in the case of student athlet by insurance requirements minimum academic standards and the communal undress nd general lack of privacy in the sports locker rooms because school sports are not for the bash ful student athletes were found to have lower expecta tion of privacy than other students80httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34624crs14 81 id at 658 82 id at 662 83 id at 66263 84 id at 66465 85 133 f3d 984 7th cir1998 86 172 f3d 574 8th cir 1999 87 963 p2d 1095 colo 1998balanced against this diminished privacy interest was the nature of the intrusion and importance of the governmental interest at stake first th school district had mitigated actual intrusion by implementing urine collection procedures that simulated conditions nearly identical to those typi cally encountered in public restrooms by analyzing the urine sample only for presence of illegal drugs not for other medical information such as the prev alence of disease or pregnancy and by insuring that positive test results were not provided to law enforcement officials81 school officials unquestionably had an inte rest in deterring student drug use as part of their special responsibility of care and direction toward students82 that interest was magnified in veronia by judicial findings that prior to implementation of the program large segment of the student body particular ly those involved in interscholastic athletics was in state of rebellion fueled by drug and alcohol abuse83 consequently the court approved the school districts drug testing policy reasoning that the fourth amendment only requires that government officials adopt reasonable policies not the least intrusive ones available the majority in veronia however cautioned against the assumption that suspicionless drugtesting will readily pass muster in other constitutional contexts84 division of opinion soon emerged among the lower courts as to how broadly veronia could be applied to permit suspicionless drug testing that included student groups beyond athletes and in cases where there was evidence of systemic drug problem among the student body for exampl the seventh and eighth circuits in nearly identical cases todd v rush county schools85 and miller v wilkes 86 respectively upheld random drug testing po licies that applied not only to student athletes but also to students participating in any other extracurricular activity without an identifiable drug problem among the affected student populations in either case parting company with the todd line of decisions was trinadad school district 1 v lopez 87 where the colorado supreme cour t disapproved of policy for drug testing all students in extracurricular activities where there was convincing evidence of higher drug usage rates by students participating in extracurricular activities or that the reasonable privacy expectations of such students had been so diminished by constraints of the sports culture or otherwise as those imposed on student athletes in veronia this conflict among the circuits was ultimately settled by the supreme court in 2002 d ecision board of education of indepe ndent school district 92 ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34624crs15 88 536 us 522 2002 89 id at 83031 90

and tutor the majority reas oned the state has responsibility for the discipline health and safe ty of students whose privacy interests are correspondingly limited and subject to greater control than those for adults89 moreover students who participate in extracurricular activities have limited expectation of privacy as they participate in the activities and clubs on voluntary basis subject themselves to other intrusions of privacy and m eet official rules for participation90 the fact that student athletes in the veronia case were regularly subjected to physical exams and communal undress was not deem ed essential to the outcome there instead that decision depended primarily upon the schools custodial responsibility and authority which was equa lly applicable to athle tic and nonathle tic activities91 the testing procedure itself involving collection of urine samples chain of custody and confidentiality of results was found to be minimally intrusive and virtually identical to that approved by the court in veronia in particular the opinion notes test results were kept in parate confidential files only available to school employees with need to know were not disclosed to law enforcement authorities and carried disciplinary or academic consequen ces other than limiting extracurricular participation given the minimally intrusive nature of the sample collection and the limited uses to which the test results are put we conclude that the invasion of students privacy is not significant92 the majority concluded that neither individualized suspicion nor demonstrated problem of dr ug abuse were necessary pr edicates for student drug testing program and there is threshold vel of drug use that need be satisfied93 finally we find that testing students who participate

preventing deterring and detecting drug use94 suspicionless drug testing in other regulatory contexts while the focus of judicial scrutiny has largely remained fixed on workplace and public school drug testing ques tions have also arisen in regard to testing in other administrative venues growing body of case law has developed from the efforts of lower federal and state courts to apply the special needs approach to an expanding array of governmental programs and regulatory activities the third circuit for example anticipated skinner and von raab when it upheld mandatory testing of horse racing jockeys officials and trainers in shoemaker v handel 95 decision which has since been extended to other participants in that heavily regulated industry96 in another regulatory context the illinois supreme court in fink v ryan97 upheld that states implied consent stat ute under the special needs exception to the fourth amendment and its state c onstitutional counterpart the illinois law authorizes chemical testing for drugs or alcohol of drivers who are arrested and issued traffic citation for any accident causing serious injury or death individualized suspicion was required because the states special need to suspend and deter chemically impaired drivers went beyond normal law enforcement moreover drivers expectation of privacy was diminished by the highly regulated character of automobile usage upon state highways and because state law imposes separate duty on drivers in such circumstances to remain at the scene to assist injured parties and law enforcement officials98 on the other hand the court has struck down drug testing po licies that primarily serve criminal law enforcement purposes in ferguson v city of charleston 99 the supreme court invalidated drug testin g

prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures judicial exceptions to traditional requirements of warrant and individualized suspicion for administrative searches have been extended to random drug testing of public employees and school students where the government is able to demonstrate special need beyond the demands of ordinary law enforcementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34624crs20 in the public employment setting however special needs analysis has largely been confined to relatively narrow circumstan ces directly implicating compelling public safety law enforcement or national security interests of the government more generalized governmental concerns for the integrity or efficient operation of the public workplace have usually not been deem ed sufficient to justify interference with the reasonable expectation of privacy of wo rkers or other individuals to be tested additionally warrantless suspicionless drug testing programs that serve primarily criminal law enforcement purpose are likely to be unconstitutional the constitutional parameters of special needs analysis is outlined in series of supreme court rulings in skinner v railway labor executives association the us supreme court upheld postaccident drug and alcohol testing of railway employees after major train accidents or incidents and it approved the testing of us customs employees seeking promotion to cer tain sensitive jobs involving firearms use drug interdiction duties or access to classified information in national treasury employees union v von raab these decisions established that compelling governmental interests in public safety or national security may in appropriate circumstances override constitutional objections to testing procedures by employees whose privacy expectations are diminished by the nature of their duties or workplace scrutiny to which they are otherwise subject in veronia school district v acton the supreme court first approved of random dr ug testing procedures for high school student athletes holding that was subsequently extended in board of education of independent school district 92 of pottawatomie county v earls to permit random drug testing of students participa ting in nonathletic ex tracurricular activities however the court placed limitations on th special needs doctrine when in chandler v miller it voided georgia law requiring drug testing of candidates for state office for lack of government need substantial enough to warrant suspicionless searches additionally the court generally has struck down drug testing policies that primarily serve criminal law enforcement purposes such as in ferguson v city of charleston
