of you who dont wish to receive these correspondances indeed i have provided david halpern with written set of comments on the offending papers for internal use so that he was armed w specifics as he confronts the issue within ostp he may have gotten additional comments from other individuals as wellim not sure i believe that the matter is in good hands with dave but we have to wait and see what happens in any case id be happy to provide my comments to anyone who is interested i think that response to climate research is not good idea phil and i discussed this and agreed that it would be largely unread and would tend to legitimize paper which many of us dont view as having passed peer review in legitimate manner on the other hand the in prep review articles by jones and mann rev geophys and bradleyhughesdiaz science should go along way towards clarification of the issues and at least tangentially refutation of the worst of the claims of baliunas and co both should be good resources for the far as well cheers mike ps note the corrections to some of the emails in the original distribution list at 0927 am 42403 0600 mark eakin wrote at this point the question is what to do about the soon and baliunas paper would bradley mann hughes et be willing to develop and appropriate rebuttal if so the question at hand is where it would be best to direct such response some options are 1 rebuttal in climate research 2 rebuttal article in journal of higher reputation 3 letter to ostp the first is good approach as it keeps the argument to the level of the current publication the second would be appropriate if the soon and baliunas paper were gaining attention at more general level but it is not therefore rebuttal someplace like science or nature would probably do the opposite of what is desired here by raising the attention to the paper the best way to take care of getting better science out in widely read journal is the piece that bradley et are preparing for nature this leaves the idea of rebuttal in climate research as the best published approach letter to ostp is probably in order here since the white house has shown interest in this paper ostp really does need to receive measured critical discussion of flaws in soon and baliunas methods i agree with tom that noted group from the detection and attribution effort such as mann crowley briffa bradley jones and hughes should spearhead such letter many others of us could sign on in support this would provide dave halpern with the ammunition he needs to provide the white house with the needed documentation that hopefully will dismiss this paper for the slipshod work that it is such letter could be developed in parallel with rebuttal article i have not received all of the earlier emails so my apologies if i am rehashing parts of the discussion that might have taken place elsewhere cheers mark michael mann wrote dear tom et thanks for commentsi see weve built up an impressive distribution list here this seemed like an appropriate point for to chime in here by in large i agree w toms comments and those of barries as well number of us have written reviews and overviews of this topic during the past couple years there has been lot of significant scientific process in this area both with regard to empirical climate reconstruction and in the area of modeldata comparison including in fact detection studies along the lines of what barrie pittock asked about in previous email see eg tom crowleys science article from 2000 phil jones and i are in the process of writing review article for reviews of geophysics which will among other things dispel the most severe of the myths that some of these folks are perpetuating regarding past climate change in past centuries my understanding is that ray bradley malcolm hughes and henry diaz are working independently on solicited piece for science on the medieval warm period many have simply dismissed the baliunas et pieces because from scientific point of view they are awfulthat is certainly true for example neville has pointed out in previous email that the standard they applied for finding medieval warm period was that particular proxy record exhibit 50 year interval during the period ad 8001300 that was anomalously warm wet or dry relative to the 20th century many of the proxy records dont really even resolve the late 20th century could be used to define an mwp anywhere one might like to find one this was the basis for their press release arguing for mwp that was warmer than the 20th century nonsequitur even from their awful paper and for their bashing of ipcc and scientists who contributed to ipcc which i understand has been particularly viscious and ad hominem inside closed rooms in washington dc where their words dont make it into the public record this might all seem laughable it werent the case that theyve gotten the bush white house office of science technology taking it as serious matter fortunately dave halpern is in charge of this project and he is likely to handle this appropriately but without some external pressure so while our careful efforts to debunk the myths perpetuated by these folks may be useful in the far they will be of limited use in fighting the disinformation campaign that is already underway in washington dc here i tend to concur at least in sprit w jim salinger that other approaches may be necessary i would emphasize that there are indeed as tom notes some unique aspects of this latest assault by the skeptics which are cause for special concern this latest assault uses compromised peerreview process as vehicle for launching scientific disinformation campaign often viscious and ad hominem under the guise of apparently legitimately reviewed science allowing them to make use of the harvard moniker in the process fortunately the mainstream media never touched the story mostly it has appeared in papers owned by murdoch and his crowd and dubious fringe online outlets much like server which has been compromised as launching point for computer viruses i fear that climate research has become hopelessly compromised vehicle in the skeptics can we find better word disinformation campaign and some of the discussion that ive seen eg potential threat of mass resignation among the legitimate members of the cr editorial board seems in my opinion to have some potential merit this should be justified not on the basis of the publication of science we may not like of course but based on the evidence eg as provided by tom and danny harvey and im sure there is much more that legitimate peerreview process has not been followed by at least one particular editor incidentally the problems alluded to at grl are of different naturethere are simply too many papers and too few editors w appropriate disciplinary expertise to get many of the papers submitted there properly reviewed its simply hit or miss with respect to whom the chosen editor is while it was easy to make sure that the worst papers perhaps including certain ones tom refers to didnt see the light of the day at j climate it was inevitable that such papers might slip through the cracks at eg grlthere is probably little that can be done here other than making sure that some qualified and responsible climate scientists step up to the plate and take on editorial positions at grl best regards mike at 1153 pm 4232003 0600 tom wigley wrote dear friends apologies to those i have missed who have been part of this email exchange although they may be glad to have been missed i think barrie pittock has the right idea although there are some unique things about this situation barrie says 1 there are lots of bad papers out there 2 the best response is probably to write rebuttal to which i add 3 published rebuttal will help ipcc authors in the 4ar ____________________ let give you an example there was paper few years ago by legates and davis in grl vol 24 pp 23191222 1997 that was nothing more than direct and pointed criticism of some work by santer and yet neither of us was asked to review the paper we complained and grl admitted it was poor judgment on the part of the editor eventually 2 years later we wrote response grl 27 29732976 2000 however our response was more that just rebuttal it was an attempt to clarify some issues on detection in doing things this way we tried to make it clear that the original legatesdavis paper was an example of bad science more bluntly either sophomoric ignorance or deliberate misrepresentation any rebuttal must point out very clearly the flaws in the original paper if some new science or explanations can be added as we did in the above example then this is an advantage _____________________________ there is some personal judgment involved in deciding whether to rebut correcting bad science is the first concern responding to unfair personal criticisms is next third is the possible misrepresentation of the results by persons with ideological or political agendas on the basis of these i think the baliunas paper should be rebutted by persons with appropriate expertise names like mann crowley briffa bradley jones hughes come to mind are these people willing to spend time on this _______________________________ there are two other examples that i know of where i will probably be involved in writing response the first is paper by douglass and clader in grl vol 29 16 1010292002gl015345 2002 i refereed virtually identical paper for j climate recommending rejection all the other referees recommended rejection too the paper is truly appalling but somehow it must have been poorly reviewed by grl and slipped through the net i have reason to believe that this was anything more than chance nevertheless my judgment is that the science is so bad that response is necessary the second is the paper by michaels et that was in climate research vol 23 pp 19 2002 danny harvey and i refereed this and said it should be rejected we questioned the editor defreitas again and he responded saying the ms was reviewed initially by five referees the other three referees all reputable atmospheric scientists agreed it should be published subject to minor revision even then i used sixth person to help decide i took his advice and that of the three other referees and sent the ms back for revision it was later accepted for publication the refereeing process was more rigorous than usual on the surface this looks to be above board although as referees who advised rejection it is clear that danny and i should have been kept in the loop and seen how our criticisms were responded to it is possible that danny and i might write response to this paper defreitas has offered us this possibility ______________________________ this second case gets to the crux of the matter i suspect that defreitas deliberately chose other referees who are members of the skeptics camp i also suspect that he has done this on other occasions how to deal with this is unclear since there are number of individuals with bona fide scientific credentials who could be used by an unscrupulous editor to ensure that antigreenhouse science can get through the peer review process legates balling lindzen baliunas soon and so on the peer review process is being abused but proving this would be difficult the best response is i strongly believe to rebut the bad science that does get through _______________________________ jim salinger raises the more personal issue of defreitas he is clearly giving good science bad name but i do not think barrage of ad hominem attacks or letters is the best way to counter this if jim wishes to write letter with multiple authors i may be willing to sign it but i would not write such letter myself in this case defreitas is such poor scientist that he may simply disappear i saw some work from his phd and it was awful pat michaels phd is at the same level
