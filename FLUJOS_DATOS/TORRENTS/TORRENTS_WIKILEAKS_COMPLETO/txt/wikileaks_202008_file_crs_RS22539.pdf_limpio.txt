they first exhaust their available administrative remedies by pursuing to completion the prisons internal complaint process before moving forward with their civil rights lawsuits the court will decide in three consolidated cases jones v bock 057058 walton v bouchard and williams v overton 057142 whether the plras exhaustion requirement insists that prisoners complete the administrative review process in accordance with applicable procedural rules more specifically 1 whether the plra prescribes total exhaustion rule that requires federal court to dismiss prisoners federal civil rights complaint for failure to exhaust his or her administrative remedies whenever there is single unexhausted claim despite the pres ence of other exhausted claims 2 whether the plra requires prisoner to name particular defendant in his or her administrative grievance in order to exhaust his or her admin istrative remedies as to that defendant and to preserve his or her right to sue them and 3 whether satisfaction of the plras exhaustion requirement is prer equisite to prisoners federal civil rights suit such that the prisoner must allege and document in his complaint how he exhausted his administrative remedies or instead whethe r nonexhaustion is an affirmative defense that must be pled and proved by the defense these cases are important because the supreme courts decision will

litigation reform act requires that he first exhaust his available administrative remedies by comple ting the prisons internal complaint process before moving forward with his civil rights lawsuit the supreme court agreed to clarify whether under the prison litigation reform ac t mixed inmate civil rights lawsuits contesting prison conditions and containing both exhausted and unexhausted claims must be dismissed in toto8 the united states courts of app eal are divided on the issue of total exhaustion now courts in the sixth eighth and tenth circuits maintain that plaintiffs entire suit must automatically be dismissed if he has not totally exhausted all of hisher administrative remedies with respect to each aspect of the claim9 other courts in the second sixth ninth and tenth circuits ve rejected the total exhaustion rule10 williams and walton present the additional question of whether the plra requires prisoner to name particular defendant in his or her admin istrative grievance in order to exhaust his or her administrative remedies as to that defendant and to preserve his or her right to sue them11 jones presents third question whether satisfaction of the plras exhaustion requirement is prerequisite to prisoners federal civil rights suit such that the prisoner must allege in his complaint how he exhausted his administrative remedies or attach proof of exhaustion to the complaint or instead whether non exhaustion is an affirmative defense that mu st be pleaded and proved by the defense12 this question has divided the lower federal appellate courts as well13

together the issue divergence is attributable to their somewhat individualistic fact patterns jones who suffered back injuries in car accident while he was in prison custody sued because he was assigned job that required him to do physical labor and that resulted in furthe r injury and an adverse work evaluation14 at the initial stage of the grievance process jones named the officer who provided the evaluation officer opanasenko health ca re classification deputy warden and warden15 in subsequent administrative proceedings he identified the warden by name but for the first time identified the classification official and deputy warden by name when he filed his civil rights complaint in district court16 jones asserted in his complaint that he had exhausted his administrative remedies but only later moved to attach supporting documentation with regard to some of the defendants documentation which the defendants had already provided in their reply17 the sixth circuit held that jones complaint must be dismissed for failure to exhaust because 1 he had not at any point included sufficient documentation of exhaustion with regard to all defendants total exhaustion and 2 he had not included fficient documentation of exhaustion in his original complaint with regard to any of the defendants insufficient pleading18 williams filed suit because he was denied surgery on his right arm and hand to remove disfiguring tumors and was denied single cell assignment to accommodate his handicap19 although he named the defendant s in the underlying accommodation grievance he had not named personally any of the defendant s sued when he filed the underlying surgical grievance20 the sixth circuit held that failure to name the defendants through the course of the grievance proceedings rendered williams surgical claim unexhausted and require d dismissal of his accompan ying exhausted accommodation claim as well21 walton who is black alleged that he was the victim of racial discrimination because he received greater discipline for assaulting corrections officer than white inmates he said had committe d similar acts22 at the first stage of his administrative proceedings walton charged particular assi stant deputy warden by name23 advised that different assistant deputy warden had in fact orde red the disciplinary action walton charged corrupt

11the sixth circuit held that waltons failure in his initial grievance to identify either by name or position the defendants ultimately sued other than the assistant deputy warden required dismissal of his entire suit even if his grievance against the assistant deputy warrant who approved the disciplinary action were considered exhausted25 the plra has resulted directly in effective yet controve rsial results although the intended goals of the plra to reduce the quantity of prisoner litigation have been realized26 critics of the plra express concern th at the exhaustion of the administrative remedies requirement is too strict27 the petitioners jones williams and walton in conjunction with prisoner rights advocate groups argue that mandatory dismissal of prisoners entire complaint on technicality is contrary to the plain language and legislative intent of the plra and imposes substantial arbitrary barriers to access to the courts28 they contend that the sixth circuits requirement that each prisoner include specific documentation of how he exhausted administrative remedies is judici ally created fiction and likewise at odds with the intent of congress29 petitioners also assert that the sixth circuits rule freezing the universe of potential defendants at the beginning of the grievance process suffers from the same defects and is inconsistent with the courts past characterization of the informality of the grievance process30 the michigan department of corrections on the other hand argued that the sixth circuits adherence to the total rule accords with the legislative intent and plain meaning of the plra31 their argument follows that by drafting the plra congress used specific language to signify that an entire suit must be dismissed from court if all administrative remedies had not been pursued pr ior the commencement of the action32 therefore they argue that automatic dismissal of an insufficiently exhausted complain is in line with thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22539crs6 33 id at 12 34 id at 1 35 supra note 27purpose33 the department of corrections also ar gues that the total exhaustion rule does not impose an undue hardship on prisoners because cases dismissed on plra gr ounds are dismissed without prejudice which allows prisoners to refile their complaints in federal court once they have exhausted all remedies34 the federal courts receive close to 25000 inmate civil rights suits year35 congress enacted the plra to ease the burdens of such suits impose upon the courts and upon prison authorities while nevertheless assuring the survival of meritorious claims the three challenged procedures total exha ustion inmate pleading requirements and defendant specific exhaustion all operate to ease the burde ns on the courts and prison authorities the question before the court is whether any or all of them impermissibly do so at the expense of meritorious claims and contrary to the plra
