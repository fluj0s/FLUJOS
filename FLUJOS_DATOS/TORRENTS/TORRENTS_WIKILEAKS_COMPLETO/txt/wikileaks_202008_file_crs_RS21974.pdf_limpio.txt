is the largest employer in the united states and the federal employees health benefits program fehbp is the larges t employersponsored health insurance program fehbp covers about 8 million current workers members of congress annuitants and their families fehbp offers enrollees choice of five feeforservice plans available government wide and another five plans available to employees of certain small federal agencies such as the foreign service in total there are about 300 different plan choices including all regionally available options as well as choices offered by plans for standard option high option and high deductible plans as practical matter depending on where an enrollee resides his or her choice of plans is limited to about five to 15 different plans plan details for all fehbp plans are available on the website of the office of personnel management opmhttpwwwopmgov beginning in 2007 those eligible for fehbp whether or not they are actually enrolled may also enroll in the federal employee dental and vision insurance program fedvip which provides supplemental dental and vision insurance 1 participation in fehbp is voluntary and enrollees may change plans during designated annual open season periods special enrollment periods are also allowed for new employees and for those with qualifying special circumstance such as marriage enrollees are not subject to pre existing condition exclusions the governments share of premiums is set at 72 of the weighted average premium of all plans in the program not to exceed 75 of any given plans premium the maximum annual government contribution for 2008 is 3800 for selfonly coverage and 8600 for family coverage the percentage of premiums paid by the government is calculated separately for individual and family coverage but each uses the same formula annuitants and active employees pay the same premium amounts although active employees have the option of paying premiums on pretax basis premiums in 2008 will rise by an average of 21 over 2007 rates while overall the increases are small some plans have large premium increases however premium increases ignore any changes in benefits or costsharing in particular plan although there is core or standard benefit p ackage required for fehbp all plans cover basic hospital surgical physician and emergency care plans are required to cover certain special benefits including prescription drugs which may have separate deductibles and coinsurance mental health care with parity of coverage for mental health and general medical care coverage child immunizations and limits on an enrollees total outofpocket costs for year called the catastrophic limit generally once an enrollees covered outofpocket expenditures reach the catastrophic limit the plan pays 100 of covered medical expenses for the remainder of the year plans must also include certain costcontainment pr ovisions such as offering preferred provider organization ppo networks in feeforservice plans and hospital preadmission certification g8g7g10g4g18g561g18g149g138g151g156g561 fehbp statutes specify three types of participating plans the governmentwide plan is the feeforservice plan that pays providers directly for services this slot has always been filled by blue cross and blue shield 1 for more information on the fedvip program see crs report rs22535 federal

american postal workers union apwu plan all persons eligible to enroll in fehbp may choose an employee organization plan subject to small annual membership dues comprehensive medical plans include the hmos availability of these plans varies depending on where the individual resides deductibles copayments and coinsurance amounts vary across plans many plans offer two or more options with different premiums and levels of coverage even within individual plans enrollees are offered lower deductible and coinsurance amount if they choose to use services such as physician or hospital provider in the plans network examining the premiums deductibles copayment and coinsurance amounts for physician office visits in the blue cross and blue shield bcbs plans provides an example of this variation for 2008 bcbs offers both standard plan its more generous plan and basic plan under the standard bcbs plan in 2008 monthly premiums will increase by more than 8 over 2007 rates to 13466 for individual coverage and 31447 for family coverage the 2008 calendar year deductible is 300 per person with maximum family deductible of 600 an increase of 50 and 100 respectively enrollees receiving services from preferred provider are responsible for 15 copayment for physician office visit with requirement to first meet the deductible for an office visit with participating physician enrollees are responsible for 25 of the plans allowed amount after meeting the deductible for an office visit with nonparticipating physician enrollees are responsible for 25 of the allowed amount after meeting the deductible plus all of the difference between the allowed amount and the physicians actual charge under the basic plan in 2008 enrollees monthly premiums will increase about 3 over 2007 rates to 8479 for individual coverage and 19860 for family coverage there is calender year deductible enrollees pay 20 copayment for an office visit to preferred primary care provider and 30 copayment for an office visit to preferred specialist the basic plan operates similarly to an hmo in that enrollees may use only preferred providers to receive benefits except in special circumstances such as emergency care

in 2003 fehbp began offering highdeductible plans coupled with taxadvantaged accounts that could be used to pay for qualified medical expenses these plans are believed to help control costs by exposing enrollees to more risk for thei r health care expenditures fehbp first offered this arrangement by combining consumerdriven health plan cdhp with health reimbursement arrangement hra in 2005 fehb p expanded this option to include high deductible health plan hdhp with either health savings account hsa or an hra beginning in 2008 the blue crossblue shield basic plan will have new basic plan suboption called basic consumer option which is hdhp coupled with an hsa or hra available in limited areas additionally both the employee organization plans and the comprehensive medical plans offer cdhps and hdhps while cdhps and hdhps are both highdeductible plans there are major differences between them which are described below

taxable unused balances of pca may be carried over with limit of 5000 for individuals and 10000 for families but balances are forfeited when an enrollee leaves the plan in apwus cdhp all eligible health care expenses except innetwork preventive care are paid first from the pca eligible expenses include basic medical surgical hospital prescription drug and other services covered under the highdeductible plan as well as dental and vision services with limit of up to 400 per year for self and 800 for family once the enrollee has spent the amount contributed by the plan to the pca i 1200 or 2400 enrollees must pay the member responsibility this member responsibility 600 for individuals and 1200 for families is similar to deductible except that it is not for firstdollar coverage members who have built up the balances in their pca over time may use any excess funds to meet their member responsibility 2 once the deductible has been satisfied the highdeductible plan starts covering services with copayments and coinsurance amounts similar to those found in traditional health plans enrollee monthly premiums in 2008 for apwus cdhp are lower than 2007 rates by about 5 at 8417 for individual and 18937for family coverage while enrollees may use either in or outofnetwork providers the pca funds will go further for innetwork providers for example amounts over the plan allowance for outofnetwork services do not count toward reducing the member responsibility in 2008 in addition to apwus nationally available cdhp two other plans aetna and humana also offer cdhp although widely available neither of these plans is nationally available while these three plans are similar in many ways there are some significant differences including 1 the amount the plans place in the hra 2 the carryover amount 3 rules for when the plan begins to cover medical expenses 4 the catastrophic limit amount and 5 availability for example aetna s medical f und similar to the pca is funded by the plan in the amount of 1250 for individuals and 2500 for families with limits on carryover amounts provided you remain in the plan

paired with either an hsa3 or hra available both nationally and regionally for 2008 fehbps hras coupled with the hdhp are similar to hras offered with cdhps in that they 1 cannot exclude fehbpeligible individuals 2 can only be used for medical expenses 3 are not subject to tax 4 are funded solely by the plan 5 do not earn interest and 6 are forfeited when an enrollee leaves the plan however fehbps hras connected with hdhps have limits on carryover amounts unlike the hras connected with cdhps the rules for fehbp hsas are very different hsas are only available to certain individuals those who are not enrolled in medicare not covered by another health plan not claimed as dependent on someone elses federal tax return and those who have not received veterans administration health benefits in the past three months enrollees may add additional funds to 2 for example for individual coverage if the pca balance is 2000 the individual could use 1200 from the fund to pay for services and another 600 from the fund to meet the member responsibility the enrollee would then qualify for coverage under the highdeductible health care plan while still retaining pca balance of 200 3 for more information

contributions do not exceed the federal limit for 2008 the limit is 2900 for self coverage and 5800 for family coverage enrollees over age 55 can make catchup contribution in the amount of 900 in 2008 the plans contribution to the hsa is taxfree an enrollees contribution is taxdeductible an above the line deduction not limited to those who itemize and any interest earned is taxfree all unused funds as well any interest may be carried over each year without limit in addition to qualified medical expenses hsa funds may also be used for nonmedical expenses subject to the income tax and an additional penalty for those under 65 each month the plan automatically deposits portion of the fehbp hdhp premiums into an hsa or hra individuals enrolled in an hdhp who are not eligible for an hsa as of the first day of the month have their funds credited to an hra plans place the same amount in to an enrollees hra as they do into an hsa there are also similarities and differences between the cdhps and hdhps high deductible plans both may cover preventive services without first meeting deductible both operate similar to traditional health care once the deductible has been met both save beneficiaries money for using innetwork services and both require higher deductibles and catastrophic limits than other fehbp plans however the cdhps highdeducti ble plan only covers services after both the amount contributed by the plan for the year has been spent and the member responsibilitydeductible has been met while the hdhp begins to cover services once the deductible has been met there are exceptions in both cases for preventive care the minimum deductible for the hdhp is specified in law as is the maximum catastrophic limit while neither is specified for the cdhp examining gehas hdhp provides an example of premiums deductibles and hsahras for these types of plans for individual coverage in 2008 the monthly premium is 9520 the deductible is 1500 the plan will place 60 per month in the hsahra and those in the hsa may contribute another 2180 annually the difference between the amount contributed by the plan and the federal self coverage limit for family coverage in 2008 the monthly premium is 21745 the deductible is 3000 the plan places 120 per month into the hsahra and those with an hsa may contribute another 4360 annually the difference between the amount contributed by the plan and the federal family coverage limit enrollees over age 55 may also make catchup contributions while the premiums and deductible for gehas hdhp plan did not increase over the 2007 amounts the amount contributed by the plan to the hsahra decreased by 30 per month for individual and 60 per month for family coverage
