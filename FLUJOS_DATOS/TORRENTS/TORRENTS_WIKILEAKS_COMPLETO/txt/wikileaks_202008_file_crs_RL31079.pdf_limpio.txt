form and content of proposed fe deral homestead exemption has been controversial topic in the debate over bankruptcy reform as congress takes up the issue in the 109th congress many seek to learn what each state currently allows its residents as homestead ex emption and whether state residents may chose between federal and state exemptions or whethe r they are limited to those under state law although many publications contain comprehe nsive state homestead surveys this one is undertaken with the goal of being as up to date as possible state laws were reviewed on the lexis computer database notation indicates the currency of the legislative term included in the review of each states laws the survey provides thumbnail sketch of the character and amount of each states homestead provision derived from its statutory language this will enable the reader to appreciate the breadth and variety of statelaw approaches to these exemptions the emphasis however is on the amount of the exemption not upon conditions for validating it the survey does not address whether there is or if so the duration of an exemption for proceeds after the sale of homestead it also does not address exemptions established by case law for homesteads held as tenancies by the entirety nor does it consider provisi ons under the state laws that constitute exceptions to homestead exemption in some cases minimis wildcard exemptions for either real or personal property are noted but the survey is not co mprehensive with respect to them they are more likely to be noted when state has an extremely
