in canadian port31 mexico theater security cooperation with mexico is limited to antidrug trafficking operations and senior officer visits with mexican counterparts the former is continuation of jtf6 interactions while the latter has proven difficult because the mexican defense establishment lacks natural entry point for combatant command level engagement mexican defense leaders have historically interacted with the office of the secretary of defense because mexico was not assigned to combatant commands aor32 issues for congress during deliberations on the fy2009 defense authorization legislation some northcom issues for congress may include dod reorganization and the unified command plan ucp northcoms interagency relationships northcoms reliance on reserve component forces the ongoing cheyenne mountain operations center realignment and the allocation of resources necessary for northcom to successfully plan for and execute its assigned missions unified command plan ucp congress approved dods request for 10th assistant secretary of defense to facilitate the reorganization of the office of the under secretary of defense for policy ousd p the conference report for the 2007 national defense authorization act ndaa pl 109364 expressed several concerns about the reorganization including the assistant secretary for homeland defense inheriting western hemisphere focus33

national defense authorization act for continued crs8 combatant command interactions with ousd p however the proposed reorganization appears to create more rather than fewer entry points to navigate for example the assistant secretary for homeland defense and americas affairs as well as the new assistant secretary for global security policy both appear to have northcom interests likewise dod has currently filled only three of five assistant secretary billets within ousd p as dod reorganizes its policy staff some may call for major changes to the ucp after only five years in existence northcoms geographic aor continues to be refined may 2006 revision of the ucp shifted the aleutian islands from pacom to northcom while moving cuba puerto rico the bahamas and the us virgin islands from northcom to southcom34 there may be merit to further examining combatant command boundaries particularly between northcom and us southern and pacific commands interagency relationships based on hurricane katrina lessons learned dod and dhs have taken several steps to improve coordination several northcom components have been assigned missions that focus on military assistance to civil authorities likewise northcom continues to make tangible efforts to improve cooperation and coordination with national guard forces as well as key partners like fema reportedly northcom ngb and fema partnered to purchase 22 identical deployable cellular communication systems to improve coordinated emergency response capability35 government accountability office gao study concluded in april 2008 examined ongoing coordination efforts between northcom the ngb and states while identifying gaps in northcoms efforts36 the gao found number of ongoing efforts designed to improve northcoms civil

staffs provides information on northcoms civil support role to states northcoms hurricane and wildfire conferences are beginning to build effective relationships between participants northcom has improved relationships with state and local officials by locating defense coordinating officers in fema regional offices however the gao also identified three remaining gaps in the coordination between northcom states and the ngb38 northcom only minimally involves states in the development of homeland defense and civil support plans northcom was not familiar with state emergency response plans and has process for obtaining this information the roles and responsibilities between northcom and the ngb for planning for homeland defense and civil support are not clearly defined as such the gao recommended the secretary of defense39 direct northcom to develop thorough process to guide coordination with states to include provisions that 1 involve states in northcoms planning process and 2 obtains and incorporates information on state emergency response plans and capabilities into the development and execution of northcom plans direct northcom and the ngb to formally develop an agreement that clearly defines roles and responsibilities for northcom the ngb and the northcom national guard office in response to the gao recommendations dod stated that revised memorandum of agreement between northcom and the ngb was in coordination however dod only partially concurred with the first recommendation while dod agreed with the need for more thorough planning process dod believes the process must include us pacific and southern commands in addition to northcom further dod stated that homeland security presidential directive 8 annex 1 requires dhs to produce and integrated planning system ips dod added that northcom the ngb the joint staff and office of secretary of defense staffs are coordinating with dhs to develop an ips40 38 ibid pp 2333 39 ibid p 34 40 ibid p 47 crs10 separate gao report completed in april 2008 also examined northcoms interagency relationships the report found that northcom had taken number of steps to improve interagency coordination and concluded that northcoms federal interagency coordination efforts have helped address some of the uncertainty in the homeland defense and civil support planning process and have improved northcoms ability to coordinate in the event of actual incidents41 however the gao found that northcom lacks formal procedures to ensure that integrated planning will be fully adopted42 as such the gao recommended that dod and northcom in coordination with other appropriate federal agencies develop clear guidance for interagency planning efforts and document agreements for interagency planning groups within the construct of the integrated planning system dod concurred with this gao recommendation43 seeking to continue to strengthen relationships between dhs and dod the 2008 ndaa directs the secretary of defense in consultation with the secretary of homeland security to determine what militaryunique capabilities dod provides that are necessary to support civil authorities during national catastrophic incidents additionally the 2008 ndaa pl 110181 directs dod to budget for additional requirements deemed necessary to conduct civil support missions44 with the focus on interagency coordination some are calling for legislation to codify processes with something similar to the goldwaternichols act that reorganized dod the 2007 ndaa directed the president to provide congress report on improving interagency support45 while the report focused on better dod and civilian executive branch integration homeland security also requires cooperation across the full spectrum of federal state and local agencies46 likewise some question the advisability of creating additional layers at the federal level as it may make it more complicated for state and local authorities to interact with federal agencies 41 gao08251 homeland defense us northern command has made progress but needs force allocations readiness tracking gaps and other issues april 2008 pp35 40 42 ibid pp

increased reliance on reserve components nearly 150 reserve and national guard members staff northcom headquarters including five general officers its air force and marine components are reserve commands that have fulltime missions jtfcs is primarily reserve organization and jtfn relies on reserve component units to conduct operations likewise the national command regions integrated air defense system is operated by national guard forces in title 10 status and since 911 over 70 of the nations air defense sorties have been flown by reserve component forces47 recent trends indicate northcom will increase reliance on reserve component forces to support civil authorities reserve component forces are also deploying overseas in large numbers for other combatant commanders as mobilizations continue and homeland security missions increase more reserve component forces are serving in fulltime status some are concerned homeland defense may create near and longterm resource issues for the reserve components prompting many governors to question whether they will have sufficient national guard forces available to accomplish state missions as such the 2008 ndaa pl 110181 requires dod in consultation with dhs the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff northcom and the ngb to prepare and submit plan to congress for coordinating the use of national guard and members of the armed forces in response to natural and manmade disasters by june 1 200848 additionally the 2008 ndaa pl 110181 requires the president to establish bipartisan council of governors to advise dod dhs and the white house homeland security council regarding the use of the national guard and civil support missions49 some believe that because of the national guards unique dual status the northcom deputy commander should be national guard officer this issue was initially deferred to the commission on the national guard and reserves the commission recommended that either the commander or deputy commander of northcom be filled by reserve component officer but it recommended against adding second deputy commander billet to allow both active duty and reserve component representation at the deputy level50 the 2008 ndaa pl 110181 requires that either the commander or at least one deputy commander billet at northcom be filled with national guard officer51 47 testimony of commander us

miles west of peterson to combined noradnorthcom command center at peterson the cold war vintage facility will remain in standby status and be used for exercises or contingencies northcom believes the combined command center will increase unity of effort and operational effectiveness enabling an effective response to full spectrum of threats52 however the government accountability office gao has

positions are staffed at relatively high levels in comparison with other geographic combatant commands and that northcom officials believed they possessed adequate numbers of planning personnel55 on the other hand the gao questioned whether dod has assigned adequate numbers of forces to northcom to execute assigned missions the gao found that unlike other geographic combatant commands within dod

issues april 2008 pp35 31 crs13 the lack of units specifically identified to execute northcoms plans may increase the level of risk to homeland defense or civil support operations in terms of the availability of sufficient number of personnel with the appropriate level of training and equipment for conducting the domestic mission56 in addition the gao found that northcoms ability to monitor the readiness of forces to respond to civil support missions is hampered because few units have been identified for this mission57 as such the gao recommended that dod assign forces to northcom and require northcom to develop deployment timelines for each of its major operational plans58 in response dod agreed that certain specialized forces such as those trained to respond to chemical biological radiological nuclear and highyield explosive attacks should be regularly assigned to northcom however dod believes that readiness for civil support missions can be improved by developing civil support readiness metrics for general purpose forces59 56 ibid p 27 57 ibid pp 2730 58 ibid p 44 59 ibid pp 4546 for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34342
