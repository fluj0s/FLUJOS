communities across the united states every year causing fatalities destroying property and crops and disrupting businesses tornadoes are the most destructive products of severe thunderstorms and second only to flash flooding as the cause for most thunderstormrelated fatalities damages from violent tornadoes seem to be increasing similar to the trend for other natural hazards and some analysts indicate that losses of 1 billion or more from single tornado events are becoming more frequent insurance industry analysts state that tornadoes severe thunderstorms and related weather events have caused nearly 57 on average of all insured losses in the united states in any given year since 1953 policies that could reduce us vulnerability to severe thunderstorms and tornadoes include improvements in the capability to accurately detect storms and to effectively warn those in harms way the national weather service nws has the legal authority to forecast weather and issue warnings some researchers suggest that there are limits to the effectiveness of improvements in forecasting ability and warning systems for reducing losses and saving lives from severe weather the research suggests that for example social behavioral and demographic factors now play an increasingly important role in tornadorelated fatalities at issue for congress is its role in mitigating damages injuries and fatalities from severe thunderstorms and tornadoes the national science and technology council has recommended that communities implement hazard mitigation strategies and technologies some of whichsuch as conducting weatherrelated research and development and disseminating resultscongress has supported through annual appropriations for federal agencies such as the national oceanic and atmospheric administration the national science foundation the federal emergency management agency nasa and others other recommended strategies include land use and zoning changes which are typically not in the purview of congress congress attempted to clarify the federal role in mitigating damages from windstorms including tornadoes and thunderstorms by passing the national windstorm impact reduction act of 2004 pl 108360 it is not evident whether the program made progress toward its objective achievement of major measurable reductions in the losses of life and property from windstorms authorization for the program expired at the end of fy2008 it is also unclear whether changes to climate over the past halfcentury have increased the frequency or intensity of thunderstorms and tornadoes at issue for congress is whether future climate change will lead to more frequent and more intense thunderstorms and tornadoes and whether efforts by congress to mitigate longterm global warming will also reduce future sses from thunderstorms and tornadoes

affect communities across the united states every year causing fatalities destroying property and crops and disrupting businesses state and local governments are typically the first to respond to the consequences of extreme weather events but the federal government has responsibilities for forecasting and issuing warnings to citizens and communities lying in harms way when severe weather catastrophes overwhelm the resources of state and local governments the stafford act auth orizes the president to issue major disaster or emergency declarations resulting in the distribution of wide range of federal aid to those affected 1 also us department of agriculture programs such as federal crop insurance and emergency disaster loans can help farmers recover financially from severe weather disasters even without presidential disaster declaration2 many observers note that although the number of lives lost each year to natural hazards in the united states has decreased the costs of major disasters continues to rise3 according to the national science and technology council due to changes in population demographics and more complex weathersensitive infrastructure americans today are more vulnerable than ever to severe weather events caused by tornadoes hurricanes severe storms heat waves and winter weather 4 this report first discusses issues that may be of interest to congress in three general categories 1 forecasting and issuing warnings for severe thunderstorms and tornadoes 2 the role of mitigation and 3 the effect of climate change the second part of the report describes in more detail the risk these hazards pose to communities and individuals where when how and why they occur in the united states and what damage they may cause it also describes the role of the national weather service in forecasting severe weather and communicating the risk to communities and individuals at risk

sponsored forecast and warning systems federally backed efforts to improve the scientific understanding of severe weather phenomena and efforts to mitigate the risk of catastrophe congress has oversight and funding responsibilities for the federal agencies charged with these tasks at issue is whether those programs are effective at reducing damage injuries and loss of life from severe

precautions and strategiessuch as improved building materials and structural systemsthat decrease the vulnerability of communities and individuals to severe thunderstorms and tornadoes the federal role in supporting programs of hazard mitigation such as those included in the national windstorm impact reduction act of 2004 pl 108360 is concern for congress authorization for the windstorm impact reduction program expired at th end of fy2008 and it is not clear whether the program achieved any of the goals specified in the legislation projections of changing climate for the united states and the possibility of more intense hydrologic cycle eg more intense storms rainfall heat waves and other phenomena have raised questions about whether the costs of severe weather disasters will continue to rise in the future observers note that extreme events more than shifts in average climate conditions drive changes in natural and human systems 5 according to the us climate change research program in the future with continued global warming heat waves and heavy downpours are very likely to further increase in frequency and intensity substantial areas of north america are likely to have more frequent droughts of greater severity hurricane wind speeds rainfall intensity and storm surge levels are likely to increase the strongest cold season storms are likely to become more frequent with stronger winds and more extreme wave heights 6 distinguishing between increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events due to global warming and other factors that contribute to higher costs from disasterssuch as changing demographics in hazardprone regionsalso may be an important issue for congress

to severe thunderstorms and tornadoes will likely include improvements in the capability to accurately detect storms and to effectively warn those in harms way the national weather service nws is authorized by law to forecast weather and issue warnings how congress chooses to fund nws and conduct oversight of its activities bears directly on the agencys effectiveness in its strategic plan for 20052010 the nws cited several preferred outcomes for the nation including 1 reduced loss of life injury and damage to the economy and 2 better quicker and more valuable weather and water information to support improved decisions 7 to achieve these outcomes nws would employ strategy to improve the reliability leadtime and understanding of weather and water information and services that predict changes in environmental conditions8 improving the leadtime and reliability of severe thunderstorm and tornado forecasts could provide communities and indi viduals with information to help them better

communities must break the cycle of destruction and recovery by enhancing their disaster resilience italics added10 among the six grand challenges identified in its report the nstc recommended that communities implement hazard mitigation strategies and technologies such as development of advanced construction materials and structural systems that allow facilities to remain robust in the face of

role in developing disasterresilient materials and structures and evaluating their relative effectiveness in mitigating damages from severe thunderstorms and tornadoes has been unclear congress attempted to clarify the federal role in mitigating damages from windstorms including tornadoes and thunderstorms by passing the national windstorm impact reduction act of 2004 pl 108360 the legislation identified three primary mitigation components 1 improved understanding of windstorms 2 windstorm impact assessment and 3 windstorm impact reduction authorization for the national windstorm imp act reduction program expired on september 30 2008 and it is not clear whether the program made progress toward its objective achievement of major measurable reductions in the losses of life and property from windstorms that lofty goal may have been difficult to achieve within the th reeyear authorization even if appropriations for the program matched authorization levels and the program was well implemented on these points the house science and technology committee found that spending on the program by the four agencies responsible for program implem entationthe national science foundation the national institutes of standards and technology nist noaa and femawas far below authorized levels and that the program had not been well implemented 13 the administration cites many research activitie s and other programs underway within each of the four agencies that contribute to goals of the windstorm program and to the need to incorporate wind hazards reduction measures into an allhazards view14 biennial progress report discussed the importance of aspects of the programspecifically the goal of increasing the effectiveness of existing program efforts through better coordination among agencies15 the report indicated that interagency coordination is improving through the work of the interagency working group established under 204 of pl 10836016 however it is difficult to assess the effect of improved interagency coordination on the broader goals of the programto achieve measurable reductions in loss of life and propertyor whether the law has compelled the

without passage of the national windstorm impact reduction act the administration further concludes that the benefits of an improved understanding of severe wind hazards will not be fully realized until that understanding is incorporated more completely into actions at the state and local level17 senator bill nelson introduced s 3638 on september 26 2008 to reauthorize the national windstorm impact reduction program through fy2013 and to expand the agencies involved under an interagency working group to also include the us department of transportation dot the us army corps of engineers cor ps nasa and the office of management and budget omb the bill would have designated nist as lead agency for the interagency working group similar to its role as lead agency for the national earthquake hazards reduction program 18 the bill was referred to the senate commerce science and transportation committee the committee did not act on the legislation

scientific literature there will likely be changes in the intensity duration frequency and geographic extent of weather and climate extremes as the earth continues to warm19 these changes may continue upward trends that have already been observed such as the frequency of unusually warm nights frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events and the length of the frostfree season20 however the evidence is unclear as to whether the frequency and intensity of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes has increased or will increase in the future due to climate change part of the difficulty in sorting out trends in frequency and intensity of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes lies in the way they have been observed and reported for example the number of annual reported tornado occurrences has doubled between 1954 and 200321 some studies indicate that the doubling reflects changes in observing and reporting when the artificial trend produced by these changes is removed the adjusted data show little or trend in the number of reported tornadoes since the 1950s22 reports of severe thunderstorms without associated tornadoes increased by factor of 20 between 1955 and 200423 however researchers indicate that the increase is mainly in reports of marginally severe thunderstorms and suggest th at the evidence for change in the longterm trend of severe thunderstorms is lacking24 in studies that reanalyze environmental conditions that could have produced severe thunderstorms changes in the frequency of those environmental 17 sharon hays testimony july 24 2008 18 also known as

long enough to determine the range of natural variability25 given the uncertainty it is not yet possible to determine if these changes are due to natural variability or changing climatic conditions from greenhouse warming excessive rainfall from severe thunderstorms may trigger flash floods which are typically responsible for most floodrelated deaths in the united states each year according to researchers one of the clearest trends over the last 30 years has been an increase in the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events 26 despite this clear trend the relationship between these heavy precipitation events and the frequency and intensity of severe thunderstorms is not clear nor do scientists agree on the relationship between increased precipitation and streamflow extremes such as flooding27 as further complication studies of trends in streamflow using similar data have produced different results28 also human influences on streamflow such as building dams and creating large reservoirs may mask climatic changes29 climate model predictions suggest that with continued global warming due to increasing concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases precipitation intensity is projected to increase30 however it is unclear whether this intensification of precipitation is or will be linked in the future to more severe thunderstorms and to more severe or more frequent flash floods the section below discusses why severe thunderstorms and tornadoes are threats to some areas of the country and not others and why they occur during some parts of the year and not others the following section also describes the role of the national weather service in forecasting and issuing warnings and its relationship to private forecasters and the news media

and tornadoes affect us citizens and communities every year albeit only rarely with the same level of widespread destruction as major hurricane or flood although floods are one consequence of severe thunderstorms floods that cause widespread and prolonged destruction are typically not annual events in the united states major floods such as those that affected parts of the mississippi river region in the midwest in 2008 and in 1993 are the result of many factors and are not solely caused by heavy rains from severe thunderstorms 31 25 ccsp weather and climate extremes in changing climate 2008 p

the florida peninsula and in other parts of the southeast although the most severe weather threat from thunderstorms extends from texas to southern minnesota along the great plains and midwestern united states 48 thunderstorms are most likely to occur in the spring and summer and during the afternoon and evening in the great plains most thunderstorms occur in the afternoon and at night and along the gulf coast southeastern united states and western states they occur most frequently in the afternoon49 the greatest potential for severe weather develops in geographical regions that are subject to warm humid air at low levels while dry conditionally unstable air prevails aloft thunderstorms form during the summer in the southern great plains when southerly flow of warm very moist air from the gulf of mexico meets with dry we sterly current aloft the thunderstorms that form in colorado arizona and new mexico are due to orographic liftingascending airflow caused by the rocky mountains few thunderstorms occur along the west coast of the united states because this region is frequently influenced by cooler maritime air masses that suppress convectional uplift over land50

of cells moving as single unit with each cell in different stage of the thunderstorm life cycle 52 as the multicell storm evolves individual cells take turns at being the most dominant new cells tend to form along the upwind typically western or southwestern edge of the cluster with mature cells located at the center and dissipating cells found along the downwind eastern or northeastern portion of the cluster multicell storms come in variety of shapes sizes and intensities 53 they are stronger than single cell thunderstorms but less severe than supercell storms each cell in multicell storm lasts about 20 minutes however the multicell cluster may persist for several hours most flash floods occur during multicell storm events54

incr easing similar to the trend for other natural hazards according to some insurance industry analysts losses of 1 billion or more from single tornado events are becoming more frequent57 for example the socalled super tuesday tornado outbreak during february 56 2008 in several southern states including arkansas mississippi and tennessee caused approximately 850 million in insured losses58 insurance industry analysts indicate that tornadoes severe thunderstorms and related weather events such as hailstorms but not hurricanes or earthquakes ve caused nearly 57 on average of all insured losses in the united states in any given year since 195359 fatalities caused by tornadoes have declined significantly since the 1930s generally because of improved forecasting warning systems and increased public awareness of the tornado risk however some researchers suggest that the decline is unlikely to continue and may have already stopped 60 these findings attribute the stalled decline to increasing vulnerability due to demographic factors rather than shortcomings in tornado forecasts and warnings61 the results would suggest that there are limits to the number of potential lives saved by improvements in forecasting ability and warning systems and that social behavioral and demographic factors may play an increasingly important role in tornadorelated fatalities 62 other stakeholders

fatalities from floods which occur in vehicles this indicates that people are more likely to seek shelter during tornadic events however the risk of injury or death seems to depe nd on what type of housing stock in which they choose to seek shelter for example one study indicated that manufactured houses such as mobile homes are particularly vulnerable to tornadoes mobile home deaths accounted for an average of 44 of all deaths caused by tornadoes between 1985 and 2005 and showed an increasing trend over the 20year period 64 during the same time period tornadorelated deaths within permanent homes fluctuated between 20 and 30 and deaths in vehicles decreased to 99 of all tornadorelated deaths on average65 the study concluded that the high percentage of mobile homes in the southeast may be the key factor explaining why most tornadorelated deaths occur in lower arkansas tennessee and lower mississippi river valleys members of congress have recognized the increased vulnerability of citizens living in manufactured housing to tornadoes in the 110th congress the house passed hr 2787 cjs home protection act of 2007 on october 30 2 007 the bill would amend 604 of the national manufactured housing construction and safety standards act of 2004 42 usc 5403 to require that all manufactured homes be equipped with noaa weather radio66 noaa weather radios would presumably give the residents of manufactured homes better chance of receiving tornado warnings and allow them to take precautionary measures companion bill s 2724 was introduced in the senate on march 6 2008 the senate did not act on the bill in 2003 the 108 th congress passed the tornado shelters act pl 108146 which amended the housing and community development act of 1974 42 usc 5305a to authorize communities to use community development block grant cdbg funds for construction of tornadosafe shelters in manufactured home parks the law was aimed at communities of at least 20 manufactured homes and which consist of predom inately low and moderate income residents to be eligible the community has to be located in state that was struck by tornado during the fiscal year when funds were made available or during the previous three fiscal years 67 since 1950 violent tornadoes were responsible for 675 of all tornado deaths in the united states yet comprise only 21 of all tornadoes68 the number of fatalities caused by less violent tornadoes is also significant and some studies suggest that the percentage of fatalities caused by less violent tornadoes has increased since the 1970s69

thunderstorm to the ground tornadoes develop from severe thunderstorms in warm moist unstable air along and ahead of cold fronts there are two types of tornadoes those that come from supercell thunderstorm and those that do not 74 tornadoes that form from supercell thunderstorms are the most common usually the largest and the most dangerous in supercell thunderstorms rotating updraft is essential to development of tornado rotation of the updraft can be caused by wind shear which occurs when winds at two different levels above the ground blow at different speeds or in different directions an invisible tube of air begins to rotate horizontally and rising air within the thunderstorm tilts the rotating air from horizontal to vertical resulting in rotation that extends through much of the storm once the updraft is rotating and being fed by warm moist air flowing in from the ground level tornado can form the mechanisms that cause tornadoes to form from supercell storms are not known precisely and it is not currently possible to predict which supercell thunderstorms will produce tornadoes and which will not based on observations approximately 20 of supercell thunderstorms produce tornadoes 75 70 national severe storms laboratory at httpw wwnsslnoaagovprimertornadotor_faqshtml 71 national severe storms laboratory at httpwwwn

thunderstorms and tornadoes form and improving the accuracy and timeliness of forecasting and warning systems will likely provide individuals and communities in the united states better information to

necessarily lead to significant decreases in damages injuries or deaths from severe thunderstorms and tornadoes shifting populations changes in wealth density and construction of dense infrastructure in areas prone to severe weather could offset improvements in forecasting and warning systems the potential for considerable loss of life and property due to tornadoes continues to exist especially in highly vulnerable regions of the country further the increasing population and migration patterns of this population suggest that the overall vulnerability and risk to humans and their property may amplify in the future despite improvements in forecasting detection and warning dissemination 94 references omitted in fact implementing hazard mitigation strategies may include developing and

estimating the intensity of tornadoes and was intended to relate the degree of damage to the intensity of wind96 the original fscale was used for over three decades but its limitations prompted the development of new scale called the enhanced fscale or efscale the efscale is intended to be more robust and precise method of assessing tornado damage than the original fscale the efscale calibrates tornado damage by using 28 different types of damage indicators such as the type of construction eg anchored versus unanchored houses mobile homes schools garages barns skyscrapers transmission towers and others 97 even with the improvements over the original fscale the ef scale only represents estimates of wind speed based on damage and not measurements of actual wind speeds in tornadoes98 actual tornado wind speeds are still largely unknown table a1 compares the original fscale and the efscale which is currently used by meteorologists and wind engineers t able a1 fscale and enhanced fscale
