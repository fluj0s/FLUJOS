trust funds under the latest forecast continue to face longrange ﬁnancing problems on combined basis the oldage survivors and disability insurance oasdi trust funds are projected to be depleted in

shortrange 10year and longrange 75year operations of the oasi and di trust funds since there is uncertainty in long term projections the trustees provide estimates based on three alternative sets of economic and demographic assumptions low cost alternative i intermediate cost alternative ii and high cost alternative iii the intermediate projections represent the trustees best estimate these intermediate projections are the projections used in assessing the shortrange adequacy of social security financing while the three sets of longrange projections highlight that there is uncertainty in these estimates this approach does not provide any indication of the probability that the futu re financial status of the trust fund are within or outside the range of these estimates the standard longrange projection methodol ogy lowcost intermediate and high cost projections uses deterministic model of outcomes where certain assumptions are made regarding important mographic and economic factor s affecting the trust fund balance the deterministic model uses separa specified assumed values for each of the assumptions in recent years the annual report has be gun to provide stochastic projections that attempt to m odel the probability of alterna tive trust fund outcomes the stochastic approach is built on thousands of independent s imulations where the value of the assumptions are allowed to vary the distribution of these simulation outcomes are then used to determine the probability of solvency occurring within range of years or the probability of key trust fund indicators fa lling within particular numerical range while the trustees report provides these st ochastic estimates they are found in an appendix of the report and the model is vi ewed as being in its early stages of development summarizing the trust fund operations over 75year period may lead to misperceptions about program stainability for even longer periods the trustees report now includes some measures of trust fund obligations beyond the 75year period which assume that most of the demographic nd economic trends tinue indefinitely summary measures of program obligations th rough an infinite horizon are now part of the trustees report however the focus of discussion surrounding the trustees report is on trust fund estimates for the 75year peri od using the intermediate assumptions the remainder of this report will highlight the current report findings using these intermediate assumptions understanding trust fund financing in july of 2006 social security provi ded cash benefits for 49 million americans over 162 million americans paid taxes in s upport of those benefits the combined oasdi trust funds receive income from the pa yroll taxes workers pay on their wages and selfemployment income smaller amount is financed by part of the income tax some recipients pay on their social security benefits in addition the trust fund receives interest from its current assets this income is used to pay for current benefits and program administration income in excess of outgo is credited to the trust fund these trust fund assets are primary indicator of the programs fina ncial status the trustees report details these transacti ons and makes projections about future years transactions and the status of the trust funds when assets at the beginning of any year are equal to

reform legal analysis of social security benefit entitlement issues kathleen swendimen and thomas nicolain excess of expected expenditures the tr ust fund is thought to have an adequate balance if this ratio of assets to expected expenditures reaches zero the trust fund is said to be insolvent this means that fullyscheduled current law social security benefits could not be provided without some infusion of add itional revenues2 solvency under the intermediate forecast the trustees project that on combined basis the balance of the social security trust funds will peak in 2026 but will be depleted in 2040 one year earlier than estimated in last years report figure 1 illustrates the projected and eventual decrease in social security holdings table 1 shows other important dates related to trust fund financing under the intermediate pr ojections the di trust fund by itself is projected to become insolvent in 2025 and the oasi trust fund by itself is projected to become insolvent in 2042 b ecause the oasi trust fund as measured by income outgo and balances is much larger than the di trust fund when all combined oasdi operations are considered th year of exhaustion converges at

funds is paid by the government to the government that is transfer of funds from one government account to another beginning in 2017 money will have to be drawn from the general fund of the treasury to meet benefit payments and administrative costs under the intermediate forecast the comb ined trust fund expenditures would begin to exceed tax revenue in 2017 as shown in figure 2 despite the tax revenue deficit at this time the combined trust fund assets c ontinue to grow through 2026 bringing their balance to slightly under 6 trillion source the 2006 nnual report of the board of trustees of the federal oldage and survivors insurance and disability insurance trust funds this increase is the result of continued gr owth in the trust f unds net interest in 2027 and thereafter the reserve balance w ould begin to be drawn down until the trust funds assets do not fully cover exp ected costs in 2040 at that point annual tax revenue would be sufficient to cover only about 74 of program costs under the current law projection expected tax revenue s would continue to decline as share of program costs figure 2 projected income excl uding interest and outgo of the social security trust

thought of as the lumpsum amount that if invested today given an assumed rate of return would grow to cover the programs co sts at the end of the projection period these types of measure attempt to account for the time value of money interest earned and are dependent on the assumptions used in their calcula tion ie the interest assumptions it is not simple measure of the cumulative gap between trust fund income and outgosuch that at the end of the 75year pr ojection period 2080 these revenues would equal just 70 of costs over the full 75year projection period on average trust fund expenditures are projected to exceed income by 15 expressed another way the longrange trust fund deficit is projected to be 202 of taxable payroll com pared with 192 of taxable payroll as projected in the 2005 report the systems longrange financing problems reflect projected costs associ ated with the aging of the population the first members of the baby boom generation will reach early retirement age in 2008 and with projected increases in life expectancy and decreases in birth rates over the next 25 years the number of people aged 65 and older is project ed to increase by 90 in contrast the number of workers whose taxes will finance future benefits is projected to increase by only 14 as result the number of work ers supporting each recipient is projected to decline from 33 today to 22 in 2030 afte r 2030 the ratio gradually declines even further an additional way in which the trustees express the longterm concerns for the program is by providing an estimation of how large cash infusion would be needed to retain solvency in lieu of other reform options comprising of revenue increases or benefit reductions in the 2006 report the trustees estimate that the present value of future infusions necessary to keep the system solvent beyond 2040 to the end of the 75year longrange projection period w ould be 46 trillion to sustain solvency for the infinite horizon the present value of future reve nue infusions is much higher 134 trillion3
