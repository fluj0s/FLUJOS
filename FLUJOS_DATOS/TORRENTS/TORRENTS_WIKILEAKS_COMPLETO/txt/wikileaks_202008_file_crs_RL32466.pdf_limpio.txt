policy emma chanlettavery foreign aﬀairs defense and trade division may 13 2008 abstract rising competition for energy in china japan and south korea are of interest to us policymakers for three primary reasons first the surge in chinas energy needs has emerged as major factor in inﬂuencing world oil prices second the tightening global oil market could increase the bargaining power of oil exporting countries possibly driving wedge between the united states and our asian allies over important foreign policy issues third competition in asia over access to energy supplies could signiﬁcantly alter the geopolitics of the region with important ramiﬁcations for us foreign policy analysts alarmed at the developing trends are quick to mention that energy insecurity is often cited as the proximate cause of the japanese attack on pearl harbor in 1941httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32466g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for

markets largely due to chinas remarkable growth in demand as the gap between consumption and production levels in asia expands the regions economic powers appear to be increasingly anxious about their energy security concerned that tight supplies and consequent high prices may constrain economic growth rising energy competition in east asia promises to affect us policy in many ways from contributing to price spikes because of chinas rapidly increasing demand to altering the geostrategic landscape in the years to come as regional powers struggle to secure access to energy supplies this report analyzes how china japan and south koreas pursuits to bolster their energy security impacts us interests it also examines decisions being made by asian states now that will significantly shape global affairs in the future how these decisions might play out and how congress and the executive branch might play role in those decisions china japan and south korea have been moving aggressively to shore up partnerships with existing suppliers and pursue new energy investments overseas often downplaying doubts about the technical feasibility and economic profitability of new development their outreach to suppliers includes the development of close ties with iran key concern to us policymakers given skepticism about tehrans nuclear program this report outlines the energy portfolios and strategies of the three countries including their pursuit of alternatives to petroleum the russian far east with vast energy reserves and relative geographical proximity to northeast asian markets is already an arena for competition among the asian powers the current struggle between china and japan over access to russian oil via pipeline from siberia may be indicative of more conflicts ahead if russia continues to attract commercial and political overtures to gain access to its resources moscow stands to gain considerably more power in international affairs the possible implications of the surge in energy competition are wideranging from provoking military conflict to spurring unprecedented regional cooperation depending on how events unfold the us alliances with japan and south korea as well as relationships with russia and china could be challenged to adapt to changing conditions central asia with its considerable energy supplies and key strategic location has reemerged as an arena for geopolitical contests among major powers many analysts concur that it is in the interest of the united states for the governments of china japan and south korea to approach energy policy from market perspective they believe that if beijing tokyo and seoul instead link energy supply with overall security the potential for conflict and instability is heightened the report concludes with number of options including those that us policymakers might pursue to encourage trend towards cooperation and the politicization of energy policy this report will be updated

successfully reducing its share of petroleum as its primary energy sources from over 70 in 1970 to under 50 in 2004 since the 1973 arab oil embargo japan has increasingly relied on nuclear power generation to reduce its dependence on oil and curb carbon emissions safety concerns have at times shaken the publics confidence in the industry and led to temporary declines in power generation when plants are shut down following accidents despite occasional setbacks however japan remains the thirdlargest user of nuclear energy in the world and depends on nuclear reactors for over one third of its electricity japan has 55 lightwater nuclear power reactors and has plans to build up to 13 more over the next decade japan relies on natural gas for about 14 of its energy consumption importing

savings plans to reduce per capita consumption to lower levels japan has also committed funds to developing solar hydro and other carbonfree environmentally friendly renewable energy sources japanese automakers are leaders in producing hybrid cars which over time are expected to reduce dependency on petroleum japan has dual interest in improving efficiency to enhance its energy security and to meet its own environmental goals particularly emissions targets set under the kyoto protocol the announcement of new national energy strategy in japan in 2006 sets ambitious goals for increasing

the largest and most contentious project thus far has centered on the destination of pipeline originating in an eastern siberian oilfield in the lake baikal region an agreement between russia and china endorsed by presidents putin and hu in may 2003 cleared the way for the pipeline to go from the city of angarsk to daqing chinas flagship oilfield with refining facilities in the industrial northeast the arrangement stalled however after the arrest of russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky chairman of yukos the company that brokered the deal and planned to construct the pipeline in 2005 moscow reversed course and designated the route preferred by japan from the nearby city of taishet to the russian port of nakhodka near vladivostok on the sea of japan and short tanker trip away from japan presently the kremlins position appears to try to satisfy both demands by postponing the decision on the ultimate destination to later date most energy analysts caution that the decision is far from finalized and that significant obstacles remain to realizing any arrangement the nakhodka option is far more expensive and ambitious the pipeline would cover over 2580 miles and cost up to 18 billion according to some estimates compared to the 1400 mile estimated 25 billion that the daqing route would cost 40 but the japanese proposal also offered nearly full financing for the construction and oil exploration largely through the government owned japan bank for international cooperation jbic and russia would own and control the entire length of the pipeline japan is anxious to diversify its suppliers and analysts estimate that if japan imported million barrels day from russia its dependence on the volatile middle east would fall by 101541

supplies from the middle east pass by ship through the strait pass that faces organized piracy and could easily be blocked militarily in the event of confrontation between the united states and china the strait of malacca is one of the most likely flashpoints for military conflict china does not have the naval might to prevent an economic blockade by power like the united states fact that drives its desire to invest in closer energy sources as chinas military modernizes one of its key objectives is likely to be the protection of its sea lanes to the middle east 47 47 see global trends 2020

sources of supply in the middle east given that us alliance partners japan and south korea have been willing to engage countries like iran to secure energy contracts some fear that rising china would be even more assertive in cultivating relationships with us adversaries some scholars have posited that asian nations competition for energy supplies with the west could lead to an eventual middle eastasia nexus in which asian governments become closer politically with the gulf states in order to secure longterm access thereby marginalizing us power 50 other observers have envisioned dire scenarios that could emerge from protracted uschina struggle over oil including an increasingly close chinasaudi arabia relationship that could lay the groundwork for world warlevel conflict 51 other analysts however point to the reported decrease in chinas weapons trade with iran and the fact that china did not side with iraq in the usled invasion in 2003 the current leadership in china places economic development as high priority and many assert that china will not initiate military action based solely on energy resources unless it is seriously threatened52 in addition beijing would likely be reluctant to challenge the united states for access to energy supplies because of its need for american investment and us markets 48 the ethnic russian population of the russian far east is only 7

refining sector has moved toward deregulation but many barriers remain to outside competition 53 similar obstacles to open market competition exist in the power sectors in japan and south korea the united states could seek to reduce these barriers by encouraging its allies to create independent regulatory bodies some specialists suggest that us officials could also work with the japanese and south korean governments in restoring public confidence in nuclear energy by sharing technology and expertise as available to assure safer operation of nuclear reactors some say that collaboration on energy research might also be beneficial in fostering cooperative marketbased approach to energy security in addition to offering the promise of technological breakthroughs that eventually reduce global dependency on oil the department of energy has taken modest steps to enhance energy efficiency cooperation with asian nations including efforts to develop fuel cell technology research and

conflict assertions of military strength or regi onal tension over access to oil supplies could cause price spikes in the global market which would be harmful to us interests as well positive bilateral relationships and overall regional stability might enhance the perception of oil as global commodity as the consumption giant in the region china likely could benefit from us assistance in developing alternatives to oil such as biofuels or coalbased fuels hydrogen and natural gas japan could also be helpful to china in developing energy conservation strategies encouraging japan to include energy efficiency programs as part of its development assistance to china could also serve the us interest 55 in addition some analysts suggest the united states or its allies could consider

if as many analysts believe further globalization of the energy market will reduce the potential for major power conflict and instability strong leadership is essential to coordinate cooperation between actors many feel the united states should take the role of rulesetter and enforcer through economic organizations military cooperation for safe transit of energy resources technical expertise approval of international development assistance and the promotion of common standards and shared infrastructure in their view expanded american engagement can help lead energy security to more open regulated mode instead of actors resorting to oldstyle resource diplomacy 56 some energy specialists have suggested that inviting china to join the international energy agency iea could alleviate many of the concerns of managing chinas surging demand the parisbased agency made up of the 27 industrializ ed countries that comprise the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd including korea and japan is committed to ensuring energy security through cooperative solutions and safeguards such as national strategic stockpiles proponents assert that engaging china in the iea mechanism could help to maintain the stability of world oil prices as well as lessen beijings sense of strategic vulnerability that could ultimately lead to military rivalry providing multilateral

because the current members are defined as being industrialized democracies category which does not include china because of its communist political system others have suggested that the iea could create mechanism specifically for emerging markets that does not demand full membership in the agency but still provides mechanism to mitigate the effects of supply disruptions as well as inclusion in coordinating the release of reserves another approach might be for the iea to sponsor oil stockpiles in regions of concern 58 another multilateral alternative for the us could be one of forming regional energy coordination body some analysts advocate the creation of an asian version of the iea in order to share information transfer conservation technology and coordinate regional strategic stockpiles to reduce the effects of supply disruptions multinational framework could spur concerted efforts to make projects like gas pipelines feasible and beneficial for the region as whole possible coordinating institution is the asian pacific economic cooperation apec forum which has called for cooperation in developing measures to ensure energy security for the region as energy cooperation between northeast asian countries improves strategies to develop the russian far east might energize regional trade and spur economic growth 59 regional approach likely would require considerable us
