uranium enrichment program soon after the agreed framework collapsed north korea expelled internati onal inspectors and withdrew from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt u s intelligence officials claimed pakistan was key supplier of uranium enrichment technology to north korea and some media reports suggested that pakistan had exchanged centrifuge enrichment technology for north korean help in developing longer range missiles us official statements leave little doubt that cooperation occurred but there are significant details missing on the scope of cooperation and the role of pakistans government north korea and pakistan both initially denied that nuclear technology was provided to north korea presiden t musharraf admitted however in 2006 that such technology had been transferred this report describes the nature and evidence of the cooperation between north korea and pakistan in missiles and nuclear weapons the impact of cooperation on thei r weapons of mass destruction wmd programs and on the international nonprolif eration regime it will be updated as events warrant the roots of cooperation are deep north korea and pakistan have been engaged in conventional arms trade for ove r 30 years in the 1980s as north korea began successfully exporting ballistic missiles and tec hnology pakistan began producing highly enriched uranium heu at the khan research laboratory benazir bhuttos 1993 visit to pyongyang seems to have kicked off serious missile cooperation but it is harder to pinpoint the genesis of pakistans nuclear cooperation with north korea by the time pakistan probably needed to pay north korea for its purchases of mediumrange dong missiles in the mid1990s upon which its ghauri missiles are based pakist ans cash reserves were w pakistan could offer north korea route to nuclear weapons using heu that could circumvent the plutoniumfocused 1994 agreed framew ork and be difficult to detect wmd trade between north korea and pakistan raises

rennackweapons of mass destruction trade between north korea and pakistan introduction more than 30 years ago states agreed to control trade related to weapons of mass destruction wmd to complement the agreements comprising the nonproliferation regime supplier controls are not foolproof but many observers believe that national and multilateral export controls can slow deter and make wmd acquisition more difficult or costly for the determined proliferator until political change makes the weapons i rrelevant or longer desirable1 recurrent problem in controlling technol ogy transfers is that key states do not participate in the regimes although they are still targets of supplyside restrictions some proliferating states now are able to reproduce wmd technologies and systems and sell them abroad without formal restrain ts on trade north korea pakistan and india are three such examples in the case of nuclear weapons and missile technology2 when export controls and interdiction fail some us laws impose penalties on countries entities or persons for prolifer ation activities the provisions are varied and extend across the range of foreign assistance aid financing government contracts military sales3 penalties for engaging in enrichment or reprocessing trade were strengthened by the 1976 and 1977 sy mington and glenn amendments to the foreign assistance act now sections 101 and 102 of the arms export control act later penalties were added for nuclear detonations and other provisions established penalties for individuals missile proliferationrelated sanctions were established in the missile technology control act 1990 which added chapter vii to the arms export control act and similar language at section 11b of the export administration act of 1979 in addition

became leading exporter of ballistic missile s beginning in the 1980s according to the central intelligence agency cia north korea attaches high priority to exporting ballistic missiles which is majo

thought of as major exporte r of wmdrelated items it remains to be seen whether the pakistani military andor government was i nvolved at all with khans nuclear deals pakistan has long rejected the npt and tested nuclear weapons in 1998 but is party to the bwc and the cwc nonetheless the us department of defense believes pakistan has the resources and capabilities to support limited bw research and development effort and likely has chemical weapons capability15 pakistan has sought technical assistance in its ballistic missile programs from north korea and china for over decade to some proliferation by states that have newly acquired wmd is inevitable resulting from diffusion of technology insuffi cient political will to enforce controls or demand fueled by perceived threats or the continuing prestige of wmd in the past however technology transfers between countries outside of the control regimes seemed limited by the lack of technical skill and technology or hard currency by the mid1990s however north korea had proven track record in ballistic missiles and pakistan had demonstrated its uranium enrichment capabilities although pakistan apparently was hampered by lack of rd currency it could provide north korea with route to nuclear weapons using high ly enriched uranium heu this route would not only circumvent rth koreas agreed framework with the united states but would also be difficult to detect using satellite imagery north korean enrichment at the time the 1994 agreed framework w ith north korea was negotiated there was concern about but scant evidence of north

would have to say that yes the agreed framework is ss than perfect and there are vulnerabilitiesthe most glaring problem was that we were tryi ng to stop the nuclear weapons program and we focused on the existing weapons program in north korea based upon plutonium but we did not achieve any additional transparency we had new inspection regime and all of us were keenly aware that one could build nuclear weapons not only with the existing facilities but also with new secret ones i was asked in testimony in 1995 and many times privately by senators and congressmen whethe r north korea could cheat i said yes they could and if they did it would probably be in the area of enrichment and the technology would be centrifuge this was common sense many of us had been around the track with other countries that had done exactly this although we could predict it why did we not do something about it because we did not think it was negotiable thats judgment of the negotiating team and the government at the time it was not my personal judgment only we made the best deal we could and we reported that the way to deal with this vulnerability was to monitor north korea just as carefully as we would if we did not have deal through our intelligence capabilities and th intelligence capabilities of our allies we would try to catch them if they cheated and the prog ram we knew about we could monitorpakistan in the late 1980s16 us intelligence sources also believed that technicians employed by leybold ag were involved in transferring equipment and information to north korea one or two such technicians were in north korea in 1989 and another leybold employee reportedly was seen there in 1990 subsidiaries of leybold ag were also involved in exportin g centrifugerelated welding equipment to iraq in the late 1980s17 negotiators of the agreed framework were aware that north koreas npt obligations did not prohibit uranium enrich ment and that the agreed framework did not directly address uranium enrichment18 north korea was bound not to possess plutonium reprocessing or uranium enrich ment facilities by virtue of the 1992 joint declaration of denuclearized korean peninsula bilateral agreement with south korea that called for subsequent meetings the usnorth korean agreed framework required north korea to make progress in implementing the joint declaration but the process languished throughout the 1990s the us government continued to look for signs of enrichment and in 1998 the united states sent team to kumchangni to look for undeclared nuclear activities including uranium enrichment the team conc luded that the site was not nuclearrelated by 1999 according to one former official however there were clear signs of active north korean interest in uranium

mmercial sate llite photos of hagap show tunnel entrances but little else detecting clandestine uranium enrichment is generally considered to be more difficult than detecting clandestine plut onium production for several reasons first satellite imagery is most useful when chan ges can be detected at known facilities or in detecting new facilities reactors and reprocessing facilities used in plutonium production often have lltale signatures shape size features like windows in reprocessing plant connection to water source power plants or connection to an electricity grid environmenta l releases which facilitate remote detection uranium enrichment plants often do not although this varies among the techniques used for example gaseous diffusion enrichment pl ants often are very large and require tremendous amounts of electricity offering some distinguishable features in contrast centrifuge plants can be small emit few environmental signatures and do not require significant amount s of energy to operate pakistani assistance there is currently tailed unclassified information on the assistance pakistan might have offered one media report citing western officials said the aid included complete design package for centrifuge rotor assembly while japanese report stated that pakistan had expor ted actual centrifuge rotors 20003000 to north korea23 the washington post reported

enrichment capability on the one hand acquiring fissile material is to ma ny observers the most difficult part of nuclear weapons acquisition on the other nd north koreas pl utonium production program is longer bound by the agreed framework north korea began operating its 5mw reactor and has claimed to have completed reprocessing the spent fuel in storage although the us has not confirme d this north korea therefore now may be able to augment its current stockpile of 12 weapons worth of plutonium with additional plutonium for about 5 to 6 weapons currently most accounts suggest that rth korea does not have completed enrichment plant in order to produce enough heu for 1 to 2 weapons about 50kg north korea would require cascad of thousands of centrifuges if north korea has the capability to produce its own centrifug rotors or has completed assemblies already producing heu might be considered easier that its other fissile material production options the unofficial us delegation that visited north korea in january reported that the larger reactor under construction at yongbyon was clearly in disrepair the uncla ssified cia 2002 pape r estimated that north korea

evidence that paki stan provided p1 or even p2 centrifuge technology was available at that time28 revelations that libya received nuclear weapons design from foreign source raise concerns about whether north ko rea also received such nuclear wea pons design29 according to media reports the packet of information that libya received on the nuclear weapon included chinese text and stepbystep

north korea since it left the npt in 2003 nonetheless such program may make the north korean arsenal less vulnerable to possible military strikes because centrifuge enrichment fac ilities are hard to

using composite pits or boosted fission techniques although there are indications that they have the technical skill to do so pakistans missile development pakistan according to many observers has two clearly distinct missile development programs the first prog ram is run by the pakistan national development complex pndc in collaboration with the pakistan space and upper atmosphere research

300km in the hatf 2a and to 800km in the hatf 3 despite claims of indigenous development there are ma ny indications that the hatf 1 2 and 3 benefitted from chinese and eur opean assistance some

missile areas in benazir bhuttos second term 1993 to 1996 to include exchanges of scientists and engineers42 if khan piggybacked his nuclear deals onto missile cooperation then he certainly would have

weapons st ate part of this restru cturing apparently included issuing regulations for controlling nuclear exports in june 2000 the pakistani government published an advertisemen t announcing procedur for commercial exports of nuclear material prospec tive exporters would need objection certificate from the pakistan atomic ergy commission which would also have the authority to verify and inspect all prospective nuclear exports according to an article in the pakistan daily dawn the items listed in the advertisement can be in the form of metal alloys chemical compounds or other materials

nonetheless secretary of state powell told abcs this week that president musharraf gave his assurance as he has previously that pakistan is not doing anything of that naturethe past is that past i am more concerned about what is going on now we have new relationship with pakistan51 powell stressed that he has put president musharraf on notice in my conversations with presid ent musharraf i have made clear to him that any any sort of contact between pakistan and rth korea we believe would be improper inappropriate and woul d have consequences52 khans confession in 2004 raises an impor tant question of whether the pakistani government knew of aided or abetted his nuclear assistance to north korea khan has alleged that military officials knew of the transfers but few details have emerged one account states that generals musha rraf karamat and waheed knew of aid to north korea when they were chiefs of the army staff53 pakistani officials have consistently averred that any nuclear t echnology was transferre d on personal basis without the acquiescence or knowledge of the pakistani government54 this could explain why the bush administration thus far has not sought sanctions against pakistan in letter to key senators and member s of congress on march 12 2003 assistant secretary of state for legislative affairs paul kelly wrote that the administration carefully reviewed the facts relating to the possible transfer of nuclear technology from pakistan to north korea and decided that they do not warrant the imposition of sanctions under pplicable us laws ho wever

discuss eliminating its wmdapparently president musharraf sought to dampen rumors that pakistan traded nuclear secrets for missile help by sta ting that whatever we bought from north korea is with money56 evidence of such barter would clearly implicate the pakistani military and government which could complicate us decisions on aid to pakistan and possibly trigger us sanctions one analyst has suggested that pakistans foreign currency reserve crisis in 1996 might have made barter arrangement attractive57 in that year the government was able to avoid defaulting on external debt with help from the international monetary fund and borrowed 500m from domestic banks58 the reserves at that time were 773 million the equivalent of bout three weeks of imports59 the next year visits of north korean and pakistan i officials accelerated althoug h this could be attributed solely to missile cooperation issues for congress north koreas actions alone raise sign ificant policy questions for congress specifically on how to roll back capability that north korea refuses to admit it has however wmd trade between two proliferators raises host of other issues that may be pertinent to congre ss oversight of nonprolifera tion programs and strategy and counterterrorism first leverage is needed from outside the traditional nonproliferation framework ce neither north korea nor pakistan is member of the missile or nuclear control regimes china is an obvious source of leverage because of its longstanding diplomatic military and economic tie s to both countries but the development of new relationshi p between the united states and pakistan based on counterterrorism cooperation may also be source of leverage second this example of secondary prolif eration highlights the critical roles of sanctions interdiction and in telligence nonproliferation sanctions appear to have had little effect on north korea and pakistan while comprehensive sanctions against libya over thirty years appear to have helped libya decide to renounce its wmd60 although intelligence information was used to help alert pakistani officials to khans technology trade interdiction appeared to pl ay secondary role it is not yet clear whether khans forced retirement in 2001 cut off trade in which case intelligence would have played leading role or whether it continued beyond that until inspections in iraq and libyas conf essions made khans position untenablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31900crs16 61 remarks by deputy secretary of state armitage to senate foreign relations committee hearing on north korea february 4 2003 62 when asked at the daily press briefing on december 11 2002 about waiving sanctions against yemen for its receipt of scuds from north korea state department richard boucher said we decided to waive it because of the commitments that they yemen had made and in consideration of their support fo r the war on terrorism he later elaborated that we have done lot of cooperation traini ng exchange of information law enforcement cooperation with the government of yemen nd we want to continue to do that further intelligence information has not been able to locate uranium enrichment facilities in north korea congress may wish to explore in the context of the presidents nonproliferation initiatives outlined on february 11 2004 how to improve these capabilities the example of wmd trade between north korea and pakistan raises particular questions about how to interp ret proliferation threats w ithin the nexus of terrorism and wmd do these developments compromis the security of the united states and its allies because pakistan and north korea are developing new capabilities or because sales of sensitive technologies continue bated and could expand to terrorists since september 2001 the nexu s of proliferation of wmd and terrorism has been called one of the greatest threats to us security although north korea is one of the seven state sponsors of terrori sm some in the admin istration believe that the nexus of terrorism and wmd is not as pronounced in north korea as it has been elsewhere for example in iraq61 others believe however that there is danger of north korea proliferating its nuclear technol ogy pakistan while not state sponsor of terrorism clearly has terrorist activitie s on its soil and potential terrorist access to its nuclear weapons has been par ticular concern since september 11 2001 at that time nonproliferation cerns about pakistan centered on the security of the pakistani nuclear arsenal from terrorists and the activities of pakistani nuclear scientists providing assistance to terrorists or other states the inadvertent leakage of nuclear knowhow appeared to be serious threat although the pakistani government repeatedly has assured the worl d that its nuclear pr ogram is safe there are those who believe this may not be true in the case of trade with north korea it is unclear whether alleged nuclear transf ers occurred with the blessing of the pakistani government or on the personal initiative of scientists some have maintained that pakistan should be able to provide evidence that it provided cash rather than nuclear technology in return for north korean missiles and components that apparently were loaded onto governmentowned c130 aircraft others maintain the united states should press harder for direct access to khan to learn the scope of his activities broader question is whether the bush administration has given higher priority since september 2001 to c ooperation on counterterrorism than to cooperation in nonproliferation for ex ample when north korea shipped scud missiles to yemen in december 2002 north korea was sanctioned while yemen was not sanctioned for receiving them yemen has been actively cooperating with the united states in counterterrorism activities62 when asked if the countries that provided assistance to north korea on the richment program would risk being cut off from us

people may have done years before september 11th or some time before september 11th have changed september 11th changed the world and it changed many nations behaviors along with it and dont read that to be any type of acknowledgment of what may or may not be true but septembe r 11th did change the world63 fleischers statement appears to imply that forgiveness of proliferation that occurred before september 11 2001 is in order because counterterrorism takes precedence over counterproliferation comb ating terrorism nd weapons of mass destruction however are both important objectives for the united states and congress may consider in its oversight ro how we can successfully balance both pakistan is clearly key ally in the global war on terror but the considerable uncertainty about the pakistani governme nts involvement in khans activities particularly with respect to north korea raises questions about its past but also future cooperation in combating the sp read of weapons of mass destruction
