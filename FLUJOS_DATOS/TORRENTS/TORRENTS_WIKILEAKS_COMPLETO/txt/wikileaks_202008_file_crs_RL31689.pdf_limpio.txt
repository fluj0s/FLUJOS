divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31689us international refugee assistance issues for congress summary the united states is the largest national contributor to international humanitarian assistance programs for re fugees traditionally it contributes to refugee appeals both to alleviate the suffering of innocent victims and out of concern that refugee flows can lead to instability in countries or regions important to us foreign policy interests the united states is also the largest resettlement country the money for humanitarian assistance and some of the costs of resettlement in the united states is authorized under the migration and refugee assistance mra account of the department of state authorization bill and appropriated in the foreign operations appropriations bill though not the topic of this report the bulk of assistance for refugees who resettle in the united states is authorized and appropriated in the labor health and human services hhs legislation this report discusses the size of the us in ternational refugee assistance budget and its allocation between humanitarian assistance and admissions with the end of the cold war us refugee policy began to evolve to reflect changes taking place in the international arena the nearly exclusive anticommunist focus began to shift as conflicts among nations moved away from the constraints of superpower politics and toward more complex array of internal disputes these new conditions led to change in the nature of refugee emergencies and in the types of programs that the united states and the international community provide for refugees and other people forced to flee their homes in addition it resulted in tremendous increase in the number of people needing assistance these factors also influenced the continuing debate between the administration and the congress and within the congress about the us role with regard to refugees the mra is part of the foreign ai d appropriation and because humanitarian emergencies are growing in number comp lexity and size it faces enormous budget pressures both from traditional foreig n assistance programs and from newly emerging national priorities while refugee assistance enjoys considerable support congress and the administration face the difficult task of funding humanitarian needs within constrained budget for the last several years with the exception of fy1999 the appropriation for the mra acc ount has remained at about 700 million pl 107115 signed into law on ja nuary 10 2002 appropriated 705 million for the mra and 15 million for the emerge ncy

the united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr to include not only those fleeing across borders refugees but also returned refugees asylum seekers internally displaced persons idps and returned idps idps are individuals uprooted within their c ountry but not necessarily given protection and assistance under humanitarian law unhcr extends assistance to certain groups not protected under the unhcr mandate by grouping them as part of the broader defin ition people of concern 2 this report replaces an earlier crs issue brief ib89150 and will be updated periodicallyus international refugee assistance issues for congress introduction there are over 12 million refugees worldwide included in the total of close to 20 million individuals characterized as people of concern1 the result is continuing increase in costs and expe nditures required to address the problem while the global trend suggests that the numbers of refugees may have stabilized in recent years the ebb and flow of popula tion movements remain largely dependent upon external events and usually require an immediate response two major factors influence us decisions to aid refugees 1 an american bipartisan tradition of humanitarian concern for suffering people and 2 concern that refugee flows can lead to instability in countries important to us foreign policy us assistance takes the form of aid to refugees in their count ries of asylum and admission to the united states for some refugees of special concern the problem for congress is how to respond programmatically to refugee needs in way that satisfi both the american tradition of providing assistance and us budgetary limitations this report examines the problem and the response over time by congress and the executive branch it also considers the role of the international community through the united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr2 background before reviewing the us financial assistance to refugees this report will examine the evolution of the refugee pr oblem worldwide and briefly review the international response to ithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31689crs2 3 see unhcr website for further in formation httpwwwunhcrorg 4 see the 1951 united nations convention relating to the status of refugees under the 1951 convention and the 1967 protocol which followed contracting states agreed to cooperate with unhcr and facilitate its supervisory function 5 the 1967 protocol removes the geographical and time limitations written into the original convention under which mainly europeans involv ed in events occurring before january 1 1951 could apply for refugee statusexpanding needs of refugees worldwide unhcr3 established by the ge neral assembly in 1950 and made operational in 1951 is mandate d by the united nations to lead and coordinate international action for the worldwide prot ection of refugees and the resolution of refugee problems unhcrs initial mission was to help resettle european refugees after world war ii and its mandate reflects this history unhcr became the institutional mechanism for the implement ation of the 1951 convention relating to the status of refugees this convention established the definition of refugee and the organizational tasks nd responsibilities of the inte rnational community toward refugees4 however the definition of refugee was not universal the 1951 convention allowed states to limit the defi nition of refugees to those created by events occurring in europe prior to 1951 when international and intergovern mental refugee organizations were established in the 1950s and 1960s their ma ndates were fairly specific and defined refugees as persons who fled their country in response to persecution on the basis of race religion ethnic or social group or political opinion while refugee situations did not always conform to these definitions they usually could be accommodated within the mandates of the humanitarian relief agencies refugee emergencies usually did not receive worldwide media attention there wa s little news coverage of the hardships faced by refugees in their exile refugee assistance was also provided in relatively safe setting becau humanitarian assistance was given with the agreement of the host government involved in response to subsequent large refug ee movements that increasingly occurred outside of europe the time and geog raphical limits of the 1951 convention were eliminated with the 1967 protocol to which the united states is party5 furthermore the general assembly passed resolutions requesting that unhcr not only help refugees but also provide ssistance to asylum seekers returnees and those displaced within the borders of th eir own countries these many groups make up the people of concern to unhcr the number of refugees in camps around th world increased steadily as result of the conflicts that erupted after the end of the cold war straining the regular budgets of the agencies that assist them but the numbers displaced by warfare or other manmade disasters within the borders of their own countries grew even more these internally displaced persons idps such as those in sierra leone bosnia or chechnya currently outnumber traditional refugeeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31689crs3 6 for example stateless citizens such as t hose from the former soviet union who have not been able to obtain citizenship in any of the former republics are assisted by unhcraccording to unhcr the number of people of concern declined from record 27 million in 1995 to 198 milli on by january 2002 this figure included approximately 12 million refugees pers ons who fled from their country 462700 returnees people returning to their c ountry but not fully resettled 940800 asylum seekers 53 million idps 241000 returned idps and another million others of concern6 unhcr estimates that an additiona l 2025 million may be displaced for political or other reasons from their homes with the majority receiving little or international assistance the number of refugees and displaced persons in africa numbered 20000 in 1989 today there are more than six million refugees idps and returnees in africa much of the increas in numbers of refugees and displaced is blamed on the rise in ethnic conf lict unleashed after the cold war changing circumstances in refugee produc ing countries have also altered the international response and created greater pressure to act increasingly refugee problems are part of longstanding political disagreements within countries rather than between nations resolving them may require the unified action of many governments if not the security c ouncil and raises the sensitive issue of the limits of sovereign governments freedom to repress or harm its own citizens international consensus is difficult and often takes years to achieve in the interim humanitarian suffering and destruction tinues in the affected countries where the underlying issues remain unresolved humanitarian assistance is often the only course which can be agreed upon within the last decade and half new kinds of humanitarian situations have become increasingly common and in fact ma ke up the bulk of international disaster situations in addition the longheld gene rally agreed doctrine that nations should not meddle in the internal affairs of other countries unless invited to do so has begun to be questioned this has placed humanitarian aid workers in increasingly dangerous situations and has led to an increased military role for the united nations and its member states in activities that range from providing security to delivering aid these and other factors have driven up the cost and sometimes reduced the effectiveness of humanitarian assistance the changing nature of refugee situations the typical profile of the refugee situation is quite different today from that of postworld war ii and as result humanitarian needs have changed as well specifically new challenges include from one war to another refugees often flee to areas that are also at war the situation in rwandaburundidemoc ratic republic of congo are current examples refugee and humanitarian aid workers attempting to help these victims of war have themselves become victims of conflict the plight of idps idps are people driven from their homes by warfare but not crossing an internati onal border and thus not beco ming convention refugeeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31689crs4 7 see ambassador richard c holbrooke united states permanent

attention even though their compatriots who fled to another country of ten received humanitarian aid as refugees examples of this situation today are afgha nistan the balkans chechnya sudan and sierra leone one response to the gr owing numbers of people in this type of situation has been broadening of the unhcr activities or area of responsib ility in october 1992 unhcr donor nations appr oved an expansion of the unhcr role to include assistance to the millions of pe ople displaced within their own countries by war andor famine resulting from war this change made unhcr responsible for nearly twice as many needy people almost overnight although in fact the agency had been assisting many of them previously w ith informal donor support in other cases such as the current situations in colombia and afghanistan people are prevented from fleeing warfare because surrounding countries close thei r borders and unhcr and other humanitarian agencies must assist them in extremely difficult and dangerous situations former us am bassador to the united nations richard c holbrook made the plight of idps special concern of his7 both the secretary general and the high commissioner for refugees have also called for increased attention to idps complicating factors exacerbated by war persons in need may be victims of combination of refugee emergency and natural disaster which may be exacerbated by warfare drought in ethiopiaeritrea and afghanistan while warfare continues are current examples other situations include farmers who cannot farm because of warfare or minefields leading to food shortages and lack of livelihood or families unable to maintain sanitation due to lack of water and waste systems posing increased risks to health the needs of these people have been served by the international agencies that respond to natural disasters by the refugee relief agencies as well as by the humanitari an agencies such as the international committee of the red cross icrc which respond to civil conflict situations to address problems of program overlap among the international agencies and the lack of clear mandate by any one agency to help the united nations secretary general kofi annan in december 1991 created the department of humanitarian affairs although it was somewhat successful in c oordinating the intern ational response to all disasters either manmade or na tural annan abo lished it under his 1997 reorganization plan and established instead emergency relief coordinator in the office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs ocha thereby raising the level of attention paid to humanitarian assistance seeking assistance in failed states humanitarian emergencies occurring in countries without functioning government make it difficult for relief agencies to get assistance to victims of civil war in these situations issues such as visas shipping clearance us of roads and airport fac ilities water and power cannot be addressed centrally nor can

and military roles in humanitarian assistance increasingly the roles of humanitarian ag encies overlap with military assistance as in kosovo in 1999 former unhcr high commissioner og ata expressed concern over attempts to bypass humanitarian agencies in high visibility crises instead using military or other newlycreated governmental entities she noted that military involvement has sometimes undermined c oordination among civilian human itarian agencies and may create the perception in the eyes of the comb atants that refugees are parties to the conflict12 secretary general annan has also cautioned against mixing military and humanitarian actions he stressed that government should fear that accepting humanitarian aid will lead to military intervention13 the use of military forces in humanitarian assistance emergencies raises other thorny issues such as how much force should be used and whom or what they should protect refugees humanitarian aid workers or pallets of aid supplies14 addressing the causes of refugee flight the causes of refugee flight are varied but generally involve violation of the human rights of certain people and their persecution based on race religion nationality membership in particular social group or political opinion however many believe the underlying cau of refugee flight is mo re basic conflict poverty underdevelopment overpopulation and nvironmental degradation there is widespread agreement that prevention is the best way to address refugee flows president clinton created the new position of under secretary for global affairs to allow the department of state to focus more attention on the underlying causes of refugee flight the clinton administration also reorganized the bureau of refugee programs to include population and mig ration in order to consolidate all departmental responsibility for these rela ted matters the office of transition initiatives oti was also created as part of reorganized usaid humanitarian

environment attempts to drive refugees from the camps by various factions periods of prohibited contact with the aid agencies and the need to return many of them quickly to rwanda all contributed to required unhcr need for 114 million for repatriation and reintegration of refugees to rwanda alone for 1997 this amount did not include the many millions more that were spent by other agencies such as united nations development program undp united nations childrens fund unicef and the world hea lth organization who for activities to rehabilitate both the nations and the people who had been victims of war international response there are many international actors i nvolved in addressing the worldwide problems presented by refugees and idps these include the united nations other international organizations ios interg overnmental agencies ngos and private or religious groups pvos two internationa l agencies of particular importance in dealing with international refugees are the unhcr and the united nations relief and works agency for palestine refugees in the near east unrwa the role of unhcr unhcr has three main functions first it provides legal protection to those who fall within its mandate governments tablish procedures to determine who is refugee and his or her rights in accord ance with their own legal systems unhcr offers advice and nonbinding guidelines to these governments in countries which are not party to international refugee treaties but request unhcr assistance unhcr may determine refugee status and offer its own protection and assistance the core rights accorded to refugees are acceptance of asylum seekers at the border nonforced repatriation nonrefoulement protection of their safety access to fair and efficient procedures for termination of refugee status the same rights and basic help provided any other foreigner who is legal resident and appropriate lasting solutions concerning their status second unhcr seeks permanent solutions to refugee situations in general there are three solutions for refugees 1 voluntary repatriation 2 local integration in the country of first asylum and 3 rese ttlement from the country of first asylum to third country unhcr prefers voluntary re patriation whereby refugees return to their home countries if repatriation is impossible the unhcr seeks to locally integrate the refugees and if this is impossi ble then seeks to resettle the refugees in third country refugees and idps returning home are also assisted by unhcr these repatriations often require followon rehabilitation of agricultural land and infrastructure to ensure that the refugees can survive in homelands devastated by war although in the long run repatriation is th best and least expensive solution in the short run it is often more expensive and dangerous than maintaining refugees in camps additional complications ma make the expense even higher15 in many recent cases unhcr has been urged to repatr iate refugees in short period of time so that they can participate in elections in their homeland at the same time refugeeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31689crs8 16 the unrwa was established by united na tions general
