from joseph alcamo alcamousfunikasselde to mhulmeueaacuk robswartrivmnl subject timing distribution of the statement date thu 9 oct 1997 185233 0100 replyto alcamousfunikasselde mike rob sounds like you guys have been busy doing good things for the cause i would like to weigh in on two important questions distribution for endorsements i am very strongly in favor of as wide and rapid distribution as possible for endorsements i think the only thing that counts is numbers the media is going to say 1000 scientists signed or 1500 signed one is going to check if it is 600 with phds versus 2000 without they will mention the prominent ones but that is different story conclusion forget the screening forget asking them about their last publication most will ignore you get those names timing i feel strongly that the week of 24 november is too late 1 we wanted to announce the statement in the period when there was sag in related news but in the week before kyoto we should expect that we will have to crowd out many other articles about climate 2 if the statement comes out just few days before kyoto i am afraid that the delegates who we want to influence will not have any time to pay attention to it we should give them few weeks to hear about it 3 if greenpeace is having an event the week before we should have it week before them so that they and other ngos can further spread the word about the statement on the other hand it wouldnt be so bad to release the statement in the same week but on diffeent day the media might enjoy hearing the message from two very different directions conclusion i suggest the week of 10 november or the week of 17 november at the latest mike i have organized email list that could begin to compete with the list you can get from the dutch but i am still willing to send you what i have if you wish best wishes joe alcamo prof dr joseph alcamo director center for environmental systems research university of kassel kurt wolters strasse 3 d34109 kassel germany phone 49 561 804 3898 fax 49 561 804 3176
