alone does not establish an basis for preferring more or less equal distribution of income nonethele ss common aim of policy is promoting equality of pportunity an extremely unequal distribution of income may be considered an indication of lack of qual opportunity argume nts for more equal distribution of income than that which w ould result from market forces are based on number of propositions one is comm on assumption made in economic analysis known as diminishing marginal utility of income this is the notion that each additional dollar of income yields less utility or satisfaction if the assumption of diminishing marginal utility of income is accepted then in theory it should be possible to increase the overall wellbeing utility of society by taking some from those with high incomes and giving it to those with low incomes second non economic justification for policies designed to make the income distribution more equal is concern that society prevent its members from falling below some minimum standard of living existing measures of income fall well short of an ideal that would accurately indicate how well off individuals or househol ds are not all kinds of income are counted taking the existing measures at face value however several observations can be made first the distribution of income in the united states has become increasingly unequal since the late 1960s second the us inco distribution is the most unequal of all majo r industrialized countries some of the greater income equality found in other major industrialized countries may be due to the fact that government transfers are mo re directly targeted at lower income households the distribution of earnings is more unequal than is the distribution of household income of particul ar interest is that the gap in earnings between highly educated or skilled workers and less skilled workers has grown substantially explanations focusing on world trade and national demographics have been suggested but the one most widely accepted is that technological advances in recent years have increased the demand for more highly skilled labor relative to its supply policies that boost the supply of skilled wo rkers would thus seem likely to narrow that gap and act as an equalizing influence on the income distribution but the large gap in pay between skilled and unskilled workers that has developed would itself seem to be substantial incentive for pros pective and current workers to expand their education and training this report will be updated as developments

international comparisons although an economic expansion be gan in november 2001 and productivity growth has been relatively rapid since then there is concern that wages have not kept pace with overall economic growth and that business owners ve profited at the expense of workers1 there is shortage of anecdotal evidence regarding workers who are losing ground in spite of growing economy at times when the benefits of economic growth do not seem to be shar ed by all there tends not unexpectedly to be an increased focus on how much disparity in living standards there is across the population now that the economy seems to be somewhat less vigorous those concerns are amplified there are number of legislative issues for which the shape of the income distribution may be an important consider ation among them are tax rates and the minimum wage this report examines the distribution of income in the united states including factors that may help explain it how it has changed over time and how it compares with those of other countries evaluating distributions economic theory does not establish basi s for preferring any particular degree of equality in the distribution of income in theory at least with respect to labor income what matters is that the distribution result from efficient markets where final demand for goods and services and the re lative productivity of the firms producing those goods and services determine the demand for labor in each sector of the economy and the earnings of each of those jobs the shape of the income distribution is also function of labor supply the willingness of workers to take jobs depends on the pay as well as relative preferences for labor and leisure the ability of workers to command given wage is also direct function of their educational attainment and skill level their human capital changes in the age distribution can also affect the income distribution as workers tend to earn more as they get older but even in an economically ideal wo rld where the income distribution was solely attributable to the workings of efficient markets there may still be moral ethical or philosophical reasons for preferring an alternative outcomehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32639crs2 2 see n gregory mankiw principles of economics fort worth texas the dryden press 1998 3 for complete explanation of what is incl uded in money income see us department of commerce us census bureau current population repor ts consumer income p60231 august 2006 appendix aarguments for more equal distribution of income than that which results from market forces are based on number of propositions2 one is founded on common assumption made in economic analysis known as diminishing marginal utility of income this refers to the idea that each dditional dollar of income yields less and less satisfaction in ec onomic jargon utility than the first put another way this proposition presumes that one additional dollar of income means less to someone making 100000 than it does to someone making 20000 if the assumption of diminishing margin utility of income is accepted then in theory it should be possible to increase the overall wellbeing utility of society by taking money from those with high incomes and giving it to those with low incomes the difficulty with that proposition is that doing so may have economic costs that offset part if not all of any gain in overall utility second justification for policies design ed to make the income distribution more equal is concern that society prevent its members from falling below some minimum standard of living this may be due to pure altruism or the sense that luck has something to do with ones place in th income distribution or the belief that when more people have stake in society the more tranquil it will be raising the minimum standard of living may thus serve as kind of insurance finally common aim of policy is promoting equality of opportunity an extremely unequal distribution of income may be considered an indication of lack of equal opportunity beyond these considerations economics has little to say bout the desirability of any particular income distribution but economists have developed ways to measure changes in the distribution and have searched for causes of variations in the distribution over time measuring income as is the case with any number of economic statistics income data have limitations the census bureau in an nnual survey collects data from sample based on the concept of money income money income accounts for wide range of income sources but it is unavoidably in complete money income includes income from earnings interest and dividends soci security and other forms of social insurance it does not include the value of nonmoney benefits such as food stamps or housing subsidies neither does it include capital gains3 with respect to the distribution of overall economic wellbeing limited measure such as money income may be misl eading for example consider the casehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32639crs3 where two families are in every way equal in terms of wealth and income neither owns their home but they both have substa ntial savings in interest earning assets suppose one family takes funds that are earning interest and uses them to buy their home one would argue that that family is now worse off but the existing measures of money income would indicate that to be the case in fact the family that buys its home is earning an implicit income in the use of the house just as they would earn rental income if they rented it to th other family in the example not counting this implicit income in existing measures may have significant effect on the shape of the income distribution if homeowner ship rates change over time or the share of assets invested in owneroccupied hous ing changes and those changes affect one part of the distribution more than another then existing data concerning changes in the shape of the distribution of income would be misleading existing measures of income also ignore th value of leisure thus in the case of two individuals whose measured incomes differ only because one of them works longer hours the difference in their inco mes may overstate the difference in their economic wellbeing because the one who is working longer hours is sacrificing leisure time another weakness in existing measures of income is that they do not account for the implicit income yielded by hom emakers or other work done at home consider two different ma rriedcouple households with the same income and both husband and wife are working if in one of the households the husband quits his job to stay at home and raise children that household will experience drop in money income but the work done at home is not without value and the measured difference in the incomes of the two househol ds will overstate the difference in living standards between the two households the time period in which income is measured may also affect comparisons in the economic wellbeing of di fferent households over the course of the business cycle unemployment rises and falls and so do incomes some households may tend to be more affected than others by these cycles and so the stage of the business cycle can have significant effect on relative incomes similarly individuals incomes generally vary substantially over the course of their lifetimes new entrants to the labor force typically have lower incomes than those who have been working for some time after retirement income tends to drop off because of changes in income associated with this life cycle the demographic mix of the population can have major infl uence on measures of income disparity if it is concern about living standards that prompts interest in the distribution of income then changes in wealth eg the va lue of real estate or other components of net worth might also be ta ken into account that too would be difficult because it would involve not just measuring actual chan ges but distinguishing transitory from permanent changes in wealth over short periods of time another difficulty in comparing incomes is deciding what is the relevant population in the case of labor inco the distribution of income among individuals or among workers may be of mo st interest but when it comes to overall living standards it may be more appropriate to consider the distribution of incomehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32639crs4 4 there is official definition of the m iddle class for further discussion see crs report rs22627 who are the middle class by brian w cashellamong households most households can be presumed to pool resources and enjoy some economies of scale in other words because some costs of living are fixed family of four may not need twice as much income as married couple for each family member to enjoy roughly the same living standard that adds another complication in comparing incomes for households of different sizes measuring inequality for the sake of simplicity and clarity one way the census bureau publishes income distribution data is by quintile the population is ordered from lowest to highest income and then divided into five groups of equal size the income within each group is summed and then compared to the total income of the population if income were all equally di vided and every household had the same income then each quintile would account for 20 of total income to the extent that each quintile falls short of or exceeds 20 share it is an indication of the degree of inequality in the distribution table 1 presents data on the share of total household money income accounted for by each quintile as well as for the t op 5 since 1967 the figures indicate that the bottom fifth accounts for much less than the onefifth of total income it would get if the distribution were perfectly equal while the top 20 accounts for more than twice what it would get in an equal dist ribution the top 5 accounts for more than four times the 5 share it would get if the distribution were perfectly equal there are also several trends evident at the two ends of the distribution between 1967 and the late 1970s the bottom fifth experienced slight increase in its income share while the share accruing to the top 5 of households in the distribution fell since 1980 however the share accruing to the bottom fifth has fallen and the shares accounted for by both the top 20 and the top 5 have risen between 1967 and 2007 the share of income accounted for by the three middle quintiles fell from 523 to 4694httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32639crs5 table 1 distribution of household income by quintile percentage share of total household income bottom second third fourth fifth top 5

relative degr ee of inequality in the distribution of income is the gini index also known as th index of income concentration the gini index is single number which can range betw een zero and one it is an index and therefore is not expressed in terms of any particular unit of m easurement but it does allow comparisons between and among distri butions they can be distributions from two different populations or of the same population at diffe rent points in time thus it can show if one distribution is more or ss equal than another and if there is any tendency for one distribution to become more or less equal over time to illustrate how the gini index is calculated figure 1 shows the distribution of household income for both 1967 and 2007 the horizontal axis represents the cumulative share of households beginning at the low end of the distribution and working up to the household with the highes t income the vertical axis represents the cumulative share of income accounted for by those householdshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32639crs6 source us department of commerce us census bureau the curved lines in figure 1 represent actual distributions of household income these are also known as lorenz curves the straight diagonal line depicts the distribution if it were perfec tly equal in other words if each household had the same income eg with 100 households each hous ehold would account for 1 of total household income the more equal the act ual distribution is the closer the line is to the hypothetical diagonal the gini index is ratio of the area between the diagonal and the line representing the actual distribution and the total area under the diagonal the closer the actual distribution is to the hypotheti cal equal distribution the smaller the area will be between the two lines if the act ual distribution and the diagonal coincide then the gini is zero indicating perfectly equal distribution of income in that case each household would have identical incomes at the other extreme consider distribution where all income accrued to single household in that case the actual curve would lie on the edge of the graph and the gini index would be one an increasing gini inde x number indicates an increasingly unequal distribution when comparing any two distributions the one described by higher gini index numbe r is the more unequal between 1967 and 2007 the actual distribution moved furthe r away from the hypothetical equal distribution and the gini index rose indi cating that the distribution of household income has become more unequal figure 2 plots the gini

federal reserve bank of richmond spring 2008source us department of commerce us census bureau as the chart shows since the late 1960s the trend has been one of almost steadily increasing household income inequa lity although the index fell slightly in 2007 it still indicates distribution that is much more unequal than it has been for most of the 40 years the data have been collected in addition to the gini index there are other summary measures that describe changes in the income distribution among those measures are ratios of incomes at different points in the distri bution for example the ratio of the income of those at the 90th percentile in the distribution to that of those in the 10th percentile gives estimate of the overall inequality in distribution s imilarly the ratio of the median income level 50th percentile to the 10th percentile income level and the ratio of the 90th percentile income level to the median income can be computed changes in those ratios may indicate whether change the degree of inequality is due to changes at the top or at the bottom of the distribution economists at the federal reserve bank of richmond examined changes in those ratios to shed some light on changes in the distribution5 they found that between 1961 and 2002 75 of the increase in the 9010 income ratio was accounted for by the increase in the 9050 in come ratio in other words changes in the upper half of the income distribution accounted for most of the overall increase in inequality the authors also examined changes in the distribution of the top 10 of the distribution they found that between 1961 and 2003 the share of labor income accruing to the top 10 rose from 27 to 37 more than 60 of that038039040041042043044045046047048 1967 1971 1975 1979 1983 1987 1991 1995

international comparisons of income distributions in addition to tracking changes in inequality over time international comparisons of the distributions of in come may also put current measures in perspective but just as available meas ures of income in the united states differ from the ideal measures of income in diffe rent countries also differ from each other fortunately there is source for comparable data that allows international comparisons of income inequality the luxembourg income study lis proj ect has assembled survey data from large number of different countries st atistical programs on social and economic indicators6 among those statistics availa ble are data on household income although there are differences in individua l definitions of income across countries these data can be adjusted so that they re flect more consistent measure of income in making these adjustments to get to common measure of income however the definition of income had to be limited in limiting what is counted as income the actual measures that allow crosscountry comparisons are in some cases more removed from the ideal measure th an they might otherwise be the lis uses measure of aftertax hous ehold money income as its standard7 this necessarily excludes the imputed va lues for owneroccupied housing and unpaid homework it does include some near cash subsidies such as food stamps housing subsidies and certain scholarships income is also measured net of income and payroll taxes but not of sale s value added and other indi rect taxes that may make the distributions seem more equal in those countries that rely heavily on income taxes which tend to be progressive the standard of living afforded to household by given amount of income is also affected by the size of the household an adjustment is made to these household income data to reflect the fact that the income must be divided among the members of the household the lis study assumes th at there are some economies of scale and that each additional member of househol d requires slightly smaller amount of income to maintain the overall st andard of living of the household the lis reports data allowing

other countries smeeding and rainwater analyzed income at different points in the distributions and made adjustments for differences in the purch asing power of the different currencies10 they found that people in the upper half of the distribution in the united states enjoyed living standards far above their count erparts in other industrialized countries however those near the bottom at the 10th percentile in the us distribution were not as well off as those at the same point in the distribution in the other countries examined explaining international differences what explains these international differences in income distributions the reasons fall into three categories first many other countries devote much larger share of their national output to income tran sfers which have an equalizing effect on the distribution second these data are based on income af ter taxes and tax rates in these countries vary with respect to progre ssivity and thus have different effects on the equality of the distribution of after tax income third equality in the distribution of earnings which account for about 70 of house hold income in the studies using lis data varies s ubstantially as well for those countries for which data are av ailable there is strong correlation between income shares at the lower end of the distribution and the share of gdp accounted for by transfer payments11 the evidence suggests however that for both the united states and britain given the am ount of money that is transferred those at the low end of the distribution do not bene fit as much as they do in other countries although taking into account taxes nd transfers may affect crosscountry comparisons of income inequality for earround full time workers the united states also exhibits relatively greater inequality in the distribution of earnings httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32639crs11 12 see gottschalk and smeeding crossnational comparisons of earnings and income inequality journal of economic literature vol xxxv june 1997 13 mariacristina nardi liqian ren and chao wei income inequality and redistribution in five countries federal reserve bank of chicago economic perspectives second quarter 2000 vol xxiv issue 2one explanation for the greater equality in earnings distributions abroad is that wagesetting tends to be more centralized in many other countries than it is in the united states there are two reasons for th is first in the private sector union membership may be higher and in some cases there is considerable share of the labor force that is affected by union agreements whether they are union members or not second in number of these countri the public sector also accounts for greater share of employment than in the united states and that serves as an equalizing force12 study published by the chicago federal reserve bank examined income inequality in five countri the united states canada germany sweden and finland13 the study found that after taxes nd transfer payments the us income distribution was the most unequal of th five followed by canada germany finland and sweden of those countries germany did relatively little to redistribute income either through taxes or transfers but it had the most equal distribution of labor income sweden and finland reduced income inequality through combination of relatively high tax rates and high levels of transfer paymen ts canada and the united states reduced income inequality with similar combinations of progressive income taxes and transfer payments to the extent that greater equality in the income distribution is result of deliberate policy and not the result of market forces that equality may not have been achieved without some cost assuming that these costs are appreciated they may reflect varying degrees of willingness in di fferent countries to tolerate inequality in the distribution of income explaining recent trends most industrialized countries have and certainly the united states has experienced an increase in the degree of inequality in the distribution of income more specifically most countries have ex perienced an increase in the inequality of earnings those studies that focus more narrowly on wages have come to similar conclusions two explanations are often cited for the trend toward greater inequality the first has to do with trade liberalization globalization and the second has to do with technological progress with regard to trade liberalization the ar gument is that because of reduced trade restrictions and an increasing volume of trade less skilled us workers have become more vulnerable to direct competition from lower paid workers in other countries thus the production of goods that require lessskilled workers has shifted overseashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32639crs12 14 see

policy association continuedand the domestic demand for lessskilled workers has declined here the reduced demand for lessskilled workers in manufacturing here has pl aced downward pressure on their wages and therefore tended to increase the earnings gap between skilled and unskilled workers whether that is the case is not completely settled but the hypothesis has not been accepted by most economists althoug h theoretically sound the argument has not yet been supported by compelling empiri cal evidence for one thing the wage gap between skilled and unskilled workers has grown both in t hose industries that tend to compete in world markets as well as those that are generally less affected by international trade another reason ec onomists have not found the trade argument convincing is that the number of jobs affected by the increas in trade is not sufficient to explain the magnitude of the earnings gap economy wide14 the argument that changes in technol ogy have affected the distribution of earnings has been more persuasive among many economists the most often cited evidence for such an effect is the rapid growth in the wage premium paid to more highly skilled or educated workers that began in 1979 in 1979 men with bachelors degrees earned 50 more than did those w ith high school education for women the college premium in 1979 was 41 in 2007 the advantage of college education was significantly higher with collegee ducated men and women earning 92 and 78 more respectively than those with high school education further that increased advantage coincided with sign ificant increase in the proportion of the labor force that was college educated from 164 of adults in 1979 to 31 in 2005 according to the census bureau even t hough the supply of more highly educated workers was rising it was apparently not rising fast enough to keep up with increasing demand15 one theory behind these numbers is that technological changes over the past 20 years have not affected ll jobs equally the argument is that the kinds of technological advances that have occurred since the late 1970s have been biased in favor of those jobs that require high er levels of trai ning and education not all advances require more educated workers to exploit them retail clerks may longer need to be as proficient at math and some assembly line jobs may have become simpler and more repetitive but the evidence shows that demand for more highly educated workers has increased substantially further those who use computers in their work have experienced relatively larger wage gains than have other occupations the wage gap between less and more highly educated workers has also been found to be correlated with rising outlays on research and development16httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32639crs13 16 continued vol xix 23 see also us depart ment of commerce u s census bureau money income in the united states 1998 p60206 september 1999 17 david

expl aining increased income inequality has gained wide acceptance among economists autor levy and murnane published study suggesting that technological progress affected the equality of the earnings distribution in two ways17 first information technology it served as substitute for lowskill workers reducing demand for their labor second it served as complement to educated and relatively highskilled workers increasing demand for their services both factors appear to have contributed to an increase in inequality in the distribution of earnings some trends in the labor market do not easily fit in the skillbiased technological change hypothesis card and dinardo examined the data to see how well events agreed with the implications of skillbiased change18 they found number of contradictions for example the biased change hypothesis would seem to predict that groups that typically have lower skills would have experienced relatively slower wage growth card and dinardo argue that although women nd to be less skilled on average than men and that nonwhite wo rkers tend to be less skilled than white workers those two groups did not experien ce slower wage growth and the wage gaps between groups did not widen as the theory might have predicted the authors also found that the wages of colle ge graduates with degrees in the humanities grew more rapidly than the wages of graduates w ith degrees in engineering or science study published by the federal reserv bank of minneapolis examined the changing distribution of earnings since 196119 eckstein and nagypál found that for men there was substantial increase in the inequality of the earnings distribution beginning in the mid1970s between 1973 nd 1995 the real earnings of men in the bottom 25 of the earnings distribution fell over that same period the real earnings of men in the top 25 of the distribution made significant gains they also found that beginning in 1995 the year productivity growth picked up

quintile the 20 with the highest incomes in the income distribution experienced income growth equal to the growth rate of productivity between 1995 and 2005 the author s found even the top quintile in the distribution experienced income growth below the rate of productivity increase they point out that limitations of the survey on which those data are based make it difficult to identify trends at the upper end of the income distribution dewbecker and gordon examined the re lationship between labor income and productivity and concluded th at the benefits of produc tivity growth have been unequally distributed21 dewbecker and gordon looked at internal revenue service irs income data from 1966 to 2001 they concluded that over that entire period only the top 10 of the distribution experi enced income gains equal to or greater than the overall rate of produc tivity growth further they found that the top 1 of the distribution accounted for 216 of the income gains for that period and for 213 of the gains between 1997 and 2001 after pr oductivity growth had accelerated finally they found that the top 01 of the distribution r eceived as much of the real rise in earning s as the bottom 50 between 1997 and 200122 the authors suggest that some of this is ma be due to the expansion of opportunities available to economic superstars such as sports stars and other top celebrities because of technologies such as cable television and the internet although the effects of trade liberalizati on and technological growth are the two most often discussed factors which might explain the increase in inequality there are other factors at work in the changing shape of the household income distribution shifting demographic factors have also played role one of the most important shifts has been the large rise in the labor force participation of women specifically there has been substantial increase in the number of households with working wives in 1970 just over half of all married mothers had some work experience during the year in 2005 that proportion had risen to 66 the share of married mothers who worked full time rose from 16 to 47 over the same period23 in those families with working wives their contribution to family income has been growing24 traditionally wives earnings tend not to be highly correlated withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32639crs15 24 continued review august 1993 25 peter gottschalk and timothy smeeding crossnational comparisons of earnings and income inequality journal of economic literature vol xxxv june 1997 26 interestingly there is fairly low corre lation between wealth and income which may largely be due to the fall in income that typically follows retirement 27 gary burtless has widening inequality promoted or retarded us growth canadian public policy analyse politiques vol xxix supplemen tnuméro spécial 2003their husbands earnings part of which is due to the negative correlation between husbands earnings and wives labor force participation thus the distribution of husbands earnings has been less equal than is the distribution of total household earnings however wives earnings have in recent years become more highly correlated with their husbands earnings cons equently that has been factor in the rising inequality in the distribution of household income25 changes in the distribution of wealth ma have also had an effect on the income distribution over time the distribution of household wealth is more unequal than is the distribution of either earnings or total income26 an analysis by burtless attempted to identify the proximate causes of the increase in inequality by controlling for both changes in earnings inequality and changes in the composition of households he was able to estimate how much of the change in inequality each variab accounted for between 1979 and 199627 of the total increase in us personal income inequality bu rtless found that 28 was accounted for by increased inequality in mens earnings and 5 by increased inequality in womens earnings the changing composition of households also played role between 1979 and 1996 there was an increase in the correlation between husband and wife earnings and that contributed an estimated 13 to the overall increase in inequality this is the result of surge in womens employment and the general tendency of married couples to have similar educational backgrounds and earnings potential the increase in correlation resulted in rise in the share of income accruing to households in the upper income classes at the same time there was decline in the percentage of husbandwife households income is more unequally di stributed among single adult households than it is among marriedcouple households burtless estimated that this shift accounted for 21 of the increase in inequality between 1979 and 1996 thus changes in the composition of households accounted for third of the overall increase in inequality conclusions and policy considerations existing measures of income fall well short of the theoretical ideal that would indicate how well off individuals or househol ds are not all kinds of income arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32639crs16 counted and thus the distribution of hous eholds assets may ffect ones apparent position in the income distribution taking the existing measures at face value however several observations can be made first the distribution of income in the united states has become increasingly unequal since the late 1960s second the us income distribution is more unequally distributed than is the case for large selection of other industrialized countries the distribution of earnings is more unequal than is the distribution of household income of particul ar interest is that the gap in earnings between highly educated or skilled workers and less skilled workers has grown substantially several explanations have been offered but the one most widely accepted is that technological advances in recent years ve increased the demand for more highly skilled labor relative to its s upply policies that boosted the supply of skilled workers would thus seem likely to narrow that gap and act as an equalizing influence on the income distribution given the large gap in pay between skilled and unskilled workers that has developed it might seem there is little need for additional incentives for prospective and current workers to continue their education and training any additional incentive would likely pale in comparison to lifetime of higher earnings assuming workers understand these relationships th at is one reason some have advocated doing more to improve the ducation of the very young in many cases there may be costs associated with policies designed to reduce income inequality changes in tax rates subsidies for the unemployed or other transfers for lowincome households may so have undesirable effects in the labor market and discourage some from taking jobs some of the greater income equality found in other countries however may be due to the fact that existing transfers are more directly targeted at lower income households redirecting tr ansfer payments from middle to lower class households could increase equality in the distributi on without an increase in the amount of income being redistributed
