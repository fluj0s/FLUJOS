negotiated the basic provisions of tpa were estab lished in the trade act of 1974 pl 93618 for limited period of time those provisions were renewed peri odically most recently under the trade act of 2002 under tpa cong ress provides that if trade agreement is reached by given deadline it will cons ider legislation to implement the trade agreement under expedited procedures that prohibit amendments limit debate and set deadlines on congressional action as c ondition for these procedural restraints congress requires the president to consult with appropriate cong ressional bodies before and during the negotiations tify congress before beginning any negotiations and before entering into trade agreement provide re ports as specified and meet other conditions as provided1 congress also places restrictions on the purpose of trade agreement and on language in an implementing bill through these provisions congress sets trade negotiating objectives and is informed of progress in the

long as two conditions were met first the president had to re quest the twoyear extension by april 1 2005 together with the request the president was required to submit 1 description of all major trade agreements that have been ne gotiated and might be considered under tpa and the anticipated schedule for submitting those agreements for congressional approval 2 description of progress in negotiations to achieve th purposes and objectives that congress approved in the title and statement that this progress justifies continuation of negotiations and 3 statement of the reasons why the extension is needed to complete the negotiations in effect these provisions would require the president to justify how he had used tpa until then and to describe how he might use it over the next two years on march 30 2005 the president submitted report of approximately 260 pages that contains the request for tpa extension3 the report provided an overview of the administrations trade policy and

to be referred in the house of representatives to the committees on ways and means and on rules although there is provision on committee referral in the senate the prescribed procedure appears to

of extension disapproval resolutions the act however provided that it was not in order for 1 the senate to consider an extension disapproval resolution not reported by the committee on finance 2 the house of representatives to consider any extension disapproval resolution not reported by the committees on ways and means and on rules or 3 either house of the congress to consider an extension disapproval resoluti on after june 30 2005 given these provisions the committees could take various actions on disapproval resolution committee could vote to adopt motion to report disapproval resolution favorably or unfavorably see next section for committee action on extension disapproval resolutions in 1991 in such cases the resolu tion could be brought to the floor also committee could vote down motion to report or simply not take up the resolution at all in these cases resolution would be stopped in committee on april 6 2005 senator byr on dorgan introduced extension disapproval

nd competitiveness act of 1988 pl 100418 congress approved fasttrack authority for trad agreements entered into before june 1 1991 and provided for twoyear extension the provisions in the 1988 act were almost identical to those in the 2002 act in 1988 the twoyear extension was principally intended to allow more time for the ongoing multilateral trade negotiations uruguay round in the world trade organization wto by the time thenpresident george h w bush requested the twoyear extensi on however he had notified congress of his intent to negotiate north american free trade agreement nafta that agreement not the wto negotiations became the center of the debate on the twoyear extension8 the debate was also influenced by the political situation at the time the president wasa republican and both houses of congress we re controlled by th democratic party the president requested the twoyear extension on march 1 1991 9 disapproval resolutions were introduced in the house h res 101 on ma rch 6 1991 and in the senate sres 78 on march 13 1991 on march 7 1991 the chairmen of the senate finance committee and of the house ways and means committee sent letter to the president saying that the president should address some concerns about environmental standards worker rights and similar issues before congress voted on extension of fast track procedures the house majority leader sent letter to the president with similar intent on march 27 1991 on may 1 1991 the president responded with an extensive action plan that addressed the concerns raised on may 9 1991 the house majority leader introduced resolution hres 146 th at the president be accountable in meeting the action plan and other objectives on may 23 1991 the house defeated its disapproval resolution by vote of 192 231 but approved hres 146 by vote of 3288510 the next day the senate defeated its disapproval resolution by vote of 365911 these actions indicated that while congress did not want to prevent the twoyear extension it planned to closely monitor the negotiations partic ularly with respect to naftahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22102crs5 implications for us trade policy and negotiations to understand the implications of the i ssue of tpa renewal for us trade negotiations it might be helpful to look at the reason why expedited procedures for implementing bills were approved in the first place during multilatera l negotiations in the 1960s the kennedy round the adminis tration negotiated two nontariff trade agreements without explicit authority from c ongress the prevailing view in congress was that the president had overstepped his delegated tariffcutting power in negotiating these nontariff trade agreements and cong ress decided not to enact legislation to implement the two nontariff trade agreements this result showed that the two branches of government would have to be more collaborative if trade agreements in the future were to be negotiated and brought before congress with any likelihood of approval the compromise reached in the 1974 trade act was that congress would guarantee an upor down vote without amendment as long as the president consulted with congress and followed its directives in the negotiations central question in considering extension of tpa is whether or not trade policy that promotes the negotiation and approval of trade agreements is in the national interest supporters of trade agreements argue that the agreements offer opportunities for us exporters in markets that otherwise would be closed to them and provide consumers with wider selection of lowcost products they also state that trade agreements increase the level of trade which helps the national economy to grow opponents of trade agreements argue that the agreements are often biased toward the business community and do not give enough consideration to other important objectives such as saving workers jobs or protecting the environment some opponents believe that certain trade restrictions should be left in place to protect domestic industries another question is if congress decides th at negotiation of trade agreements should be part of us trade policy is tpa nece ssary for those negotiations trade negotiators generally view tpa and its assurance of an upordown congressiona l vote as important if not critical for their credibility in trade negotiations they argue that many foreign countries may not elect to negotiate with the united states if tpa is not in effect this is because without tpas ban on amendments congress can alter an implementing bill and thereby possibly change the nature of the agreement or the balance of concessions achieved supporters of tpa argue that subs tantial changes might require renegotiation and might even kill the agreement on the other hand opponents of tpa are reluctant to give power to the president to conclude trade agreement that congress cannot change they argue that the ban on amendments under tpa is an abdication of the constitutional role of congress to regulate foreign commerce some opponents also claim that the consultation requirements of tpa have been ineffective because the president has consulted indepth with onl small number of members it is generally believed that the exped ited procedures of tp probably have the greatest effect for negotiations involving large number of countries the united states is currently participating in multilateral talks in the doha round of negotiations in the world trade organization wto these ta lks which began in 2001 and are probably at least year from conclusion i nvolve 148 wto member countries b ecause of the complexity of such talks renegotiation of an agreement among 148 countries would be tremendously difficult so us negotiators see tpas ban on amendments as crucial to maintaining any final balance of concessions in an agreement with twoyear extensionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22102crs6 of tpa the current negotiations would tinue and the new deadline of june 30 2007 would effectively set the deadline for signin g an agreement in the wto without tpa negotiations could have continued but with clear deadline and the possibility of amendments in congress other countries mig ht have reconsidered the scope and timing of further talks similar arguments apply to free trade area of the americas ftaa negotiations on an ftaa began in 1994 and 34 count ries are participating talks so far have been slow and difficult and some might argue that because of the difficulty of these negotiations tpa is important because any renegotiation would be highly difficult on the other hand others might argue that tpa does not matter much because it is unlikely that an ftaa can be reached by the extended deadline june 30 2007 for smaller regional or bilateral negotiations the effect of tpa on any set of trade negotiations might depend on how economically or politically controversial those negotiations are the more controversial the talks the greater the possibility that substantial amendments would be considered and the greater the effect of any ban on amendments with tpa for example nafta was highly controversial and it is likely that without the expedited procedures of fast track authority tpa an implementing bill would have been substantially amended in comparison the freetrade agreement with jordan was negotiated without tpa and th implementing bill was changed little during congressional consideration several smaller regiona l or bilateral trade agreemen ts are now under negotiation and they were not concluded in time to qualify for tpa without the twoyear extension most if not all might be concluded in time to qualify for tpa with the twoyear extension how important might the tpa expedited proce dures be if the admin istration concludes these agreements and submits implementing bills to cong ress under those procedures it is difficult to say agreements under ne gotiation include freetrade agreements ftas with thailand panama the ited arab emirates and oman countries in the andean region and countries in southern africa negotiations probably w ould have continued with or without tpa with tpa implemen ting bills will be cons idered under expedited procedures without amendmen t without tpa bills would have been considered under normal legislative procedures and would have been amendabl some of the negotiations have controversial aspects such as claims that worker standards are not adequate or arguments that us apparel makers and us sugar producers will face damaging competition from foreign producers some are controversial because they have stronger political than economic rationale s twoyear extension of tpa could have been more important for some of these negotiations than for others with tpa extended for two years new ne gotiations might be considered for example the administration might propose ft talks with additional countries in the middle east as part of the administration s proposal for middle east free trade area although time could be an impor tant consideration if tpa had not been extended the administration probably would have been more restrained in pursuing new trade negotiations or might have pur sue less controversial negotiati ons regardless of whether or not tpa was extended trade agreements entered into before june 30 2005 an fta with five central american countries nd the dominican republic and an fta with bahrain already qualified for expedited procedures for an implementing bill
