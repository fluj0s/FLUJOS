senate versions of gina prohibit discrimination in employment because of genetic informati on and with certain exceptions prohibit an employer from requesting requiring or pur chasing genetic information the house and senate versions of gina are similar in many respects however there are several significant differences for example the employment sections of the bills contain differing versions of the definitions of family member2 and genetic information3 generally where the employment provi sions describe unlawful employment practices s 358 includes prohibition against discrimination on the basis of information about request for or the recei pt of genetic services by such employee or family member of such employee4 whereas the house version does not explicitly include this prohibition the house bill c ontains an exception to the prohibition of discrimination regarding dna analys is for law enforcement purposes5 which does not have parallel provision in the
