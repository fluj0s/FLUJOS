6207c17 shspec171 anatomy of arc breaks tr1 is based on the desire to get response from the pc if you dont want to know tr1 will be out if you misread the meter the pc will arc break but he wont assign cause rightly he will give you some reason for the arc break which in itself might be true ie real outness but the actual cause is earlier even if he says that it is that you missed read its an earlier missed read that did the damage there is always that much alteris in the pcs protest if you touch pcs bank you put him into state of alteris because he is in state of alteris already he will frequently do something other than what you have told him to do if you let him get away with it he will become unauditable therefore never ask yes responsetype question without asking what it was this way you spot the alteris the pc thinks he is doing what you said but you mustnt acknowledge lie by letting him get away with this the degree that pcs alteris monitors the degree to which they protest alteris or acknowledgment of alteris telling someone to do something without having control of him is asking for trouble you should go into this by gradients since you are asking for trouble if you try to control him at distance before he is up to it dont acknowledge an improperly done command it is fatal to q and with the pcs alteris the pc acts as though it will please him for you to acknowledge his alteris but it doesnt pc who starts giving the auditor orders has ceased to accept the auditor as the auditor because the auditor acknowledged some alteris awhile earlier note that this arc break or attempt to control the session occurs some time after the missed withhold resulting from some alteris both involuntary and meterread missed withholds result from wrong acknowledgment i would not q and with the pcs order i would ask when did you first think i didnt hear you or what happened earlier in the session the arc break could appear up to an hour and half after the missed withhold that caused it so dont expect when asking for the missed withhold that it just happened here is just what occurs arc makes up understanding if you fail to understand what the pc said arc breaks down this is bad tr4 at this point willingness to talk to the auditor drops out and so does interest in his own case because the pc feels that he doesnt understand as much about his case as he thought he did the greater ones understanding the easier it is to blow things the auditor must understand and the pc must understand for the pc to blow anything asisness depends on understandingness alteration always pursues failure to understand notisness accompanies the notion of incomprehensibility that is what happens with the insane they are notised because they are incomprehensible the deepest lie is pretending to understand the alteris all people have to do to make some advance is to come off their high horse and admit the lack of understanding and not pretend to understand when one snarls about pc just recall the first time one didnt understand the pc understanding is in the area of knowing and notknowing see pp 1415 above for discussion of the first four postulates that is vary highechelon pair of postulates they come right after native state so they are rather esoteric buttons for lot of people and can lay an egg but severed communication line with the missed withholds involved is very comprehensible hence the idea of missed withhold communicates well its mechanics are easy to handle one kind of missed withhold is communication intended and not received this is unacknowledged truth the inadvertent withhold that one makes the pc scream like banshee since it is right on the button of the creation of his mind and the universe for instance if the pc cant get its hot in here acknowledged he will try to make it stick if he possibly can even manifesting it physiologically the other kind of missed withhold is failure to find out something wrong the pc has put through lie which you have acknowledged either way the session blows up for instance the pc says i have never had anything to do with women in my whole life gin answer to question about women this is very low reality probably due to an original low affinity so you dont give an acknowledgment you dont buy that you check the question on the meter you cannot create an arc break by establishing truth only by refusing truth and accepting lies it is never wise or kind to permit someone to depart from truth in order to spare their feelings the emeter isnt liedetector it is truthverifier the auditor uses it to establish the truth if he can establish the truth of the situation and acknowledge it he will never have an arc break this requires that an auditor not be shy about establishing the truth even if the pc is protesting and blushing the only way you will come out friend of the pc is by establishing truth the idea that social lies are necessary is one of the mechanisms for making more bank actually if you told only the truth for twentyfour hours you would do very well you would have real friends but it requires strong man to enter into this because there may be repercussions the first part may be rough but eventually it has its reward the way down is stepping back from the truth if an auditor goes into session with social mores and kindness in play the session will go to pot you can build whole universe out of bad auditing because of alteris that is why your metering has to be one hundred percent accurate and your tr4 has to include understanding the pc pc will forgive lot of fumbling if it is clear that the auditors intention is to establish truth it is better to be knucklehead than to know it all you can even act stupid as way of making sure you understand an auditor must establish truth
