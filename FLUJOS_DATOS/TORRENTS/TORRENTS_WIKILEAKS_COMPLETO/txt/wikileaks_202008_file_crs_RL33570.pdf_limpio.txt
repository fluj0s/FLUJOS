government and finance division january 19 2007 abstract over the past 15 years the us current account has moved from small surplus to deﬁcit that in 2005 was nearly 800 billion the ﬁnal tally for 2006 has not been completed but preliminary data suggests the deﬁcit will grow to near 900 billion the current account deﬁcit has increased also as share of gross domestic product gdp climbing from near zero to record 62 in 2005 because current account deﬁcit is reﬂection of concurrent net inﬂow of borrowed funds from the rest of the world the accumulation of debt from long succession of large annual deﬁcits has caused the united states to move from being small net creditor to the rest of the world to being large net debtor the net accumulation of liabilities through 2005 is 27 trillion which is equivalent to about 22 of us gdphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33570 order code rl33570 us external debt how has the united states borrowed without cost updated january 19 2007 craig k elwell specialist in macroeconomics government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33570us external debt how does the united states borrow without cost summary despite the huge increase in us external debt the investment income component of the current account has remained in surplus the size of this surplus has varied hitting low of 4 billion in 1998 and high of 37 billion in 2003 but over the past 25 years the surplus has remained between 15 billion and 30 billion since 2003 the surplus has fallen reaching 28 billion in 2004 and 11 billion in 2005 this means that the united states although large net debtor has been borrowing free of any economically meaningf ul debt service cost what is behind this apparent paradox attempts to reso lve this paradox have considered special factors that tend to mitigate the effects of the current account deficit on the value of foreign debt the role of unmeasured us exports and bias in data collection 2005 study by economist william cline ar gues that two factors have worked to limit the impact of large current account deficits on the nations economic debt service payments first is the effect of valuation changes that have caused the magnitude of us net indebte dness to grow much more slowly than the size of the current account deficits would indi cate second is the effect of asymmetrical capital returns the united states earns higher rate of return on its foreign investments than foreigners earn on their us investments more controversial interpretation of the paradox of the united states having large net external liabilities along with an investment income surplus has been provided by economists hausma nn and sturzenegger they maintain that the official current account data have faile d to record large volume of service exports so large that the united states has in truth remained large net external creditor the name they give to these invisible assets is dark matter for like the astronomical phenomenon they have visible effect g enerating investment income but stem from source that cannot be s een hidden service exports looking at the sizable gap between the rate of return on us foreign direct investment fdi and that on fdi in the united states the anomaly is not the high us yield 75 but the suspiciously low foreign yield 25 why pour hundreds of billions of investment into the united states for yield below that available from holding virtually risk free us treasur bonds or given the high yield on us fdi it would seem likely that there are superior investment opportunities elsewhere this apparent violation of rational economic be havior suggests that there could be something wrong with the fdi earnings data reported by foreign firms operating in the united states while the rate of past debt accumulation may have been smaller than what the size of us current account deficits would i ndicate and while the size of the us net debt position and investment income ba lance may be subject to significant measurement error the sheer size of prosp ective trade deficits will mean that if not now the united states will soon be net btor and will also soon have sizable deficit in investment income incurring true debt burden this report will be updated as events warranthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33570contents introduction 1 r s l v i n g t h p r d x 2 t t n u t i n g f c t r s 2

has moved from small surplus to deficit that in 2005 was nearly 800 billion the final tally for 2006 has not been completed but preliminary da ta suggests the deficit will grow to near 900 billion the current account deficit has increased so as share of gross domestic product gdp climbing from near zero to r ecord 62 in 2005 because current account deficit is reflection of concurrent net inflow of bo rrowed funds from the rest of the world the accumulation of debt from long succession of rge annual deficits has caused the united states to move from being small net creditor to the rest of the world to being large net debtor th net accumulation of liabilities through 2005 is 27 trillion which is equivalent to about 22 of us gdp there is however an apparent paradox in us international transactions in this period despite the huge increase in us external debt the investment income component of the current account has remained in surplus the size of this surplus has varied hitting low of 4 billion in 1998 and high of 37 billion in 2003 but over the past 25 years the surplus has remained between 15 billion and 30 billion since 2003 the surplus has fallen reaching 28 billion in 2004 and 11 billion in 2005 the significance of this enduring surplu s of investment income is that the united states although large net btor has been borrowing free of any economically meaningful debt service cost the investment income balance is tally of us earnings on its foreign investments net of foreigners earnings on their investments in the united states it is reported as component of the cu rrent account balance the nations most comprehensive measure of international transactions surplus in the investment income balance the us earns more than it pays means that the united states despite being large net debtor on an accounting basis value of foreign liabilities exceeds value of foreign assets is on an economic basis net creditor an economically significant debt would generate net capital income payments to the rest of the world that is debt burden in the form of real resources being transferred to the rest of the world because the united states is generating net capital income receipts suggests that it is an economic net creditor to the rest of the world and is bearing debt service cost on its large external debt this would also suggest that the large trade deficits gene rating that debt coul d be much less onerous than typically portrayedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33570crs2 1 william cline the united states as debtor nation washington institute for international economics 2005 2 foreign direct investment fdi is distinguished from portfolio investment by being purchase of equity that leads to the acqui sition of 10 or more of the capital of an enterprise resolving the paradox why is there this paradox does it sugge st there is reason for concern about us international imbalances b ecause its accu mulated debt is ec onomically costless several explanations have recently been put forward attenuating factors 2005 study by economist william cline provides an explanation for the external debt paradox as well as an assessment of the need for concern about us external imbalances by policy makers1 it argues that two factors have worked to limit the impact of large current account deficits on the na tions economic debt service payments first is the effect of valuation changes that have caused the magnitude of united states net indebtedness to grow much more slowly than the size of the current account deficits would indicate second is the effect of asymmetrical capital returns the united states earns higher rate of return on its foreign investments than foreigners earn on their us investments valuation effects over time valuation effects have worked to increase the price of us assets relative to the price of us liabilities for two reasons first us foreign assets have higher incidence of equities 58 such as foreign direct investment and portfolio investment than do us liabilities 37 in contrast us liabilities have higher inci dence of debt obligations 51 such as bonds and bank loans than do us assets 312 the differential valuation effect occurs because equities appreciate with infl ation and stock market booms but debt obligations most often do not second to far greater gree than other countries us external liabilities are denominated in dollars whereas us external assets are heavily denominated in foreign currencies theref ore when the dollar depreciates against major currencies the dollar value of us foreign assets rises relative to the value of us foreign liabilities how significant have valuation change s been for the us net asset position based on bureau of economic analysis bea data cline reports that from 1991 through 2004 the cumulative current defi cits amounted to 36 trillion the actual increase in the us net asset positio n over this period was only 24 trillion therefore valuation effects erased 12 trillion or 53 of the us current account deficits this effect wa s found to be particularly strong in the 20022004 period when the dollar depreciated substantially erasing seveneights of the cumulative current account deficits impact on the u s net asset position for this period asymmetric capital returns the united states has on average consistently earned higher returns on its fo reign investments than foreign investorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33570crs3 earned on their us investments this overa ll rate of return dvantage has fluctuated narrowly but steadily between 1 to 2 percenta ge points there is likely structural bias in world capital markets that contribut to this outcome prudent investment portfolio management calls for holding di versified collection of assets that strike reasonable balance between risk and re ward that balance would entail holding some assets offering higher return but also higher risk and other assets offering lower return but also lower risk in light of this an argument can be ma that the large and highly liquid us asset market with its transparency and gal safeguards offers bountiful array of lowyield and lowrisk assets us treasur securities are particularly attractive element of this array of lowrisk assets for this reason great numbers of foreign investors come to the us asset market to fill out the lowrisk tier of their investment portfolios currently foreigners hold more than 2 trillion in us treasury securities or about 53 of all us treasury secur ities held by the public conversely us investors are more likely to buy foreign asse ts that offer high return and high risk how significant this bias is in causing the asymmetric returns is not known the united states rate of return advantage on its foreign assets is not common to all types of foreign investments however it is almost exclusively an outcome associated with foreign direct investment fdi in the united states the rate of return on us fdi averages 71 and the ra of return on fdi in the united states averages only 25 in contrast rates of return on bank and nonbank claims and corporate bonds have been similar for both ssets and liabilities the rates of return on portfolio equities have shifted over the past 15 years favoring us equities in the early part of the period and in recent year s favoring foreign equ ities the advantage in this case is much smaller than the 128 billion net earnings on us fdi in 2004 adding only 20 billion to us investment income the significance of the rate of return advantage of us fdi for investment income is substantial cline estimates that if the rates of return on all foreign assets and liabilities were th same the us investment income balance in 2004 would not have been surplus of 36 billion but deficit of 102 billion cline cannot give conclusive reason or reasons why us fdi earns higher return than fdi in the united states implications clearly the burden of the massive external borrowing by the united states has been relatively painless to this point but as cline argues future prospects are unlikely to be as benign the sheer size of prospective us current account deficits will soon overtake the seve ral mitigating forces and cause the real debt burden to grow substantia lly the high incidence of fixed income obligations in us foreign liabilities is characteris tic that could greatly accelerate the growth of that burden fixed income obligati ons which include ba nk and nonbank claims as well as government and corporate bonds tend to be sensitive to the level of interest rates in the past the extremely low interest rates have made this structural characteristic relatively benign but global in terest rates have now begun to rise and because the united states will have to sell new debt instruments as well as turn over large share of existing debt the total interest payments to foreigners holding thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33570crs4 3 ricardo hausmann and federico sturzenegger us and global imbalances can dark matter prevent the big bang unpublished working paper kennedy school of government harvard university 2005 4 see richard d porter and ruth judson the location of the us currency how much is abroad board of governors of the federa l reserve system mimeo apr 15 1996liabilities will increase cline estimates that an increase in interest rates of only 1 or 2 percentage points would increase us net interest payments to foreigners by 30 billion to 70 billion added net interest payments of this size would soon swing the investment income balance from surplus to deficit and cause us debt service costs to become very real the united states was able to avoid this effect in 2005 because interest rate increases were in shortterm yields that generated equally large increases in interest receipts and payments if however longterm yields also begin to rise the effect will be more onesided because ther will be substantial increases in payments on us treasury securities held abroad with compensating increase in similar foreign payments the presence of dark matter more controversial interpretation of the paradox of the united states having large net external liabilities paired with an investment income surplus has been provided by economists usmann and sturzenegger3 they maintain that the official current account data have failed to record large volume of service exports so large that the united states has in truth remained large net external creditor these service exports are not measured in export data because they are hidden within various us capital outflows and they are not measured there either nevertheless once abroad these services produce earning s that show up as foreign investment income the name they give to these invisible assets is dark matter for like the astronomical phenomenon they have visible effect generating investment income but stem from source that cannot be seen hidden service exports the imputed effect of dark matter on the us net sset position is huge transforming deficit of 25 tr illion into surplus of 600 billion this would suggest that the accumulated dark matter has an economic value of 31 trillion the sources of dark matter hausmann and stur zenegger name three classes of invisible us exports global li quidity services insurance services and knowledge services attached respectively to three types of capital outflows us currency us sovereign debt and us fdi liquidity services dollars holds special gl obal status with the currency being widely held as an asset to meet th liquidity needs of the world economy it is matter of controversy as to what is th scale of foreign holdings of dollars the estimates of the share of the 700 billion federa l reserve notes in circulation that are held abroad range from as low as 30 to as much as 704 beas own tally of currency held abroad wa s 333 billi on in 2004 or bout 48 of the total inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33570crs5 5 federal reserve note held abroad is not liability of the us government the holder of dollar has other claim on the us governme nt then that piece of paper itself distinct from us treasury bond federal reserve notes carry claim for interest payment claim for repayment of principal and claim for any nonpecuniary servicescirculation much of this demand come s from foreign governments whose own currencies are unstable or have acute probl ems with inflation also some of the international demand for dollar currency may be tied to black market and criminal transactions such holdings are effectively an interest free and irredeemable loan to the united states and although recorded as lia bility in the us inte rnational investment position they are not perfor ming as us liability5 if the proceeds from this interest free loan are invested in assets earning positive rate of return there will occur an inflow of investment income with visible asset generating it dark matter because there is certainty about how much do llar currency is actually held abroad there is range of estimates of potential dark matter from liquidity services it is unlikely that the amount is less than 200 billion or exceeds 500 billion if invested in assets with 5 return the range for the income flow from this form of dark matter would be from about 10 billion to about 25 billion annually insurance services this source of dark matter is in concept similar to liquidity services but applied to lowrisk us treasury bonds as noted in the cline study examined above the world economy s an apparent strong demand for low risk asset to fill out its i nvestment portfolio and the holding of us treasury bonds is the preferred way of meeting this demand the united states on the other hand can use these proceeds to fill out the high risk highyield tier of its investment portfolio with much higher yielding bo nds from emerging economies hausmann and sturzenegger argue moreover this yield difference will not be compressed by competitive forces and will persist because th world is exchanging safe asset for risky asset and the difference is in effect an insurance premium the world pays the united states for lowering its risk knowledge services hausmann and sturzenegger argue that current accounting practices are greatly understating the stock of us fdi assets because they fail to account for embodied knowledge services these unmeasured assets do however generate an inflow of revenue that is measured as investment income this would lead to higher apparent rate of return on the fdi assets that are measured this occurs because us fdi has embodied in it extremely valuable but unmeasured assets exported in the form of knowhow brand recognition expertise and research and development hausmann and sturzenegger maintain that knowledge services is the most important source of dark matter implications of dark matter taking dark matter into consideration the global imbalances that countless observe rs have found so troubling would be eliminated the united states would be net creditor not net debtor japan is large creditor whereas the euro area and the rest of the world are net debtors overall the world economy is generally bala nced with the exception of japan having large net positions dark matter would also suggest the united states is far morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33570crs6 6 these criticisms follow those found in william buiter dark matter or cold fusion goldman sachs global economic paper 136 jan 2006of saver than indicated by official sta tistics moreover so long as dark matter continues to be largely ba sed on knowledge exported abroad it should lead to steady net creditor position for the united states nd fairly stable in ternational economy evaluation the dark matter hypothesis has met with criticism6 in the case of liquidity services or external seigniorage the argument is valid in concept but the magnitude of the associated earnings inflow is probably moderate in size probably more than 25 billion nd perhaps as little as 10 billion in the case of insurance services the argument seems highly improbable if the high risk of default on the sovereign bt of emerging economies is taken into consideration default is hardly unlikel just since 1998 there have been debt defaults by argentina uruguay russia pakistan venezuela ukraine ecuador and peru further the yields on us treasur bonds are not unusually low often being higher than the yield on the sovereign bt of other advanced economies this suggests that the markets are not conferring any preferred market status on us treasury bonds in the end the observed sp read in interest rates between us treasury bonds and emerging market sovereig n debt is often not large seeming only minimally sufficient to cover default risk and leaving little left over for the alleged insurance services premium in the case of knowledge services dark matter may exist but it is also reasonable to conjecture that it is likewis embodied in fdi in the united states causing these investments to be similarly undervalued in the us net international investment position niip calculations in fact ratio of the niip data on market value and book value of fdi which should be an indicator of expected profitability of an investment shows significant difference in expected profitability between fdi in the united states and us fdi in general it is likely that there are important valuation problems on both the asset and liability side of fdi making it unclear whether there is systematic overstatement or unde rstatement on either the foreign or the united states side bias in data collection looking at the sizable gap between the rate of return on us fdi and that on fdi in the united states the argument can be made that the anomaly is not the high us yield 75 but the suspiciously low foreign yield 25 why pour hundreds of billions of investment into the united states for yield below that available from holding virtually risk free us treasur bonds or given the high yield on us fdi it would seem likely that there are superior investment opportunities elsewhere this apparent violation of rational economic behavior suggests there could be something wrong with the reported fdi earnings data from foreign firms operating in the united states another indicator of fdi data problems is that there is yield gap between us portfolio assets and liab ilities fdi is distinguished from portfolio

for european policy studies working document 2006capital of an enterprise why would owning less than 10 of an enterprise be an investment in which foreign investors are competitive with us investors but owning more than 10 be one in which they are not these observations prompt the hypothesis that because us corporate taxes are often higher than those of other countri foreign multinational companies in the united states systematically shift profits from their us affiliates to the parent company or to another affiliate in lower tax jurisdiction with the purpose of reducing their us tax liabilities funds ar not actually crossing any border rather they are being disguised by the use of certain business practices or accounting devices these practices of course di stort the investment income data by undervaluing foreign income in the united states the significance of this practice is suggested by the stark asymmetry of the retained earnings component of the investment in come balance foreign affiliates in the united states report virtually reta ined earnings whereas us firms report substantial retained earnings in their foreign affiliates the cumulative profits reported on us fdi from 1999 thr ough 2004 wa s 984 bil lion of which 620 billion or 65 was reported as retained earnings in comparison during this same period the cumulative profits reported on fd i in the united states were 233 billion of which only 41 billion or 18 was reporte d as retained earnings there is obvious reason for this different performance7 the strength of tax incentives on where profits are reported by multinational corporations is evident in the case of irel and very low tax country foreign firms report profit rates of about 20 on fdi in ireland this is 10 times higher than the yield reported on fdi in the united states and seemingly far greater than credible difference in true profit opport unities another piece of evidence is afforded by the response of us multinational companies to the onetime tax incentives provided by the american jobs creation act of 2004 in 2005 the year the tax incentives were in effect there was sharp redistribution of retained earnings from abroad to us parents as retained earnings from foreign operations abruptly fell to near zero from 177 billion in 2004 and retained earnings repor ted by us parents increased to 244 billion from 50 billion in 2004 the cloaking of the us earnings of foreign multinational companies can be accomplished by the use of what economists call transfer pricing this occurs through the manipulation of the price the company charges for product or service it supplies to its foreign affiliate tax codes usually require that parents and affiliates conduct transactions using armslength pr icing but deviation from this standard can be very hard to detect pa rticularly if as is common the good or service exchanged does not have market determined price fo r reference paying higher prices for goods or services provided by the parent or another affiliate will increase the recorded operating costs of the us affiliate nd in turn decrease its recorded profits and thereby decrease its us tax lia bility the transfer price transaction can be with other foreign affiliates operating in different jurisdictions as well as withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33570crs8 8 see congressional budget office why does us investment abroad earn higher returns than foreign investment in the united states economic issue brief nov 2005the parent there is at present conclusi ve evidence of the extent of profit shifting by multinational corporations through transf er pricing but as already suggested it is likely to be very difficult to detect8 conclusion it is probably true that the valuation of us external assets and liabilities is subject to measurement error however the magnitude of error even if several hundred billion dollars is unlikely to be larg enough to greatly alter the basic shape of us international trans actions large current account ficits and deteriorating external net asset position the tremendous size of prospective current account deficits will mean that if the united states is not now net external debtor it soon will be even ignoring the likely bias associated with the reporting of retained earnings to compute the investment income balance the likely pace of debt accumulation by the united states in conjunction with likely future of higher world interest rates suggests that the current investment income surplus will soon turn to deficit this would put the united states in the position of having to then incur net economic debt service costs on its large borrowings from abroad preliminary data indicates that the investment income balance may post sm all deficit for 2006 this cost could grow large quickly however therefore the us trade deficit and its consequences will continue to be legitimate matters of concern fo r economic policy makers
