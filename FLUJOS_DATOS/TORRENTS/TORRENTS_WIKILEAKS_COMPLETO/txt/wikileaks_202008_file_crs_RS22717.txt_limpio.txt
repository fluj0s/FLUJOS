is broadly defined to include two or more individuals who jointly engage in forprofit business activity they typically consist of general partners who actively manage the partnership and limited partners who contribute capital general partners may also contribute capital according to an administration official tax considerations likely motivate the organization of private equity and hedge funds as partnerships2 in general partnerships 1 for more complete description of the tax issues surrounding hedge funds and private equity managers see crs report rs22689 taxation of hedge fund and private equity managers by mark jickling and donald j marples 2 testimony of treasury assistant secretary for tax policy eric solomon in us congress senate committee on finance carried interest i july 11 2007 at httpwwwsenategov continued crs2 do not pay the corporate income tax and instead pass all of their gains and losses on to the partners the returns of these partnerships are generally taxed as capital gains in addition the tax rules for partnerships allow sufficient flexibility to accommodate many economic arrangements such as special allocations of income or loss among the partners general and limited partners are compensated when the investment yields positive return this income as mentioned above is not taxed at the partnership level only the individual partners pay taxes usually at the capital gains rate in addition the general partners typically receive additional compensation from the limited partners compensation structures may vary from fund to fund but the standard pay formula is called 2 and 20 the 2 represents fixed management fee 2 that does not depend upon the performance of the fund it is characterized as ordinary income for the general partner and is taxed at ordinary income tax rates the 20 is share of the profits from the assets under management 203 this portion of the general partners compensation is commonly referred to as the carried interest selecting this form of compensation aligns the interests of both the limited and general partners toward achieving positive return on investment carried interest is characterized as capital httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22717 gain and taxed at the capital gains rate issues surrounding the characterization of carried interest are the focus of the remainder of this report character of carried interest central to the current debate concerning the tax treatment of carried interest is whether it is compensation for services or an interest in the partnerships capital4 current law treats carried interest the same as all other profits derived from the partnership and thus characterizes carried interest as being derived from an interest in the partnerships capital as result carried interest is taxed at capital gains rates which have historically been lower than the rates on ordinary income this rate differential is generally thought to motivate the current structure of compensation received by fund managers if carried interests were treated as compensation for services provided by the general partners then the realized gains would be characterized as ordinary income taxed at generally higher rates and subject to payroll taxes in the united states debate on the appropriate characterization of carried interest has been brought to the forefront by both proposed legislation and series of congressional hearings on carried interest hr 2834 hr 3996 and hr 6275 would make carried interest taxable as ordinary income the bills state that carried interest shall be treated as ordinary income for the performance of services and thus taxed as ordinary income at rates up to 35 hr 3996 was passed by the house of representatives on november 9 2007 and by the senate on december 6 2007 with an amendment that removed the 2 continued financesitepageshearing071107htm visited june 23 2008 3 in some cases general partners are only entitled to share of the profits if the fund surpasses minimum rate of return or hurdle rate 4 second issue related to carried interest deferral is discussed more fully in crs report rs22689 taxation of hedge fund and private equity

received by the committee on finance in addition the senate finance committee and the house ways and means committee have held series of hearings on carried interest5 debate concerning the characterization of carried interest is not unique to the united states in fact the united kingdoms treasury select committee has asked hm revenue and customs to explain 2003 memorandum of understanding that allows general partners in private equity funds to characterize carried interest as investment income6 in addition table 1 illustrates that european countries have not achieved

association benchmarking european tax and legal environments december 2006 most analysts view carried interest as representing at least partly compensation for services provided by the general partner in some instances this distinction is clear but in others it is more opaque analysts generally base their characterization of carried interest upon the degree to which the general partners own assets are at risk and differences in the profit interest of the general and limited partners some view carried interest as type of performancebased compensation that should be characterized as ordinary income that is the general partner is being compensated for providing the service of generating positive return on the investment this argument 5 us congress senate committee on finance carried

committee private equity volume 1 and 2 july 24 2007 crs4 would seem to have greater merit in cases where hurdle rate must be reached prior to the award of carried interest some also argue for change in the characterization of carried interest based upon the economic principles of efficiency and equity tax systems are generally deemed more efficient when they tax similar activities in like manner critics note that under the current characterization of carried interest these performance fees are taxed less heavily than other forms of compensation leading to distortions in employment organizational form and compensation decisions7 as result of these distortions they maintain that the economy misallocates its scarce resources they also argue that the current treatment of carried interest violates the principles of both horizontal and vertical equity that is individuals with the same income should owe the same in taxes regardless of the form of the income and that those that earn more should pay more in taxes than those that earn less others view the current characterization of carried interest as appropriate because of the general partners contribution of sweat equity to the fund that is the general partners contribute their management skills to the partnership in lieu of contributing httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22717 capital once granted carried interest the general partner has an immediate ownership interest in the partnership and thus is taxed on the proceeds of the partnership based upon the character of the proceeds under this view the limited partners agree to finance the carried interest through reduction relative to their capital investment in their rights to the profits of the partnership this view however highlights general inconsistency in the tax code from an economic perspective the blurring of the returns from labor and capital for example imagine the case of sole proprietor who turns an idea into business if the sole proprietor is later able to sell the business for profit the tax system will characterize the profit as capital gain though the provision of labor unquestionably contributed to the increased value of the business in other cases such as when nonqualifed stock options are exercised the issue is more transparent and the gain is characterized as compensation and taxed as ordinary income any subsequent gain or loss is characterized and taxed as capital gain some have interpreted this sweat equity argument to represent an implicit loan to the general partners that should be taxed somewhere between that of pure capital and pure ordinary income8 under this option the general partner would be viewed as receiving an interestfree loan from the limited partners equal to share of the partnership represented by the carried interest the general partner would count the implicit interest from the loan as ordinary income9 subsequent profits from the carried interest would then be taxed as capital gains 7 aviva

university of colorado legal studies research paper series working paper 06 27 june 12 2007 9 the implicit interest is the interest that the general partner would have paid on the loan had it been made at market rates crs5 some view potential modifications to the treatment of carried interest as unadministrable in testimony before the senate committee on finance treasury assistant secretary for tax policy eric solomon stated that the current taxation of carried interest provides certainty for taxpayers and is administrable for the internal revenue service10 he cautioned against making significant changes in these rules given the widespread reliance of partnerships on these rules others argued that the current characterization of carried interest contributes to innovation and adds economic value to the economy they asserted that venture capitalists engage in risking time money and effort to assist the most compelling business models to improve the way that americans live and work11 further they argued that private equity allows companies to invest in longterm strategies that might otherwise be ignored by the managers of publicly traded companies forced to keep close eye on quarterly earnings12 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22717 10 testimony of treasury assistant secretary for tax policy eric solomon senate committee on finance carried interest i july 11 2007 at
