crime us policy programs and related issues summary transnational organized crime presents serious threat to us national security and global stability organized criminal groups have benefitted from the demise of legal structures following the collapse of the soviet union and in many failed states they have been able to expand their networks across national borders globalism serves these groups which increasingly rely upon advanced technology and the global financial system to accumulate wealth from their illicit activities these groups engage in wide array of criminal activities across national borders that include the illicit drugs trade trafficking in persons alien smuggling and financial crimes these transnational crimes directly threaten american communities and businesses experts also warn of the potential opportunistic links between such criminal groups and terrorist organizations the recent decrease in statesponsorship and support may lead terrorist groups to increasingly rely upon transnational criminals for finances weapons or other forms of assistance such alliances between terrorist and criminal groups could create additional threats to american interests this report presents the direct and potential threats which emerge from transnational organized crime and describes the us government response to combat global crime it outlines the overall framework of us policies formulated to combat transnational organized crime both the clinton and bush administrations response to transnational crime is framed within the 1998 international crime control strategy federal agencies have formulated additional national strategies related to specific dimensions of transnational crime congress has also directed us policy and programs and provided law enforcement agencies with several tools to combat transnational organized crime key federal law enforcement and intelligence programs that focus broadly on transnational crime are discussed some of these programs are designed to monitor investigate and prosecute transnational organized criminals other programs facilitate bilateral and multilateral law enforcement cooperation from foreign government institutions moreover some programs seek to provide law enforcement training and assistance to foreign governments federal agencies leading the us governments efforts to combat transnational organized crime include the departments of defense justice treasury homeland security and state finally it examines potential congressional concerns related to us efforts to combat transnational crime as organized criminal groups accumulate wealth and leverage affecting american interests the report will not be updated contents introduction 1 background 1 threats to the united

reports 16 transnational organized crime us policy programs and related issues introduction transnational organized crime threatens american communities businesses and financial institutions1 in larger sense it is also seen as endangering the security of the united states and other nations undermining the rule of law corrupting governments impeding sustainable development and jeopardizing local and regional stability by possibly providing arms and supports for terrorists and insurgents this report looks at the extent of the threat posed by transnational crime and us efforts to respond to this threat it discusses key federal programs of law enforcement and intelligence agencies designed to monitor investigate and prosecute transnational organized crime it also addresses programs of bilateral and multilateral law enforcement cooperation with foreign governmental institutions finally the report suggests some policy concerns for congress which has continued to give considerable attention to us national security dimension of the threat posed by transnational organized crime while giving priority to the war on terrorism congress has supported the continuing fight against drugs trafficking in persons intellectual property violations money laundering and other crimes that threaten the day to day activities of american citizens and businesses background organized criminal groups exploit the global economy with sophisticated means to accumulate illicit profits furthermore some criminal groups have been linked with terrorist organizations in money laundering and other activities2 according to united nations estimate organized crime controls one quarter of the worlds gross domestic product3 the international monetary fund estimates that figure to be between two and five percent4 another study estimates that nine percent of the us gross domestic product is under the control of organized crime5 should us policy 1 us department of state bureau of international

study in the financial times fraud report continued crs2 and programs neglect to address transnational crime experts fear that criminal groups might expand their activities and perhaps strengthen their alliance with terrorist organizations thereby creating more serious strategic threats to us interests for the sake of their own profits there is single accepted definition of transnational organized crime in 1994 researchers defined transnational crime to include offences whose inception prevention andor direct or indirect effects involve more than one country6 other experts suggest that transnational organized crime involves any concerned or organized group of people which continuously practices its criminal activity and whose main goal is to make profit everywhere without reference to national state boundaries7 us law defines organized crime as transnational threat to the national security of the united states8 transnational organized crime thrives especially in nations where law enforcement institutions are weak money laundering and corruption are rampant and citizens have few viable economic alternatives following the collapse of the soviet union for example transnational criminal groups took advantage of the decline of government institutions reduction in border controls and resurgence of ethnic and regional conflicts in the states of the former soviet union and easter europe to expand their criminal activities and networks across national borders criminal groups also took advantage of economic globalization expanded international travel faster and more direct communications and the rapid transfer of money in the financial system9 regions most affected by organized crime include subsaharan africa eastern europe latin america and the caribbean10 but all regions are affected by the growth in transnational organized crime globally transnational organized crime has particular characteristics that distinguish it from other types of

diversity of their operations12 other experts describe these groups as decentralized flat networks that take advantage of modern technology to frequently adapt their criminal activities13 central intelligence agency study predicts that groups based in north america western europe china colombia israel japan mexico nigeria and russia will increasingly form networks with each other to expand their criminal activities14 threats to the united states experts caution that measuring the true extent of transnational organized crime is difficult because the clandestine nature of criminal activity means that much of the crime is unreported in some countries law enforcement officials manipulate data to produce selfserving reports15 another challenge for those trying to get complete picture are the differences in criminal penal codes and definitions of crime despite these challenges there is consensus that transnational organized crime has grown dramatically the us governments international crime threat assessment has been developed by an interagency working group to provide various measures of global crime the latest assessment released in december 2000 concludes that the most significant areas of criminal activity include 1 terrorism and drug trafficking 2 illegal immigration and trafficking in persons 3 trafficking of products across international borders 4 economic trade crimes and 5 financial crimes16 from this and other recent assessments the following picture emerges every year illegal drugs kill more than 19 thousand americans and impose 160 billion in social and economic costs17 and 50 billion in direct costs to the united states18 only half of the estimated 750 billion to 1 trillion laundered globally each year is attributed 11 rt naylor mafias

criminal activity for transnational groups20 national survey reveals that one third of state and local law enforcement agencies nationwide identify cocaine as their greatest drug threat following trafficking in drugs and weapons trafficking in persons is widely seen as the most profitable activity for organized criminal groups21 and is globally estimated to generate between 35 billion and 10 billion per year22 approximately 18000 to 20000 people are trafficked into the united states every year according to the annual trafficking report23 experts note that trafficked humans forced into bondage can keep paying returns to the criminal organization24 so trafficking in persons can generate both short and long term profits organized smugglers also make shortterm profits from transporting undocumented migrants into the united states for work in licit and illicit industries25 alien smuggling is estimated to generate global profit of 9 billion per year26 one expert estimates that organized criminal groups smuggle 10 to 50 percent of illegal migrants27 another observer calculates that approximately one million people are smuggled every year from poor to wealthier countries28 19

up to 250 billion from this form of counterfeit and intellectual property crime transnational criminal groups organize and control the manufacture transport storage and sale of counterfeit or pirated groups like trafficking in persons intellectual property crime is dominated by criminal organizations due to the relatively low level of risk and comparatively high level of profits30 organized criminals are attracted to the united states open society and free markets and some of these groups have been known to invest the proceeds of their illegal activities into legitimate american financial institutions through direct and indirect means other groups mainly those involved with trafficking in drugs engage in bulk cash smuggling to place their illicit profits in jurisdictions with lax financial regulations and law enforcement drug traffickers use various methods to launder their profits both inside and outside of the united states in the united states the primary drug money launderers are colombian and mexican criminal organizations31 terrorism nexus one issue of considerable concern is the possibility of opportunistic links between criminal and terrorist organizations both terrorist and organized criminal groups thrive in areas with weak governmental control and law enforcement and lax border controls both groups operate in cell structures use similar means to move and launder money32 and threaten the destabilization of third world governments33 in addition both groups target civilian populations and youth for recruitment34 despite these similarities there are fundamental differences between organized criminals and terrorists 29 statement of ronald k noble secretary general of interpol before the house international relations committee july 16 2003 30

senate judiciary committee may 20 2003 crs6 organized criminal groups are distinct from terrorist organizations in that they focus on profit and engage in terror only to provide more congenial environment for their criminal enterprises organized criminal groups do not generally seek to overthrow the existing power structure35 whereas terrorist groups by definition have political motivation some criminal organizations have used terrorist attacks against foreign governments to disrupt investigations eliminate effective law enforcement officials coerce judges into more lenient sentencing policies and create an environment conducive to more criminal activity in contrast terrorist organizations usually engage in organized criminal activity aside from terrorism only to support themselves financially36 because terrorists view crime as means to political end drug trafficking investigations37 reveal that 14 of the 36 designated foreign terrorist organizations38 engage in narcoterrorism often in alliance with other traffickers39 much like transnational organized crime there is formal definition of narcoterrorism the department of defense dod defines the term as terrorism conducted to further the aims of drug traffickers it may include assassinations extortion highjackings bombings and kidnapings directed against judges prosecutors elected officials or law enforcement agents and general disruption of legitimate government to divert attention from drug operations according to the drug enforcement administration dea narcoterrorism is subset of terrorism in which terrorist groups or associated individuals participate directly or indirectly in the cultivation manufacture transportation or distribution of controlled substances and the monies derived from these activities further narcoterrorism may be characterized by the participation of groups or associated individuals in taxing providing security for or otherwise aiding or abetting drug trafficking endeavors in an effort to further or fund terrorist activities40 narcoterrorist organization is an organized group that is complicit in the activities of drug trafficking in order to further or fund premeditated

administration the threat of international crime to us national security was recognized in october 1995 with the presidential decision directive 42 pdd42 in joint response to this threat several federal agencies developed the us governments international crime control strategy in june 199845 this strategy intends to serve as dynamic evolving roadmap for coordinated longterm attack on international crime and to supplement previous crime strategies despite the administrations efforts an international crime control bill46 consisting of measures designed to deter and punish international crime and promote global cooperation was not enacted by the 105th congress or subsequently the bush administration in april 2001 the assistant to the president for national security

activities on american communities and businesses us policymakers also have to concentrate on other national security threats following september 11 2001 federal agencies have restructured their programs and resources to focus on the war on terrorism analysts who criticize the level of federal spending on counterterrorism programs compared to other anticrime efforts argue that the economic losses from terrorist attacks are small by comparison to transnational crimes such as drug trafficking however other analysts warn policymakers that psychological and political costs in addition to direct economic losses are potentially enormous and unquantifiable some analysts have criticized the tendency for law enforcement officials to use terrorist criminal and insurgent to define the same person or organization for example the dea calls pablo escobar narcoterrorist both drug trafficker and terrorist69 some agencies are suspected of using the terrorism nexus to receive additional funds for programs related to transnational crime under the guise of counterterrorism experts argue that some of the same vulnerabilities in the global financial system allow both terrorist and criminal organizations to pursue their illegal activities coordinated law enforcement and intelligence approach that targets key vulnerabilities may effectively combat both groups what if any performance measures are in place to monitor the effectiveness of federal programs related to transnational crime following gao inquiry an nsc official revealed that performance measurement system envisioned under the 1998 international crime control strategy was never established because individual agencies were given discretion to devise and implement their own measurement systems70 analysts urge agencies to establish system to measure the effectiveness of their transnational crime control programs such mechanism may provide an agency some flexibility to adapt its strategies and program activities agency officials may argue that performance measures are hard to formulate because of the challenges associated with obtaining accurate international criminal data another challenge for agencies is to establish uniform system across programs to measure the overall impact on transnational crime some observers propose developing network similar to the department of justices organized crime and drug enforcement task force ocdetf which coordinates federal law enforcement efforts to combat national and international organizations that cultivate process and distribute illicit drugs whereas ocdetf focuses on drug trafficking parallel task force could focus on other forms of trafficking that involve transnational criminal organizations this task force could also expand its network overseas to include foreign law enforcement and intelligence officials in pursuing major investigations are benefits associated with increase overseas presence of us law enforcement and intelligence officials worth the corresponding risks some experts support the increased overseas presence of fbi dea and other federal agents in an effort to gain cooperation from foreign law enforcement officials

transnational crime dod officials are also supported for their overseas military operations to pursue counternarcotics activities other experts remind policymakers that objections to american presence have provoked terrorist attacks in the past for example in 1993 osama bin laden trained the somali tribesmen who ambushed us peacekeeping forces in somalia71 in 2003 leftist guerrillas in colombia kidnaped three american contractors and according to journalist have killed four american contractors since 200272 would increased participation in multilateral institutions help or hinder us criminal investigations some observers propose that the united states build additional international law enforcement networks because transnational cooperation supports domestic investigations intelligence gathering and helps to develop worldwide strategy to combat transnational crime proponents argue that multilateral institutions can develop international standards for documentation requirements eg passports bills of lading among nations and efficient mechanisms to identify fraudulent documents that facilitate criminal activities others are concerned about possible complications that might arise from the sharing of law enforcement techniques and intelligence with foreign governments organized criminal groups invest in the corruption of government officials in several countries in order to weaken law enforcement institutions that would otherwise undermine their activities furthermore some experts believe multilateral organizations are not very effective while participation is timeconsuming and laborintensive 71 ivan eland does us intervention overseas breed terrorism cato institute foreign policy briefing 50 december 17 1998 available at httpwwwcatoorg pubsfpbriefsfpb50pdf
