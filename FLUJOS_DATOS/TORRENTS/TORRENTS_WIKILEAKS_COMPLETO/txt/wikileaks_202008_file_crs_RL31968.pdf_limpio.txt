the face of longterm care texas introduction federal legislative perspective states choosing to modify their programs for longterm care face significant challenges financing of nursing home care has dominated longterm care spending for decades the federal financing structure that created incentives to support institutional care reaches back to 1965 number of converging factors have supported reliance on nursing home spending prior to enactment of medicaid homes for the aged and other public institutions were financed by combination of direct paymen ts made by individuals with their social security old age assistance oaa benef its and vendor payments made by states with federal matchi ng payments on behalf of i ndividuals the kerrmills medical assistance to the aged maa program enacted in 1960 predecessor to medicaid allowed states to provide medical services including skilled nursing home services to persons who were not eligible for oaa cash payments thereby expanding the eligible population1 in 1965 when kerrmills was transforme d into the federalstate medicaid program congress created an entitlement to skilled nursing facility care under the expanded program the social security amendments of 1965 required that states provide skilled nursing facility services and gave nursing home care the same level of priority as hospital and physician rvices amendments in 1967 allowed states to provide care in intermediate care facilities icfs for persons who did not need skilled nursing home care but needed more than room and board in 1987 congress eliminated the

for nursing home care grew by 50 in the three year period beginning in 1967 in fy2001 medicaid spent 531 billion on institutional care for nursing homes and care in intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded facilities effective in 1990 as result of these various amendments people eligible under the states medicaid plan are entitled to nursing home facility care that is if person meets the states income and asset requirements as well as the states functional eligibility requirements for entry into nursing home he or she is entitled to the benefit these early legislative developments we re the basis for the beginnings of the modern day nursing home industry sign ificant growth in the number of nursing homes occurred during the 1960s from 1960 to 1970 the number of homes more than doubled from 9582 to almost 23000 nd the number of beds more than tripled from 331000 to more than one million2 today there are about 17000 nursing homes with 18 million beds3 during the latter part of the 1960s and the 1970s nursing home care attracted great deal of congressional oversight as result of concern about increasing federal expenditures and pattern of instances of fraud and abuse that was becoming evident between 1969 and 1976 senator frank moss thenchairman of the subcommittee on longterm care of the senate special committee on aging held 30 hearings on problems in the nursing home industry4 home care services received some congressional attention in the authorizing statute home health care services were one of the optional services that states could provide under the 1965 law three years later in 1968 congress amended the law to require states to provide home health care services to persons entitled to skilled nursing facility care as part of their stat medicaid plans effective in 1970 during the 1970s the department of health ducation and welfare now health and human services dhhs devoted attention to alternatives to nursing home care through variety of federal research and demonstration efforts these efforts were undertaken not only to find ways to offset the high costs of nursing facility care

homes and in community settings rather than in in stitutions however it was not until 1981 that congress took significant legislative ac tion to expand home and communitybased services through medicaid when it aut horized the medicaid section 1915c home and communitybased waiver program under that authority known then as the section 2176 waiver program the secretary of dhhs may waive certain medi caid state plan requirements to allow states to cover wide range of home and communitybased services to persons who otherwise meet the states eligibility requirements for institutional care the waiver provision was designed to alter the bias in the medicaid program that favored institutional care over care in home and communitybased settings services include case management personal care homemak er home health aide adult day care habilitation environmental modifi cations among many others5 these services are covered as an option of states and under the law persons are not entitled to these services as they are to nursing facility care moreover states are allowed to set cost caps and limits on the numbers and types of persons to be served under their wavier programs

financial incentives help promote an institutional bias in the program trends in home and communitybased care texas supports relatively wide range of home and communitybased services for adults with

program and eight small programs funded by state and social serv ice block grant ssbg funds authorized under title xx of the social security act texas employs two features that make its financial eligibility standards for home care services provided under its state medicaid plan different from those used by other states the first is its use of special income rule to determine eligibility for home care services in the early 1980s the state received approval from the us department of health and human rvices dhhs to conduct section 1115 demonstration project15 designed to eliminate custodial care in nursing homes and to serve people needing that level of care in the community under the demonstration texas was allowed to use special inco rule known as the 300 rule when determining eligibility for medi caid state plan service known as primary home care under the rule persons may have inco up to 300 of th federal ssi level and qualify for medicaid ordinarily states are allowed to use this more liberal income standard to determine financial eligibility only for institutional care or for section 1915c home and communitybased waiv er services states are not allowed to use the 300 rule for medicaid state plan services since texas does not have medically needy program which allows persons with high medical expenses to deplete their income and then establish dicaid eligibility the use of the 300 rule for home care in texas was intended to establish more liberal standard for home care only when the texas demonstration project ended congress amended the medicaid statute16 to allow texas to continue to use the more liberal 300 rule to determine eligibility for home care services offered under the st ate medicaid plan thus creating eligibility for home care for persons who have higher income than would otherwise be eligible in addition to its use of the 300 speci income rule texas allows persons who qualify for nursing home care and whos income exceeds 300 of the ssi level to place income into special trusts ca lled miller trusts and still qualify for medicaid coverage medicaid law requires states that use only the 300 rule andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31968crs16

officials and key stakeholders conducted during the texas site visit during the summer of 2002 institutional bias texas has dealt with the institutional bias built into the medicaid program over the years by increasing funding devoted to home and community services particularly for its aged and disabled medicaid beneficiaries the state was also one of the first to have comprehensive plan for dealing with the implications of the supreme courts olmst ead decision that plan has fostered number of changes designed to provide the least restrictive care in home and communitybased settings rather than institutional care texas implemented threephase res ponse to olmstead for nursing home residents the first phase began in december 2000 and consisted of informing nursing home residents about communitybas ed alternatives the 2year second phase began in september 2001 with pilot program in three sites to relocate nursing facility residents into the community pilo ts involve hiring and training relocation specialists developing an assessmen t instrument and conducting community awareness activities the third phase will be to divert persons from nursing homes to home and communitybased servi ces through preadmission screening in december 2000 texas implemented its community icfsmr living options process which is designed to inform all residents of icfsmr about alternative living arrangements and to determine whether people with developmental disabilities can live successfully in the community people who wish to leave an icfmr and whose interdisciplinary team determines that they are able to live in the community are placed on the home and co mmunitybased services waiver waiting list the third major step the state took invol ved using legislative riders which the legislature often uses to impose polic direction on the executive branch rider 7 from the 77th legislature 20022 003 stat that dhs cannot disallow community services for current waiver participants who would otherwise be in nursing home if additional services are required to keep them in the community another recent rider 37 states that as residents leave nursing homes their funds should follow them into the community and that their use of home and community services will not be counted against the waiver slots in eff ect they jump the waiting list for home and community services in response to ride r 37 the state moves anyone who has lived in nursing home within the last 6 months to the top of the community based alternatives waiver waiting list nursing home liability insurance due to historical quality assurance problems in nursing homes texas requires nursing homes to have liability insurance many companies have stoppe d selling policies to the states facilities because of perceived high damage awards the state sponsored an insurance company the joint underwriting association jua that will provide insurance but will not cover losses due to punitive damages according to state officials thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31968crs31 41texas department of human services individual service profiles community care programs apr 2002 as updated on may 31 2002 42the medicarechoice program was created by congress in the balanced budget act bba of 1997 to give medicare beneficiaries mo re access to private health plans including several types of managed care plans typically these plans provide more health care coverage than feeforservice medicare in return for beneficiary premiums and medicare capitated payments for further information see crs report rl30702 medicarechoice by hinda ripps chaikind and paulette morgancompanys policies cost 50 to 70 less than similar policies available in the private marketplace however providers say that premiums remain unaffordable and that many facilities are going wit hout liability insurance as result the state has also capped damage awards against nursing homes at 750000 integration of health and longterm care services texas has tried to integrate health and longterm care rvices for persons with disabilities because the state believes that integration could improve service delivery and possibly lead to cost savings three efforts are noteworthy but small the states consolidated waiver program encompasses persons with developmental disabilities and children as well as aged and disabled adults this program is designed to test consolidation of 5 medicaid waivers in bexar county th waiver will last for three years and will serve 100 persons 50 adults and 50 children eligible for nursing facility

home costs the program cost 134 million and served 468 clients month in fy200141 the texas starplus waiver in harris county was originally intended to rely on medicare and medicaid waivers to pr ovide integrated health and longterm care services to dual eligibles the state did not obtain the medicare waiver necessary for integration and now only covers up to 120 days in nursing facility under its medicaid waiver however ever care one of its medicaid hmos received approval from cms in 2002 to opera as medicarechoice plan42 to encourage starplus dual eligible members to voluntarily enroll in this medicare choice plan the state has lifted the three pres cription per month limit for those who choose this option this provides real opportunity for the medicaid waiver to offer more integrated care starplus already integrates acute and longterm care for medicaidonly members who comprise pproximately half of the programs membershiphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31968crs32 43us department of health

institutions into the community the state has taken few steps in this area such as re quiring the texas department of housing and community affairs to make 35 housing vouchers available to people leaving nursing homes however medicaids use of gr oup residential housin g is rather limited waiting lists for home and communitybased care waiting lists have been significant concern for so time in texas but the projected 18 billion budget deficit projected for sfy2003 and 81 billion for the 200405 biennium will likely forestall any attempt to tackle this issue in march 2002 the community based alternatives waiver for the aged and disabled had an interest list of 37667 persons 54 of whom were estimated to be eligible for services the median length of time on the interest list is 1038 months44 about 21000 of those on the list were already receiving services primarily from the primary home care and adult day care programs the texas department of mental health and mental retardation reports that in february 2002 16845 people were waiting for mental retardation services in the home or community 46 of these people r eceived services data about persons on the various waiting lists
