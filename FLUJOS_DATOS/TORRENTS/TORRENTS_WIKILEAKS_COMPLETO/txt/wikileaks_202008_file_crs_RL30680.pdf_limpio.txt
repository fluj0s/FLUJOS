these decisions involved investigative stops one dealt with proposed exception to the fourth amendment warrant requirement and one dealt with the constitutionality of luggage search on bus this report will examine these fourth amendment1 decisions investigative stops the case that set the cornerstone in the area of investigative stops is the supreme courts 1968 decision in terry v ohio 392 us 1 1968 case involving stop and frisk in that case police officer observed three individuals conducting themselves in manner which based upon the officers experience appeared to indicate that the individuals were casing store as possible armed robbery target the officer stopped the individuals and identified himself but did not receive prompt identification from the men he addressed he then seized one of the men and patted down the exterior of his clothes in search of weapons in doing so the officer found gun the court found fourth amendment rights implicated in this situation where police officer accosts an individual and restrains his freedom to walk away2 the court applied reasonableness test looking to whether the officer could point to specific and articulable facts which taken together with rational inferences from those facts that neutral magistrate would conclude would lead man of reasonable caution to believe that possible criminal conduct was involved and that an investigative stop and frisk were warranted3 this case and its progeny have given rise to the requirement that an investigative stop be support ed by reasonable suspicion of criminal activity the courts analysis in this area has been very fact specific examining the totality of the circumstances and requiring the officer to havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30680crs2 4 see eg alabama v white 496 us

base his reasonable suspicion of criminal activity4 two cases from the courts past term addressed investigative stops florida v j l in florida v j l supra the court considered the question whether an anonymous tip that person is carrying gun is without more sufficient to justify police officers stop and frisk of that person5 the court held that it was not the police had received telephone tip from an anonymous caller that young black male wearing plaid shirt at specific bus stop was carrying gun the call was apparently not recorded and information was available regarding the informant after an unknown period of time two officers were sent to the bus stop in response to the call there they found three young black men one of whom j l was wearing plaid shirt the officers did not observe firearm nor did j l make any threatening or suspicious moves one of the officers told j l to put his hands on the bus stop frisked him and seized gun from j ls pocket although the police had received information about the other two young men they were frisked by the second officer nothing was found at the time of the stop and frisk j l was almost 16 he was charged under state law with possessing firearm under the age of 18 and with carrying concealed firearm without license the defendant filed motion to suppress the gun as the fruit of an illegal search and the trial court granted his motion this decision was reversed by an intermediate appellate court the supreme court of florida then reversed the intermediate appellate courts decision and held that the search violated the fourth amendment the florida supreme court found indicia of reliability in the facts before it to give rise to reasonable suspicion of criminal activity two of the justices of the supreme court of florida dissented on the theory that the safety of the public and the police warranted firearm exception to the general rule foreclosing stop and frisks based upon an unsupported anonymous tip the decision of the florida supreme court was in conflict with decisions in the us courts of appeals for the seventh circuit and the district of columbia circuit which found that such investigative stops satisfied the fourth amendments requirements the us supreme court granted certiorari and affirmed the supreme court of floridas decision the us supreme court noted that here the officers suspicion of criminal activity stemmed solely from an uncorroborated anonymous tip from an unknown location the officers had personal observations to support the suspicion that j l was carrying firearm the court distinguished this situation from that of tip from known informant whose reputation can be assessed and who can be heldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30680crs3 6 120 s ct at 1378 7 id 8 id at 1379 white involved an anonymous tip that woman was carrying cocaine and predicting that she would leave particular apartment building at particular time get into car matching specific description and drive to specified motel the woman did so only after observing this behavior did the police have reasonable basis for believing that the person providing the tip had some knowledge of the womans affairs however the court noted that that knowledge did not necessarily imply credibility with respect to the information that she was carrying cocaine the court regarded white as close case 9 idresponsible if her allegations turn out to be fabricated see adams v williams 407 us 143 146147 19726 the court noted however that while an anonymous tip alone seldom demonstrates the informants basis of knowledge or veracity alabama v white 496 us at 329 there are situations in which an anonymous tip suitably corroborated exhibits sufficien t indicia of reliability to provide reasonable suspicion to make the investigatory stop 496 us at 3277 in the case before it the court found such indicia of reliability the call did not afford the police any predictive information that would give the police means of testing the informants knowledge or credibility nor was this deficiency remedied by the fact that the search produced gun the court emphasized that the reasonableness of official suspicion must be measured by what the officers knew before they conducted their search all the police had to go on in this case was the bare report of an unknown unaccountable informant who neither explained how he knew about the gun nor supplied any basis for believing he had inside information about j l if white was close case on the reliability of anonymous tips this one surely falls on the other side of the line8 in j l the court outlined the degree of reliability of an anonymous tip sufficient to support terry stop the accuracy of description of subjects readily observable location and appearance is reliable in the limited sense that it will help the police identify the subject in supporting an investigative stop however it is the reliability of the tipsters assertion of criminal activity that is critical9 the court in j l rejected an argument by the state of florida and by the united states as amicus that firearm exception be created to the general standards for presearch reliability necessary to justify stop and frisk in so doing the court noted that the reliance on reasonable suspicion to support terry stop instead of the usual probable cause necessary to support other searches was responsive to the concern over the danger to public safety posed by armed criminals however the court declined to go further observing that an automatic firearms exception would make it possible for person to harass and embarrass another by calling in an anonymous tip falsely stating that that person was carrying firearm the j l court also noted that once such an exception was in place it would be difficult to limit it just to firearms nor did j ls age justify the search for the gun tip was more reliable where it involved person under the age of 21 than it would have been had it involved an adulthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30680crs4 10 120 s ct 673 675 2000 11 120 s ct at 674the court refused to speculate about circumstances in which an alleged danger might be so great as to justify search even without showing of reliability report of person carrying bomb may not require the same indicia of reliability to support search that report of firearm may require the court also noted that its holding did not foreclose protective searches in settings such as airports or schools where there is diminished expectation of privacy based on information which would not justify searches elsewhere the court emphasized that the requirement that an anonymous tip bear standard indicia of reliability in order to justify stop in way diminished police officers prerogative in accor d with terry to conduct protective search of person who has already been legitimately stopped justice kennedy concurred observing that there were many possible indicia of reliability in the context of anonymous tips that have not yet been addressed by the court illinois v wardlow the other terry stop case considered by the court during the past term was illinois v wardlow supra in this case the court addressed the question of whether wardlows unpro voked flight from officers in heavy narcotics trafficking area supported reasonable suspicion that the person fleeing was involved in criminal activity thereby justifying an investigative stop the officers who stopped wardlow officers nolan and harvey were driving the last of four police cars converging on the area to investigate illegal drug transact ions the eight officers in the four cars anticipated encountering large number of people in the area including drug customers and lookouts officers nolan and harvey observed wardlow standing next to building holding an opaque bag when he saw the officers wardlow turned and fled when the officers caught up with wardlow officer nolan did protective pat down for weapons since in his experience it was common for weapons to be near the vicinity of drug transactions during the frisk the officer squeezed the opaque bag wardlow was carrying and encountered hard gunshaped object upon opening the bag officer nolan discovered 38 handgun and five rounds of live ammunition wardlow was arrested he moved to suppress the gun at trial the trial court denied his motion finding the stop and frisk lawful wardlow was convicted of unlawful use of weapon by felon the illinois appellate court reversed finding that the gun should have been suppressed because the officer lacked reasonable suspicion to justify terry stop the illinois supreme court affirmed the illinois appellate courts decision finding that flight may simply be an exercise of persons right to go on ones way and could not constitute reasonable suspicion justifying terry stop10 the united states supreme court reversed holding that the stop and frisk in this case did not violate the fourth amendment11 the court reviewed the facts above noting the context in which officer nolan decided to investigate wardlow after seeing him flee the court emphasized thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30680crs5 12 120 s ct at 676

presence in an area of expected criminal activity standing alone is not enough to support reasonable particularized suspicion that the person is committing crime but the officers may consider the relevant characteristics of location in determining whether the circumst ances are sufficiently suspicious to warrant further investigation12 among those contextual circumstances which may be considered is the fact that the stop occurred in high crime area nervous evasive behavior is another pertinent factor to be consi dered the court characterized headlong flight as the consummate act of evasion it is not necessarily indicative of wrongdoing but it is certainly suggestive of such13 in the courts view unprovoked flight is neither mere refusal to cooperate with police nor going about ones business14 determination of reasonable suspicion is based on commonsense judgments and inferences about human behavior15 in context officer nolan suspicion that wardlow was engaged in criminal activity was reasonable and sufficient to support an investigative stop while the court acknowledged that there may be innocent reasons for flight in context it was suggest ive of criminal activity and officers may detain fleeing individuals to resolve such an ambiguity if in investigating further the officer does not learn facts giving rise to probable cause that the individual stopped was involved in criminal activity then that individual must be allow ed to go on his way here the investigative stop revealed evidence of criminal wrongdoing justice stevens joined by justices souter ginsburg and breyer concurred in part and dissented in part they concurred in the majoritys unwillingness to adopt either bright line rule authorizing the temporary detention of anyone who flees at the sight of police officer or one holding that flight upon seeing the police can never by itself be sufficient to authorize terry stop however they differed with the majority in that those dissenting would not have found the circumstances in the case before them sufficient to support an investigative stop justice stevens noted wide range of possible explanations for person to flee after seeing police car some were innocent while others were consis tent with criminal wrongdoing further he noted that some of the innocent circumstanc that could precipitate flight were particularly prevalent in high crime areas the dissenting justices found both the fact of unprovoked flight and wardlows presence in high crime are too generic and susceptible of innocent explanation to satisfy the reasonable suspicion inquiry16 justice stevens emphasized that the burden to articulate facts sufficient to support reasonable suspicions fell upon the state and found that the state had failed to carry its burdenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30680crs6 17 120 s ct 7 8 1999 18 the plain view doctrine provides in pertinent part that objects within the plain view of an officer who has right to be in the position to see those objects may be seized without warrant see eg horton v california 496 us 128 1990 illinois v rodriguez 497 us 177 1990 washington v chrisman 455 us 1 1982 united states v santana 427 us 38

found during warrantless search of homicide crime scene should be suppressed one night while flippo and his wife were vacationing in cabin in state park flippo called 911 to report that he and his wife had been attacked police responding to the scene found flippo standing outside the cabin with head and leg injuries after questioning him an officer entered the cabin and found the body of flippos wife she had received fatal head wounds the police closed off the scene took flippo to the hospital and searched the exterior and the environs of the cabin for footprints or signs of forced entry police photographer arrived at 530 the next morning the officers then reentered the building and processed the crime scene spending 16 hours taking photographs searching the cabin and collecting evidence among the things found was closed but unlocked briefcase which in the ordinary course of investigating homicide they opened finding and seizing number of photographs and negatives in an envelope flippo was indic ted for his wifes murder he moved to suppress the photographs and negatives arguing that the police had obtained warrant and that exception to the warrant requirement applied the trial court denied his motion to suppress approving the search as one of homicide crime scene stating the court also concludes that investigating officers having secured for investigative purposes the homicide crime scene were clearly within the law to conduct thorough investigation and examination of anything and everything found within the crime scene area the examination of the briefcase found on the table near the body of homicide victim in this case is clearly something an investigating officer could lawfully examine 17 althoug h both the defendant and the prosecutors cited the us supreme courts decision in mincey v arizona 437 us 385 1978 to the trial court and the state also placed reliance on the plain view exception to the warrant requirement18 the trial court in denying the motion to suppress appears to have relied solely on the premise that after murder crime scene is secured for investigation anything and everything within the crime scene could be searched the supreme court of appeals of west virginia denied discretionary review the united states supreme court granted certiorari in per curiam opinion the court reversed and remanded the lower court decision

s ct at 8 21 120 s ct 1462 1463 2000required for search or seizure under the fourth amen dment unless one of the exceptions to the warrant requirement applies19 in mincey the court rejected the position that there was murder scene exception to the warrant requirement under the fourth amendment as the flippo court stated we noted that police may make warrantles s entries onto premises if they reasonably believe person is in need of immediate aid and may make prompt warrantless searches of homicide scene for possible other victims or killer on the premise s 437 us at 392 but we rejected any general murder scene exception as inconsistent with the fourth and fourteenth amendments the warrantle ss search of minceys apartment was not constitutionally permissible simply because homicide had recently occurred there 437 us at 395 mincey controls here20 the court did not express an opinion as to whether the search of the cabin might be justified as consensual an argument raised by the state because this factual issue was not suitable for consideration in the first instance by the us supreme court nor did the court express any opinion as to whether any other exception to the warrant rule might be applicable or as to whether the admission of the evidence might be harmless error such matters if properly raised were to be resolved on remand the case was reversed and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with the courts opinion luggage search bond v united states the final fourth amendment case decided by the court in the october 1999 term was bond v united states supra in bond the court examined the issue of whether law enforcement officers physical manipulation of bus passengers carry on luggage violated the fourth amendment21 the court held that fourth amendment violation had occurred bond was passeng er on greyhound bus route from california to little rock arkansas the bus stopped at the permanent border patrol checkpoint at sierra blanca texas border patrol agent entered the bus to check the immigration status of the passengers the agent having reached the back of the bus and having determined that the passe ngers were lawfully in the united states then began walking to the front of the bus as he proceeded forward the agent squeezed the soft carryon luggage that the passengers had placed in the overhead storage space above their seats when he squeezed green canvas bag in the compartment above bonds seat the agent encountered bricklike object bond admitted the bag was his and permitted the agent to open it the agent found brick of methamphetamine wrapped in duct tape and rolled in pair of pants httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30680crs8 22 in ciraolo the court held that police observation of backyard from plane flying at 1000 feet did not violate reasonable expectation of privacy similarly the court in florida v riley 488 us 445 1989 relied on ciraolo in holding that police observation from helicopter flying at 400 feet of greenhouse in homes curtilage was not violative of the fourth amendment the court based these decisions on the theory that the property was not necessarily protected from inspection that involves physical invasion and that in each case the defendants expectation of privacy was neither reasonable nor one that society was prepared to honor 488 us at 449 23 120 s ct at 1465bond was indicted for conspiracy to possess and possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine in violation of 21 usc 841a1 he moved to suppress the drugs as fruits of an illegal search the district court denied his motion he was convicted and sentenced on appeal bond conceded that other passengers on the bus had access to his bag however he argued that the agent had manipulated the bag in way that the passengers would not have the court of appeals rejected his argument finding the fact that the agents manipulation of the bag was calculated to detect contraband irrelevant for fourth amendment purposes citing the supreme courts 1986 decision in california v ciraolo 476 us 207 198622 the united states supreme court granted certiorari and reversed distinguishing the visual observation in cirao supra and in florida v riley 488 us 445 1989 from tactile inspection in the case before it the court deemed the latter more intrus ive than the former the court noted that travelers use their carryon luggage to transport personal items that they prefer to keep close at hand the court found two questions to be central to its fourth amendment analysis whether the defendant has shown that he sought to preserve something private and whether the individuals expectation of privacy was one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable23 in answering the first of these questions the court noted that bond had attempted to preserve privacy by use of an opaque bag placed in the overhead compartment above his bus seat as to the second the court observed that bus passenger placing bag in the overhead bin expects that other passengers or bus company employees may move it around but not that they will as matter of course feel the bag in an explo ratory manner the court held the agents physical manipulation of the bag unconstitutional under fourth amendment precepts justice breyer dissented joined by justice scalia finding that the degree of physic manipulation of his carryon luggage by the agent in the case before the court was more intrusive than that which bus passenger might expect from fellow passengers or bus employees the dissent noted further that in determining what expectation of privacy is reasonable in given situation the purpose of the intrusion is irrelevant rather the critical factor is the effect of that intrusion justice breyer regarded the majority opinion in bond as departure from established fourth amendment jurisprudence and as decision which would have detrimental effect on law enfor cement efforts to detect drugs in border searches while doing little to further legitimate privacy interestshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30680crs9 conclusion in the october 1999 term the supreme court placed limits upon the extent to which intrusions into reasonable privacy interests may withstand constitutional muster in number of areas drawing upon terry v ohio supra and its progeny the court in florida v j l supra held that stop and frisk may not be justified by an anonymous tip without more that person in given location and wearing specific clothes was carrying gun such tip merely provided identifying information about the subject but lacked sufficient indicia of reliability as to the allegations of criminal activity in illinois v wardlow supra the court found that the headlong flight of subject in high crime area upon seeing police was sufficient to support stop and frisk in flippo v west virginia supra the court relying upon its 1978 decision in mincey v arizona supra rejected homicide crime scene exception to the warrant requirement of the fourth amendment finally in bond v united states supra the court found that bus passenger had reasonable expectation of privacy in regard to opaq ue carryon luggage stored above the passengers seat in an overhead compartment physical manipulation of that luggage by border patrol agent exceeded constitutionally permissible grounds
