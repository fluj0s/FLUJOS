millions of people to access online content and electronically communicate and interact with each other the potential for computer users to infringe intellectual property copyrights using the internet could expose service providers to claims of secondary liability such as contributory and vicarious copy right infringement concer ned about this significant legal vulnerability of service providers congress passed the online copyright infringement liability limitation act title ii of the digital millennium copyright act dmca of 19981 which created limitations on the liability of osps and isps for copyright infringement arising from their users activities on their digital networks2 the acts legislative history indicates that congress wanted to provide service providers with more certainty in order to attract the substantial investments necessary to continue the ex pansion and upgrading of the internet3 at the same time congress desired to preserve strong incentives for service providers and copyright owners to coope rate to detect and deal with copyright infringements that take place in the digital networked environment4 the dmca therefore includes several conditions that the service provider must satisfy in order to qualify for liability protection nd requires that the serv ice providers activities be encompassed within one of four specified categories of conduct5 one federal district court assessed the dual purpose and balance of the dmca in the following manner congress created tradeoffs within the dmca servi ce providers would receive liability protections in

providers from copyright infringement suits the dmcas safe harbor provisions codified at 17 usc 512 do not confer absolute immunity but they do greatly limit service providers liability based on the specific functions they perform7 the safe harbors correspond to four functional operations of service provide r 1 transitory digital network communications 2 system caching 3 storage of information on systems or networks at direction of users and 4 information location tools8 qualification for any one of these safe harbors is limite d to the criteria detailed in each provision and qualification under one sa fe harbor category does not affect the eligibility determination for any of the other three9 512 transitory digital network communications when service provider acts as data conduit at the request of third party by transmitting routing or providing connections for material through system or network controlled or operated by or for the service provider it will be shielded from liability for copyright infringement10 this safe harbor also prot ects the service provider for any intermediate and transient storage of the material in the course of conveying the digital information however qualification for this safe rbor is subject to several conditions including11 data transmission occurs through an automated technical process without selection of the mate rial by the service provider the service provider does not dete rmine the recipients of the material intermediate or transient copies stored on the providers system or network must not be accessible to anyone other than the designated recipients and such copies must not be retained on the system longer than is reasonably necessaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32037crs3 12 caching is defined as intermediate and

content for purposes of improving network performance caching12 helps to reduce the service providers network congestion and increase download speeds for subsequent requests for the same data for example subscribers to service provider may transmit certain material to other users of the providers system or network at the direction of those users the service provider may via an automated process retain copies of this material for limited time so that subsequent requests for the same material can be fulfilled by transmitting the retained copy rather than retrieving the material from the original source on the network13 immunity for service providers that utilize system caching is provided on the condition that the isp complies with the following14 the content of cached material th at is transmitted to subsequent users is not modified by the service provider the provider complies with industr standard rules regarding the refreshing reloading or other updating of the cached material the provider does not interfere wi th the ability of technology that returns hit count information that would otherwise have been collected had the website not been cached to the person who posted the material the provider must impose the same conditions that the originalposter of the material required for access such as passwords or payment of fee the provider must remove or block

activity is apparent17 where the provider has the right and ability to control the infringingactivity it must not derive financial benefit directly attributable to that activity upon receiving proper notificati on of claimed infringement the service provider must act expeditiously to remove or block access to the material the service provider must designate an agent to receive notificationsof claimed infringement the contact information for this agent must be filed with the register of copyrights 18 and also be displayed to the public on the service providers website copyright owners must adhere to prescribed procedure to inform the providers designated agent of claimed infringement to constitute effective notification the copyright owner must co mply substantially with the statutory requirements of 512 c3 19 the notification is in writing signed physically or electronically by person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright allegedly infringed the notification identifies the material that is claimed to have beeninfringed and provides sufficient in formation allowing the service provider to locate the material the complaining party includes statement under penalty ofperjury that the party has good faith belief that the use of the material is not authorized by th copyright owner and that the information in the notification is accurate 512 d information location tools the fourth safe harbor classification immunizes service providers that provide users access to websites that contain infringing material by using information location tools such as hypertext links indexes and directories 20 the conditions attached are substantially similar to those that apply to the system storage safe harbor provision disc ussed above 512 c including lack of actual or constructiv knowledge requirement s notice and take down procedures and absence of direct fina ncial benefit21 the rationale for protecting service providers under this provi sion is to

finding in formation possible on the internet22 without safe harbor for providers of these tools the human editors and cataloguers compiling internet directories might be overly cauti ous for fear of being held liable for infringement notice and takedown procedure one condition common to three of the four categories is the requirement that upon proper notification by the copyright owner of online material being displaye d or transmitted without authorization service provider must expeditiously remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing material23 this notice and takedown obligation does not apply when the service provider functions as passi ve conduit of inform ation under 512a but is condition that must be met to obtain shelter under the remain ing three safe harbor provisions as indicated by the eligibility conditions in each subsection of 512b d the notice and takedown procedure varies slightly for each to prevent abuse of the notice and takedown procedure 512f provides damages costs and attorneys fees to an service provider that is injured by knowing material misrepresentation that an item or activity is infringing24 for example any person who sends cease and desist letter to service provider with the knowledge that the claims of copyrigh t infringement are false may be liable to the accused infringer for damages eligibility threshold for safe harbor for protection under any of the exemptions party must first meet the st atutory definition of service provider the dmca provides two distinct definitions one applicable to the first provision and the second applicable to all of th others under 512a the transitory communications provision service provide r is narrowly defined as an tity offering the transmission routing or pr oviding of connections for digital online communications between or among points speci fied by user of material of the users choosing without modification to the content of the material as sent or received25 the remaining three subsections utilize broader definition of service provider applicable to provider of online services or network access or the operator of facilities therefor26 for example this definition encompasses providers offering internet access email chat room and web page hosting services27 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32037crs6 28 17 usc 512i1ab 29 standard technical measures is defined at 512i2

repeat copyright infringers the provider must accommodate and not interfere with standardtechnical measures 29 that are used by copyright owners to identify or protect their works such as di gital watermarks or digital rights management technologies affirmative duty to police infringing activity pursuant to 512 m the dmca safe harbor provisions are not conditioned upon service provider monitoring its service or affirmatively seeking facts indicating infringing activity30 one us district court has noted that this provision of 512 rep resents legislative determination that copyright owners must th emselves bear the burden of policing for infringing activity service providers are under such duty31 yet some legal commentators suggest that courts ve nevertheless created back door requirement for isps to police their system s in search of copyright infringement by strictly construing the 512i obliga tion to implement repeat infringer termination policy as an affirmative duty to actively investigate potential infringement32 these judicial interpretations of the termination requirements in section 512i1a discussed below ar guably may be contrary to congresss intent in 512m as indicated in committee report language accompanying the dmca legislation the committee does not intend this termination provision to undermine the principles of new subsection m by suggesting that provider must investigate possible infringements mon itor its service or make difficult judgments as to whether conduct is or is not infringing however those who repeatedly or flagrantly abuse their acce ss to the internet through disrespect for the intellectual property rights of others should know that there is realistic threat of losing that access33 judicial interpretation of the safe harbors

and in re aimster copyright litigation 35 the courts denied safe har bor protection to the companies napster and aimster on the ground that t hose companies did not meet the eligibility requirements specified by the dmca bo th of these companies operated peerto peer networking services that facilitated sharing over the internet of music files stored on their users computer hard drives using peertopeer software offered by napster and aimster36 mp3 song files the major ity of which were unauthorized for distribution by their copyright owne rs were uploaded and downloaded freely and repeatedly to the alarm of the music recording industry napster asserted that its operations were protected by the 512a safe harbor provision claiming that it offered the t ransmission routing or providing of connections for digital online communications37 the district court in napster found that the infringing material was ex changed over the internet not through napsters servers and therefore napster did not provide connections through its system38 on the basis of this determination the court rule d that napster had failed to demonstrate that it qualifie d for the 512a safe har bor in addition the court noted that even if napster had met the criteria in 512a it did not satisfy the threshold eligibility requirements in 512 i in particular th termination policy provision the court found that the plaintiffs in the case had raised genuine issues of material fact about whether napster had reasonably implemented policy of terminating repeat infringers when it introduced evidence that napster had not adopted formal termination policy until two months after the filing of the lawsuit against it39 this belated attempt to adopt termination po licy would have prevented napster from seeking liability protection under any of the four safe harbors the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit in napster rejected blanket conclusion that 512 of the dmca will never protect secondary infringers but commented that the plaintiffs raise serious questions regarding napsters ability tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32037crs8 40 napster 239 f3d at 1025 41 id 42 id 43 aimster

unde r 512d the information location tools provision whether copyright owners must give service provide rs official notice pursuant to 512c3 in order for the pr ovider to have knowledge of infringement on its system and whether napster had in fact complied with the termination policy requirement of 512i1a41 nevertheless until these issues could be addressed at trial the district courts approval of preliminary injunction against napster was appropriate because the plaintiffs had demonstrated that the balance of hardships tips in their favor42 in lawsuit similar to napster record company and music publishing plaintiffs charged the peertopeer filesharing serv ice aimster with contributory and vicarious infringement of copyrights held by the plai ntiffs in addition to distributing file sharing software aimster provided online tutorials on its website which methodically demonstrated how to transf er and copy copyrighted works over the aimster system43 in addition the aimster software allowed users to encrypt all the file exchanges scheme that effectiv ely prevented aimster from gaining knowledge of the type of content being transferred unlike napster aimster had adopted termination policy for repeat infringers before lawsuit was filed against it however the district court in aimster found that the termina tion policy could not be implemented in reality because the encryption technology provided by aimster made it impossible to determine which users were transferring copyrighted files44 the court thus found aimster inelig ible for any safe harbor pr otections because its repeat infringer policy did not meet th requirement of 512i1a45 in upholding the district courts preliminary injunction the us court of appeals for the seventh circuit noted the dmca provides series of safe rbors for internet service providers and related entities but none in which aimster can moor the common element of the dmcas safe harbors is that th service provider must do what it can reasonably be asked to do to prevent the use of its service by repeat infringers far from doing anything to discourage repeat infringers of the plaintiffs copyrights aimster invited them to do so showed them how they could do so with ease using its system and by teaching its users how to encrypt their unlawful distribution of copyrighted materials disabled itself from doing anything to prevent infringement46httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32037crs9 47 357 f3d 1072 9th cir 2004 48 file stored in binary format is computerreadable but not humanreadable see

receiving response the plaintiff then filed copyright infringement suit against aol and other parties the court of appeals for the ninth circuit in ellison upheld the district courts conclusion that there were triable issues of material fact concerning ellisons contributory copyright infringement claim on the basis that reasonable trier of fact could find that aol had reason to know of the potentially infringing activity and had materially contributed to it51 although aol did not have actual knowledge of the infringement aols failure to receive the plaintiffs dmca notification was due to its own fault in not promptly updating its designated agent contact email address with the copyright office52 due to this error the email sent by the plaintiff was routed to defunct email account

copyright infringement liability54 the ninth circuit reversed the district courts conclu sion that aol qualified for safe harbor limitation of liability the appe llate court found at l east triable issue of material fact regarding aols thre shold eligibility for safe harbor under 512i55 first the court explained that 512i1a has three separate requirements for service provider to fulfill adopt policy that provides for th termination of service access for repeat copyright infringers in appropriate circumstances inform users of the service policy and implement the policy in reasonable manner the court determined that there was ample evidence in the record to suggest that aol failed to satisfy the last of these requirements because aol had changed the email address to which infringement notifica tions were being sent and did not close the old email account or forward the messa ges to the new address aol allowed notices of potential copyright infringement to fall into vacuum and to go unheeded56 this fact alone provides basis for reasonable jury to find that aol did not reasonably implement policy against repeat infringers57 thus the appellate court remanded the case for trial on ellisons contributory infringement claim and if aol is found liable on aols eligibility under 512 i to assert the safe harbor defense58 in als scan inc v remarq communities inc the us court of appeals

that he had not strictly complied with section 512c367 the us district court instead considered whether the plaintiffs imperfect noti ce satisfied the dmcas substantial compliance requirement the court noted that hendrickson did not include in his notice written statement attesting to the good faith nd accuracy of his infringement claim as required by 512c3avvi68 in addition the plaintiff

limited to service providers such as yahoo and google that provide links to millions of websites and does not c over service provider that links to relatively small number of websites with whom the isp has contract ual relationship84 the perfect 10 court dismissed the plainti ffs arguments as being without merit noting that 512a includes isps that provide connection to infringing material also nothing in 512d limits its applicability only to isps that provide links to millions of websites with which the service provider lacks contractual relationships85 thus the court allowed the defendant

district court in in re verizon internet services inc determined that the 512h subpoena process provides substantial prot ection to service providers and their customers against overly aggre ssive copyright owners and unwarranted subpoenas98 in particular it noted that the dm ca provides disincentives for false representations under the act making it cos tly for anyone to seek subpoena on the basis of intentional misrepr esentations and thereby furt her ensuring that subpoenas will only be used in circumstances of good faith allegations of copyright infringement99 three months later the cour t upheld the constitutionality of the dmcas subpoena provision in another proceeding against verizon stating that the dmca contains adequate safeguards to ensure that the first amendment rights of internet users will not be curtailed100 the court in dicta claimed that owing to builtin safeguards it is unlikely that 512h w ill require disclosure to any significant degree of the identity of i ndividuals engaged in protected anonymous speech as opposed to those engaged in unprotected copyright infringement101 the court explained that whatever marginal impact the dmca subpoena authority may have on the expressive or nonymity rights of internet us ers is vastly outweighed by the extent of copyright infringement ove r the internet through peertopeer file sharing which is the context of the

specifically blocking access to infringing material and terminating subscribes account 113 17 usc 512bd 114 17 usc 512aupholding the riaa subpoenas109 the reversal was predicated on the appellate courts findings that under 512 subpoena may be issued only to an isp engaged in storing material that is infringing or the subject of infringing activity on its servers not to an isp acting as passive condu it for data transferred between two internet users and an isp acting as conduit fo r p2p file sharing does not involve the storage of infringing material on the isps server the court rested its decision on techni cal interpretation of 512h and the overall structure of 512 examining closel the crossreferences of subsection h it noted that one of the required elements in the subpoena application is that the copyright owner identifies the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material110 the court agreed with verizon that it is impossible to comply with this requirement when an isp is acting as mere conduit because matter what information the copyright owner may provide the isp can neither remove nor disable access to the infringing material because that material is not stored on the isps server s verizon can not remove or disable one users access to infringing material resident on another users computer because verizon does not control the content on its subscribers computers111 the court rejected the riaas contention that an isp could disable access by terminating the infringers account with th isp blocking access to infringing material and terminating an isps user account are separate remedies elsewhere under 512112 notice and takedown requirement s of 512bd that is disabling access to infringing material apply to isps when they are storing infringing material either as temporary cache of web page as website stored in the isps server or as an information locating tool hosted by an isp113 but not when it is routing infringing material to or from personal co mputer owned and used by subscriber114 the court reasoned that the reference to disabling access for purposes of issuing subpoena is distinct from terminating serv ice thus because the isp does not have access to material residing on users computer it cannot disable access to it by others examining the overall structure of th statute the court concluded that the presence in 512h of three separate refere nces to 512c and the absence of any reference to 512a suggests the subpoena power of 512h applies only to ispshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32037crs18 115 verizon 351 f 3d at 123637

riaas concerns regarding the widespread infringement of its members copyrights and their need for legal tools to combat it but it would not rewrite the dmca to ddress those concerns that prerogative rests squarely with the congress in re charter communications on january 4 2005 divided panel of the us court of appeals for the eighth circuit reached the same conclusion regarding the dmca subpoena power as the verizon appellate court116 at issue was charter communications motion to quash the riaa s subpoenas requesting that the internet service provider produce the names physi cal addresses tele phone numbers and mail addresses of 200 charter customers the eighth circuit ruled that 512h does not authorize copyright owner to request subpoena for an isp that only acts as conduit for copyrighted material transferred between two users117 in dicta the court acknowledged the difficulties that copyrigh t owners face in deterring unlawful p2p filesharing without first learning of the identities of persons engaged in the activity however the court pointed out that this information could be discovered through alternative means such as john doe lawsuits118 legal device that the riaa has been using in the aftermath of verizon in order to obtain courtordere d subpoenas119 conclusion among the dmcas significant changes to the copyright act is the creation of 512 to protect service
