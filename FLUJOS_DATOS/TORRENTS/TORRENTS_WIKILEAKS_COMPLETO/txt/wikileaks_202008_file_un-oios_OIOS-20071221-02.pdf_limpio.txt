united nations office of the high commissioner for refugees unhcr executive summary from june to september 2007 the office of internal oversight services oios conducted review of results based management rbm at the united nations office of the high commissioner for refugees unhcr oios found that unhcr s operating environment poses considerable obstacles to effective rbm implementation these i nclud challenges in defining and measuring success in the area at the crux of its mandate that is the provision of international protection as well as challenge s in accounting for the numerous factors outside its control that can hinder the achievement of planned objectives despite these obstacles oios found unhcr to show demonstrat ed commitment to strengthening implementation of rbm culminating in range of recent initiatives aimed at addressing specific gaps it has systematically identified oios nonetheless found number of potential risks to the success of unhcr s rbm efforts as it moves forward low staff awareness and ownership of rbm stand to impe the efforts if not countered by greater communications supports and guidance in addition aspects of the current rbm framework itself hinder its intended use as tool for increased accountabili ty and better informed decision making staff spend c onsiderable time on rbm related activities but lack time and forums for reflecting on and applying the information these activities generate to their programming decision s or to donors and management s resource decisions despite unhcr s efforts to casc ade its objectives throughout the agency oios found that these objectives have not fully trickled down to all levels of the agency s planning and reporting processes and are not consistently enshrined in individual operational or partner performance appraisal systems and w ith regard to how unhcr measures its performance in the field oios saw need for further refinement of indicators clearer delineation between external and internal factors affecting performance and clearer differentiation of unhcr s contribution to results from that of its partners in addition to assessing the formal mechanics of rbm at unhcr oios also addresses unhcr s success in realizing the underlying practical purpose of rbm namely to learn from performance so as to im prove over time in this vein oios found that unhcr staff lack adequate mechanisms for horizontal knowledge and information sharing likewise unhcr s partners indicate the agency has not adequately consulted them or relied on their expertise as mean s of learning and improving finally although unhcr has qualified internal evaluation section in place it is currently serving in policy advisory capacity 3 oios urges that this section s programme evaluation and methodological assistance function s be fully restored as these highly rbm relevant activities are not currently being performed on scale commensurate with unhcr s size the scope of its work and the manifold challenges it faces based on these findings oios makes 17 recommendations aim ed at strengthening unhcr s rbm system as tool to aid the agency in defining its objectives managing and measuring progress toward them and using this information to reinforce accountability and inform decision making among the recommendations oios c onsiders to be of highest priority are the following unhcr should install centralized function for vetting the cascading of its objectives throughout the agency and it should vest rbm focal points not only with compliance but also with advancing rbm throughout the agency unhcr should lengthen the period between prior year data reporting and subsequent year planning activities in order to allow organizational learning to be brought to bear on planning and managing toward objectives unhcr should ensure that all work plans performance reports and sub agreements clearly spell out the results for which individuals operational units and partners are responsible as well as external and internal factors affecting the successful achievement of objectives in order to strengthen accountabil ity unhcr should further refine its indicators of achievement to include clearer differentiation between outputs and their associated outcomes and impacts more consistent focus on proportion of need abated rather than raw numbers served inclusion of indicators related to the enabling environment and inclusion of indicators related to target populations attitudes toward unhcr s work unhcr should articulate medium to long term strategic plan for bringing resource and results data to bear on budgetary decision making in order to forge stronger results based budgeting rbb component within rbm unhcr should strengthen the evaluation role of its evaluation section and should more systematically track follow up to the recommendations emanating from evaluations unhcr should revisit its trainings and materials with view to clearly conveying the basic purpose and core concepts of rbm as well as embedding an rbm approach within all trainings and materials 4 cont ents paragraphs page i background 116 915 introduction 12 9

int ernal oversight services oios conducted review of results based management rbm at the united nations office of the high commissioner for refugees unhcr1 this review is part of series of inspections t inform wider scale assessment of rbm in t he united nations secretariat2 2 this final report reflects adjustments undertaken in response to comments received by unhcr in reference to the draft inspection report of 16 november 2007 unhcr has subsequently submitted its comments which have bee n duly reflected in this final report and its highlights oios greatly appreciates the courtes ies and cooperation unhcr has extended to the inspection team throughout this exercise3 b results based management at the united nations secretariat 3 the conce pt of rbm has been referred to frequently within the un4 but there is single authoritative or commonly understood definition of the term as noted by the joint inspection unit jiu5 rbm is sometimes used interchangeably with the more explicitly defi ned process of results based budgeting rbb6 oios s analysis is guided by the understanding that rbb has been introduced to the organization as first step toward full scale deployment of rbm7 which is viewed as more comprehensive both processes sta rt from the premise that in order to be effective at what they do organizations must articulate the precise objectives they are attempting to achieve then operationalize these into clearly defined indicators against which to monitor performance8 but wh ereas rbb i s tied specifically to the resource allocation stage of decision making rbm addresses the full cycle of programme implementation and all activities that go with the managerial role 1 an on site visit to unhcr headquarters in geneva was undertaken from 18 29 june 2007 followed by visit to the unhcr malaysia office in kuala lumpur from 23 27 july 2007 and interviews at unhcr s new york office on 10 august 2007 teleconferences with 34 staff re presenting seven additional unhcr country offices were conducted on 8 august 22 august and september 4 2007 2 the first inspection in this series conducted from march to june 2007 focused on rbm at the united nations economic and social commission fo r asia and the pacific escap see oios report ins 07003 3 oios would in particular like to acknowledge the full support and cooperation of the designated

building on gares55231 the parameters of rbb eg in ares53205 a53500 and add1 a53655 a54456 a55543 a57478 7 for example this is in line with oios s recommendations on taking rbb to the next level as per a57474 46 implementation of all provisions of general assembly resolution 55231 on results based budgeting 8 one set of such indicators includes the smart c riteria that is specific measurable attainable relevant and timebound 10 4 rbm can essentially be seen as paradigm of organizational governance that brings centrality to the results associated with public service delivery and to the alignment of resources and management instruments behind the achievement of these results in enabling planning to be driven by intended future effects rat her than by rote bureaucratic precedent its ultimate purpose is to strengthen the relevance efficiency and effectiveness of organizational performance in addition to this forward looking focus on targeted results at its core rbm is also focused on ret rospective organizational learning that is the organization s ability to learn from performance data and incorporate this learning into subsequent decision making about resources and other aspects of management 5 the importance of rbm has been embedded in series of united nations reforms undertaken over the past decade these began with the aim expressed by then secretary general kofi annan in his 1997 reform programme9 of shifting the focus of planning budgeting reporting and oversight from how t hings are done to what is accomplished 10 this aim is also reflected most recently in the current priority attached to improving governance strengthening management effectiveness and accountability 11 6 the operative elements of the united nations secretariat rbm or rbb system are reflected in the rules and regulations governing programme planning the programme aspects of the budget the monitoring of implementation and the methods for evaluation ppbme12 and in the instructions that are periodicall issued in support of planning budgeting13 and performance reporting14 the concepts and requirements projected by these guide the practices adhered to by all individual secretariat programmes 7 at the front end the rbm process starts with secretariat programme s articulating results framework typically referred to as log frame 15 based on assumed cause andeffect relationships the log frame comprises set of overarching objectives representing the given programme s longer term rationale then ar ticulates set of expected accomplishments eas that reflect more specific outcomes to which the programme intends to contribute within given biennium finally the log frame specifies for each of the eas set of measurable indicators of achievement ioas and their associated performance measures pms intended to capture the anticipated degree of change ie from baseline to target within the given biennium 8 the log frames developed as part of strategic planning also serve as reference points fo r resource allocation by the general assembly ga the programme of work approved with the budget also comprises planned schedule of outputs those concrete activities products and deliverables intended to be the vehicles for achieving the 9 a51950 renewing the programme for reform 10 ibid 240 11 see eg a60883 report of the secretary general on implementation of decisions contain ed in the

results frameworks also provide the logical structure for reporting requirements through the integrated monitoring and documentation information system imdis which is ultimately utilized for pr eparation of the secretary general s biennial programme performance report ppr c inspection objectives and methodology 1 inspection objectives 9 the current inspection exercise was conceived as one in series of rbm inspections undertaken to extract findings and recommendations at the programme17 level that might help inform the future development of the organization wide rbm framework18 this series of rbm inspections are independent of management s response to review of rbm requested by member states19 and will incorporate review of responses of the secretariat to recommendations made by the jiu in its series of reports on rbm20 and the ensuing ga endorsement of the jiu benchmarking framework21 while individual inspection reports in this series emphasi ze actions taken at the programme level and issues which are within the realm of local decision making oios also seeks findings which have potentially broader appli cability in this respect oios is accumulating memorandum i tems warrant ing further cons ideration these items are interspersed throughout the findings section of this report emanating from th is objective of informing development of rbm throughout the secretariat the overall purpose of th present inspection was to determine whether unhcr s current systems practices and management strategies are conducive to the assumptions and objectives of rbm as strategy for organizational governance and management thus the overarching areas subject to review included the following22 translatio n of mandates into operational objectives throughout the agency b measurability of performance indicators c practice of continuous results monitoring and evaluation d use of results information to guide decision making and partnerships and capacity developme nt for rbm 2 methodology 10 in conducting the current inspection oios used combination of qualitative and quantitative data collection methods including the following main data sources 16 standard output categories are defined by ppbm rule 1054 17 oios refers to unhcr as secretariat programme rather than secretariat entity for greater parity with other reports in this series 18 see terms of reference associated with this inspection 19 as per gares61245 also of relevance is the review experiences gained with the changes made in the planning and budget process as requested by gares58269 20 most

auditors report on its review of rbm 24 these consist ed of 1 review of the cascading of unhcr objectives throughout the organization including the accountability mechanism associated with the achievement of these objectives at both the operational level ie from global strategic objectives to divis ion and bureau strategic objectives to sectionunitservice work plans and country operations plans for the eight country offices and the individual level ie the inclusion of objectives along with an accountability mechanism featuring incentives for performance and disincentives for underperformance in individuals career management system cms work plans 2 review of agreements and subagreements with its partners in the eight country offices specified in points k and n 3 review of inte rnal and external materials related to unhcr s age gender and diversity mainstreaming agdm initiative in order to determine how deeply and concretely the core elements of this initiative have permeated the organization and 4 review of all unhcr ev aluation reports and policy papers from 2006 2007 primarily to ascertain the extent to which they link to rbm itself as mechanism and to the global strategic objectives specifically 25 this survey referred to in this report as staff survey was condu cted from 17 june to 17 july 2007 two samples were employed first purposive sample was drawn of staff members whose titles suggested they might be closely engaged in the rbm process of total of 569 unhcr staff members sampled 149 responded for 26 per cent response rate second random sample was drawn of all remaining staff minus those who would likely have little to say about the process eg interns short term consultants and so on of total of 2912 unhcr staff members sampled 331 responded for an 11 per cent response rate 26 the survey referred to in this report as the partner survey was conducted from 8 august to 14 september 2007 two samples were employed first purposive sample was drawn of partner organizations that partner with unhcr broadly across number of settings and initiatives of total of 68 such partners 5 responded for 7 per cent response rate second purposive sample was drawn of partners that have partnered with unhcr on smaller scale of total of 333 unhcr partners 35 responded for an 11 per cent response rate 27 the survey was conducted from 2 august to 14 september 2007 sample of was drawn of unhcr s governmental and inter governmental donors who had pledged above the level of 100000 in 2007 of total of 57 unhcr donors 11 responded for 19 per cent response rate despite this low response rate these donors jointly represent 58 per cent of unhcr s total 2006 contributions ie 6294 million of 11 billion this source is referred to in this report as donor survey 28 total of 20 separate interviews and 9 focus group discussions encompassing 48 staff members were conducted with unhcr staff and management at unhcr headquarters in geneva for total of 68 staf f members interviewed in addition 8 interviews with unhcr staff were conducted in unhcr s new york office as were 18 staff interviews in unhcr s malaysia office 13 country offices including by teleconference29 its donors30 and its united nations and non partners31 g observations of proceedings of the standing committee of unhcr s executive committee excom in geneva32 h demonstrations of key software tools related to unhcr s rbm mechanism33 and i an official site visit to one country office and regional protection hub in order to instantiate the main findings gleaned from all other data sources 34 11 the methodo logy associated with this analysis is limited by the concurrent timing of this inspection with number of initiatives underway at unhcr to improve rbm the impact of which is as yet unknown the methodology is also limited by low response rates related t the general staff partner and donor survey s and the lack of representation of institutional donors35 in the donor sample 36 it is also limited by the relatively small number of unhcr country offices with which oios was able to conduct focus group discus sions and from which to compile operational data within the time of the review d unhcr mandate structure governance and funding37 1 mandate and structure 12 unhcr s work is underpinned by an international legal regime originally enshrined in the 1951 united nations convention relating to the status of refugees and its 1967 protocol in the unhcr statute38 the agency is mandated with providing international protection to refugees and to seek permanent39 solutions on their behalf unhcr s governing bodi have since directed unhcr40 to assist other persons of concern pocs besides refugees including asylum seekers returnees stateless persons 29 these included 34 staff members in the following 7 offices colombia hungary iraq sri lanka sudan sweden and the united states of america washington dc these offices were selected based on several criteria including size of operations geographic distribution mix of regional hubs and country offices mix of persons of concern poc profiles and mix of protection and assistance profiles 30 one focus group discussion encompassing 3 major donors was conducted with unhcr partners at unhcr headquarters in geneva in addition 1 individual interview and 1 focus group discussio n encompassing 2

second or offbudget year of the current biennium55 for 2007 unhcr s requested pre revision annual programme budget amoun ted to approximately 1043 billion decrease of 9 per cent from its 2006 budget of 1145 billion this on the heels of increases from 2004 to 2005 3 per cent and from 2005 to 2006 17 per cent 56 oios notes that unhcr has experienced gaps between budgeted funds and funds available for number of years beginning in 2006 unhcr introduced 20 per cent cap on all programme budgets ie both the annual programme budget approved by excom and in the rb funded administrative budget57 unhcr field and headquarters managers were thus requested to plan their operational budgets based on 80 per cent of the approved budget58 16 unhcr s administrative functions are supported through the s regular budget59 roughly 3 per cent of unhcr s total budget has bee n rb funded in recent years with the balance financed through voluntary contributions or extrabudgetary xb sources donated by individual member states as well as inter governmental supranational institutional and private donors60 since the late 1990s the proportion of unhcr s total xb funds earmarked to specific countries or specific sectoralthematic initiatives referred to by unhcr as tightly earmarked funds has gradually risen while at the same time there has been concomitant decrease in th proportion of earmarks to specific regions or subregions referred to by unhcr as broadly earmarked funds61 the percentage of unearmarked or unrestricted funds has remained steady over this same period at approximately 20 per cent 62 54 excom s annual meeting focuses on the review and approval of unhcr s programmes and budget these annual excom sessions are public and are attended by number of non excom member states igos

additional 20 million in targeted budgetary reductions was identified in 2q06 approximately half of which was implemented at headquarters see aac961026 58 aac961026 as part of these measures managers were directed to prioritize immediate tangible aid to refugees and other pocs while deferring ngerterm strategic goals as well as travel consulting budgets and other less directly beneficiary oriented line items wherever possible 59 unhcr statute 20 60 aac961011 aac961026 61 in 2006 tightly earmarked funds amounted to 525 per ce nt of the total budget and broadly earmarked funds amounted to 275 per cent of the total budget 62 unhcr 2006 global report 16 ii findings unhcr has demonstrated commitment to strengthening results orientation but significant challenges remain 1 challenges to effective rbm implementation 17 oios noted some unique features of unhcr s operating environment that speak to complex ity in implement ing rbm including inherent unpredictability of population movements and national government policies b expansion in target populations to idps and other pocs in addition to traditional cross border refugees c advocacy and protection work can entail mov ing intangible outcomes eg associated with the crea tion of an enabling environment63 and d the proliferation of actors in the field leading to the need for greater coordination of efforts clear er division of labour and unambiguous leadership as reflect ed in the humanitarian reform agenda64 18 these features of unhcr s operating environment pose significant challenges related to defining and measuring objectives which may need to be seen as moving target and which does not always fit neatly into gleyear planning and reporting cycle the increasing number and mobility of pocs embedded in u rban settings in the host country further complicates unhcr s ability to measure its own effectiveness compared to the more straig htforward catchment area of refugee camp s finally there are inherent difficulties in operationalizing coordination within the humanitarian reform agenda and in parsing out unhcr s contributions to results from that of its partners 2 unhcr s commitment to strengthening its result s orientation 19 despite these manifold challenges oios noted number of positive indications of the agency s commitment to strengthening its rbm mechanism through series of initiatives aimed at resolving deficits identified in 2005 gap analysis of rbm 65 these initiatives include the xpansion and refinement of unhcr s global strategic objectives gsos and of the standards and indicators sis that operationalize the gsos 63 oios recognizes that the inherent difficulty in operationalizing some of its key outcomes has in the past led to reluctance to operationalize these in better way based on the findings of this exercise oios asserts that it is indeed possible to operationalize unhcrs protection work and many unhcr staff agree with this assessment 64 iasc guidance note

conceptualize and implement the initiatives enumerated above as concrete steps toward improving rbm 20 in addition to these concrete initiatives oios note d number of softer aspects of unhcr s culture and structure that speak to its progress toward improved results orientation staff interviewe understand the general purpose of rbm68 and are aware of odms and its central role in this area with many in terviewees adding that they appreciate and value its efforts 69 furthermore many staff members recognize the leaps unhcr has made from the input based days when ccomplishment was associated 66 specific features of focus s functionality include the ability to cascade the gsos throughout operational work plans in more streamlined way the ability to link resources to objectives albeit at later phase the abili ty to parse out unhcr s contributions from those of its partners and account for external factors as well as achieving number of other desirable planning and reporting improvements eg housing the results framework in shared realtime platform ag gregating disaggregating data in variety of permutations fielding and aggregating alternative sis and the ability to enter data offline for later uploading online 67 oios takes note of odms s location as cross cutting management function reporting directly to the dhc its active role in working with the senior management committee comprised of the hc the dhc and the ahcs for protection and operations and its function as secretariat to unhcr s rbm board comprised of the smc as well as the dir ectors for international protection division of external relations division of human resources management division of finance and supply management division of operations support division of information systems and communications and one bureau direc tor serving for one year term 68 on an unaided basis for example when staff survey respondents were asked what they understood the main objectives of rbm to be over half 530 per cent mentioned various aspects related to defining objectives while another third of respondents named aspects associate with improved planning 300 per cent 69 oios notes positively that these initiatives were underway before oios notified unhcr of this inspection 18 with the ability to spend70 also oios found that staff and m anagement exhibit high degree of candour and introspection about rbm and their own performance this culture of constructive reflection constitutes critical hallmark of rbm and of organizations that seek to learn and improve finally oios acknowle dges rbm s central place on the agenda of the senior management committee smc the creation of the rbm board with odms as its secretariat and the recent enshrinement of rbm as centrepiece of its management strategy for targeting the gsos 71 b despite in itiatives to strengthen results orientation lack of staff understanding and buy in could hamper success 21 while staff awareness of rbm s overall purpose is high oios found specific understanding of core rbm elements to be low many reflexively referred to rbm as performance reporting and accountability mechanism but were less clear on its potential for inform ing decision making in addition number of staff members use d the terms outputs outcomes and impact interchangeably even though rbm h inges on clear d ifferentiation of these terms72 oios is aware of unhcr management s tactic of embedding core rbm elements throughout the agency without necessarily referring to these elements explicitly as rbm but conjectures that this subtler approa ch might jeopardize effective implementation of rbm among wider cross section of staff also among some staff buyin to rbm is impeded by lack of belief that their rbm efforts have yielded practical benefits many even suggest the time and resource s they devote to rbm take away from their substantive functions with little sense that management uses the information generated for any other purpose than to placate donors 73 some describe gradual accumulation of retooled processes and revis ion of d ocumentation requirements without ever doing away with earlier ones the most common attitude oios found among staff toward the rbm initiatives was therefore that of cautious 70 while 577 per cent of respondents in the staff rvey say that unhcr s operations management system oms is an extremely effective or somewhat effective tool for helping unhcr achieve its objectives only 69 per cent give oms the former rating and the remaining 508 per cent give it the latter rati ng another 274 per cent say it is neither effective nor ineffective and 148 per cent say it is somewhat ineffective or extremely ineffective 71 see 2008 2009 gsos strategies and management priority 101 consolidating results based management throughout the organization including improved policy development planning reporting and evaluation in addition in some unhcr communications rbm constituted part of its gsos for 2006 and 2007 but in others it did not see eg unhcriom0822004 unhcrfom08420042006 and unhcr s results based management gap analysis current situation and future directions geneva odms 11 october 2005 compare to the 2006 global report and the 2007 gsos 72 oios is aware of an outstanding debate over the nomen clature surrounding effectiveness and impact however in common parlance these terms are at present clearly defined per guidance in the form of the ppbme and unegs guiding documents terminology notwithstanding there is risk that this semantic debate will detract from the core issue that organizations should focus on long term results as well as short term results this is the case for humanitarian organizations including unhcr which engages in many other activities with potential longterm andor ecological effects eg provision of basic needs and whose core protection mandate explicitly focuses on durable solutions nonetheless oios is cognizant of the unique challenges humanitarian organizations like unhcr face in measuring impact w hen actual operations often end after short period 73 survey results point to staff members moderate level of utility of rbm system while half of staff respondents 510 per cent say the current operations management system is somewhat effective as tool for helping unhcr only 70 per cent say it is extremely effective with the remaining 420 per cent deeming it less than somewhat effective 19 optimis m staff are wait ing to determine whether and how current initiatives di ffer from their predecessors and how the might improve day today work74 donors echo this sentiment75 22 in terms of closing knowledge and perception gaps oios noted unhcr s infrastructure for conveying rbm concepts and instruments76 but found evidenc of comprehensive internal communications strategy that includes overarching communications objectives vehicles for achieving them and targeted audiences77 or documentation to suggest its individual communications elements are working oios is aware of the pending structural move of the programme coordination and operational support pcos78 service into greater support role under the umbrella of merger with the budget section to form the programme budget section pbs it also n otes however that in tandem with its current austerity measures unhcr has targeted training and professional development as an area toward which it will devote fewer resources this does clearly involve risk in terms of opportunities for embedding rbm concepts with in the body of internal capacity development activity79 finally to address staff buy in oios found need for greater consultati on with staff members in the design and development of key rbm initiatives oios takes at face value odms s claim that it consulted with key staff at various stages of each initiative underway however many staff members maintained that they were not consulted even in areas where they claim significant exper tise unhcr maintains that all rbm initiatives in the last two year s have been systematically vetted and approved by senior managemen t and all important changes to its rbm system 74 in the partner survey fully 700 per cent of respondents concur that unhcr has been either somewh at effective or extremely effective in defining results and managing toward them however while 571 per cent feel unhcr s rbm approach has gotten much better 238 per cent or gotten little better 333 per cent another 357 per cent feels i t has stayed about the same 75 in assessing unhcr s effectiveness in defining results and managing toward them donor respondents rate unhcr on either end of the continuum of extremely ineffective or extremely ineffective but roughly two thirds r ate it as somewhat effective and the remaining third rate it as neither effective nor ineffective when asked on open ended basis to explain their ratings donors tend to note the overall improvement they have witnessed at unhcr 76 oios noted the dedi cated rbm and odms corners of unhcr s website which include number of relevant items and to be relatively up to date in addition during oios s site visit at headquarters it was apparent that management kept staff members abreast of on going developm ents both by email and in town hall forum surrounding the outposting initiative while some staff members value this platform as an important source of information however oios cautions unhcr not to rely on this platform alone as means of communic ating to staff members for whom rbm might seem less salient 77 report by unhcr s igo also cites the inadequate level of supports as central determinant of unhcr s success in meeting its objectives these include general skills supports as well as skil ls specific to management s rbm related needs eg surrounding financial and human resource management see aac961028 paras 29 30 78 oios understands pcos to be the headquarters service responsible for developing trainings the standards and indica tors themselves and instructions and guidelines 79 oios noted in the staff survey for example that overall participation in unhcr s 10 main rbm related trainings was low ie ranging from low of 60 per cent respondents for the training in operation data management to only 360 per cent for the protection learning programme in addition over two thirds of respondents 680 per cent said the trainings they have received were much less or somewhat less than what they need to successfully fulf il their rbm role and when asked on an open ended basis what key improvements unhcr could make to rbm issues related to internal rbm capacity building formed the most common cluster of responses 229 per cent 20 approved by them it agreed that consultation and internal communication could be improved but claims that in each instance consultation has taken place c unhcr s results framework has improved but c larity can still be improved and goals should cascade through levels of operation in more consistent manner 1 refinements to unhcr s results framework 23 oios noted number of refineme nts to unhcr s results framework in recent planning cycles these include an expansion of unhcr s gsos between 2006 and 200780 followed in 2008 2009 by consolidation of the gsos81 stronger results oriented language82 and greater sense that eas constit ute the highest operational priorities associated with their corresponding gsos 83 in addition oios acknowledges unhcr s effort since 2007 to bring the language of the gsos closer to accepted organization wide norms and standards eg use of expected accomplishments and performance targets in the spirit of greater system wide coherence 84 oios also takes note of key improvement planned for the 2008 2009 cycle namely clearer differentiation between targeted objectives themselves and the manage ment strategies through which to achieve the m85 staff and donors widely agree that these changes have resulted in more comprehensive accurate depiction of unhcr s multifaceted activities 2 translation of corporate gsoseas to the regional country nd divisional level 24 in addition to these refinements oios also noted unhcr s emphasis on cascading the gsos throughout the agency that is translating these overarching corporate objectives into set of regional and divisional objectives which in t urn are translated into country section and individual specific objectives86 oios identified 80 this includes clearer unpacking of t he 2006 gsos in 2007 with an increase from 4 to 6 gsos 81 ibid also see 2008 2009 gsos this includes reduction in gsos from 2007 to 2008 2009 from 6 to 5 along with the addition in 2008 2009 of 5 strategies and management priorities associated wi th achieving the gsos 82 ibid oios notes the use of stronger results oriented language associated with each gso eg ensuring affirming realizing attaining guaranteeing etc in the 2008 2009 gsos than was the case in prior gsos 83 ibid since 2007 unhcr has appended to each gso to emphasize priority given to the eas 84 delivering as one report of the secretary general s high level panel on united nations system wide coherence in the areas of development humanitarian assistance and the environment new york united nations 9 november 2006 pp 40 42 see also 2007 and 2008 2009 gsos 85 2006 2007 and 2008 2009 gsos 86 results based management in unhcr unhcr s conceptual framework working draft odms 22 june 2006 memorandum item 1 successfully moving secretariat programmes toward greater results orientation requires more than improved technical systems it also requires effective communications training and consultation to promote understanding and buy in to rbm 21 two main shortfalls in the cascading process to date first most staff interviewees report that gains in the objectives comprehensiveness and accuracy have not been met with tools to help managers priorit ize among the various gsoseas from which they can choose 87 while some managers do not see the need for headquarters to support them in this prioritizing function others would welcome greater guidance88 25 second shortfall in the implementation of the cascading process surrounds the variable degree of cascading evident in planning and reporting instruments in its analysis of individual and operational work plans for the 2007 cycle89 oios found almost all individual work plans to be either explicitly or implicitly linked to the gsos and to their office s operational work plan similarly almost all operational work plans explicitly made reference to specific gsos and large number of specific ioas90 howev er the link between country office and bureau regional objectives was in some cases implicit rather than explicit and at present only quarter of operational work plans explicitly link ed their plan to rbm or to unhcr s emphasis on results91 oios also found very low level of linkage between partner sub agreements and the gsos outlined in country offices cops92 oios noted similar variability of cascading in unhcr s key reporting mechanisms for example unhcr s most recent performance reporting mechanism to donors and other stakeholders the 2006 global report mention s each of the four gsos for 2006 but for only two of these ie gsos 1 and 2 does it do so explicitly with the remaining two ie gsos 3 and 4 being covered indirectly by way of individual ea mentions also only 7 of unhcr s 27 eas for 2006 are explicitly referenced at all 93 in this regard it is unclear why guidelines provided by unhcr to its headquarters and country offices94 specifically require that annual country reports 87 unhcr s since 2007 added language to each gso pointing to its associated eas as key priorities see footnote 85 oios suggests that this does not directly prioritize which eas should be given priority over others either from corporate standpoint or withi n any given country or regional context in addition this approach leaves considerable leeway for alternative eas that is by suggesting that there are other less urgent eas that some country offices might be active in oios does not view this leeway either positively or negatively in its own right 88 in the respondent survey fully third of staff who participated in the management learning programme 331 per cent said that this training was not very closely related to rbm or not at all closely related to rbm and in interviews most country representatives reported that they largely rely on their own substantive experience and that of their staff for priority setting rather than on guidance from headquarters hoping that their decisions will be acceptable to the regional bureaux oios notes that while this approach is consistent with decentralized bottom up approach to planning it could be reinforced by shared standards for priority setting and for effectively managing toward these prior ities in ways that might complement managers substantive and regional expertise 89 oios analyzed 6 headquarters level operational plans 4 country office and 2 regional office plans and 20 individual par plans from mix of headquarters and field offices documents included all divisional work plans from headquarters n12 as well as key individual work plans n20 oios did not conduct similar analysis of gso cascading for the 2008 2009 period as many operational units and regional and country of fices are still in the process of developing their work plans 90 oios noted an average of approximately 4 5 gsos and an average of 39 sis and other alternative indicators 91 oios noted that the effort to better link the gsos and the bureau plans and cops is relatively recent initiative 92 oios conducted formal analysis of 9 partner sub agreements across 5 of the country offices under review 93 this includes one direct reference to gso 1 one indirect reference to gso 2 4 direct references to gso 3 nd 1 direct reference to gso 4 during its observation of the excom standing committee s 39th session individual excom members took note of this need for greater alignment between reporting documents and the gsoseas 94 instructions and guidelines to unh cr field and headquarters on reporting on 2006 implementation in 2007 and planning for 2008 2009 geneva pcos 11 december 2006 22 acrs95 make explicit linkage s to gsos while there is such requirement for annual protection reports aprs 96 3 adequacy of ioas pms in operationalizing the eas 26 oios learned that as with the gsoseas unhcr has on an on going basis sought to expand and refine the ioas and pms that operationalize its eas 97 however oios found that these ioapms known internally as standards and indicators sis could more accurately and effectively capture unhcr s work for example oios found pivotal element of unhcr s protection work to be missing from the sis entirely namely those efforts that involve improving enabling environment many dips staff are skeptical that their work can be as easily operationalized as more concrete assistance related work98 in interviews however individual non dips and dips staff claim that protection can indeed be operationalized given appropriate methodological supports this gap in protection related sis reflects more generalized staff sentiment expressed in both in terviews and surveys99 that the current sis do not fully encapsulate the full spectrum of unhcr s work 27 oios though not in position to judge the substantive merit of individual sis identified number of specific methodological deficits that might c ompromise the sis utility in operationaliz ing the gsoseas in formal analysis of the sis oios found that individual s is are not explicitly link ed to corresponding gsoseas they are meant to articulate nor is each si clearly instantiated as an ou tput an associated outcome and where feasible an associated impact measure in addition some sis use suboptimal scales100 individual sis are used in conjunction with some poc groups but not with others without clear rationale101 and there is lack f comprehensive methodological 95 acrs which are drafted by country offices and only accessible internally review major developments the management of op erations and the main achievements and constraints encountered 96 aprs issued by country offices monitor the protection and rights of refugees and other pocs 97 practical guide to the systematic use of standards and indicators in unhcr operations seco nd edition division of operational services geneva unhcr 2006 98 oios acknowledges that unhcr is currently attempting to remedy this gap see the agenda for protection measuring protection by numbers see also the strengthening protection capacity project in the staff survey among those who took part in the protection learning programme 410 per cent said it was not very closely or not at all closely related to rbm making it the training viewed as the least relevant to rbm 99 staff survey r espondents tended to give unhcr middling ratings on the identification of programme performance indicators that are meaningful measures of unhcr s success in meeting its objectives 429 per cent rated unhcr as excellent 71 per cent or good 358 per cent on this item whereas 355 per cent rated it as fair and another 215 per cent rated it as poor 162 per cent or very poor 53 per cent 100 these include eg using yesno response set on country level statistics when percentage would be more helpful see si 14 do all asylum seekers have access to information on counseling on rsd procedures si 15 are reasons for rejection shared in writing with the applicant et ux 101 although differences in the number of indicators identified in the three operational level questionnaires are justified when additional areas have to be covered in refugee campsettlement indicators need to cover camp management food and nutrition water and sanitation oios was not always able to ascertain why some sis appear in one questionnaire and not in others even though these sis seem intuitively important in all three settings for example while health issues are covered extensively in the refugee campsettlement 5 sis they are c overed far less in the urban programme list 1 si and in the returnee area list 2 sis education is also theme under which the number of sis varies greatly 9 sis in the refugee campssettlements list 4 sis in the urban programmes list nd 3 sis in the returnee area list 23 guidance to help field staff measure overall need102 and to collect performance data in relatively standardized way that facilitates regional and corporate data aggregation103 oios found t hese methodological weaknesses to be mirrored in the operational work plans analyzed during this exercise104 28 managers have typically respon ded to the sis shortcomings in one of two ways neither of which oios found to be conducive to well functioning agency wide rbm system one has been to meet h q reporting require ment s regardless of how meaningful the selected sis are to managers own decision making and do nothing more with the result that performance monitoring can be disconnected from the work at hand 105 another response has been to meet h q requirements but to develop parallel performance monitoring systems that better account for what their offices do than the sis this response has led to individual performance monitoring system s that might be more meaningful but also ineffic ient in their duplicative use of staff resources and in their lack of linkage to shared corporate results framework 106 oios recognizes unhcrs effort to ensure that focus address both local and hq s data needs memorandum item 2 there is an inherent tension between the need on one hand for shared objectives that can be aggregated and reported on corporately and disaggregated for comparison and on the other hand the need for these objectives to resonate with and make sense in their local operating environment there is connected need to refrain from making data collection so onerous that it draws staff away from their substantive work memorandum item 3 the target or beneficiary population of given programme s activities constitutes critical level of analysis for assessing effectiveness and impact it is not sufficient to include individual community representatives alone or to solely rely on community inputs at the programme design stage 102 that is the denominator of effectiveness ratios of service data to overall need 103 such guidance appears in the practical guide or in the operations management learning programme and in the staff survey only 60 of staff claimed to have participated in the training in operational data management making this training the least frequented of any training moreover among those respondents who did participate in this training over quarter 265 per cent sa id it was not very closely or not at all closely related to rbm 104 none of the work plans clearly spelled out data collection strategy in addition most were comprised of outputs and outcomes only ie work plan explicitly included impact indi cators and in work plan was the linkage between outputs and their associated outcomes clear work plan explicitly addressed impact indicators staff aimed to ameliorate in the forthcoming year or impact achieved in the current year that had been t argeted in prior years activities oios also found individual plan mentioned impact finally among the performance indicators enumerated in operational work plans oios found that while some plans included precise baseline data and precise targets f or many or most indicators others did not 105 some managers for example state that they select indicators that are measurable as opposed to those that best represent what they do 106 unhcr s iog points to this issue as well see aac961028 24 24 d compliance with performance monitoring and repo rting requirements is generally high but is timeconsuming and seen as p rovid ing little payoff in decision making 29 in its analysis of unhcr s performance reports oios observed high degree of compliance with the instructions and guidelines overall although it found compliance to be more variable with respect to specific requirements107 in formal analysis of unhcr s document outlining compliance with planning and reporting requirements the instructions and guidelines to field and headquarters on repor ting on 2006 implementation in 2007 and planning for 2008 2009 oios noted number of changes aimed at further aligning planning budgeting and reporting closely with rbm108 oios commends unhcr for its efforts to simplify the format of internal reports to eliminate duplication between acrs aprs and the country and regional operations plans coprop 30 of greater concern to oios than compliance levels is the utility the outputs provide compared to the staff inputs required to produce them oios found that staff spend large proportion of their time on data collection performance monitoring and reporting among the 91 0 per cent of staff survey respondents who say they spend any time at all on rbm related activities staff members report spending an verage of roughly 20 0 per cent of their time on monitoring and another 19 0 per cent on reporting however staff sense that there is little payoff to these activities as feedback is rarely given on the information they produce and performance data are rarely seen being used in actual decision making 31 the perceived lack of connection between staff s efforts and daytoday decision making is borne out in weaknesses in unhcr s reporting instruments themselves and in their linkage to subsequent year plann ing instruments in systemic review of unhcr s performance reports oios found these instruments to contain number of rigidities that hamper their utility as decision making tools these include the inability to adequately parse out unhcr s contribut ion to the achievement of objectives from that of its partners109 the mismatch between the occurrence of activities and when these activities reap results110 the difficulty measuring ecological changes andor sustainability111 the inability to adequately acco unt for unforeseen contingencies inherent in its work that impinge on staff s ability to achieve the objectives outlined in their work plans112 and the inability to measure important qualitative indicators all of these issues 107 these areas include eg the analysis of objectives linked to gsos changes in partnerships the impact of assumptions and constraints on achieved results the potential for durable solutions and phase out and the extent to which unchr summary manageme nt strategy proved accurate 108 these include number of specific references to rbm and unhcr s results orientation as well as particulars surrounding the internal control role of regional bureau directors in ensuring gso cascading basing resource reques ts on evidence based needs assessment and so on 109 this issue is commonly referred to as the attribution problem 110 this issue is commonly referred to as the timetopayoff problem 111 this issue is commonly referred to as the impact problem 112 this issue is commonly referred to as the external factors problem 25 were substantiated to signi ficant degree113 oios also found lack of congruence between unhcr s prior year reporting timeline and its subsequent year budgeting and reporting timeline114 unhcr requires operational staff to prepare an array of prior year performance reports and curre ntyear monitoring reports115 however the planning process for the subsequent year begins during this same period 116 oios found that unhcr could use prior year performance information in more meaningful way to inform subsequent year planning117 32 oios understands these rigidities to be system wide rbm hurdles at the same time oios sees the rigidities as underpinning staff members sense that rbm has little utility whatsoever in humanitarian or united nations field setting thereby jeopardizing initiatives to bring the modality more fully to scale at unhcr oios therefore strongly commends unhcr in its effort to address many of these rigidities by way of the focus software 118 oios urges unhcr to thoroughly address as many remaining technical anomalie s in the software as possible before bringing it to scale throughout the agency so as to avoid the unintended consequence of dampening rather than boosting staff s enthusiasm for its utility similarly oios acknowledges unhcr s identification of manager s as rbm focal points but noted in interviews that these focal points are charged more with planning and reporting requirements than with creating culture of applied learning in their respective offices 119 unhcr noted appreciation for the changes oios m ade to this paragraph but fel t that oioss reference to technical anomalies added little to the report while implying that unhcr might consider putting product out that did not work well unhcr claims that it would not release substandard product 33 oios found that these measures to bring unhcr s monitoring and reporting system to bear on decision making would benefit from more and better training guidance and other supports to the staff who produce and apply these data these include well tailored focus tutorials that convey how the software can help decision making as well as training managerial rbm focal points in their enhanced role beyond mere compliance 113 oios analyzed unhcr s 2006 global report the 2006 high commissioner s report to the general assembly and 2006 headquarters reports as well as all annual protection reports aprs and c ountry reports for 2006 for 5 of the 8 country and regional offices under review 114 oios later learned that pcos had also identified this problem 115 respondents to the donor survey also tend to rate unhcr s work plans and performance reports more highly n average for their relevance in reflecting the state of affairs on the ground than they do these instruments overall quality or overall accuracy these instruments timeliness receives the lowest rating of all dimensions 116 that is planning be gins in january with draft work plan due in march and finalized in june calendar for reporting implementation and planning excluding monthly sitreps spmrs and quarterly obligation plans geneva unhcr november 2006 see also unhcr manual cha pter 4 parts 3 and 5 117 aside from mentioning this in interviews in the staff survey when respondents were asked on an open ended basis what key improvements unhcr could make to rbm issues related to improved planning processes formed one of the most common cluster of responses 221 per cent in addition oios found that none of unhcr s 2007 operational work plans included in its narrative risk analysis of key gaps outlined in its 2006 performance reports as an influence on its current year work p lans 118 update on focus unhcr s new rbm software geneva unhcr 15 june 2007 also see results based management operations management support software geneva unhcr 30 june 2006 119 the iog points to human resources as accounting for the high degre of variance in levels of rbm implementation level among country offices see aac961028 23 26 they also include more general training guidance and other supports to data collection staff in producing better data in more standardized way across the agency oios noted that unhcr lacks simple graphical overview of the rbm process including timelines responsible individuals the rationale behind each deliverable in the process and standard operating procedures sops120 finally oios noted that while pcos offers wide variety of rbm related training121 many staff members feel the training could more directly aid them in their rbm responsibilities122 in this regard oios noted gaps in staff members technical knowledge surrounding data collection123 and reporting124 and was unable to find any standard practices or guidelines surrounding data collection gap that limits the ability to aggregate data points at the corporate and inter office levels oios strongly encourages the current review of ficsss revised operational data management learning programme odmlp to take into account these staff development needs 120 although oios noted that the instructions and guidelines mentions deliverables and date as does the calendar it not able to cull such flow chart g raphically depicting the rbm process anywhere in unhcr s materials 121 these include eg revised operations management learning programme omlp programme management and epmirp training and more see report on the programme training activities geneva pcos 2006 122 oios notes that staff despite spending high proportion of their time on rbm related activities ie 470 per cent of staff reporting spending at least half of their time on these activities with staff in general spending an avera ge of 370 per cent of their time on rbm relatively small proportion of staff members have taken part in any of the 10 rbm related trainings unhcr offers staff participation in these trainings ranges from low of 60 per cent training in operationa l data management to high of only 360 per cent protection learning programme furthermore among those who participated in these trainings staff members consistently tend to rate the trainings they received to be related only somewhat closely to rbm finally among those who participated over two thirds 680 per cent claimed the training as somewhat less 470 per cent or much less 210 per cent than what they needed on rbm 123 for instance while some staff claimed that specific qualit ative aspects of their work could not be captured when oios probed on this issue it concluded that some of these aspects could indeed be operationalized within the planning and reporting framework 124 in addition in its desk review of performance report s oios noted high degree of variation in the presentation of results for example some reports were more balanced in addressing both the achievement and non achievement of results while others focused exclusively or heavily on achievement some accoun ted for external factors influencing performance in great detail while others did not some addressed impact while others did not some reported raw numbers while others reported proportions of total need and so on in surveys oios noted that while both donors and partners are likely to feel that actors in the field including unhcr and its partners are extremely effective or somewhat effective in addressing pocs needs in the short term 909 per cent for donors and 927 per cent for partners they were somewhat less likely to rate these actors performance as extremely effective or somewhat effective in addressing longer term impact 818 per cent for donors and 805 per cent for partners on this issue of impact oios does note however tha t in the instructions and guidelines for 2007 will soon require headquarters and country offices to include discussion of external factors in their planning and reporting documents memorandum item 4 within the secretariat there is an incongruence be tween the extensive monitoring and reporting requirements placed upon operational staff on one hand and on the other hand the need to digest this performance information before planning for the subsequent year there is need for greater buffer perio d between prior year performance reporting and subsequent year planning and more formalized systems for incorporating the former into the latter 27 memorandum item 5 many constraints endemic to the s work including the number of external factors affecting its ability to achieve objectives the number of actors contributing to objectives the s qualitative or indirect role in the achievement of objectives and the time to payoff of its efforts confound efforts to effectively use rbm planning nd reporting platforms as accountability or decision making tools unhcr is making progress in linking resources and results but at present planned objectives and prior year performance data have yet to be clearly and systematically factored into resou rce decisions 34 oios noted the high proportion of unhcr s budget coming from extra budgetary xb sources ie 97 per cent in the 2004 2005 and 2006 2007 biennia this high proportion of xb funding poses challenges125 to unhcr in effectively and efficient ly achiev ing agreed upon objectives as do constant if not decreasing overall resource levels and an increasing number of actors vying for these resources 126 donors also appear to recognize these constraint s127 oios learned that unhcr has responded to decline in its share of these resources with global austerity measures combined with an outpost ing of number of posts to decrease input costs128 35 oios observes that the hierarchy of budgeting decision making in unhcr s case might be broken down into thre main types of decisions 1 d onor decisions of whether to fund unhcr and by how much 2 donor decisions as to the proportion of total donor contributions that will be earmarked versus earmarked and what type of earmarking will be undertaken and 3 unhcr decisions over how to apportion its total envelope among its various offices and substantive areas as rbb constitutes central pillar of rbm oios noted that in all three areas unhcr s work plans and performance data could be made more relevant to decision making 129 36 oios sees opportunit ies for unhcr to harness the sources of information to better inform resource decision making130 both in its own right as planning and 125 these include relatively high number of ad hoc reporting requests f rom individual donors as well as the constraints imposed by certain forms of earmarking 126 2007 global appeal geneva unhcr 2007 127 half of respondents to the donor survey rank the availability of adequate resources to do the job as the most importan t factor influencing unhcr s and its partners effectiveness in the field 128 ares55232 129 donors and some staff members alike suggest that when donors do use unhcr work plans and performance data they do so in general sense to determine what unhcr s done and what it plans to do there is sense that they use this information to set their own priorities however respondents to the donor survey point to their own national considerations as the most important factors influencing overall envelopes nd earmarking levels rather than factors associated with unhcr itself 130 respondents to the donor survey for example tend to cite the extent to which resources are properly allocated toward key objectives preceded in importance only by the availabil ity of adequate resources to do the job itself 28 accountability131 tool and to counter staff perceptions that their planning an d reporting efforts yield little influence some staff and donor interviewees for instance claim that the gradual increase in earmarking has resulted from unhcr s inability to effectively present its work plans and performance data and their resource im plications enhancements in th is process might therefore serve to increase the resources over which unhcr exercises greater control with respect to unhcr s own internal resource allocations oios learned that there have been some exceptions to unhcr s general austerity measures but that these exceptions have not been conveyed in transparent manner with exceptions seemingly based on factors other than prior performance or target ed objectives132 oios commends unhcr for focusing regional bureau director s more closely on bring ing data to bear on their internal resource decision making process and encourages it to continue strengthening this initiative oios urges unhcr to make this process more transparent standardized and collaborative one between b ureaux and country offices 37 in addition to unhcr s outposting measure and its directive to regional bureau directors to rely more heavily on work plans and performance information oios acknowledges that unhcr is making progress in linking resources more closely to results oios learned that unhcr plans to directly link its resource msrp and results focus frameworks more closely albeit in later phase of its development in addition in 2007 unhcr proposed133 and excom endorsed134 move to better ca librate its budgeting framework with other rbm processes and programmes oios strongly endorses these streamlining initiatives however from its review of key documents oios found evidence of strategy for bringing these enhanced resource results linkages to bear on decision making135 oios notes that donor resource allocations levels of earmarked versus discretionary funds internal resource allocations and greater accountability represent only some of the potential uses of work plans and performa nce 131 nonperformance does not negatively affect budgets either with r espondents to the donor survey tending to disagree that non performance would decrease their overall envelope because of this an insuffic ient rbb component also compromises rbm s utility s an accountability mechanism it is noteworthy that in oios s analysis of operational work plans in most work plans the connection was unclear between planned outputs and outcomes and the resources req uested in order to produce them 132 some staff members felt these differences were grounded in unforeseen or growing crises that have warranted supplemental budgetary allocations in other cases however they sensed that these exceptions appear to hinge n the overall rhetorical ability of the country office representative to make compelling anecdotal case for need 133 proposal for the redesign of unhcr s budget structure 23 january 2007 134 ec58sccrp17 135 iom 0512007 fom 0542007 proposal for the redesign of unhcr s budget structure 23 january 2007

tool data on resource results linkages can assist managers in assessing their prior work and in planning for future work for example by helping them assess the cost effectiveness of various initiatives reallo cate their internal resources to areas of highest priority and examine strategic partnerships and pilot projects 136 memorandum item 6 resource decision making within the secretariat is largely not informed by programmes prior year performance data or current year work plans in order for rbb to assume its place as core rbm element the secretariat and governing bodies should determine what types of budget decisions can and should be influenced by this information f individual and operational accou ntability frameworks for rewarding performance and sanctioning underperformance are weak 38 improved ccountability is one important purpose of rbm and oios recognizes that accountability mechanisms entail many elements including physical accountability tools clear responsibilities authority structures reporting lines and more oios confirmed that unhcr does have clear reporting line137 but in its analysis of operational and individual work plans138 it found unhcr s accountability mechanism for adequa tely rewarding performance and sanctioning underperformance of individuals and operational units to be weak 139 for example in its analysis of operational work plans oios found only one work plan that explicitly stated the office s responsibility for the achievement of results in the forthcoming year likewise almost individual work plans include clear language referring to the individual s responsibility for the results outlined in the plan nor do managers work plans consistently articulate their responsibility for delivering the results of their respective units in interviews some managers conceded that the career management system cms is an optional component of the performance appraisal report par and that most staff members do not comple it140 in addition report by unhcr s iog notes that some managers 136 results based budgeting and management in nutshell new york united nations programme planning and budget division april 2002 137 unhcr manual unhcr organigramme 138 documents included all divisional work plans from headquarters n12 as well as key individual work plans n20 oios did not conduct similar analysis of gso cascading for the 2008 2009 period as many operational units and regional and country offices are still in the process of developing their work plans 139 oios defines sanctioning not only as punishing underperformance but rather helping managers and other staff members to identify potential areas of improvement and conversely oios defines rewards as non monetary as well as monetary incentives 140 in addition in the staff survey when respondents were asked on an open ended basis what key improvements unhcr could make to rbm issues related to improved connection of human resource issues to rbm formed one of the most common cluster of responses 221 per cent with most of the specific responses under this category revolving around accountability of staff and management for results 330 per cent performance assessment of staff 142 per cent and ensuring that staff are qualified 132 per cent 30 appear to be more focused on par compliance than on its intended purpose of setting objectives ensuring accountability for these objectives and identifying areas where additional supp orts are needed141 39 oios found that external factors are not always sufficiently accounted for in work plans and reporting mechanisms from an accountability standpoint there is general need for unhcr to better decouple those factors within its control versus those lying outside its control otherwise there is significant risk that failure to adequately spell out such operating assumptions ex can lead to tendency ex post facto to ascribe any underperformance at all to external factors142 in interviews oios noted staff members ability to offer up large number of specific external factors that constrain their performance identifying these factors formally at the planning stage would help staff better understand what is and is not expected of them and unhcr and prospective donors in holding staff accountable for what does lie within their control oios strongly supports unhcr s changes to its instructions and guidelines to address the need for clearer identification of results for which operational units and individual will be responsible and for clearer delineation of external and internal factors affecting the achievement of these results oios encourages unhcr to exercise greater internal control over this system and to not only monitor compliance but also provide feedback so operations and individuals can refine the instruments over time 40 oios learned of unhcr s move toward more decentralized regional model for planning managing and reporting on results this approach oi noted reflects unhcr s well grounded decision to have its organizational structure represent the nature of population movements which often have regional causes consequences and solutions in interviews however oios learned that some regional head s are unsure of what authority they have for ensuring accountability within the country offices in their region and whether and how they themselves will be held accountable for the achievement of regional results143 memorandum item 7 along with scarce re sources external factors pose major constraint to many secretariat programmes ability to effectively achieve results however these external factors though oftentimes legitimate reasons for the non achievement of objectives can become grounds for r ationalizing underperformance operational and individual accountability can be strengthened by having all work plans spell out anticipated external factors and performance reports and appraisals refer back to these same external factors 141 see aac961028 paras 2829 142in contrast to staff reports in surveys bo th donor sand partner respondents tended to rank external factors as the least important influence among nine various sources of influence on unhcr s and its partners success in the field 143 oios did review unhcr s directive in this regard see unhcr s new resource allocation framework geneva structural and management change march 2007 14 however the authority outlined in this document heavily emphasizes aspects of management related to budgeting and resource allocations 31 g unhcr has not fully integrated partners into its rbm mechanism and could better harness partners expertise to achieve its own objectives 41 unhcr has long relied on partnerships with united nations and non united nations partners alike to effectively and efficiently ac hieve its objectives recognizing key gaps in response capacity coverage time liness and effectiveness in humanitarian partnerships the united nations has in recent years sought to ensure greater predictability and accountability in these partnership s through comprehensive humanitarian reform agenda144 unhcr has been an active participant in the inter agency standing committee iasc the chief body responsible for implementing the humanitarian reform agenda in 2005 the iasc also r ecognizing that c oordination for more timely and effective system wide response requires leadership based on individual programmes comparative advantage introduced cluster approach to clearly designate individual programmes to lead specific sectors of humanitarian resp onse when emergencies arise145 oios learned that unhcr has been designated cluster lead in three sectoral areas 1 protection 2 camp coordination and management in situations of conflict and 3 emergency shelter in cases of conflict 146 42 oios noted number of challenges that the humanitarian reform agenda with its emphasis on enhanced coordination and leadership poses to unhcr in folding partners into its own rbm mechanism 147 first and foremost the ability to define and effectively manage toward shared objectives remains an on going challenge as does the ability to parse out individual contribution s of unhcr and its individual partners in achieving these objectives oios commends unhcr for its plans to improve in this area but noted other gaps in the extent to which unhcr s partners are currently integrated into its results framework148 in its cascading analysis oios found low overall level of linkage between partner sub agreements and the ir corresponding unhcr cops both in terms of explicit g so mentions and explicit mention of partners accountab ility for results149 moreover in the process of selecting partners and continuing or discontinuing partnerships some country office teams claim to rely heavily on prospective partners 144 ares46182 ios noted the humanitarian reform agenda s four main objectives as follows 1 sufficient humanitarian response capacity and enhanced leadership accountability and predictability in gap sectorareas of response ensuring trained staff adequate commonl yaccessible stockpiles surge capacity agreed standards and guidelines 2 adequate timely and flexible humanitarian financing including through the central emergency response fund or cerf 3 improved humanitarian coordination and leadership eg more effective humanitarian coordinator system more strategic leadership and coordination at the inter sectoral and sectoral levels and 4 more effective partnerships between and non humanitarian actors 145 inter agency standing committee ia sc guidance note on using the cluster approach to strengthen humanitarian response 24 november 2006 146 terms of reference iasc cluster approach evaluation 1st phase 25 april 2007 147 in the partner survey respondents consistently ranked coordinati onrelated factors eg the ability of actors in the field to agree on prioritized objectives the ability of actors in the field to coordinate their operational activities as the strongest influences on success in the field followed by the abilit of unhcr s results approach to define objectives focus actors on these objectives and manage toward results 148 oios conducted formal analysis of 9 partner sub agreements across 5 of the country offices under review 149 per footnote 64 oios acknowle dges that focus intends to address this gap by serving as platform to be shared by unhcrs partners as well as unhcr itself 32 performance in formation while others concede that they do not150 finally partners performance information is not routinely or uniformly shared with them either as an accountability tool or learning tool that might inform the partnership s ongoing work151 owing to the centrality of partnerships in unhcr s ability to effectively achieve its objectives oios maintains that unchr should continue to offer and where necessary require its partners to participate in any training and supports relevant to unhcr s rbm p rocess152 43 oios commends unhcr for including partners in the participatory assessments that inform its planning process that said m any partners nonetheless view unhcr as taking top down approach to its partnerships whether or not it is operational or cluster lead in given setting for example some partners say that they sometimes receive their proposals back from unhcr with their suggested objectives reformulated or deleted and others added in with communication indicating the rationale behind these edits or feedback for future reference in addition some partners claim that unhcr could benefit from their own expertise in important areas of its work for example in the area of women and women s rights children education public health an d so on but does not consult them unhcr should actively take part in and where applicable spearhead the creation of formal forums for unhcr and its partners to share best practices and lessons learned with each other in horizontal manner153 44 oios fo und that unhcr lacks measures for effectively measuring partnership coordination particularly in those areas in which it serves as cluster or operational lead oios noted that b eginning in 2008 2009 unhcr will be to parse out its gsos from those managem ent strategies aimed at achieving them oios also took note that unchr 150 this analysis reflects those scenarios in which country offices have choice among several prospective partners all else held equal oios acknowledges that this is not the case in many instances for example some partnerships arise as result of mandated involvement eg ocha s involvement in virtually all humanitarian relief settings while others arise because of the ea rly evolution of civil society in many countries 151 this finding is corroborated by recent findings of the iog see aac961028 paras 19 and 25 in addition some partners claim that unhcr has terminated certain partnerships and projects on generic gr ounds of underperformance without sharing specific feedback that might help them learn and improve their effectiveness 152 this includes its general orientation on the rbm process technical aspects associated with rbm eg identification of sis data collection methods work plan development and performance reporting and its recent initiatives to improve rbm and unhcr specific areas of expertise that might enhance its partners effectiveness oios encourages unhcr to follow through on its intentio n to do so in the partner survey relatively low percentages of partners maintain that they have received rbm relevant trainings from unhcr partner participation in unhcr led trainings ranges from low of 146 per cent ie for trainings related to using performance andor needs assessment data to aid decision making to high of only 375 per cent ie for trainings related to understanding and systematically assessing the prioritized needs of populations of concern substantial proportions of partners claim to need further training in these and other key areas including understanding and systematically assessing the prioritized needs of the specific protection and assistance needs of groups and individuals within key populations of concer n as distinguished by their age gender diversity or other factors 438 per cent collecting performance andor needs assessment data in the best way possible 343 per cent and understanding and systematically assessing the prioritized needs of populations of concern 334 per cent by contrast the one area where the highest proportion of partners claim to have received more rather than less training than what they need to date is complying with data reporting requirements fully 330 per ce nt say they have received somewhat more or much more training than what they need 153 in this vein in the partner survey more respondents were likely to disagree somewhat or disagree strongly 28 per cent that unhcr treats its partners more as eq uals than as subcontractors than with almost any other item in this agreement inventory 33 has identified developing dynamic partnerships as one of its key management strategies for achieving results gso 6 however in its formal review of unhcr s sis oios found indi cators explicitly operationalizing coordination of or with partners oios encourages unhcr to concretely operationalize and measure coordination as critical gauge of its own successful management toward results h unhcr must strengthen its internal orga nizational learning mechanism particularly its independent evaluation function as vital element of rbm 1 unhcr s internal organizational learning mechanism 45 unhcr staff s substantive expertise and institutional knowledge are widely acknowledged by th agency s donors partners and external experts oios noted lack of formalized learning forums to diffuse individuals experience and expertise for greater corporate effectiveness 154 many staff interviewees volunteered that they do not currently have adequate horizontal linkages within their given substantive areas for example public information officers could benefit from the experience of their colleagues elsewhere n how to work toward and measure the creation of better enabling environment or protection officers could devis idp related indicators and solutions155 oios acknowledges recent calls for dips and dos staff to forge greater linkages and encourages unhcr to facilitate such linkages across its global operations as whole and at all staff levels156 46 in addition to its human infrastructure unhcr could improve its physical infrastructure for facilitating these linkages while unhcr s intranet and internet have compiled wide range of information of potential uti lity to staff members there is need to make these platforms into more powerful information and knowledge sharing tool oios noted that some areas are difficult to navigate and many key items are not updated for example even ostensibly simple queries via the intranet s search function often yield unwieldy or unsatisfactory results moreover by the fourth quarter of 2007 4q07 some 2006 cops were available online while others are not157 this piecemeal approach is not conducive to up todate information sharing across u nhcrs vast network of offices 2 unhcr s evaluation function 47 in addition oios s view is that unhcr s evaluation function stands to be greatly strengthened this step is necessary if in keeping with the end purpose of rbm 154 oios later learned that ficss also identified this gap and advocated for an information portal to be shared internally as well as with partners to fill it this portal project is currently under development 155 unhcr s iog enumerates number of sporadic office specific initiatives to capture and store best practices and lessons learned but notes that this practice is not consistently applied at all offices or b etween offices see aac961028 34 37 156 oios took note for example that in 6 out of pdes s 15 reports it was unclear whether the evaluators had included pocs as source of data moreover in many cases it was unclear which exact data collecti on methods it had used how many informants or respondents had been involved what potentially important stakeholders had not been included and so forth 157 oios later learned that all cops are available to all hq staff upon email request but does not fee l this system is sufficient for meeting real time information needs and does not achieve maximum reach among all global staff 34 the agency is to become an organization that learns from its performance in order to improve oios noted that unhcr does have central function dedicated to evaluation the policy development evaluation service pdes in its analysis of pdes outputs in 2006 and 2007 oios lear ned that pdes produced 11 evaluation reports in 2006 4 by pdes itself and 7 by external consultants and 4 reports in the first three quarters of 2007 3 by pdes itself and 1 by external consultants with another 3 pdes generated reports slated for relea in 4q 07 in its analysis oios found these reports to be of very high calibre on number of methodological and substantive dimensions outlined in the united nations evaluation group s uneg s norms and standards for evaluations 158 moreover most re ports explicitly drew out specific practical and actionable recommendations related to best practices or lessons learned 159 48 less certain from oios s analysis however is how systematically pdes s reports are linked to rbm and to the achievement of the ag ency s full range of priorities enshrined in the gsos in this regard oios found pdes s mission statement160 evaluation policy161 and chapter 4 part 7 of unhcr s manual to lack explicit reference to pdes s linkage to unhcr s rbm framework or the gsos or to the role of evaluation in an rbm framework more generally 162 it also found specific areas of the manual in need of update since its last iteration in 2002 to better reflect unhcr s progress in improving rbm 163 oios understands that pdes recently inheri ted these documents from its predecessor the evaluation and policy analysis unit epau upon the re establishment of the evaluation function in the form of pdes after epau had been defunct for several years however t his lack of an explicit rbm linkage is reflected in pdes s reports only 3 of 15 reports make explicit reference to rbm or the gsos for the year under review moreover qualitative review of these reports suggests that while it is clear that each one indeed emanates from one or more of the agency s priorities and particularly from burgeoning policy issues eg the effectiveness of the cluster approach in meeting idps needs emerging u rban pocs etc what is less clear is why these priorities received attention while other high pr iorities did not164 158 uneg checklist on evaluation quality questionnaire for self assessment new york united nations evaluation group uneg aug ust 2005 oios examined the 15 pdes evaluation reports published in 2006 and 2007 as well as its 4 policy papers and 24 research articles published in unhcr s scholarly journal new issues in refugee research during this period 3 of which written by hcr staff and 21 by external authors 159 that said in the spirit of transparency in debating the merit of these reports findings and recommendations oios would encourage future reports to more thoroughly and systematically detail their data collection nd data analysis methods including their methodological limitations 160 policy development and evaluation service mission statement geneva pdes 161 unhcr s evaluation policy geneva unhcr evaluation and policy analysis unit epau september 2002 162 oios did note that both pdes s mission statement and unhcr s evaluation policy do mention relevance ie to unhcr s operational needs and performance as fundamental principle underlying pdes s work however oios feels that pdes s role within hcr s rbm framework could be made more explicit 163 these include eg specific references and links to uneg norms and standards as well as unhcr s active participation in uneg see unhcr s evaluation policy p 5 and p 11 more explicit reference to t he role of evaluation and pdes in light of developments in the humanitarian reform agenda at present pdes does not mention these issues under the rubric of it core principle of consultation either in the mission statement or unhcr s evaluation policy p 11 164 for example in 2006 pdes targeted wide variety of issue areas eg structural influences on effectiveness urban populations cost effectiveness in resource use pocs eg refugees idps returnees and asylum seekers and levels of analy sis eg single country offices multiple country offices and corporate by contrast in the first three quarters of 2007 this scope had reduced to examine the coupling of single issue area ie the cluster 35 49 also of concern to oios is pdes s current evaluation capacity evaluation as an organizational learning tool serves vital function in rbm165 however oios learned that pdes is simultaneously serving in policy advisory capacity undoubtedly an important function if it were to systematically harness knowledge to inform policy166 in examining the 4 policy papers produced in 2006 2007167 oios found only 1 to explicitly connect unhcr s policy position to the state of the knowledge surro unding the issue at hand and this paper stated this evidence casually without reference to specific source or to knowledge generated by pdes oios det ected numerous functions pdes c ould be engaged in that are more consistent with the role of evaluation within an rbm context first and foremost pdes should be undertaking regular programme evaluation there is also considerable opportunity for pdes to collaborat with its colleagues in enhancing unhcr s si inventory and its data collection and reporti ng systems and in boost ing staff s own basic capacity for undertaking these tasks as such pdes rather than revamping its evaluation policy outright should seek greater alignment of its present activities to its original evaluation policy168 which cove rs these multifaceted functions 50 oios is aware that complete devolution of evaluation functions to unhcrs operational units and country offices might not be optimal both from n efficiency standpoint169 and methodological standpoint 170 oios notes that pdes uniquely combines methodological rigour with substantive and institutional knowledge of unhcr and its work moreover pdes is uniquely positioned to undertake number of cross cutting evaluation functions as well in addition to its current role in policy development these include on going self evaluation of unhcrs rbm systems and processes recent initiatives to improve them171 and several other roles 172 in this sense pdess capacity should be boosted if it is to assume these other important rbm related responsibilities unhcrs donors likewise express concern with unhcrs current lack of adequate evaluation capacity and strongly support measures to boost it possibly through earmarked funds173 donors and other stakeholders also express concern over pdess close association to the office of the hc oios notes that the location of pdes within approach and single population ie idps at one level of analysis ie multiple country offices culminating in summary report of these offices 165 norms for evaluation in the united nations system united nations evaluation group uneg 29 april 2005 standards for evaluation in th united nations system united nations evaluation group uneg 29 april 2005 166 this policy focus might help explain in part pdes s focus on the cluster approach in idp settings in all of its 2007 evaluations to date 167 these include the following unhcr refugee protection and international migration the high level dialogue on international migration and development unhcr s observations and recommendations 28 june 2006 forced migration and development 911 july 2007 and unhcr recommendations to the eu africa ministerial conference on migration and development 16 november 2006 168 unhcr s evaluation policy geneva unhcr evaluation and policy analysis unit epau september 2002 169 it would be inefficient for operational staff to have to acquire in addition to their substantive operational expertise evaluation expertise 170 the uneg norms and standards suggest the principle that the greater the independence of the evaluation function the greater the objectivity of its work 171 oios maintains tha t the igo could serve an important function in this area as well see aac961028 172 oios is aware that pdes in its former incarnation as epau embraced these other roles see unhcrs evaluation policy pp 1 3 56 and 12 13 173 oios notes that unhc r has explicitly committed itself to allocating the resources necessary to realizing the goals of its evaluation policy see unhcrs evaluation policy p 5 36 the ohc with the head of pdes reporting directly to the hc as conforming with united nations evaluation group uneg norms for the reporting lines of eva luation heads174 however while its central location might enhance pdess role as an aid to management oios also notes potential risk to the independence of pdes in providing organizational accountability and learning175 while pdes states that its curre nt roster of evaluations was self generated oios notes that this independence is not guaranteed under the current structural arrangement should managements vision of an independent evaluation function change and as noted in 49 above pdes is cur rently beholden to the ohcs desire for it to play greater policy advisory role in addition to undertaking programme evaluations oios suggests that guidance from uneg could be clearer on the relative merit of reporting lines to given programmes ma nagement versus its governing body 51 knowledge generated by evaluations and other sources of organizational learning is only as good as it is implemented or at least considered seriously in subsequent decision making176 in this regard oios concurs with number of unhcr s self generated documents177 concluding that if rbm is to become truly internalized within unhcr the agency must take more seriously the implementation of recommendations garnered from the reports of pdes as well as the inspector general s office igo oios the jiu external evaluators the iasc and other bodies seeking to assist it in its learning process this entails formal transparent process for r eview ing these recommendations and tracking the agency s implementation of them i unhcr has improved the mainstreaming of age gender and diversity but lacks shared agency wide understanding of what it means to implement agdm in the field 52 unhcr operates in close proximity to the end beneficiaries of its work oftentimes in direct service capacity oios therefore understands that it is incumbent upon unhcr if it is to achieve its objectives effectively to not only develop its core expertise in serving the population at large but also nuanced understanding of subpopulations an d their unique vulnerabilities in this regard its protection work should clearly reflect the s body of declarations conventions protocols and other pronouncements on population specific concerns178 as well as the growing state ofthe knowledge surro unding specific subpopulations needs and what this means for protection and assistance programming 174 norms for evaluation in the united nations system united nations evaluation group uneg 29 april 2005 standards for evaluation in the united nations system united nations evaluation group uneg 29 april 2005 175 oios submits that pdess location within the office of the hc might driv its choice of activities rather than an independent assessment of key risks to the agency of the gsos more broadly and of the many other roles it could be playing pdes however claims that most of the evaluation projects in its current work plan were self generated 176 ibid 177 see eg the gap analysi s unhcr s evaluation policy and aac961028 178 including eg sres1325 2000 ecres200520 ecosoc agreed conclusions 19972 a4449 1989 37 53 oios learned that unhcr has for some time been developing its internal capacity in attending to subpopulation specific needs179 culminating in 2004 in the formalization of policy and associated guidelines supports and an accountability framework by way of the age gender and diversity mainstreaming agdm initiative 180 unhcr has incorporated agdm in its manual181 including revision to chapter 4 and oth er unhcr documents eg the emergency handbook the idp protection handbook and on its intranet which collectively serve to delineate the broad goals and contours of its policy oios also commends unhcr for its formal incorporation of age gender and diversity into unhcr s gsos since 2006182 moreover oios is strongly encouraged by noticeable degree of internal deliberation about how agdm fits into the rbm framework as evidenced in gradual refinements to how it reflects an agdm perspective in each subsequent set of gsos from 2006 to 2007 and from 2007 to 2008 2009183 54 that said oios found the articulation of unhcr s agdm goals and the strategies for achieving them to be less clear in the field in its cascading analysis oios noted that the speci fic agdm related objectives for 2007 have not been fully cascaded down from the corporate policy level to the regional and country levels 184 oios speculates that th is lack of full scale mainstreaming might reflect lack of shared understanding of what agd m is what it means and especially how it is to be articulated 179 external expert interviewees claim that unhcr has been attempting to build its internal subpopulation specific capacity since at least the 1990s guidelines on the protection of refugee women geneva unhcr 1991 unhcr policy on refugee women geneva unhcr 1990 see also unhcr s age and gender mainstreaming pilot project 2004 synthesis report ep au20053 april 2005 180 unhcr handbook for the protection of women and girls june 2006 p 15 181 unhcr handbook for the protection of women and girls june 2006 182 2006 2007 and 2008 2009 gsos oios is also encouraged by the attempts pdes has made to i ncorporate agdm into its evaluations pdes explicitly references agdm in 5 of its 15 reports produced in 2006 2007 implicitly deals with agdm relevant issues in 14 of its 15 reports 183 for example one 2006 gso refers to agdm in very generic manner wi th gso 2 stating that unhcr will ensure international standards of protection for girls boys women and men of concern to unhcr are met various eas heavily emphasizing two specific sex related issues gender equality gso 2b promote gender equality and women s empowerment and sgbv gso 2a improve physical security and reduce incidents of violence in particular prevent and respond to sexual and gender based violence or one specific aspect of children s rights gso 2f safeguard the right to ducation by contrast the 2007 gsos tighten unhcr s agdm focus in two ways first by strengthening language surrounding unhcr s commitment to taking broader view of age and gender eg by focusing not only on equity but also on knowledge of gender and age based differences and second by explicitly folding in diversity as well as age and gender gso 1 states that unhcr will ensure international standards of protection are met for all persons of concern to unhcr taking into account their age gen der or personal background italics added finally for the upcoming 2008 2009 biennium unhcr takes more far reaching approach to agdm much as it does to rbm itself by removing it from the gsos themselves and defining it instead as an integrated ma nagement strategy that suffuses the entirety of unhcr s work 184 oios found that all of unhcr s five regional bureaux do explicitly mention age and gender in their strategic objectives however oios noticed some variation in the depth that individual bure aux devote to explaining how they will parlay the agdm policy in concrete terms only one bureau does so in any detail with the remaining four bureaux generically stating that they will foster country office compliance with unhcr s age and gender mainstre aming policy in addition oios found only two of the five bureaux to mention diversity the cascading of agdm is less consistent in the cops assessed by oios of the 8 cops analyzed only 2 provide an in depth narrative outlining specific strategy fo r how country offices will go about mainstreaming any component of agdm with the remaining 6 cops generically mentioning their intention to further mainstream it furthermore as with the regional bureaux strategic objectives some of the cops failed to include the mainstreaming of diversity that said oios found correlation between the bureaux and country offices that had ignored diversity 38 in concrete programmatic terms oios noted for example that the main pillars of unhcr s agdm strategy185 and the 2008 2009 eas surrounding the agdm gso186 are not explicitly aligned moving fo rward unhcr should harmonize these two main sources on agdm guidance updating the manual to more closely reflect these eas 55 also f concern to oios is the extent to which unhcr s agdm strategy is complemented by adequate supports to equip staff with the tools to operationalize and implement the aforementioned pillars for example what it means to apply age gender and diversity analysis to all operational activities or analyze the findings of participatory assessments from an agdm perspective and whether to view these objectives through the lens of equity or an adequ ate appraisal of age gender and diversity based differences in its cops review oios found almost mention of how country offices should interpret these general directives from t he rbm perspective of defining objectives harnessing resources and working toward them and looking beyond unhcr s policy itself oios found that cops explicitly linked their agdm related objectives or activities as stemming from united nations guidin g documents on the main components of age gender or diversity187 56 this is not to say that country offices are not undertaking important concrete steps in these areas on the contrary oios noted in its analysis that many country offices are currently incor porating agdm into their participatory assessments and others are constructing explicit strategies for how to bring agdm to bear on their protection and operations activities others are not however oios merely notes that country offices are at presen t not consistently stating the precise agdm outputs they are undertaking and the associated outcomes they are seeking to achieve which might be reflective of lack of clear parameters and guidance from headquarters 188 moving forward unhcr should conside r providing more detailed support and guidance to its staff in this regard189 and better harness ing the population specific expertise of its partners eg unicef ngos etc 185 these include the following 1 working in multi functional teams with partners 2 participatory assessme nts 3 analyzing the findings of participatory assessments 4 using this analysis for strategic planning 5 agreeing with pocs on how projects and services will be monitored and evaluated 6 development of the agdm accountability framework and 7 establishment of longer term training strategy 186 per the 2008 2009 gsos unhcr has summarized these as follows 1 applying age gender and diversity analysis to all operational activities 2 improving gender balance in unhcr s workforce in the fiel d and at headquarters 3 improving the level and quality of registration data collection analysis and documentation at all stages of an operation and 4 implementing the accountability framework for agdm 187 sres1325 2000 ecres200520 ecosoc greed conclusions 19972 a4449 1989 188 oios does note that pcos since 2007 has incorporated agdm into its operations management learning programme omlp training however there is currently dedicated agdm unit in omlp just over one page is dedicated to agdm and various sections weave in agm issues moreover these sections while providing an outline of overall agdm goals do not provide prescriptive guidance on how to operationalize agdm implement the agdm pillars described in the manual r suffuse the 2008 2009 gsos with an agdm sensibility oios notes that the community development gender equality and children section cdgecs plans to work with pcs on improving agdm related indicators and trainings and on including pcs in its three year agdm action plan 189 cdgecs notes that some of the inconsistency in cops stems from unhcrs bottom up approach to agdm related objective setting via participatory assessments as such its role is limited to an advisory capacity namely the provi sion of guidance surrounding the need for objectives to be rights based activities to be community based and indicators to be agd sensitive it therefore underscores that ultimate accountability for achieving agdm related objectives should rest with the operati onal units it advises that said cdgecs agrees that guidance to the field must be improved and that agdm must be more fully integrated into unhcrs rbm mechanism but notes several challenges it has faced in this regard to date eg the tendency for d iscussions of the sis to focus on other 39 iii recommendations recommendation 1 57 the newly created training unit within dos should revisit pcos s existing trainings and materials with view to clearly conveying the basic purpose and core concepts of rbm as well as embedding an rbm approach within all trainings and materials particular attention should be paid to focus and its linkage to msrp methodological aspects of operationalizing indicators and collecting data on them managers need for prioritizing and budgeting and the need for fuller understanding of how to integrate agdm into field activities unhcr senior mana gement should ensure that adequate resources are in place to support unhcr s and its partners training and support needs and should explore more cost effective modalities for doing so paras 22 24 33 42 53 55 56 sp 07005001 unhcr informs ios that it has

unhcr informs oios that it has undertaken steps to address this issue since the inspection oios notes these steps and will review them as part of its semi annual reporting cycle recommendation 4 60 pbs pdes and operational staff should work together in further refining the sis by way of more explicit linkages between individual sis and their corresponding gsoseas as well as clearer parsing out output based sis from t heir intended methodological issues than on the operationalization of agdm and technical difficulties incorporating the findings of participatory assessments into focus and their associated costs into msrp internal code used by the office of internal oversight services for recording recommendations 40 outcomes and impact they should also strengthen the sis focus on proportion of need abated rather than on raw numbers served and promote best practices for mapping and tracking total need finally they should develop sis related to ta rget populations well being and to their attitudes toward unhcr s work as source of performance information paras 2628sp07005004 unhcr informs oios that it has undertaken steps to address this issue since the inspection oios notes these steps and will review them as part of its semi annual reporting cycle recommendation 5 61 division and bureau directors and section managers should use the period between prior year data reporting and subsequent year planning activities to bring organizat ional learning to bear on planning and managing toward objectives in more effective and efficient manner at the same time where this is not possible omss might also harness fics s considerable analytical resources to produce country and issue specif ic data products that take the analytical onus off of operational staff and better meet their information needs paras 3032 50 sp07005005 recommendation 6 62 the division of financial administrative management should fulfil its intention to link msrp to focus without delay and to complement this initiative with adequate communications and supports paras 22 24 36 37sp07005006 recommendation 7 63 the deputy high commissioner should task odms and the programme budget service with improv ing unhcrs prioritization and resource allocation processes with particular emphasis on enhanced use of results data analysis as well as lessons learned paras 31 35 37sp07005007 recommendation 8 64 unhcr senior management should strengthen the agencys accountability framework paying particular attention to more systematic review of results in terms of outcomes and impact as well as delivery through the combined functionality of the msrp and focus software it should also make mandatory the submission of specific work plans including the career management system cms component of individual work plans and by ensuring that planned enhancements to these systems eg the clear delineation in all work plans of the assumptions and external f actors expected to affect the successful achievement of objectives it should also establish formal internal control system to monitor compliance oversee quality assurance of work plans and performance reviews and provide feedback and guidance on how to refine work plans and performance reports for greater precision and accuracy paras 3840sp07005 008 41 unhcr informs oios that it has undertaken steps to address this issue since

as well as their authority over the country offices under their purview 40sp07 005009 recommendation 1 0 66 pbs should include more specific reference in the instructions and guidelines surrounding the need to include in partner sub agreements the cascading of regional and country objectives to the subagreements and b specific mention of partners accountability for specific results the office of the ahc operations the regional bureaux and country offices should include this area as an explicit object of its internal control over the cascading process in addition country offices should be sure to communicate performance information to partners in more consistent and transparent way so that partners can improve their effectiveness in achieving shared objectives finally unhcr should make good on its intention to boost partner participation in unhcr led trainings and supports related to rbm and recent initiatives to improve it paras 4243sp07005010 unhcr informs oios that it has undertaken steps to address this issue since the inspection oios notes these steps and will review them as part of its semi annual reporting cycle recommendation 11 67 based on the findings of the iasc s and pdes s evaluations of the cluster approach unhcr senior management in conjunction with their counterparts at ocha should extract an array of best pra ctices surrounding coordination in humanitarian response settings through pbs pdes the division of external relations and others the smc should then formally operationalize and monitor unhcr s performance on its 2008 2009 gso 6 developing dynamic pa rtnerships paras 2627 41 44 sp07 005011 recommendation 1 2 68 unhcr should formalize horizontal forums for sharing best practices and lessons learned not only internally but also with partners so as to improve clusters joint achievement of resu lts and to receive partner feedback on country offices own work in the spirit of horizontal knowledge sharing t he division of information systems telecommunications under the direction of unhcr s substantive divisions and odms should streamline up dates to unhcr s internet and intranet sites so that more rbm relevant information eg work plans performance reports best practices papers can be shared among more staff more readily paras 4546sp07005012 42 recommendation 13 69 pdes should update its mission statement unhcr s evaluation policy

humanitarian reform agenda and its strategy for determining areas of evaluation from one year to the next 48sp07005013 recommendation 14 70 the office of the hc should capitalize on pdes s significant evaluation expertise and while retain ing pdes s current policy development and policy advisory function solidify its evaluation role as such rather than re writing its evaluation policy outright pdes

donors to identify funding for this vital rbm related function in the upcoming budget year paras 4950sp07005014 recommendation 15 71 in keeping with the finding of odms s gap analysis dips dos and other divisions should more systematically track follow up to the recommendations emanating from evaluations and other sources of independent objective learning and implement these rec ommendations wherever possible the inspector generals office which is mandated to assess the quality of management in unhcrs field operations should examine the extent to which managers are making effective use of evaluation findings and recommendati ons 51sp07005015 recommendation 16 72 dips and the regional bureaux should strengthen compliance with the agdm accountability framework and the cascading of gso 7 throughout the agency and provide clearer instructions for how detailed the re gionalcountry objectives should be the community development gender equality children section should also provide more detailed guidance on how diversity mainstreaming should be articulated in objective setting and programming and update the agdm we bsite to weave these into coherent narrative explaining the

with the issuance by headquarters of its instructions for detailed project submissions for the coming year followed by country offices submission of these detailed project submissions to their respective regional bureaux t headquarters one month later in november in december these initial planning documents are followed by another key guidance document also issued to headquarters divisions and bureaux as well as country offices related to planning for the coming year nd to performance reporting for the prior year in off budget years this document also includes instructions for planning for the next biennium190 at the same time headquarters also processes letters of instruction lois and issues staffing tables and administrative budget and obligation documents abods to the field for the following year based upon the lois country offices prepare sub project agreements with their partners in december of the previous year the country offices as well as the divi sions and regional
