feasibility of implementing largescale address reporting opponents have voiced s ubstantive objections to the proposal they argue that strictly enforcing the chan geofaddress reportin g requirement could subject some otherwise lawabiding aliens to severe punishment possibly including removal critics also fear selective enforcement of the reporting requirement on the basis of race ethnicity or other characteristics 2003 changes to the special registration system on december 2 2003 dhs published an interim rule in the federal register to amend the nseers regulations41the rule became effective on december 2 and provided for 2month comment period ending on february 2 2004 the interim rule suspends the requirements that 1 individuals registered under nseers at port of entry report after 30 days to complete their registration and 2 all nseers registrants reregister annually instead according to the summary of the rule dhs will utilize more tailored system in which it will notify individual aliens of future registration requirements under the ne w rule dhs will decide on casebycase basis which registrants must appear at dhs office specifically us immigration and customs enforcement office for one or more additional registration interviews to determine whether they are in compliance with the conditions of their nonimmigrant visa status and admission for some aliens these interviews may be more frequent than the prior 30day and annua l reregistration requirements among the other changes made by the rule are conforming amendments to the regulations to reflect the transfer of immigrationre lated functions from doj to dhs under the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 in the supplementary information accomp anying the rule dhs offered several reasons why the suspension of the autom atic reregistratio n requirements is appropriate and advantageous it indicated that there are other tracking systems including usvisit and the student and exchange visitor information system sevis42that can help ensure that nseers registrants remain in compliance with the terms of their visas and admission in addition dhs stated that suspending the 30day and annual reregist ration requirements will reduce the burden on those required to register under the current regu lations as well as to dhs with respect to the latter it further stated that dhs re sources not needed for reregistrations can be used for other purposes including to cra ft targeted registration process that meets the national security needs of the countryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31570crs12

raphing and registering of covered aliens according to dhs special registration of aliens at ports of entry has consistent with the programs intent provided important law enforcement benefits which have included the identification of number of alien terrorists and criminals the rule also does not change the general requirement that nseers registrants report their departure upon leaving the united states legislation in the 107thcongress alien registration and reporting provisions were included in legislation in the 107thcongress the enhanced border security and visa entry reform act of 2002 as enacted by the 107thcongress directs the genera l accounting office to conduct study of the feasibility and utility of requi ring nonimmigrants in the united states to submit current address and where applicable the name and address of an employer every year the study is due by may 200343as discussed above similar address reporting requi rement existed until 1981 an immigration reform measure the securing americas future through enforcement reform act of 2002 hr 5013 would have amended the ina to expand existing registration requirements44in addition to the current requirement that aliens who are in the united states for 30 days or longer and are unregistered apply for registration and be fingerpr inted by day 30 it would have required subsequent registrations on the part of lpr s every year and on the part of other aliens every 3 months with respect to address re porting the bill would have retained the current requirement that aliens notify the attorney general of change of address within 10 days and would have preserved th attorney generals authority to require upon 10 days notice that the natives of any foreign state report their current addresses among its other registration related provisions hr 5013 would have directed the attorney general to establis h an information technology system for the collection compilation and maintenance of registration
