abstract the national defense authorization act for fiscal years 1992 and 1993 allows us special operations forces sof to train under the joint combined exchange training jcet program in foreign countries and does not prohibit training in nations where human rights violations have been reported such training includes instructing host government military units in lethal and nonlethal skills

updated as events warrant joint combined exchange training jcet and human rights background and issues for congress summary recent press articles describe us special operations forces sof training under the joint combined exchange training jcet program in countries where human rights abuses have allegedly or actually taken place joint combined exchange training is carried out under provisions in 10 usc 2011 the law allows the regional commanders and the commander of the us special operations command to pay for deploying and training us sof teams as long as the primary purpose of the activity is to train the us special operations forces one of the primary unconventional warfare foreign internal defense missions of us sof is to train other militaries sof uses jcet deployments to practice training foreign militaries 10 usc 2011 requires the secretary of defense secdef to submit an annual report to congress covering various jcet details the press and members of congress have expressed concern because of the apparent contradiction between declared us policy not to train foreign military forces implicated in human rights violations supported by actions of congress to curtail military aid to such countries and the continued use of jcet deployments to those countries to train us sof under jcet sof teams have trained foreign units that subsequently were accused of being involved in human rights abuses three countries of particular concern are indonesia colombia and rwanda as long as the sof received the primary benefit the training was legal unlike other forms of foreign aid military assistance and military training the funding for jcet comes from the defense department budget because jcet is dod training activity in addition press reports and members have complained about the perceived lack of civilian oversight in planning approving and monitoring these training operations the department of state department of defense us ambassadors congress and host nation governments are involved in jcet oversight whether existing prefy99 mechanisms provided adequate oversight is in question congress has taken steps to enact legislation to bring jcet more into alignment with policies and establish more stringent oversight the leahy amendment to the department of defense fy1999 appropriations act pl 105262 prohibits the us military from training with human rights abusers unless waived by the secretary of defense two other bills in the 105th congress the security assistance act of 1998 s2463 and the international military training and accountability act hr3802 would have banned all forms of us military training to countries ineligible for the international military education and training imet program one other bill the international military training transparency and accountability act hr4874 would specifically ban jcets for countries under imet restrictions several alternative courses of action and additional issues remain balancing national

rights background and issues for congress introduction congress is concerned over special operations forces sof training in countries with alleged human rights violations one program joint combined exchange training jcet has been the subject of particular scrutiny press reports allege us sof teams trained foreign units under the jcet program that either previously or after receiving jcet training committed human rights violations within their own borders or in neighboring countries recent press articles focus on jcet intent and oversight some members of congress question the value of jcet deployments to the us military suggesting the actual benefits are somewhat vague and evasive1 one issue is whether or not the sof units receive enough training to justify the expenditures related issue centers on the real intent of the jcet exercise deployments are they for the benefit of us special operations forces or actual training for the host military some members believe the dod is disregarding congresss intent and that the state department should be more actively involved to those members it appears that jcet functions as military assistance program without proper foreign policy coordination with little us benefit and with major foreign policy impact2 allegations have surfaced that there is little effective oversight by the us or host nation governments in the jcet planning and execution process3 furthermore it is charged that the jcet program is not monitored well enough by senior foreign policy officials4 clearly there is confusion about jcet its intent and scope this report examines jcet background reviews congressional concerns addresses recent legislative and dod initiatives to refine and realign jcet approval and reporting and notes additional options and issues for congressional consideration 1 dana priest special forces training review sought washington post july 15 1998 p a25 2 security assistance act of 1998 committee on foreign

crs2 background special operations forces us special operations forces sof are structured and organized as unified command the us special operations command ussocom headquartered at macdill air force base florida each theater commander in chief cinc has his own special operations command soc for planning scheduling and coordinating special operations within his theater usually the soc has operational control of theater sof executive oversight of sof policy and resources is vested in an assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low intensity conflict asd solic special operations forces include forces from the army navy and air force although the marine corps possesses units tasked and capable of performing special operations marine units are dedicated solely to 10 usc 2011 activities and therefore do not conduct any training under jcet guidelines5 sof tasks demand spectrum of qualifications ranging from rigorous physical conditioning and combat skills to language proficiency and instructor abilities sof teams often work in small groups behind enemy lines or in the midst of foreign population requiring language proficiency they tend to be self sufficient and flexible in countries where indigenous groups may have hostile reaction to large visible us conventional presence or in nations in which larger presence might create controversy back home in the united states6 special operations forces are designated by the secretary of defense and specifically organized trained and equipped to conduct and support special operations7 characteristically sof operations are lowcost and lowvisibility with potentially highpayoff returns sofs apply their unique skills to attain political economic military or psychological objectives in peace or war8 special operations are designed to achieve military political economic or informational objectives by unconventional military means in hostile denied or politically sensitive areas these operations are conducted across the full range of military operations independently or in coordination with operations of conventional nonspecial operations forces politicalmilitary considerations frequently shape special operations requiring clandestine covert or low visibility techniques and oversight at the national level special operations differ from conventional operations in degree of

work with indigenous forces is unique hallmark of sof if they can successfully organize and train indigenous forces to fight common enemy sof effectively open second front and reduce or preclude use of us conventional forces the sof principal missions and collateral activities listed below demonstrate the wide range of skills needed by sof and the requirement for diverse training conditions10 practice and proficiency in these numerous missions place premium on realistic training opportunities jcets can provide opportunities to train in different skills including practice teaching among indigenous foreign forces sof principal missions counterproliferation combating terrorism foreign internal defense training host nation to counter insurgency lawlessness and subversion strategic reconnaissance assessing capability intent geography and battle damage direct action including hostage rescue psychological operations civil affairs unconventional warfare information operations sof

activities as directed by higher authority11 9 joint pub 102 p404 10 previously sof mission statements included nation building to preclude us involvement that term is longer used but the intent to preclude us involvement is inherent in the overall sof mission the current african crisis response initiative acri is one example source ussocom public affairs by teaching local militaries and

jcet joint us exercises provide limited opportunity for sof teams to obtain the training they need exercise scenarios participants and environments do not adequately simulate an undeveloped host nation its government military or infrastructure the joint combined exchange training jcet program was specifically designed to meet us special operations forces training needs the jcet program enables us sof to practice one of their essential missions training other militaries to conduct operations sof teams train foreign units in both military and nonmilitary skills commensurate with the list of missions delineated above but conditions vary widely from country to country with only the barest resources in some countries or poorly organized military in another these variations mean the sof teams need to have practice adapting their methods of instruction in less than ideal situations and environments they are training themselves to train other units in variety of conditions the primary reason jcet exists is to train our own forces to be better instructors it also provides them opportunities to practice their foreign language skills and become familiar with cultural differences between the united states and the participating countries although jcets are not designated intelligence collection operation the sof teams do gather information and learn the local terrain climate and unique geography while building regional perspective and orientation more importantly sof teams learn the way specific foreign militaries organize and operate they learn who the leadership is and how to work with that militarys command and control structure12 us sof teams conduct jcet missions in over 100 countries they are an important part of the us postcold war policy of engagement according to dod jcets help advance national interests by fostering respect for human rights and by preparing us forces to perform emergency evacuations for example after the may 1997 coup and military takeover of sierra leone the successful evacuation of 2500 civilians was assisted by sof that previously conducted jcets there and in the region they were familiar with unique problems and challenges on the ground13 authority the authority for jcet exercises derives from us code title 10 section 2011 gives the commander of ussocom and the regional cincs the authority to spend money and send sof teams overseas to train with foreign military units if the primary purpose of the deployment is to train us sof the law also allows for some defrayment of expenses for the host nation government pertinent senate committee discussion recognized the need for sof to practice training because training other militaries encompasses so much of what they do 12 m2 presswire16 july 1998us dod dod news briefing c 199498 m2 communications ltd rdate140798 210 pm 13 ibid crs5 sof practice training in internal defense and unconventional warfare in countries where they may have to fight or train local units again in contingency the provision recognized jcet training would benefit the local militaries and that consequence was labeled indirect and unavoidable14 the primary purpose of using ussocom and other combatant commands operations and maintenance funds for jcet training was to ensure us sof received this type of training when congress mandated the jcet program it exempted participating special operations forces training overseas from restraints imposed on conventional military forces that exercised with foreign militaries15 funding for jcet comes from dod accounts and therefore is not subjected to legislative restrictions imposed by foreign aid appropriations acts prior to fy1999 jcets were not legally subject to the human rights restrictions placed on other us programs jcet teams trained in countries denied other us military exchanges16 from the annual report on training of special operations forces april 1 1997 for the period ending september 30 1997 it appears that most jcet deployments complied with congressional intent did not contradict other us policies and served to benefit us special operation forces other jcets reportedly have exceeded us sof training requirements by focusing on the recipient host nation military needs training them in areas such as counternarcotics and counterinsurgency techniques in exchange for access to top foreign officials17 and to boost us influence in that nation and region18 the total cost for jcet in fy1997 was 152 million this funding was approved as part of the ussocom operations and maintenance budget unlike imet or other programs that are approved as line items individually by country jcet funding is taken out of the larger ussocom budget as required without congressional approval of funding for jcets on line item or country basis some critics see lack of civilian oversight journalists reports suggest training arrangements are made between us sof and foreign militaries without host nation governments or ambassadors input into the jcet event19 as result reports further allege under jcet sof teams have trained in countries with human rights problems or that are engaged in active conflicts such as indonesia and colombia20 consequently jcet has been characterized by some as not well monitored and as out of step with the broader foreign policy of support for human rights21 14

other benefits from jcet deployments the military asserts it gains familiarity with nations in which sof teams may have to evacuate us citizens and embassy personnel give emergency humanitarian assistance or engage in combat these forces pass on their human rights values respect for civilian leadership and their professionalismall key ingredients to engaging militaries abroad according to dod jcet opportunities are critical to us sof asd solic is the primary department of defense point of contact for counter terrorism22 important benefits claimed include language practice exposure to diverse cultures topography and weather and host military organization readiness and capability also for operations such as counter terrorism it is important to have established contacts known map accuracy and routes in and out of contentious areas jcets forge abilities to work harmoniously with foreign groups that give special operations forces marked edge over conventional forces when circumstances demand regional orientation and political and cultural sensitivity23 we consider jcet an important program because it allows us to train in different areas of the world and to learn how other militaries operate said pentagon spokesman kenneth h bacon forces learn teach and practice important skills one of those skills is hostage rescue24 secretary of defense william cohen has also stressed jcet importance jcets are the backbone of training for special operations forces preparing them to operate throughout the world in those areas where our forces conduct jcets they encourage democratic values and regional stability in the future we can expect our forces to confront threats posed by an increasingly diverse set of actors placing premium on the skills or forces developed in jcets25 dod maintains that jcets benefit us sof in another way some units are stationed in countries where they cannot train in some missions certain types of training that are too sensitive in one country can as jcet be moved to another country parachuting may be moved from japan to thailand due to restricted airspace and noise sensitive areas controversial urban warfare exercises may be moved from the united states to singapore lithuania or india sofs have the opportunity for jungle tracking in malaysia and noisy night low altitude flying is moved from england to mountainous and sparsely

otherwise would not have disadvantages jcet builds contacts with foreign military leaders and encourages respect for human rights by host militaries but sof team has control over the foreign units behavior after it leaves jcet training doesnt necessarily change host militarys behavior27 therefore members of congress have raised questions about the benefits claimed by us sof especially when compared to the abuses ascribed to some of the foreign militaries that have received jcets28 another disadvantage is that jcets sometimes appear to be part of larger policy framework for the countries in which they are conducted this appearance can confuse and cast doubt that the primary jcet purpose is to train us sof advocates of jcet have clouded the issue further raising congressional concerns h allen holmes assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low intensity conflict asd solic called sof force multiplier and diplomacy multiplier29 senior us military officers have been cited as referring to jcets as way to shape the environment for cincs as well as train us troops political card direct instrument of us foreign policy the most direct and most involved tangible physical part of us foreign policy in certain countries and leading force exerting us influence overseas30 while these statements may have been intended to emphasize how jcets support us policy such statements have been interpreted to mean that the benefits of sof presence transcend training and represent an independent tool of policy making these statements make it appear that jcets are not clearly defined or the military is in fact forging policy for this reason the senate committee on foreign relations has included the requirement for onetime report by the secretary of state detailing the steps taken to ensure that all us foreign military education and training activities are being conducted in accordance with the foreign policy objectives of the united states31 other us military assistance programs the house international relations and the senate foreign relations committees authorize many overseas programs and activities the committees authorize funding for foreign aid arms

imet consists of funding for instruction to foreign military students units or forces as nonreimbursable grant by the us armed services or its contractors imet content may include correspondence courses technical or educational publications and other media expanded imet eimet consists largely of classroom training for civilian officials and senior military leaders on controlling budgets and running defense establishment fid focuses on the civilian and military agencies of government fid helps train these agencies and assists them in establishing programs that are designed to free and protect the society from subversion lawlessness and insurgency imet and fid are paid for by the united states fms on the other hand is part of the foreign assistance act of 1961 as amended and the arms export control act of 1976 as amended fms requires the recipients to reimburse the united states for all defense supplies and training they receive in all three programsimet fid and fmsthe receiving nations needs are important factors in determining the content of the program three differences set jcet apart from the us military assistance programs above in contrast to imet eimet fid or fms the jcet program 1 primarily concerns us sof 2 uses different funding source controlled by dod and 3 is intended primarily to train and benefit us sof not the foreign military forces of note elements of fid are in high demand as jcet training this may be cause of concern because fid supports domestic agendas of host governments and normally implies some level of internal threat or active insurgency34 an active counterinsurgency program would require congressional approval to train and support approval process and civilian oversight jcets begin with request by sof unit to meet mission essential task list training requirement combatant cinc or host nation military or government us ambassador may also request jcet ussocom and the theater cincs determine feasibility sof unit availability and the need for the specific proposed or requested training the theater special operations commands obtain concurrence from the appropriate embassies and request from them any known

focus of human rights at the state department as the state department has bureau that monitors human rights and dod does not dod assumes state and the embassies coordinate and exchange information on

senate and the armed services national security and international relations committees of the house of representatives42 according to dod there is nothing secret about the jcet program it is very public43 there seem to be conflicting ways of accounting for jcet training not all sof training in given country may be classified as jcet that is for the sof units primary benefit operations and maintenance money is set aside to train sof but not all om money will be used as 10 usc 2011 funds newspaper articles have suggested the om money training objectives and units are not consistently accounted for in the annual report44 the inconsistencies appear to support claims that the jcet objectives are changed to suit the decision makers as to what is or is not called jcet exercise45 it appears that some of the jcet accounting inconsistencies arise from the fact that several one or two person trips have been classified as jcets these trips may have been for embassy staff training or

trips under jcet authority but they were not actual jcet missions47 though congress receives an afterthefact annual report under 2011 congressional oversight is generally absent in the planning and execution phases of jcet while jcet and sof training ultimately fall under the house and senate defense committees they operate without the same restrictions the foreign affairs committees place on other programs jcets are subject to different appropriations and authorizations channels hence in the past military commanders and ambassadors had wide degree of latitude and discretion in directing and approving sof training even in countries under sanctions48 congressional concerns human rights are major us policy concern human rights issues are reflected in jcet oversight vetting of foreign units and more pointedly what units the sof teams train and what actions those units and personnel are involved in after the jcet some members of congress consider sof leading force of us influence abroad49 as such jcet instructors should be conducting training and not establishing policy in foreign nations the biggest problem may not be the actual jcet training but rather the appearance that it is being carried out without reference to any larger policy framework50 jcets may be viewed by some as directly undermining us efforts to promote democracy demilitarization and respect for human rights foreign units that have participated in jcets have been implicated in human rights abuses either before or after they were trained questions have been raised on procedures and responsibilities for vettingthe process of identifying units and individuals accused of human rights abuses and denying them us training dod has been accused of not properly vetting units for human rights abusers

units in the host nation pentagon spokesman kenneth bacon asserts that ambassador approval gives degree of diplomatic oversight and monitoring that the state department takes very seriously and we in dod take very seriously as well we have not carried out proposed missions in cases where the state department has raised objections one example that occurred recently was nigeria where the state department raised objections to planned mission and it did not take place52 countries that raised cause for concern after jcet exercises took place are indonesia colombia and rwanda specific jcet and human rights issues in selected nations recent press accounts have highlighted jcet deployments in indonesia colombia and rwanda training in these countries has been controversial and contentious due to their human rights records and involvement of their armed forces in suppressing opposition indonesia congress terminated imet money for indonesia to punish the suharto government after the 1991 massacre of 270 protesters by indonesian troops in east timor53 this 1992 congressional training ban prevented indonesian military officers from receiving further training54 until 1996 when expanded imet was granted55 the eimet reportedly focused on human rights training and classroom instruction56 after the 1992 imet ban dod continued training sof in indonesia under jcet for example army special

concern in letter to defense secretary cohen evans stressed the 1992 imet ban was meant to send strong signal to the suharto regime that the united states would not tolerate human rights violations and that he and the other members were deeply concerned that our military has continued training indonesian forces under different program and they viewed the training as an effort to circumvent congressional intent60 unlike eimet some jcets taught lethal tactics the recipient for most jcets was the kopassus the jcet training indonesia received was designed to repel potential external enemy the training will also prove useful if indonesian forces participate in an international peacekeeping effort relevant to the human rights issue the jcets did not specifically teach indonesian forces to fight or suppress their own people according to us embassy personnel in indonesia none of the urban warfare curriculum taught crowd control furthermore the exercises fit eimet guidelines61 prior to the jcet suspension on may 8 1998 62 all jcets in indonesia were approved by the ambassador or his country team63 as the indonesian crisis unfolded earlier this year members of congress spoke out

be the same as it is fighting leftist guerrillas as well as drug traffickers the issues for us policymakers are 1 whether and to what extent to support military guilty of human rights abuses and 2 how to support the colombian military without getting involved in counterinsurgency the colombian military does not have the resources it needs to adequately deal with both the guerillas and the drug rings the military is also getting pressure from the colombian government concerning human rights abuses due to human rights abuses by the colombian military congress passed legislation in 1995 to

counternarcotics training77 janes reported us sof heavily involved in columbia78 the nature of the counternarcotic war in columbia is source of confusion and concern us military official in colombia reportedly said we can call anything counterdrugs if youre going to take out target it doesnt make much difference if you call it drug lab or guerilla camp theres not much difference between counterdrug and counterinsurgency we just dont use the insurgency word anymore because it is politically too sensitive79 because the guerillas protect the drug labs the counternarcotic effort takes on all of the appearances of counterinsurgency initiative to fight the drugs the colombian military has to fight the guerillas as well jcets are separate from the counternarcotics program in colombia in 1998 there have been 6 jcets with 32 people total the counternarcotics training provided by the us has consisted of 18 deployments and 252 people the jcets provided counter terrorism and hostage

counter narcotics to counterinsurgency something the administration must request from congress the appearance is that jcets are supporting counterinsurgency training bypassing congressional intent to

us also trains sof with jcet deployments there us efforts to promote human rights recently have been overshadowed by questions on whether or not us forces trained rwandan units that committed atrocities during the war in zaire the charges some rwandan units with abuses that constitute crimes against humanity including massacre of civilians and refugees rep smith questioned if the dod had investigated whether sof trained any of the suspected units under jcet the pentagon had not investigated any of the units because it was not required to under 10 usc 2011 defense officials are

zaire the jcet conducted by fort bragg sof team taught smallunit leader training rifle marksmanship first aid land navigation and patrolling88 some of the 30 rwandan soldiers may have been involved in the rapes murders genocide robberies and other widespread atrocities reported by the media it may be that the rwandan military is observing human rights in peace but not in war89 as result us human rights training is completely eclipsed by later abuses of these units even so the shear scope and magnitude of the abuses and atrocities attributed to the rwandan patriotic army suggests 30 soldiers cannot be solely responsible90 revenge killings in zaire may have continued anyway91 field investigator kathi austin visiting scholar at the center for african studies at stanford university and consultant to the international crisis group in brussels and other human rights organizations stated that the us is losing human rights credibility without denunciation from the state department or white house according to some activists state department arguments that say sof training moderates rwandan behavior and teaches the law of war are good without tangible results92 other nations the us has conducted jcets with over 100 countries worldwide most of them have not been contentious the us has even used jcets to train with formal allies for example sof conducted at least one jcet with the british in africa93 navy seal team used jcet in turkey to learn the local terrain meet host counterparts practice language skills operate with the host unit and experience the environment94 generally

working more military to military ties than civilian to civilian ties recent legislative initiatives have attempted to resolve some of these issues recent legislative initiatives the senate armed

officials say that secretary of state madeleine albright will require ambassadors to ensure all host units are vetted for human rights abuses before they participate in training with the us military the ambassadors will make sure jcets are not training units when there is credible information or evidence of gross violations the defense department reportedly has voiced concern that this process could hobble the jcet program106 leahy amendment congress attached an amendment the leahy amendment to the department of defense fy1999 appropriations act pl 105262 due to reports that training was provided under jcet to colombian troops despite previous restrictions congress elected to prohibit any funds from being used to allow us sofs to train foreign units if the state department has credible information that member of the unit had committed gross violation of human rights an exception could be made if corrective steps were taken to prevent further abuses107 the amendment does not specify those steps one interpretation is that the aid restriction means military units must be vetted of troops with adverse human rights records before those units can receive training or equipment another interpretation is that the perpetrators must be brought to justice sen leahy said our special forces have trained foreign troops without regard for who they are or whether they turn around and

sanctioned by congress and it establishes guidelines for dod the bill was not acted on by the 105th congress further options steps are being taken by dod and the department of state on their own initiatives besides the initiatives discussed above several other options exist for realigning jcet with us policy should congress choose to do so one way to revise oversight is to amend public law to specify which committee gets the annual report containing jcet deployment information dod comptroller instructions already specify which committees osd is to send the report to but it is not in 10 usc 2011 the committees could hold hearings after delivery of the annual reports alternately the new sasc subcommittee for emerging threats and capabilities including wmd sof and terrorism could do the same115 another approach would be to set manpower monetary or country thresholds that would flag when jcet is being conducted in an area of potential embarrassment congress could make the state department through policies executed at the embassies be responsible for approving and disapproving jcets based on these new guidelines thresholds might include the size of the jcet force which is usually small 40 people or less or the amount of money again small at 152 million in fy1997 alternately congress could determine set of criteria for the type of training allowed for recipient country restricting jcets there to noncombat skills congress could review dod instructions and guidance dod has already begun revising these under new guidelines secdef will approve jcets on monthly basis asd solic dod general counsel usdp and several other senior civilians within dod are now part of the approval and oversight process embassies and cincs will share review and document human rights information on foreign units trained under jcet state receives dods jcet list before the jcets are executed in its implementation of pl 105262 section 8130 dod must take into account human rights information provided by state and the embassies special operations commands document vetting by the state department the country team or the ambassador dod prefers to leave human rights determinations to the department of state however dod may be able to track units and personnel it trains under jcet however host countries may not be forthcoming with information dod sees need and value to train with full units human rights considerations could eliminate jcet deployments in some countries116 finally there are inconsistencies between dod and the state department concerning jcet dod might clarify jcet definitions and standardize reporting and 114 httpthomaslocgovcgibinqueryzc105hr4874 115 us senate committee on armed services press release january 14 1999 116 priest washington post

weapons of mass destruction wmd became ussocoms top priority mission for 1998 the mission includes finding securing classifying defusing destroying in place or transporting to safe location whole range of chemical biological or nuclear weapons119 major challenge sofs face is the lack of human intelligence on some smaller nations in which they may have to operate someday120 sof teams arguably need realistic training and conventional exercises provide little help in this regard sof units rarely get into action in war games121 the margin for error in recovering wmd conducting counter terrorist operation or hostage rescue is extremely small jcets provide skills and information that may prove vital to the success of future operation somewhere in the world whatever actions congress takes to correct or fine tune the jcet approval and oversight process other issues remain key issue is what restraints are appropriate and at what cost in dealing with third world militaries when training us forces to face enemies that are often more elusive and dangerous than those typically faced in the past in problem countries in which imet is suspended with the possibility of needed sof action to evacuate us citizens in the future should allowances be made for jcet what should be the criteria when considering the genocide in rwanda is any benefit sof receive worth the damage to the
