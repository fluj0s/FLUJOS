loan mortgage corporation freddie mac conforming loan limit as rule lenders permit eligible borrowers to obtain v aguaranteed home loans for four times th v guaranty amount in effect the maximum v aguaranteed home loan is often equal to the freddie mac loan limit39 the economic stimulus act of 2008 stimulus act pl 110185 increased the freddie mac conforming loan limits temporarily through december 31 2008 to the higher of the 2008 conforming loan limits417000 for singlefamily homes or 125 of the median home price for the area in which the property is locatedbut in case could the loan limit exceed 175 of the 2008 limit depending on the location of the property the freddie mac loan limit could be between 417000 and 729750 after enactment of the stimulus act it was discovered that the increased limits for freddie mac did not apply to v aguaranteed home loans because of the manner in which the language of the act was drafted this was corrected by identical language that was enacted in two subsequent lawssec 2201 of the housing and economic recover act of 2008 hera pl 110289 and sec 501 of the veterans benefits improvement act of 2008 pl 110389 hera and pl 110 389 provided that through december 31 2008 the maximum v guaranty amount was 25 of the freddie mac loan limit as increased by the stimulus act present law 40 provides that an eligible veteran may obtain v aguaranteed loan to refinance an existing loan on home owned and occupied by the veteran but the maximum va guaranty was 3600041 and the refinanced loan could not exceed 90 of the value of the property42 as noted above lenders will generally make v aguaranteed loans for up to four times the v guaranty amount so 36000 guaranty implies that the maximum amount for refinanced loan would be 144000 this is significantly less than the amount that veteran may obtain for purchasing home 417000 to 729750 sec 503 of hera amended the law to provide the same guaranty amount for homes purchased or refinanced by veteran the section also permitted v guaranteed refinance loans to be made for up to 100 of the value of the property the v as authority to guaranty adjustable rate mortgages arms expired on september 30 2008 sec 505 of pl 110389 extended that authority through september 30 2012

representation of veterans before the v and its predecessors this regulation has continued to evolve over the years with congress establishing various standards for representation criteria and guidelines for fees and limitation on when veteran may engage the services of an attorney on fee basis to represent him or her in the appeals process the v claims appeal process is detailed multistep procedure 56 law enacted in the 109th congress pl 109461the veterans benefits health care and information technology act of 2006 57 acthas modified attorney participation in appeals the secretary of veterans affairs secretary is required to provide additional qualifications and standards for agents58 and attorneys who represent veterans before the v these standards deal with 1 training and character and 2 fee criteria and limitations the secretary is authorized to charge and collect fees from the agents or attorneys to be used for administrative expenses for veterans benefits programs the following grounds for suspension of agents and attorneys are provided in the act presenting frivolous claims prior suspensions charging excessive or unreasonable fees or failure to comply with the secretarys regulations significant change that the act made in the role of attorneys in the appeal process is when in the appeal process an attorney may commence services for fees previously an attorney could not represent veteran for fee until the board of veterans appeals bv made final decision 59 this had the effect of excluding an attorney from the process until all of the administrative appeals had been exhausted the act now permits an attorney to enter the appeal process at much earlier dateafter the veteran has received decision on his or her claim from the v and decides to appeal this initial decision administratively through the filing of notice of disagreement nod 60 an attorney may now provide representation for fee after the nod is filed the act requires the secretary to provide congress with an evaluation of the effect of the new system of representation not later than 42 months after the date of its enactment the act 56 see crs report rl33704 veterans affairs the

order reduction in an agreed upon fee if the secretary finds the fee excessive or unreasonable the secretarys decision may be reviewed by the bv which is authorized to make the final review of the issue61 permitting paid legal representation at an earlier stage in the veterans appeal procedure has been somewhat controversial while veterans groups such as the national organization of veterans advocates nov and the paralyzed veterans of america pv have supported the change other groupsmost notably the disabled american veterans da vhave vigorously opposed the change have continued to oppose implementation of the law and have sought repeal of the law62 opposition to the change may be summariz ed into three broad categories first representatives of veterans groups have been the exclusive representatives of veterans in the v administrative appeal process and are reluctant to change this arrangement second there is belief that any benefits should belong exclusively to the veteran and should not be shared or paid to legal representative third there may be reluctance to have previous work done by veteran representatives reviewed by attorneys hr 1318 introduced by representative ron wis would have repealed the authority for certain agent or attorney representation in veterans benefit cases before the v in effect the bill would have returned to the procedure that existed before pl
