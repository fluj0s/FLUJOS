us designed and stockpiled tactical nuclear weapons todays threats consist of regional instabilities and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruc tion wmd however the us as well as many other nations actively pursues policy of nonproliferation despite this the number of nations who have or are developing nuclear weapons continues to grow therefore the us may some day find itself confronted by an opponent who possesses nuclear weapons because of the continuing reduction in the size of us military forces the us could also find itself opposed by an overwhelming conventional threat either scenario could lead to the use of nuclear weapons therefore the us must concern itself with countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction despite the continuing drawdown of us military forces the current national military strategy includes fighting and winning two nearsimultaneous regional wars with conventional forces any us threat of employing nuclear weapons is to deter potential adversarys use of such weapons if deterrence fails the goal is to end hostilities on terms acceptable at the lowest level of conflict to the us and its allies however the us unilaterally reserves the right to use nuclear weapons if necessary use would be restricted of course with tight limits on the area and time of use this would allow the belligerent to recognize the signal of limited response and to react accordingly the army describes battlefield nuclear warfare bnw in terms of being able to conduct continuous combat operations in nuclear environment the presence of any nuclearcapable system before during or after nuclearweapons employment by either friendly or enemy forces creates nuclear environment the implications of their very presence creates the nuclear environment before 1991 the us army had custody of tactical nuclear weapons which were to be employed on presidential release by organic army field artillery units in september 1991 the presidential nuclear initiative pni removed the organic nuclear responsibility from the us army today the army neither has custody of nuclear weapons nor do corps and divisions employ them the us air force or the us navy are now responsible for delivery of nuclear weapons in support of army operations the army retains its role in nominating nuclear targets and is also responsible for nuclear force protection this manual establishes army doctrine for operations in nuclear environment and details the doctrine for integrating nuclear considerations into all other aspects of the battlefield it also describes the armys role in nominating targets at corps and above levels and protecting the force from the effects of nuclear weapons detonation nuclear operations may occur at strategic operational and tactical levels of war nuclear employment in theater of operations has theater strategic operational and tactical results execution has national strategic implications the corps role is to function at either the tactical or operational levels of war at the tactical level the corps accomplishes missions as field manual fm 10015 describes at the operational level when directed and augmented the corps functions as either the army force arfor the joint force land component command jflcc or joint task force jtf by viewing the corps in its many possible roles the reader can also discern nuclear procedures for echelons above corps eac and joint missions this manual can help educate and train commanders and staffs at corps and operational levels in nuclear operations and educate and train divisions in nuclear force protection it is used with joint publications jp 3121 3 122 srd or 3123 and serves as the bridge between joint and vifm 10030 army doctrine it is also used with fm 2550 which contains

used in this manual masculine pronouns apply to both men and women viichapter 1 transition from joint nuclear doctrine the nuclear environment nuclear environment exists if either adversary in conflict possesses nuclear capabilities and if any of the following elements are present there is capability by belligerent to deliver weapons of mass destruction nuclear weapon is in the area of responsibility aor there is possibility of deployment or employ ment of nuclear weapons into an aor in nuclear environment decisive battles might be greatly compressed the course of campaigns could be radically altered or accelerated the threat of and the lethal consequences of nuclearweapons use can greatly influence military operations and increase the battlefields complexity the army supported by joint assets must be capable of ducting all operations in such an environment nuclear operations fall into two basic categories immediate nuclear support and preplanned nuclear support both terms define the use of nuclear weap ons against hostile forces in support of friendly air land and naval operations nuclear support should the employment of nuclear weapons become neces sary the commander in chief cinc andor joint forces commander after receiving release permis sion from the president through the national com mand authorities nca can use either of these two forms of support to alter the balance between firepower and ma neuver to affect the tempo and destructiveness of operations to respond to the enemys use of weapons of mass destruction using nuclear weapons at the proper time and place can create conditions for decisive results commanders at corps and above integrate nuclearweapons into other systems to achieve the greatest operational advantage nuclearweapons use will not change warfare fundamentals however it will create conditions that could significantly affect how commanders apply them levels of war the levels of warstrategic operational and tacticalhelp clarify activities by echelons within the theater across the full range of military opera tions they provide useful framework within which cinc can order activities within his area of responsibility the levels of war also help com manders visualize logical flow of operations an allocation of resources and the assignment of tasks each level of war is defined by the extent of com mand authority scope of perspectives designated responsibilities and the intended outcome at the strategic level of war the perspectives are worldwide and longrange at the operational level of war military forces attain theater strategic objec tives through designing organizing and conducting campaigns and major operations the concern at the tactical level of war is the execution of battles and engagements the cinc normally operates at the theater stra tegic level of war the corps commander could be the senior army commander subordinate to the cinc in this capacity he may operate at the opera tional or tactical levels in this situation the corps commander may also be responsible for the nuclear targetnomination process and the nuclear biologi cal and chemical nbc protection process concerns and views regarding nuclear employ ment differ at each level of nuclear operations battlefield nuclear operations support the opera tionallevel commanders concept and intent corps and eac commanders are normally responsible for nuclear target nominations commanders at divi sion and lower levels normally operate at the tactical level of war and are responsible for the nbc defense process 11fm 10030 deterrence although the us military forces overriding sion is to deter war especially nuclear war the intent behind the 1991 presidential nuclear initiative pni was to enhance national security through arms reduction while preserving the capability to regenerate selected forces if required recent arms control agreements and unilateral initiatives provide for real reductions in the arsenals of nuclear powers however even with the most optimistic outlook the sheer number of remaining weapons is formidable an increasing number of potentially hostile states are developing or have the capability to develop weapons of mass destruction therefore the us must maintain modem reliable and fully capable strategic deterrent as its number one defense priority deterrence is the product of nations military capabilities and that nations willingness to use those capabilities the us policy is to terminate conflict at the lowest possible level of violence consistent with national and allied interests the ability to conduct operational and tacticallevel nuclear activities enhances us deterrent policy the potential employment of nuclear weapons at theater level when combined with the means and resolve to use them makes the prospects of conflict more dangerous and the outcome more difficult to predict the us position is that it can achieve deterrence if any potential enemy believes the out come of nuclear war to be so uncertain and the conflict so debilitating that he will have incen tive to initiate nuclear attack the resulting uncer tainty reduces potential aggressors willingness to risk escalation by initiating conflict at the same time credible defensive capability which would include the threat of employing nu clear weapons could bolster the resolve of allies to resist an adversarys attempts at political coercion for example the us capability of responding to biological and chemical attacks with nuclear weap ons would likely reduce or eliminate such attacks nuclear weapons contribute to but do not by themselves ensure deterrence to have credible nuclear deterrent requires nation to have the means the ability and the will to employ nuclear weapons the nation must also have reliable warning systema modern nuclear force the capability and flexibility to support spec trum of response options deployable defensive system for theater protection the threat of nuclear escalation is major concern in any military operation involving the armies of nuclear powers controlling escalation is essential to limiting rational threats incentive for nuclear response escalation control involves careful lection of options to convey to the enemy that although the us is capable of escalating operations to higher level it has deliberately withheld strikes the us views restraint in the use of nuclear weapons as an important way to control the escala tion of warfare restraint provides leverage for negotiated termination of military operations how ever the us cannot assume potential enemy will view restraint in the same way or that he will not employ weapons of mass destruction therefore the us must be capable of deploying those forces nec essary to defeat aggression provide coercion and bring the war to speedy termination on terms favorable to the us and its allies commanders and staffs at all levels must continue to be familiar with nuclearweapons effects the actions required to minimize such effects and the risks associated with using nuclear weapons the threat the cold war eras definitive threats to american security were nuclear surprise attack and the possi ble invasion of western europe the new threat is worldwide regional instability including the possi ble regional use of nuclear weapons coupled with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction developing countries as well as regional powers are gaining the ability to manufacture nuclear arse nals the current threat from developing nations primarily consists of short and intermediaterange ballistic and cruise missiles and aircraft capable of carrying nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction other threats such as terrorists groups may also possess nuclear weapons nation that has the capability of using ballistic or cruise missiles and highspeed aircraft to deliver weapons of mass destruction at extended ranges 12fm 10030 significantly increases those weapons effective ness as instruments of terror such capability also enhances the possibility of conflict escalation be yond hostile regions boundaries the use of or the threat of using weapons of mass destruction within campaign or major operation can cause largescale shifts in objectives phases and courses of action coa nuclear weapons make it possible to drastically change the effective ratio of regional forces and equipment and to create conditions favorable to threats operations sequently if potential adversary is not successful conventionally he might consider using weapons of mass destruction the most accepted enemy employment method ology to destroy critical targets is surprise poten tial enemy might try to destroy massed units and all other critical targets using various nuclearweapons burst options space bursts air bursts surface bursts belowsurface bursts such attacks might be single attacks or part of group of massed nuclear strikes therefore retaliation or escalation would result in the likelihood of nuclear use against friendly forces or retaliation or escalation could be used in response to an enemys first use of weapons of mass destruction one element of the commanders critical infor mation requirements ccir is determining if the theater threat is capable of using weapons of mass destruction the answer dictates future command actions proliferation nonproliferation and counterproliferation proliferation is the process by which one nation after another comes into the possession of or attains the right to determine the employment of nuclear weapons each potentially able to launch nuclear attack upon another nation nonproliferation efforts focus on preventing the spread of missiles and weapons of mass destruction through arms and ex port controls beyond the scope of corps and eac interest counterproliferation strategy focuses on military measures centering both on how to deter or discourage as well as how to defend and attack against the possible use of such weaponsthe department of defenses dod counterpro liferation initiative recognizes the goal of prevent ing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their associated delivery systems it also recog nizes that the us must continue to expand its efforts to protect forces interests and allies the initiative has two fundamental goals to strengthen dods contribution to govern mentwide efforts to prevent or diplomatically reverse the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction to protect us interests and forces as those of its allies from wmd effects by assuring that us forces have the equipment doctrine and intelli gence needed to confront if necessary any future opponent who possesses weapons of mass destruction the department of defense marshals its unique technical military and intelligence expertise to improve arms control compliance to control exports to inspect and monitor the movement of nuclear materials to interdict shipments for inspection during crises to strengthen the norms and incentives against wmd acquisition the department of defenses acquisition strategy in the areas of command control communications and intelligence c3i counterforce operations ac tive defense and passive defense address the fol lowing critical counterproliferation challenges detecting and destroying wmd capabilities from production through storage to deployment conducting military operations in wmd envi ronment dealing with consequences of wmd use includ ing medical treatment cleanup and recovery coping with the diffusion of new technologies note this manual concerns the nuclear part of weapons of mass destruction although nuclear weapons are an element of terrence potential regional adversaries might or might not understand the deterrence value of the 13fm 10030 us nuclear weapons if the goals of promoting peace deterring war and resolving conflicts fail deterrence fails therefore fighting and terminating hostilities become paramount united states doc trine assumes that if the potential foe is capable of using weapons of mass destruction then us forces must act accordingly nuclear forces nuclearcapable forces navy and air force are instruments of national power in regional conflicts they contribute to theater deterrence or provide warfighting option to the nca because the army longer has an organic nu clear capability the navy or air force will provide nuclear support the army can now only nominate nuclear targets usually at lower than the corps level the division normally is limited to nbc protection activities the capability of the us to deploy nuclear forces into theater significantly complicates the enemys planning process the alert status of nuclear forces is function of the world situation at any given time and thus enhances their responsiveness leadership battlefield stress in nuclear environment will be higher than us forces have ever experienced only disciplined welltrained and physically fit units can function well in such an environment commanders who understand this and who provide soldiers with strong positive leadership good mental and physical preparation and clear comprehensive plans will sure soldiers are in better position to survive and win units may have to operate with reduced mutual support and fire support with degraded electronic communications abilities along extended lines of communications loc and possibly without cen tralized control or continuous communications therefore to improve command and control c2 leaders must work toward three general goals which take on added importance in nuclear operations 1 instill an aggressiveness in their units that will transcend the shock and stress of the nuclear environment2 train junior leaders to think and operate independently 3 develop smallunit cohesion commanders and staffs must fully understand the potential of nuclearweapons use by both an adver sary and by us joint force they must also have working knowledge of nuclearweapons effects employment doctrine survivability measures necessary to preserve combat power medical requirements as result of nuclear explosion the psychological impact of nuclear warfare on soldiers and units as commanders plan and fight successive battles involving actual or possible nuclear operations they must continually assess their soldiers psychologi cal and physiological stresses commanders must emphasize situations in training exercises and leadership which will help soldiers accomplish their missions training on nuclear battlefield every soldier will front new and strange circumstances and be under constant danger of attack nuclear weapons will quickly cause many casualties as well as interme diate and longterm radiation effects soldiers will be exposed to death and destruction of magnitude far beyond imagination and may have to operate in widely dispersed isolated and semiindependent groups everyone must understand and practice sur vival and mitigation techniques such techniques will give soldiers direction and confidence in confusing frightening situation the large and sudden losses that nuclear attack will cause will shock and confuse inadequately trained or psychologically unprepared troops reac tion times will be slower and the ability to respond to leadership and the desire to perform at peak proficiency may be degraded the violence stress and confusion can easily divert attention from bat tlefield objectives extraordinary discipline and leadership are vital to overcoming distractions 14fm 10030 maintaining the missions focus and pressing the fight training the cornerstone of success technically and psychologically prepares soldiers for the nu clear environment successful nuclear

they have been trained clear concise policies and guide lines provide control and direction commanders must emphasize the fact that aggressive maneuver even by relatively small units will have high

significantly to the physical and psychological environment of combat they cause intense violent effects which severely affect unit movement employment and protection com manders at all levels must understand the opera tional and tactical implications of the nuclear environment and its effect on operations the basic effects of nuclear detonation are blast thermal radiation residual ionizing radiation initial radiation and electromagnetic pulse emp these effects can destroy or neutralize targets as well as impair through physical injury the operational ca pability of personnel flash blindness radiation sickness eardrum rupture and seconddegree burns are some of the injuries persons might experience weather terrain surface conditions and man made structures modify nuclearweapons effects also conditions existing naturally on the battlefield at any given moment can enhance or mitigate such effects therefore commanders must adequately prepare and train their units for all possibilities note see jp 3122 srd for us military forces only jp 3123 and da pamphlet pam 503 for indepth discussions of nuclear effects blast the blast wave static overpressure and dynamic pressure from nuclear air burst mostly causes materiel damage surface and subsurface bursts generally produce less airblast damage and more cratering most data on blast effects describe blasts as ob served on flat or gently rolling terrain there is quick and simple method for calculating changes in blast pressures in hilly mountainous or forested terrain in general compared to the same distance on flat terrain pressures are greater on the forward slopes of steep hills and lower on reverse slopes lineofsight shielding is not dependable blast waves can bend or diffract around obstacleshills may decrease dynamic pressure and offer some local protection from flying debris however small hills or folds in the ground are considered negligible for target analysis wooded hills lessen dynamic pressure but do not significantly affect overpressure wooded hills will also produce sig nificant wood splintering tree blowdown and forest fires the reflecting nature of surface over which weapon detonates significantly influences the dis tance to which blast effects extend smooth reflect ing surfaces such as ice snow sand moist soil and water reflect most of the blast energy maximizing its effects conversely surfaces with thick low combustible vegetation dry soils with sparse vege tation and desert sand minimize such effects builtup areas do not significantly affect blast waves effects and even though urban structures may provide some local shielding from flying bris they can also increase pressures by channeling blast wave weather conditions also affect blast damage rain and fog lessen the force of the blast wave by increasing air density and moisture these condi tions help dissipate the energy of the blast wave as it moves through the heavier air thermal radiation fireballs intense heat possesses high thermal energy that as thermal radiation is transmitted from the point of detonation over wide area thermal radiation travels at wavelengths from ultraviolet to infrared the atmosphere absorbs some of the ultra violet radiation therefore the prime source of ther mal radiation is the infrared thermal radiation can ignite materiel and cause serious burns however the effect of thermal radia tion on target is influenced by many factors including the state of the atmosphere and the targets thermal absorption qualities color thickness sistency and reflective properties for example when weapon detonates below an overcast sky the underside of the cloud layer acts as reflector 21fm 10030 the reflected energy is then added to that coming directly from the point of explosion the differing levels of energy released from the variousyield weapons further complicates the use of thermal effects for targeting the level of energy released is not the only effect the rate at which it is released also has impact smaller weapons release thermal energy relatively quicker than larger ones also larger weapons generate heat more slowly taking longer to dissipate or be conducted away therefore the total amount of thermal energy avail able for given type of weapon is directly propor tional to its yield although not basic effect flash blindness is phenomenon that soldiers might experience from the thermal effect from nuclear explosion flash blindness takes two formsdazzle and retinal burns dazzle is the most common form of flash blind ness its effect is similar to the temporary blindness that camera flash bulbs or bright car headlights at night cause the difference is in intensity dazzle effects from flash bulb are temporary inconven ience effects from nuclear burst are prolonged and cause far greater loss of vision looking directly at burst causes severe impairment of vision for from 2 to 3 minutes by day to over 10 minutes at night when the pupils are fully dilated two minutes is long time on battlefield and seems longer to pilots fiying highspeed aircraft the second and more serious form of flash blind ness results from retinal burns received when the lens of the eyes focus the image of the fireball onto the back of the eyes estimates of the risk of retinal burns vary small pinpoint retinal burns may heal in time but greater damage is unlikely to do so and will leave permanent blind spot in the affected eye some sources believe that only small percentage of troops will receive such injuries others believe this could be more serious threat residual ionizing radiation initial radiation and the operational exposure guide oeg residual ionizing radiation typically occurs after the first minute of detonation it primarily consists of energized impurity particles and debris falling back to earth because of air movement andorrainout residual ionizing radiation could be lin gering and widespread operational hazard within the first minute after nuclearweapon detonates initial radiation in the form of xrays gamma rays and neutrons is emitted initial radia tion travels at nearly the speed of light and can penetrate and damage materiel and injure personnel initial radiation can help defeat the enemy but it can also endanger friendly forces and the local civilian population denser air at sea level absorbs more initial radia tion than thinner air at higher altitudes as the height of burst hob or the temperature of the air in creases the air density decreases this allows initial radiation to extend farther because it is less absorbed by air molecules an important factor influencing the amount of initial radiation target receives is shielding for example the surrounding ground acting as an ab sorber or shield will sharply reduce the initial ra diation from surface and subsurface bursts terrain features can greatly influence initial radiation ef fects minor irregularities such as ditches gullies and small folds in the ground offer some protection major terrain features such as large hills and forests can provide significant protection for equipment and personnel depending on the height of burst people inside buildings tanks or individual fight ing positions receive lower initial radiation doses than people in the open and at the same distance from the nuclear detonation how much less pends on how much initial radiation the intervening material absorbs all material absorbs some nuclear radiation however because of the high penetrating power of neutrons and gamma rays the shielding material must be quite thick to provide significant protection dense materials such as armored vehicles offer excellent protection against gamma rays some readily available lowdensity materials offer the best protection against neutrons depending on its moisture content soil may also be good neutron shield for example an individual fighting position with 1 meter of overhead soil protection will shield its occupant from as much as 98 percent of the neutron radiation material sufficient to protect against gamma rays also provides some protection against neutrons as 22fm 10030 general guideline soldiers can construct shields of minimum thickness meant to absorb both neutrons and gamma rays by either alternating layers of high to lowdensity materials or by thoroughly mixing such materials units may encounter nuclear contamination from sources other than weapons detonation possible sources include fallout caused by the destruction of an enemys nuclear weapons production facility enemy stockpiled weapons and nuclear energy re actors both friendly and enemy another source of contamination would be the deliberate spread of radioactive materiel over friendly forces or terrain nuclear environment can be created without the introduction or detona tion of yieldproducing weapon therefore com manders at all levels must be aware of this possibility as well as the possibility of the contami nation from nonweapons sources that could signifi cantly affect operations note see fm 315 and the fm 3series manuals for description of actions to counter these events the operational exposure guide oeg ex pressed in terms of negligible or emergency risk criteria is the key to nuclear contamination avoid ance the oeg gives the commander flexible system of radiation exposure control the com mander specifies oeg for his units level of radia tion the level of exposure must be kept as low as possible based on the stated oeg leaders can select units with low radiation exposure to perform necessary missions establishing and using oeg procedures helps leaders successfully employ units on radiologi cally contaminated battlefield while keeping expo sure to the minimum extent possible consistent with the mission ignoring exposure control would be disastrous electromagnetic pulse emp on impact with the earths atmosphere or with solid materials initial radiation liberates free elec trons the free electrons create two additional ef fects the emp and the transient radiation effects on electronics tree the emp can severely degrade and destroy unprotected command control com munications computers and intelligence c4i operationselectromagnetic pulse directly injures personnel only if they are physically touching metallic collec tors such as cables at the time of an emp surge hazards may also exist from indirect or secondary emp effects for example damaged electronic equipment might catch fire also pilots may receive incorrect information from digital instruments upset by emp appropriate standing operating proce dures sop help mitigate secondary effects both emp and tree can burn out electronic components or upset system operations upset ditions can occur at low signal levels because per manent damage occurs when currents induced by emp and tree exceed the capacity of particular circuit within system shielding sensitive electri cal and electronic components is the best protection against burnout for example disconnecting an tenna cables when the equipment is not in use is recommended mitigation technique for emp in field operations highaltitude nuclear bursts ionize the atmos phere and cause serious widespread blackout of highfrequency hf shortwave and synchronous satellite relay communications blackouts can last from few minutes to several hours in highly ionized regions caused by lowaltitude bursts blackout interference generally decreases as emp frequency increases most emp energy is at frequencies below 100 megahertz blackouts from low air bursts are usually not significant dustladen clouds from low air bursts cause blackout effects lasting from few seconds to several minutes at most and then only when fireball or dust cloud blocks transmission paths actual interference pends on how many nuclear bursts occur the alti tudes at which they occur and the areas over which they occur units can reduce blackout by using wire communications systems however system with wires especially long wires is more susceptible to emp routing radio communications through retrans mission station or manual relay to bypass the blackout region assigning alternate frequencies if the signal operations so officer suspects that an ionized region is producing interference he tries higher 23fm 10030 frequencies first when it appears dust is the problem he tries lower frequencies figure 21 shows the range of vulnerability which varies significantly within each category for some common types of equipment communi cations equipment operators use the following gen eral rules to make rough estimates of the electronic equipments emp vulnerability1 2 3 4any system that employs highspeed integrated technology such as personal computers are considered vulnerable to emp and tree if operated in an unshielded environment older equipment that uses discrete components of semiconductors and transistors are less likely to be susceptible to emp damage than stateoftheart equipment equipment with large collectors is more susceptible to emp damage than equipment with smaller collectors because the emp energy collected is strong function of the surface area exposed to emp unhardened radios operating at frequencies of 100 megahertz or below such as hf systems have higher probability of emp damage than communications equipment which operates at higher frequencies note none of these rules apply to emphardened equipment the hardness or vulnerability level of specific items of equipment is classified for more information see jp 3122 srd unit survivability survivability operations take on increased impor tance in nuclear environment the destructive power of nuclear weapons requires new measures to reduce vulnerability and to increase survivability the commander must employ appropriate collec tive nbc protective measures given the units sion and the threat it faces note see also jp 3121 the commander also promotes survivability at least to forward elements of close combat forces by closing with the threat commanders should use scheme of maneuver that contributes both to the combat objective and to survivability for example infiltrating at multiple points and conducting spoil ing attacks commanders must rapidly assess nuclear effects and determine appropriate actions and responses the immediate impact on combat power can grade the forcess ability to accomplish current and future missions the commander must also deter mine longterm effects on future operations cerns at all levels are 24fm

chapter 4 for detailed dis cussion of individual protection survivability operations using sound active and passive protective measures and practices are in tended to protect friendly forces from the effects of enemy weapons systems sound survivability prac tices reduce forces vulnerability to detection to attack if detected and to destruction if attacked however measures to reduce vulnerability to one form of attack may increase vulnerability to other forms of attack and might detract from the overall effectiveness of the force for example dispersion may reduce vulnerability from nuclear attacks but increase vulnerability to infiltration and invite feat in detail positioning dispersion mass versus dispersion countermeasures and mitigation tech niques all lead to unit survivability positioning dispersion positioning or dispersion can enhance survivabil ity however dispersing combat units in direct pro portion to threats nuclear weapons and yields is neither possible nor desirable the degree of disper sion possible should be that which permits mission accomplishment while not subjecting the force to an unacceptable risk from attack the difficulties with dispersion include movement of equipment coordi nation and supportability although dispersion can enhance units sur vival it can also restrict tactical flexibility and in hibit mobility dispersion reduces vulnerability but dispersion beyond the range of effective c2reduces combat power and increases the possibility of mission failuremass versus dispersion because measures that enhance survivability re duce combat power the commander must carefully manage active and passive protection measures dispersion is an example of the former camou flage of the latter protective measures contribute to battlefield success but they cannot ensure it massing effects on target rather than massing forces significantly reduces the risk to the command when threat possesses nuclear weapons us forces conduct operations in anticipation of their use the commander maintains his ability to dis perse forces as rapidly as he massed them or he will present lucrative nuclear target this is the mass versus dispersion dilemma note see fm 331 for tactics techniques and procedures ttp on solving the mass versus dis persion dilemma countermeasures an antagonist having sophisticated intelligence systems is great threat because it can monitor friendly communications see the battlefield from overhead locate emitters and control agents deep in rear areas countermeasures employ devices or techniques to impair the operational effectiveness of an emys activities countermeasures might include operations security opsec which can prevent the enemy from obtaining information about army operations deception which can prevent the enemy from obtaining unit location and activity information information security which can prevent disclo sure of information about unit locations and ac tivities from written verbal and graphic communications sources physical security which can prevent equipment signatures profiles and patterns signals security sigsec which can protect nuclear operational information by using 25fm 10030 communications security comsec and elec tronic security elsec techniques analysis of information gathered through intelli gence operations to predict enemy intentions mitigation techniques mitigation techniques are expedients the force accomplishes using only equipment and material available on the battlefield mitigation techniques will not totally overcome nuclear vulnerability however used wisely they can lessen the vulner ability of personnel and equipment to nuclearweap ons effects techniques may be as simple as using anchors tiedowns and outriggers to build shelters using equipment at hand to dig shelters or using tracked vehicles as overhead cover techniques may also include wetting down or compacting fensive positions to enhance radiation protection measures that provide security against detection also often provide some protection against nuclear attack or can minimize nuclearweapons effects one measure is terrain shielding which minimizes the risks of detection as well as reducing the extent and severity of nuclearweapons effects any cover including natural vegetation signifi cantly reduces thermal radiation effects and may even diminish the intensity of nuclear radiation hills and folds of ground between the unit and the detonation can somewhat reduce nuclear effects natural and manmade terrain features individual fighting positions with overhead covers or but tonedup armored vehicles can also modify blast waves and lessen nuclear effects equipment survivability equipment survivability in nuclear environment begins with the materielacquisition process before hostilities begin equipment must be able to with stand the initial effects of nuclear weapon and still accomplish its mission the commander should not confuse nuclear sur vivability with nbccontamination survivability the latter is the capability of system and its crew to withstand an nbccontaminated battlefield including one with residual ionizing radiation with out losing the ability to accomplish its mission the armys goal is for soldiers who survive exposure to nuclearweapons effects to retain their missionessential equipment in condition which would enable them to complete their missions equipment failure must not disarm soldiers who could otherwise continue their missions methods and techniques to enhance survivability units can ensure the survivability of their equip ment by avoidance using mobility concealment and ception to avoid attack redundancy proliferating so many systems or components on the battlefield that the loss of few would not affect the mission reconstitution possessing the ability to repair or replace equipment on the battlefield in enough time to complete the mission mitigation employing fieldexpedient tech niques which soldiers and units can readily ac complish using only what is available hardening designing equipment to withstand ex posure to nuclearweapons effects the best approach to equipment survivability is usually some combination of these means the com mander should consider all of them some means increase survivability against conventional as well as nuclear threats nonetheless given the unique and often farreaching effects of nuclear weapons some degree of nuclear hardening is the best ap proach in most instances balanced survivability is the essence of the armys philosophy survivability of missionessen tial equipment must be balanced with that of crew survivability it implies specific requirements to make crewserved equipment or systems as surviv able as the crewbut more survivable than the crewand only in environments of tactical signifi cance note see fm 331 for detailed ttps for nuclear contamination avoidance 26fm 10030 nuclear environment arrival times the commander must also be aware of the arrival times of different nuclear effects on the battlefield this knowledge is critical to systems response and survivability nuclear effects fall into three general time frames 1 2 3effects which almost instantaneously arrive after detonation effects which arrive within the first few seconds to minutes effects which typically take from minutes to hours or even days to arrive note see figure 22 dynamics of combat power the dynamics of combat powermaneuver fire power protection and leadershipare vital nu clearweapons use by either side adds another

chal lenge confronting the army is how to accomplish the mission following nuclearweapons use this challenge is difficult but not impossible the key is the quality of leadership and the capability to oper ate in nuclear environment leadership and training may prove to be the deciding factor in future conflicts knowledge of the special physical and psychological hazards of the nuclear battlefield and doctrinal guidance and train ing to counter these hazards greatly improves the armys ability to operate successfully summary commanders and their staffs understand that when planning operations the use or possible use of nuclear weapons has specific tangible implica tions that go beyond the actual effects of detona tion nuclear weapons are highly destructive and have harmful effects that other weapons do not have commanders must plan for and implement measures to mitigate such effects commanders must also know how nuclearweap ons effects can affect personnel equipment and the dynamics

with the threat of the enemys use of weapons of mass destruction the likelihood of an enemy using weapons of mass destruction decreases as us and coalition forces demonstrate their ability to defend against such effects and to react to attacks with nuclear weapons the threat of nuclearweap ons use creates unacceptable risk to the enemy that combined with the will to react if necessary is the basis for us nuclear deterrent policy countries that cannot protect themselves against nuclear weapons may become the primary targets of an enemy whose aim is to disintegrate coalition force if necessary the us armed force reserves the right to employ all of its assets including nuclear weapons to support coalition needs therefore nu clear warfare is most likely during major regional crisis versus lesser conflict commanders must consider the aforementioned possibilities in all strategic operational and tactical planning they must also evaluate the availability of joint nuclear resources

weapons in theater of operations include enemy use of nbc weapons lack of conventional containment of enemy forces survival of the force from mass attack support of other strategic options the corps commander and his superiors amplify the following points when nominating nuclear weapons that the enemy has used or there are indications that he will immediately use nuclear weapons that the friendly force is facing overwhelming enemy conventional forces and cannot survive unless it uses nuclear weapons that the friendly force might require nuclear weapons to accomplish the campaign plan the decision to authorize nuclearweapons em ployment is the exclusive prerogative of the presi dent the theater cinc requests the release of nuclear weapons from the nca if he determines the situation requires their use the ncas control and constraint of nuclear weapons include seven elements 1 2 3 4 5 6 7a decision to use nuclear weapons the number type and yields of weapons the types of targets

process planning guidance the nuclear deliberateplanning process is the series of actions planners take to develop nuclear support that sister services will provide planners use the joint operations planning and execution system jopes in the deliberateplanning process to develop nuclear support plans figure 31 an 32fm 10030 example of deliberate planning is the process the commander and staff use when contemplating the possible use of nuclear forces in force projection during the deliberateplanning process the com batant command staff develops the concept plan conplan and coordinates it with the various subordinate commands and services when di rected the combatant command staff develops an operation plan oplan subordinate commands develop and coordinate supporting oplans during the process the staff coordinates the nu clear appendix of the operation annex to the oplan with corps and various commands the corps through the joint force land component com mander jflcc army forces arfor or joint task force provides input to appendix 1 nuclear to annex c operations of the oplan the joint force maritime component commander jfmcc and the joint force air component commander jfacc also provide input to appendix 1 the product of this coordination is the theater oplan note both the conplan and the oplan must conform to current procedures see jp 5031 vol ume vol i for more information while developing the oplan planners consoli date nuclear requirements into separate stand alone timephased force and deployment data tpfdd document the army and the other serv ices participate in this process to make sure they have considered all reasonable options and have met all requirements echelons below the cinc may or may not par ticipate in the nuclear decisionmaking process when army echelons subordinate to the cinc are involved the procedures in this manual apply targeting within the theater the targeting of nuclear weap ons may happen in one of three ways the theater cinc can conduct planning target ing and execution without consulting the subor dinate commander the theater cinc can inform the functional com ponent commander of what nuclear weapons are available and provide planning guidance for tar get nominationthe targeting selection can come directly from the continental us conus based on the cincs requirements the crisisaction planning process nuclear planning begins during peacetime dur ing crisis army commanders use the crisisaction planning process to modify or expand existing plans as needed for the army the nuclear crisisaction planning process includes determining require ments and developing options for support when contemplating the use of nuclear weapons based on threat and operational considerations the cinc decides whether the jflcc needs nuclear support he then directs the appropriate air or mari time component commanders to develop crisis action plan usstratcom assists the cinc in the crisisaction planning cap process he then issues his opord this phase is the execution planning phase the jflcc and the corps develop supporting plans to enhance the nomination process figure 32 page 34 force projection the stages of force projection force projection operations are inherently joint and usually begin as contingency operation in response to crisis situation force projection has eight stages mobilization predeployment activi ties deployment entry operations war termination and postconflict operations redeployment and re constitution and demobilization see fm 1007 and fm 10015 for details entry operations there are two types of entry operationsunop posed and opposed before either entry operation begins the g2 determines the enemys wmd capa bility this knowledge as well as the degree of opposition the commander can anticipate influ ences the selection of which type of entry operation he will use unopposed entry operations have specific mean ings to corps that this manual does not discuss opposed entry operations may often be the initial phase of campaign commanders make maximum use of joint capabilities to ensure early lethality and 33fm 10030 force security opposed operations occur in one of three ways raids lodgements or by coup main raids are smallscale operations and should not require nuclear use lodgement operations require forces to seize an airhead or beachhead the intent is to create maneu ver room and to provide for the continuous entry of forces and materiel for subsequent operations dur ing lodgement the commander would normally nominate targets such as enemy counterattack forces or c2facilities based on low minimum safe distance msd corresponding to negligible risk to unwarned exposed personnel applying safety and collateraldamage preclusion data to the operations maps depicting the forward line of own troops flot helps ensure troop safety combined with the targetanalysis process the data ensure that the targets which commanders nominate are truly hpts and that the force meets troop and civilian safety requirements the nca makes the political deci sion if the loss of the lodgement is more acceptable than is the use of nuclear weapons note see jp 3122 srd for more information on the targetanalysis process coup main as used in this manual is an offensive operation that capitalizes on surprise and simultaneous execution of supporting operations to achieve success in one swift stroke for example coup main combines entry and combat opera tions to achieve the opposed entry aspect of theater strategic objectives in single major operation thecoup main is the preferred means of conducting opposed operations using overwhelming combat power against foe means rapid mission accom plishment fewer casualties and minimal collateral damage the main objective of nominating nuclear weap ons during coup main operations is to destroy the enemys weapons of mass destruction additional nuclear weapons are nominated against facilities and major troop concentrations nuclearweapons use during coup main hances strategic objectives rather than tactical ob jectives the nuclear weapons nominated might be further from the flot than in lodgement operations stage five is the operations stage it consists of missions that lead to or directly contribute to accom plishing the cins campaign objective see chapter 5 stage six is war termination and postconflict op erations the fundamental differences between potential nuclear war and previous military flicts involve the speed scope and degree of struction inherent in nuclear weapons employment as well as the uncertainty of negotiating opportuni ties and enduring control over military forces depending on the scope and intensity of nuclear war and how and under what conditions it is brought to conclusion may be quite different from previous wars the objective of termination strategy should 34 fm 10030 be to end conflict at the lowest level of destruction possible consistent with national objectives united states nuclear forces supporting command control communications computer and intelligence c4i systems and employment planning must provide the capability to

systems coordination coordinating actions and responsibilities is ex tremely important in nuclear operations specific functions and activities involve forces from two or more services or two or more forces of the same service therefore coordination must begin imme diately after mission receipt and continue through out the operation coordination is essential because subordinate commanders and staffs must share pertinent infor mation and have as much time as possible to prepare and rehearse plans see chapter 4 units at every level must have time to conduct route reconnais sance rehearsals and multiple activities to adjust coordination details and timing and the synchroni zation plan accordingly when properly done sub ordinate commanders intents and concepts of operations support and

manders who work with allied or coalition forces must understand how the use of nuclear weaponstherefore future world leaders must plan conduct and support multinational operations against background of continued risk of hostile forces employing such weapons principal factors affecting multinational opera tions under threat or following the use of nuclear weapons include intelligence the intelligence officer makes current comprehensive and accurate intelli gence assessment of nuclear threat in the theater of operations availability of nbc defense equipment com manders must be aware of the nbc equipment available to multinational forces training standards commanders must be aware of any limitations in their forces training and of any experience that units have had in operating under real or simulated nbc threat conditions updating threat assessments multinational com manders constantly review the nbc threat and promulgate regular updated threat assessments so subordinate commanders can make informed decisions on the minimum protective measures needed note see also allied tactical publication atp 35a see jp 3123 for description of the analysis process standardization agreements stanags and understood terms are used in multinational op erations for example the term nuclear safety line is not used in us doctrine but may be used by multinational headquarters 311fm 10030 planning joint nuclear operations at the operational level of war the commander must consider several factors as early as possible when planning multinational operations he must have reasonable understanding of his ally and coalition forces equipment doctrine and capabilities ensure that the force understands nca controls and constraints and the commanders intent for nuclearweapons

objective yield limitation is medium to very low see glossary for definitions collateraldamage constraints are stringent targets are military aircraft andor missile delivery platforms are in the theater they are not launched from the us or from one theater to another but from within the theater the operational level of war at the operational level of war joint and multina tional forces within theater of operations to plan conduct and sustain campaigns and major operations to accomplish theater strategic objec tives the operationallevel commander focuses nu clearweapons planning largely on one or more of three general tasks 1 facilitating maneuver 2 isolating the battlefield 3 destroying critical enemy facilities or functions the operational level of war is the vital link between national and theaterstrategic aims and the tactical employment of forces on the battlefield the focus at this level is on conducting joint operations joint operations include employing multiservice military forces to attain theaterstrategic objectives in theater of war combatant commanders usually plan and execute campaigns they have theaterstrategic intents cepts and objectives service or subordinate joint commanders have operational intents concepts and objectives in support of the combatant commanders the level of command varies with the nature of warfarethe strategic objectives the size and structure of the theater of war the number of forces involved the intended purpose not the level of command determines whether the unit functions at the opera tional level armies normally design major ground operations of subordinate campaign while corps and divisions fight tactical battles and engagements corps commander might also be joint force land component commander or the commander of joint tactical force commanders of unified commands conduct thea ter campaign planning with subordinate headquar ters the subordinate command and its staff consult with sister services throughout the planning process in turn tactical commanders help develop the initial concept of operations and subsequent campaign plans subordinate commanders prepare supporting plans to meet the requirements of the theater plan commanders at corps and above modify plans as necessary to attain operational objectives so long as they still achieve the theaters strategic intent com manders of joint and combined forces develop com prehensive plans which integrate aspects of each service commanders operational plans airspace coordination when cinc requests nuclearweapons release he must consider how he will manage airspace airspace priorities communications instructions and special joint airspace requirements since all components of the joint force use the airspace above surface areas the cinc must issue airspace control measures to deconflict the space the cinc will appoint an airspace control authority who is normally also the joint force air component commander use and control of airspace must be coordinated with the airspace control authority nuclear targeting identifying enemy targets this section supports the doctrine of counterforce targeting strategy as jp 312 describes army nu clear targeting utilizes the targeting methodology in 313fm 10030 the decide detect deliver and assess d3a process to identify enemy highvalue targets to determine friendly highpayoff targets to prioritize targets for attack by the most effec tive means to nominate or deliver selected weapons to assess the effects of attack against surface targets note the d3a process is discussed in more depth later in this chapter see also fm 62010 the most likely enemy nuclear targets are nuclear biological and chemical capabilities troop concentrations command control communications and intelli gence facilities logistics considerations underground facilities containing hpts targets which would severely impact the cam paign plan air defense facilities weapons of mass destruction mobile land battle targets at operational and tactical levels of war com manders use targeting methodology to identify and prioritize targets the cinc gives first priority to operational targets the corps translates operational guidance into specific tactical targeting priorities the corps commander uses his priorities to nomi nate targets the jflcc nominates targets to the jtcb if there is one the corps commander must take into consideration the time it takes to process his nomination up the chain of command over to the sister services and their targeting process then to final execution refer to figures 33 35 and 36 he must also plan conventional operations as contingency operations targeting considerations nuclear weapons are not equally suited for all battlefield requirements so there is reason to employ them if they produce only marginal gains ineffectiveness over nonnuclear fires advantages of using nuclear weapons vary with the weapon type yield and accuracy the nature and disposition of the target the terrain and weather the operational or tactical objectives commanders must also integrate nuclearweapons use into conventional fires and maneuver commander would normally nominate weapon capable of low air burst rather than one that has surface burst this would optimize basic nuclear effects and reduce militarily significant fallout another consideration is the unpredictable time requirements for nomination of nuclear weapons advanced planning is absolutely critical when commanders nominate targets destruction of the targets should radically alter the situation to the users advantage commanders must know the strengths and weaknesses of each course of action in order to nominate targets which present the high est payoff therefore it is imperative that com manders conduct continuous planning using realtime intelligence assets in determining and up dating targets is essential timing and accuracy are major factors in nuclearweapons nomination success the requirement to deconflict duplicate targeting complicates targeting different forces or different echelons within the same force may have the same needs therefore synchronizing attacks between echelons is absolutely necessary troop safety targeting considerations must also include troop safety such as collateraldamage avoidance personnel safety preclusion damage avoidance commanders must limit nuclear strikes near friendly forces and the civilian populace however proximity can vary according to the protection available for friendly units 314fm 10030 the location of the civilian populace the availability of weapons yield the weapons systems used the deconfliction with sof longrange surveil lance units lrsu and other friendly locations across the flot nuclear targets in support of maneuver units are normally deep but early warning and protection measures are important for all units normally there is requirement to warn units when the risk will not exceed negligible levels and when insufficient time exists to warn all personnel obstacles created by nuclear weapons can inhibit movement of future operations principal obstacles are tree blowdown fires area contamination and rubble in builtup areas commanders nominating nuclear weapons must consider how such obstacles will restrict maneuver they must also consider the degrading effects of nuclear weapons on both friendly and enemy communications and fire control systems decide detect deliver and assess d3a targeting methodology the d3a targeting methodology enables the com mander and staff to take the initiative in selecting hpts before they actually present themselves in the target array each function occurs both simultane ously and sequentially although not separate function target tracking is inherent throughout the targeting process target tracking must be planned simultaneously with the development of the intelli gence collection plan decide it is executed during the targeting function of detect and supports both targeting functions of deliver and assess decide detect deliver and assess targeting methodology helps maximize the effectiveness of the limited number of nuclear weapons available the decision to recommend attack of target pro vides the focus and priorities for intelligence collec tion and fire planning the commander orients the attack after analyzing the intelligence estimate of the situation the commanders mission analysis battlefield planning which projects future operationsbefore setting target priorities operations intel ligence and fire support officers conduct target value analyses tva they consider the perceived importance of the target ease and accuracy of locating targets relative ease of destroying the targets hardness and mobility probable length of time target destruction will disrupt threat force the initial detection and tracking of designated threat units with intelligence sensors should not always be the attack trigger event tracking selected targets keeps them visible while the corps validates them in the nomination process the deliver step totally depends on sister services reacting to the needs of operationallevel and corps commanders for them to respond quickly they must have as much lead time as possible therefore commanders must consider timing and other events while wargaming during the assessment phase battle damage assessment bda gives the commander feedback on the effectiveness of the nuclear weapon during the decide step planners determine the requirement for battle damage assessment for specific highpay off targets andor counterproliferation targets defeat criteria single statement of damage criteria covers all situations the appropriate nuclear appendix to the oplan includes defeat criteria for nuclear weapons nomination general guidelines include the following at lower yields initial radiation not blast or thermal radiation is the foremost defeat mecha nism for mobile land battle targets the targeting officer subdivides large targets into smaller targets to reduce the size of the targeted area the minimum safe distance should be one of negligible exposed

nuclearoption planning begins with mission re ceipt and includes four phases 1 2 3 4prewartime contingency planning that is based on the type of operation and constraints wartime planning that supplements peacetime planning based on limiting requirements terrain and actual threat intelligence refinements to wartime planning that meet changing situations and which update options based on the latest threat intelligence refinements to approved options that are based on the situations just before target nomination planners develop each option along with the cam paign plan and transmit both to higher headquarters for approval commanders up the chain of com mand starting with the corps treat the option and the plan as single entity to provide the control and flexibility the nca requires and needs commanders at strategic opera tional or tactical levels must impose time frame on each option the time frame must be of sufficient length to accommodate uncertainties in intelligence and friction in battlefield conditions specifying time frame helps maximize nuclear options benefits commanders must synchronize the necessary time frame with the campaign plan the nca might constrain the time frame for options at the opera tional or tactical levels based on changes in the strategic environment as result the nomination time for an option starts about 96 hours before execution during both offensive and defensive operations each command echelon provides to their subordi nates more detailed nuclear planning guidance based on mettt factors within the limits of this guidance the operations officer and the fire support coordinator fscoord refine the planned option to support the scheme of maneuver this is not onestep decision but continuous dynamic proc ess of adapting plans to meet operational require 316fm 10030 ments constraints and option parameters to pro vide the best effect before target nomination before refinement the nominating commander must understand the intent of his next higher com mander the commander can recommend updating target information adjusting individual aiming points within the option area exchanging higher yield weapons for lower yield weapons identifying and prioritizing aiming points coordinating nonnuclear fires with nuclear fires the commander nominating the option has the flexibility of selecting aiming points in the option area this maximizes the effectiveness of the option and helps attain operational objectives however the commander must always consider troop safety in final aimingpoint refinement using updated col

over wide areas operationallevel and corps commanders can nominate nuclear weapons to support their scheme of maneuver to mass effects rapidly without shifting maneu ver forces to attack threats forces in depth mobility and survivability mobility operations preserve the friendly forces freedom of maneuver mobility missions include breaching enemy obstacles increasing battlefield circulation improving existing routes or building new ones providing bridge and raft supports for river crossings identifying routes around contaminated areas nuclear weapons will cause extensive damage and may drastically alter the military aspect of terrain therefore commanders must determine if using such weapons would create so many obstacles that units would spend more effort breaching them than would be worthwhile note see da pam 503 for detailed discussion of nuclearweapons effects on terrain survivability operations protect friendly forces from the effects of enemy weapons systems hard ening facilities and fortifying battle positions areactive survivability measures chapter 2 explains this in greater detail corps and division commanders can anticipate higher losses throughout the battlefield when the enemy uses nuclear weapons mass casualties and few available replacements will require that the commander develop plans and procedures to efficiently reconstitute combat power this in turn will impact reconstitution planning combat service support css as the scale and complexity of army operations increase the importance of combat service support to their success increases as well combat service support to the nuclear battlefield includes providing support to sister services coordination is vital combat service support units operate at all levels of war chapter 6 explains this in greater detail command and control command means visualizing the current and fu ture states of friendly and enemy forces then formu lating concepts of operations to accomplish the mission command occurs from wherever the com mander is whether at command post cp or in tank moving with the main effort control monitors the status of organizational ef fectiveness and identifies deviations from set stand ards and corrects them commanders acquire and apply means to accomplish their intents ultimately commanders provide means to measure report and correct performance the corps commander must be able to make the final decision on nomi nated target locations before passing the informa tion to his higher headquarters reliable communications are central both to bat tle command and to control this is particularly true when nominating nuclear weapons being able to quickly pass orders is critical therefore command ers must establish methods to ensure positive command and control such as using emp mitigat ing measures alternative nets communications and so on air defense air defense units are particularly susceptible to the effects of nuclear weapons detonations missiles 318fm 10030 and their associated launchers are vulnerable to blast and thermal radiation radars control vans and missile electronics are vulnerable to emp re fer to chapter 2 for survival mitigation techniques reconstitution the ascc plans and conducts operational and tactical reconstitution operations timely reconsti tution in terms of people organizations command structure and materiel is essential to continuing the mission reconstitution is total process its major elements are reorganization assessment and regen eration weapons system replacement operations facilitate the receipt of boresighted equipment and qualified crews to units undergoing reorganization or regeneration reorganization is the action the commander takes to shift internal resources within degraded unit to increase its combat effectiveness it may include such measures as crossleveling equipment and per sonnel matching operational weapons systems with crews or forming composite units the latter in volves joining two units reduced in number to form single fullstrength unit commanders should maintain as much squad crew or team integrity as possible under the circumstances to contribute to unit cohesion and to provide base for rebuilding if regeneration is required assessment measures units capability to per form its mission regeneration is incremental and involves the re building of unit through replacing personnel equipment and supplies on large scale the commander can combine per sonnel equipment and supplies to return the degraded unit to the specified level of combat effectiveness reestablishing or replacing essential command and control conducting missionessential training for the newly rebuilt unit commanders must consider individual res dur ing unit regeneration personnel with high doseaccumulation should not be assigned to units whose members have low doses this helps battalions and companies retain equal radiation states note see also fm 1009 fm 10010 fm 126 fm 633 fm 1007 and fm 10016 regardless of measures taken to enhance force survivability some close combat forces will suffer severe losses the nuclear environment does not allow the luxury of long personnel and materiel pipelines and the withdrawal and rehabilitation of units therefore at least initially the commander accomplishes force reorganization reconstitution and restoration from residual assets summary the armys role in planning nuclear operations is the heart of army nuclear doctrine planners conduct the planning process of joint nuclear opera tions in deliberate manner but in crisis they may undertake whatever actions are necessary the army also participates in forceprojection operations as part of joint force this may include multinational forces as well the corps headquarters can also function as joint task force headquarters in this role the corps takes on additional responsi bilities the corps can use the guidance in this chapter when the cinc requires target nomination the army at corps and above is supported by usanca neat during the planning and execu tion cycle the cinc is supported by stratlat from usstratcom knowledge of their actions is important to army planners for coordination and interface planning nuclear operations begins with the com manders guidance and ends with nuclear targeting and collateraldamage preclusion the mechanism for articulating the nominated targets is an option specific nuclear combat functions describe particu lar requirements in nuclear environment reconstitution and reorganization of decimated units in nuclear environment is accomplished by shifting elements in order to increase effectiveness regeneration is the rebuilding of decimated units 319chapter 4 command and staff responsibilities and procedures responsibilities this chapter discusses the sequence of actions and the personnel responsible for those actions that the senior army commander conducts after receiving controls and constraints to nominate nu clear targets because the division does not nor mally nominate nuclear targets its warfighting tasks are normally force protection and nbc defense from nuclearweapons effects procedures and actions for

on current operations and the com manders intent the commander and staff refine the nuclearweapons nomination process to ensure its optimal use the commanders primary means of monitoring the battle is the feedback he receives from forces in contact with the enemy and from intelligencegathering capabilities the command and staff action sequence ensures that the commander has the necessary uptodate information to make sound judgments on nuclear weapons operations the key is the feedback re ceived from the bce for nominated targets and the nbc defense reports received from adjacent and subordinate units summaryat any time both the commander and the staff have responsibilities to accomplish and procedures to follow their responsibilities range from target nomination to force protection the framework the commander and staff use to accomplish the mission is the decisionmaking process each staff officer has certain considerations in the initial mission analysis once the

situation warrants nuclear weapons nomination he then approves the nuclear option to be submitted to the cinc these procedures result in the preparation of plans and orders the commander approves the oplan opord and the g3 issues the oplan opord to subordinates the army commander must be prepared to inte grate nuclear nominations into his planning process 49chapter 5 nuclear support to combat operations tenets of army operations the armys success depends on its ability to operate within five fundamental tenets initiative agility depth synchronization and versatility see fm 1005 in nuclear operations these tenets take on added meaning isolation of units mass casual ties and loss of c2capabilities will necessitate semiindependent operations and decentralized trol therefore unit commanders must fully under stand the higher commanders intent continuing the mission under adverse circum stances requires initiative when units can longer adequately perform their traditional roles leaders must have agility that is they must have the ability to quickly adapt to new situation in order to accomplish combat tasks without changing task organization adding depth to battlefield gives all forces the space in which to disperse depth enables forces to take actions to minimize vulnerability to nuclear attack and nuclear effects commanders at corps and above synchronize nuclear operations by deconflicting targets maneuver forces and nuclear weapons to prevent collateral damage fratricide and to enable commanders to determine through tradeoff analysis whether or not to nominate nu clear targets loss of digital communications links because of emp damage places stress on css units and will affect their ability to provide adequate support functions therefore css units must retain as much versatility as possible to continue the mission area of operations ao three closely related sets of activitiesdeep close and rear operationsare characteristic of an area of operations commanders conduct opera tions in aos simultaneously throughout the depth of the battlefield and mass both effects and forces when and where necessary to accomplish the mission united states operations must appear to the emy to be one continuous operation against himbecause targets and operational or tactical consid erations or both vary with each operation com manders must consider nuclearweapons operations throughout the depth of the battlefield forces in immediate contact with the enemy in the offense or defense are conducting close opera tions in corps close operations as with other opera tions the theater cinc controls nuclear weapons close coordination by the corps commander with the cinc is essential to ensure successful execu tion if required the corps commander recommends yield that fits within troopsafety criteria and nominates the target with the highest payoff note see chapter 3 although nuclearweapons use in close operations is not the norm it cannot be totally ruled out commanders direct deep operations at all levels with fires and maneuver against enemy forces and functions beyond close operations deep operations affect the enemy through either attack or threat of attack they expand the battlefield in space and time to the full extent of friendly capabilities effective deep operations further overall mission success and enhance force protection in nuclear environment corps commander nominates targets to be struck with nuclear weapons in support of corps deep operations according to campaign plans doing so creates window for future offensive action destroys slows or reduces reinforcing forces creates the time and space for maneuver against attacking echelons destroys highpayoff targets forces dispersal of enemy units creates obstacles which canalize delay and dis rupt enemy forces destroys enemy staging areas variety of systems deliver nuclear strikes in support of deep operations corps and operational level commanders integrate these nuclear strikes with other deep attacks maneuver fires or both 51fm 10030 the importance of nearreal time target acquisi tion in deep operations dominates tire planning it calls for speed from target acquisition to target engagement rear operations help provide freedom of action and continuity of operations logistics and battle com mand their primary purposes are to sustain the current close as well as deep fights and to position the force for future operations therefore com manders operating in nuclear environment must make every effort to reduce the effects of an emys use of nuclear weapons by implementing actions to ensure dispersal survivability and force protection note see chapter 2 for discussion of rear opera tions mitigation techniques characteristics of offensive operations the main feature of an offensive battle is out flanking or bypassing the defender that is taking the initiative surprise concentration tempo and audacity characterize offensive operations and are components of initiative while strategic opera tional or tactical considerations may require fense the defeat of an enemy force at any level may require shifting to the offense note see figure 51 to determine the effects of nuclear weapons on the four characteristics of the offense the offense is the decisive form of warthe commanders ultimate means of imposing his will on the enemy nuclear weapons can help the com mander achieve his aim and can greatly enhance offensive operations they help achieve surprise create confusion and enable commander to exe cute his attack vigorously while minimizing risks elsewhere operationalievei and corps command ers may nominate nuclear weapons to seize the initiative maintain the momentum attack strengths and destroy threats maneuver forces can then exploit the shock the nuclear attack causes however nuclear environment increases the risks to attacking forces as well and requires enhanced security and survivability projections the lowest level of offensive theater nuclear nomination occurs at the corps level targets ofhighest priority normally are those which are most likely to affect the campaigns outcome nuclear weapons quickly break down enemy resistance and help the attacking force achieve maximum penetration note see fm 10015 in the offense the corps commander can nomi nate nuclear targets to create opportunities for deep attacks to weight the main effort to destroy or neutralize supporting forces to sustain the fight to protect exposed flanks forms of tactical offense the four general forms of tactical offense are movement to contact attack exploitation and pur suit different forms of attack simultaneously oc curring throughout the operational area in closely aligned phases that shift back and forth take new forms and offer increasing options for development for example as part of an offensive campaign the corps might be given mission which could require integrating theater nuclear fires with maneuver to achieve success when the corps commander rec 52fm 10030 ommends nuclear weapons to support the offense he must consider nominating the highest payoff targets the minimum safe distance for troop safety the least separation distance for key manmade features the collateraldamage distance for the protection of civilians the effects of nuclear weapons on forms of tactical offense affect each differently figure 52 forms of maneuver the forms of maneuver are frontal attack pene tration envelopment infiltration and turning movement commanders use these to orient on the enemy not the terrain the commanders concept of operations details how he will use fires to support whatever form of maneuver he selectsin nuclear environment as in conventional combat the commander can achieve advantages in maneuver only through continuous planning and swift execution the considerations of msd cdd and crossing nigacontaminated areas dictate the placement of the dgz figure 53 depicts various nuclearweapons effects on the forms of maneuver planning the offense planning for nuclearweapons use in support of corps operations is continuous and congruent with all other planning it does not depend on the quantity of nuclear weapons nominated the planning siderations are appropriate to offensive operations the commander and his staff must consider mettt factors when nominating nuclear targets mission offensive operations normally allow subordinate commanders the greatest possible freedom they focus on their mission and the commanders intent and make appropriate preparations for anticipated actions including likely developments and oppor tunities for nuclearweapons use however when nominating nuclear weapons the commander as sumes greater control over subordinate command ers to ensure adequate coordination 53fm 10030 enemy anticipating and planning against the effects of enemy nuclearweapons use against friendly forces is critical to campaign design commanders must ask does the enemy have nuclear capability if the answer is the question is moot if the answer is yes commanders must address issues such as dispersion type yield delivery means availability of weapons doctrine tactics and the likelihood of use troops the number and type of troops available could greatly affect the tactical plan nuclear weapons can rapidly and decisively enhance combat power smaller forces possessing nuclear weapons can ac complish the mission of larger forces not possessing nuclear weapons the units res determines its fitness for duty the lower the res the healthier the soldiers note see fm 331 terrain and weather terrain and weather can affect nuclearweapons operations and influence offensive maneuver for example tree blowdown in heavily forested area would obstruct the forward movement of friendly forces normally tactical fallout will not be significant in low air burst however weather conditions could cause rainout in the area of operations there fore if rain or snow falls through nuclear cloud significant tactical fallout may occur rain and fog can also lessen the blast wave as it travels through dense air time available offensive actions become harder to conduct when the enemy has had time to organize his fense the friendly commander can nominate nu clear weapons to effect surprise prolong confusion and sustain disorganization conversely the nomi nation process can erode friendly units available time because of the necessity of having to relay information and requests up through the chain of command and back down againconducting offensive operations the commander plans and coordinates force movement in detail to avoid confusion and delay and to gain surprise he concentrates his forces quickly making maximum use of cover and cealment signal security and deception while avoiding or masking actions that would alert the enemy to the coming attack he then conducts the attack rapidly and violently with concentrated fire power to disrupt enemy positions and hit deep in the enemy rear nuclear weapons can enhance and sup port such plans by providing destructive firepower nuclear weapons even when limited can help friendly forces cause great destruction of enemy positions with minimum concentration of forces surprise because delivery of nuclear fires re quires little visible unit preparation surprise can be complete however opsec within the stock piletotarget sequence is essential forces must avoid great display of preparation before nu clear strikes to prevent the loss of surprise shock nuclearweapons use disorganizes moralizes and freezes enemy forces in place however these effects will only be temporary exploitation must be immediate flexibility as maneuver forces develop the situ ation the commander can nominate nuclear weapons to develop major operation he might also substitute nuclear weapons for maneuver forces allowing smaller force to succeed in its attack against stronger force obstacles nuclear weapon can alter terrain to create obstacles such as fallen trees fires craters rubble and radiation this nearly instant creation of massive obstacles will allow smaller force to succeed where larger force might ordinarily be required creation of obstacles slows and canal izes counterattacks and denies terrain to the threat but like shock and surprise obstacles are temporary conversely obstacles can impede forward maneuver if the commander has not sidered leastseparation distances nuclear weapons can provide the commander with unique advantage however he equally 54fm 10030 realizes that the advantages of surprise and shock are fleeting and only initially effective note the tradeoff matrix in figure 54 page 56 is decisionmaking tool to help commanders termine whether or not to nominate nuclear weap ons in the offense characteristics of defensive operations nuclear weapons are significant force multipli ers their primary roles are to significantly defeat enemy forces and help friendly forces seize the initiative and transition to offensive operations as previously discussed the most effective use of nuclear weapons in the defense is to destroy the enemys synchronization by breaking the tempo of his operation preventing him from concentrating his strength against key portions of the defense separating his forces attacking and neutralizing his artillery interdicting routes and disrupting or destroying critical deep facilities interrupting his fire support logistic support or c2 the defender can nominate nuclear weapons to enhance combat power and to reduce his risks in sectors which require economy of force operations in addition the threat of or actual use of nuclear weapons puts amassed enemy attacking force at risk and presents him with dilemma for example the purpose of corps and jflccnominated nuclear weapons use would be to disrupt an enemys centration and flexibility whether nuclear weapons are nominated or not the possibility of their use will significantly influence how the enemy operates as enemy units advance toward the flot they become committed to specific attack avenues leaving fewer maneuver alternatives the threat of nuclearweapons use can force an aggres sor to stay dispersed inviting defeat in detail that is units can engage these smaller individual units by conventional means nearer the flot when used in this way threatening to use nuclear weapons becomes deterrentcommanders must consider the enemys poten tial nuclearweapons use and protect their forces accordingly the possible use of us nuclear weap ons can also strongly influence commanders ternate plans and help strengthen the usefulness of reserve forces the senior army commander can nominate nuclear targets without shifting maneuver forces since he retains reserve of forces to allow for flexibility in responding to an attack using nuclear weapons in support of or in lieu of reserve provides additional combat power to enhance tingency plans time is the basic ingredient of successful fense the corps commander can integrate nuclear targets into the defense to destroy assault forces and echelons before they penetrate the main battle area mba to blunt or stop penetration to destroy forces in penetration to disrupt enemy c2 to destroy or disrupt enemy logistic support for mations to protect forces during counterattacks to create opportunities for offensive actions the corps defensive pattern depends on mettt there are two defense patternsmobile defense and area defense regardless of which fense commander chooses he uses nuclearoption methodology to nominate nuclear targets mobile defense mobile defense is the defense of an area or posi tion in which maneuver is used with organization of fires and utilization of terrain to seize the initiative from the enemy that is it orients on the enemy either his defeat or his destruction by employing combination of fire and maneuver offense fense and delay tactics characteristics of mobile defense are that it orients on the enemys defeat or destruction requires allocation of the minimum force to the defense requires maximum combat power to the mobile striking force msf 55fm 10030 strikes at the decisive moment occurs simultaneously throughout the depth of the battlefield uses lethal and nonlethal systems requires greater mobility than the enemysnote the tradeoff matrix is decisionmakingthe striking force and on the location of nuclear dgzs in addition the strking force may have to cross areas contaminated by fallout and initial radia tion see fm 33 1 the commander uses the tradeoff matrix in figure 54 to recommend the final delivery time requires considerable depth of terrain tool to help commanders determine go or nogo trades terrain for maximum effect in order towhen nominating targets in either mobile or area defenseoverextend the enemy that the striking force is to attack sets up largescale counterattacks in mobile defense timing the execution of nu clear weapons by eac and the execution of the striking force is critical nuclear weapons can sig nificantly offset the size of the striking force if nuclear weapons are employed on the enemy just before the mobile striking force crosses the line of departure ld specific c2techniques such as graphically depicting the minimumsafe distance msd the leastseparation distance lsd and the collateraldamage distance cdd on the operaarea defense commanders conduct area defense to deny the enemy access to designated terrain or facilities for specified time commanders seeking to destroy enemy forces with interlocking fires organize an area defense around static framework that defen sive positions forward andor in depth provide in some cases an area defense can be part of larger mobile defense commanders employ local coun terattacks against enemy units penetrating between tions overlay can deconflict planned movements of defensive positions 56fm 10030 the depth of the defense varies according to the situation commanders position their forces on suitable terrain with specific orientation and direc tion of fire or in sectors positioning of nuclear targets allows the commander to deploy his forces in greater depth and compels the enemy to retard mass to achieve penetration after an enemy at tack defending forces can use mobility to exploit the effects of nuclear weapons on the enemy to seize the initiative and transition to the defense planning the defense planning the defense begins when commanders receive mission or perceive requirement to fend the results of the defense should satisfy the intent of the next two higher commanders and set the terms for future operations the planning proc ess begins while the target is still deep commanders may need to modify original plans as the situation changes therefore tactical forma tions must be able to modify their direction of movement or reorient defenses during operations the defense less than the offense should achieve surprise commanders must consider mettt factors when conducting their estimates of how to meet mission requirements mission the mission is the first consideration in planning the defense is the mission an area or mobile defense if it is an area defense nuclear weapons can help attrit and defeat the enemys main effort if it is mobile defense nuclear weapons can hance the striking forces combat power the commander must make his intent clear as to the type of defense he will conduct and for the nuclear targets he plans to nominate he must make his intent known as early as possible in order to integrate nuclear nominations into either defense nuclearweapons use would stop the momentum of the attacker or shock and confuse him making him susceptible to an attack by the reserve note see also chapter 4enemy the commander must determine if the enemy does or does not have nuclear capability because of the proliferation of nuclear weapons this deter mination becomes increasingly critical to all com manders when planning the defense the commander analyzes the enemys doctrine equip ment recent or past tendencies intent and probable coas from this information he determines critical points in time and space for enemy and friendly vulnerabilities during the battle the foundation of defensive plan is locating containing and defeating the enemys main and sup porting efforts in particular commanders must antici pate the enemys use of indirect approaches and his ability to project combat power into the rear area by longrange fires infiltration air mobility unconven tional warfare and wmd especially nuclear weap ons based on this anticipation the force can employ mitigation techniques to enhance survivability troops when assigning missions during planning com manders should consider their forces composition the level of teamwork the state of training and their leaders experience the mobility protection mo rale and training of troops determine to some extent how they will perform on the nuclear battlefield corps and lower com manders must also consider subordinate units res levels when determining which units will be avail able for defense operations commanders must also consider troopsafety levels for defending units and troopsafety criteria for forces left in place terrain and weather the defender must decide where he can best stop the enemy then plan accordingly studying the terrain the enemy must traverse gives valuable in formation and may decisively influence the posi tioning of defense forces the defending force must exploit any aspect of terrain that would impair emy momentum or make it difficult for him to achieve mass or to conduct maneuver defenders can use the effects of nuclear weapons to take advantage of the terraintree blowdown rubble and fires such obstacles when combined 57fm 10030 with poor weather can isolate the battlefield or slow or canalize enemy movement or protect friendly positions and maneuver terrain effects can also complicate exploitation of counterattack by reserve forces the defender can modify terrain to provide protection from nu clearweapons effects to his advantage for exam ple fortifying rearslope position of company or platoonsize units can mitigate initial nuclearweap ons effects weather and visibility affect how defender or ganizes his forces on the terrain commanders must anticipate and plan for the impact of adverse weather or limited visibility on weapons systems and optical devices however defensive plan that succeeds in clear conditions may be less effective in periods of bad weather contingencies to the basic plan should address necessary modifications to the defense during periods of reduced visibility note see also chapter 2 time available the amount of time to allot for preparation is crucial the defense is far more effective when time is available to conduct necessary planning small units train to defend with minimal preparation how ever strong defenses take time to organize and prepare for example the cinc and the opera tionallevel commander must provide enough time to the corps commander for proper preparation tactical commanders must have enough time to prepare defensive plans corps commanders must have time to conduct the decisionmaking process to nominate targets lack of time may compel commanders to main tain larger than normal reserve force or to accept greater risks than usual they must avoid this they and their battle staffs should take advantage of all available time in preparing the defense conducting defensive operations commanders should use all available combat power in unified and synchronized plan for ducting defensive operations the plan should also include nuclear planning considerationsthe corps commander normally nominates nu clear targets in deepoperations areas and as excep tions in close operations the results of rear operations must ensure the corps freedom of action the corps reserve operates in both area and mobile defenses deep operations deep operations can disrupt the enemys preparation and move ment destroy highpayoff targets inhibit or deny vital enemy operating systems c2 logistics air defense create windows of opportunity for future ma neuver operations the commander can nominate nuclear targets to achieve these ends concentrating on destroying delaying and disrupting highpayoff targets massed units headquarters and logistics areas are lucrative enemy targets corps commanders may include transportation networks and locs as high payoff targets because their destruction would slow the forward movement of armored forces the corps fights the deep operation while it monitors and supports the corps close operation the divisions deep and close operations consti tute the corps close operation the deep opera tion isolates the battlefield and allows the corps to deal with larger force than if nuclear weapons were not used close operations the corps commander positions forces in the mba to control or repel penetration the most demanding missions will be against enemy units close to us ground forces because those missions require effective strikes against mobile targets with out causing nuclearinduced friendly casualties the ability to deliver nuclear weapons close to the flot contributes to the deterrence of nuclear strikes against us and allied ground forces because of the assured capa bilities to answer in kind 58fm 10030 creating nuclear shield for us andor allied theater buildup hedge against conventional failure commanders must anticipate the need to nomi nate nuclear weapons less than 96 hours away from the delivery time the overriding factor will be troop safety and preclusion of collateral damage therefore nuclear weapons delivered in the close battle by necessity will be in the lower yield spectrum weapons with low circularerror prob abilities ceps ensure higher accuracy rear operations the corps commander must plan rear operations to retain freedom of action and to sustain the force unit and individual nuclear mitigation techniques help maintain this freedom of action note see fm 10015 for more information on rear operations reserve operations nuclear weapons can greatly enhance the flexi bility of reserve units for both mobile and area defenses the commander can use the reserves to exploit vulnerabilities to counterattack create opportunities for counterattack destroy isolated threat forces prevent enemy counterattacks against his flanks at the corps level and above small counterattack ing forces supported by nuclear weapons can achieve the results of much larger conventional force this leads to transition to conduct offensive operationssummary the tenents of army operations combined with the activities in the area of operations express where nuclear support applies to combat operations in both the offense and the defense the nomination of nuclear weapons enhances the characteristics of offensive weapons weapons effects influence the various characteristics of the offense in the forms of tactical offense the probability of the nomination of nuclear weapons ranges from very low to high the discussion also includes nuclearweapons ef fects on forms of maneuver such effects range from fixing the defender during an envelopment to having little to applicability during infiltration nuclear characteristics of defensive operations focus on target nomination against attacking enemy forces and compare application of nuclear weapons in both the mobile and the area defense planning for either defense must include consideration of mettt factors planners can use tradeoff ma trix to determine the feasibility of nominating nu clear targets when compared to the basic effects such weapons emit this process leads to how the force will conduct defensive operations this chap ter discusses them in terms of deep close and rear as well as reserve operations the threat tying the defense discussion together is the nomination of nuclear targets the objective of defensive operations is to defend only until the defending force has gained sufficient strength be fore it attacks this chapter also discusses planning for offensive operations in terms of mettt factors finally the tradeoff matrix is used to determine the feasibility of conducting offensive operations 59chapter 6 combat service support in nuclear environment combat service support is the essential capabili ties functions activities and tasks necessary to sustain all elements of operating forces in theater at all levels of war it includes the functional areas of supply transportation maintenance combat healththe combat service support process support personnel support and field services in nuclear environment large css facilities less medical facilities and activities are prime targets therefore css commanders must integrate protec tive measures and procedures into daily operations to ensure css functions will continue to maintain combat capability commanders must sustain their forces with selfsufficient and welltrained css with the dramatic changes nuclear warfare will cause the css process will become more difficult to execute and even more critical to mission accom plishment in nuclear environmentunits combat service support techniques and proce dures will require changes the depth of the operational area will increase the css system will become more widely dis persed forcing support units farther away from supported units lines of communications will become long and erratic equipment and supply stockpiles will have to be smaller and more widely dispersed digital and communications equipment used for managing css functions will be vulnerable to emp effects training of css personnel will need to include how to construct overhead cover and how to monitor decontaminate and coordinate obstacle clearance note see fm 33 and fm 331 for specific techniquescombat service support operations the destructiveness of nuclear weapons will place an extremely high value on css operations consequently successful css operations must be effective and efficient there are five characteristics of effective efficient css operations anticipation integration continuity responsiveness and improvisation anticipation anticipation means developing versatile and mo bile css capabilities that can accommodate events in nuclear environment combat service support planners must consider the impact of nuclearweap ons use by either enemy or friendly forces protective measures and procedures to mitigate nuclearweapons effects must be routine part of operations even though the other effects of nu clear detonation may not affect css logistic units emp effects could destroy digital and communica tions equipment combat service support com manders must ensure their units are welltrained and know how to protect themselves and their equip ment integration tactical and operational success depends on fully integrated support however integrating css ac tivities will be more difficult after nuclearweapons use by either enemy or friendly forces because the tempo of battle will increase response times may be shorter support requirements may be greater there will be greater than normal losses of per sonnel and equipment distances will be greater because of the disper sion of the force 61fm 10030 continuity continuity of support is the lifeblood of combat operations forces on the battlefield require tinuous css to sustain fighting strength and agility to maintain continuous operations in nuclear environment css units must avoid radiological contamination increase their mobility with more transportation and mitigate initial and residual ra diation effects mitigation techniques include using unit dispersion consistent with operational re quirements to increase nuclear survivability overhead shelter shielding materials nuclear hardened materials and shelters and protective covers to lessen initial and residual radiation effects nuclear biological and chemical reconnaissance assets adequate decontamination capabilities note contaminated units must faithfully follow decontamination procedures to ensure the maxi mum effectiveness of available assets see also fm 35 and fm 3100 responsiveness the css system must rapidly react to crises as rule css commanders and staffs tailor and adapt units to fit mission requirements often on short notice the css response requires units to reestab lish an uninterrupted support system or redirect an entire operational effort as result of enemy wmd use combat and combat support cs units that perform highpriority missions receive priority css support critical supplies will be temporarily prestocked near points of anticipated consumption to aid ongo ing operations however planners must emphasize the need to reduce excessive buildup of stocks in areas subject to nuclear attack when possible re supply operations should occur at night improvisation improvisation is the talent to make invent ar range or fabricate what is needed out of what is at hand successful logistic operations adapt tochanging situations combat service support per sonnel must be able to react to emergencies impro vising if necessary to continue operations improvisation methods and supply sources can help maintain css continuity when standard proce dures fail for example planners and operators may have to improve support system after it has been disrupted by an enemy nuclear detonation how well they react to such challenge will be key to the forces survival combat service support functions personnel support the systems of personnel readiness management casualty management replacement management and personnel accounting and strength reporting meet army personnel requirements from mobiliza tion and deployment through redeployment and demobilization personnel readiness managers prepare requisi tions in advance of hostilities based on projected losses linked to the commands vulnerability analy sis the commander updates battlefield require ments and casualty reports during hostilities casualty operations managers require increased support to be able to accurately report the large numbers of immediate casualties nuclear weapons will cause and the increased casualties that will occur from intermediate and longterm radiation effects there will be extremely high losses of man power and materiel rapid replacement will be essential replacement management provides replacement personnel individuals crews and teams based on existing and projected losses the theater replace ment system must be responsive to the army service component commanders ascc priorities in or der to provide replacements for soldiers most verely disabled by nuclear effects to sustain the force css planners must carefully coordinate with maneuver and fire support planners to locate prestock and stage supplies and equip ment well forward they must be prepared to relo cate unused supplies and support or if this is not 62fm 10030 possible destroy them except medical supplies to prevent their capture it is vital to return critical equipment to units as rapidly as possible when the commander decentralizes tactical units css units must also assume dispersed decentral ized and possibly forward positions to increase their capability to support the force however this decentralization must be balanced with the ability to provide responsive uninterrupted support to the force class vi personal demand items are normally sold through the exchange system combat service support units issue only essential class vi items along with class i supplies in an active nuclear environment maintenance maximizing equipment availability is necessity in supporting forceprojection army the differ ence between success and failure may be in having sound maintenance practices in all units positioning maintenance capabilities forward ensuring that units wellunderstand priorities for recovery and repair having quickly accessible repair parts overcoming the absence of repair parts normally requisitioned from conus depots via digital communications the commander may restrict maintenance sup port to emergency or shortterm repairs because of the high volume of vehicles nuclear detonation would damage when battle conditions permit maintenance support teams mst can perform more thorough onsite maintenance decontamina tion teams must assist msts before repair the msts performance will be degraded and repair times may increase when performing maintenance on contaminated vehicles in the initial stages of nuclear conflict maneuver elements must rely on organic maintenance capa bilities they will need to perform battle damage assessment and repair bdar they must separate vehicles into categories such as light damage mod erate damage or severe damage even though they might not have access to testing measuring and diagnostic equipment the commander should grantwide discretionary authority to repair cannibalize evacuate or destroy unserviceable equipment performing maintenance in contaminated envi ronment requires balancing several conflicting re quirements the prime objective will be to rapidly return equipment to the user in missioncapable condition the commander issues guidance as to whether to repair or abandon damaged equipment or to recover and evacuate it to an uncontaminated area he bases his guidance on the tactical situation how critical the equipment is the type and extent of contamination the time and resources available maintenance units in contaminated areas use col lective protection shelters and existing fixed facili ties to provide as much protection as possible for critical personnel and work areas as soon as the tactical situation permits units decontaminate inop erable equipment before it is recovered or evacuated to the support maintenance unit if units cannot determine the degree of contamination they mark the materiel using appropriate nbc markers to operate in the same environment as combat elements maintenance elements in the forward combat area use maintenance element vehicles whose mobility protection survivability and com munications are compatible with those of the sup ported force maintenance units are to salvage only critical items in short supply upon command ap proval they might possibly need to salvage critical contaminated items in order to return major weap ons systems to operation class ix repair parts and components includes kits and assemblies and items required for mainte nance support of all equipment units store and transport class ix repair parts in specially designed transporters for ease of movement and to reduce exposure to contamination combat service support units issue contaminated class ix items only during emergencies supply units widely disperse repair parts in the corps rear area to reduce vulnerability to nuclear weapons units store critical items in repair parts vans to reduce contamination and to ease 63fm 10030 decontamination combat service support units is cies army and air force aviation units conduct sue repair parts in containers to protect the parts emergency resupply of isolated units from becoming contaminated in transit they issue all uncontaminated items before issuing decontamicombat service support units should disperse pe nated items they check repair parts especially troleum storage locations and activities to reduce sensitive electronic parts for damage before issuevulnerability and to prevent catastrophic losses they must protect backup equipment to the same degree as primary equipment and regularly practice transportation firefighting and other safety procedures soldiers patients equipment and supplies must be moved rapidly and in sufficient quantities to support combat operations tactical actions require timely concentration of units and materiel and often demand shortnotice movement of large forces and major shifts in direction of movement there are large number of factors which hinder efficient operations in nuclear environment tree blowdown supply route closings contamination avoidance emp effects on vehicle ignition systems and aircraft electrical components and systems and refugee movements therefore all plans and op erations must be flexible enough to allow successful execution in nuclear environment transportation units will require greater flexibility in selecting routes marshaling areas convoy configurations and particularly designating communications means alternative route planning is essential move ment control elements in nuclear environment are an important link to effective transport operations class iii petroleum oil and lubricants pol includes petroleum fuels hydraulic and insulating oils chemical products antifreeze compounds compressed gases and coal these items are highly critical in nuclear environment frequently ducting survivability movements increases sumption of petroleum products and delivery requirements this need may require an increase in bulkfuel storage capacity in the corps area and the addition of more petroleum companies storage tanks and storage bladders used for bulk petroleum are vulnerable to the effects of thermal and blast units must take special care to reduce or prevent contamination of tanks and bladders when situations allow corps petroleum units may provide throughput support to the forward support battalion fsb the units can deliver supplies directly to tactical units and to forward arming and refueling points farps in emergenwhether performing combat cs or css func tions all units require uninterrupted fueling to per form effectively commanders must ensure the protection of fuelstorage facilities because such are extremely vulnerable to blast and thermal effects units making survivability moves or exploiting nuclearweapons effects will consume more fuel than anticipated this coupled with the possible loss of large amounts of fuel makes the css function key note see fm 34 for mitigation techniques combat health support chs although combat health support on the nuclear battlefield follows the basic principles of field medi cine the independent dispersed nature of combat complicates this effort nuclearweapons use will cause delays in treatment and increases in mortality and morbidity the principles in appropriate medi cal field manuals will still be valid but will need to be modified for specific situations centralized command with decentralized execu tion characterizes medical operations medical or ganizations must establish chs away from potential nuclear targets and anticipate extreme surges in patient workload from mass casualty situations triage is the medical process of classifying pa tients into four priority groups in which patients receive medical treatment immediate minimal layed and expectant triage ensures the maximum benefit to the largest number of patients medical personnel use different triage priorities for patients with radiation conventional or combined injuries the consequences of radiation injury are potentially severe medical personnel use radiation dose infor mation during the triage process if it is available also commanders and leaders monitor their 64fm 10030 soldiers radiation levels and provide that informa tion to medical personnel upon evacuation commanders leaders and soldiers can help medical personnel as much as possible to ensure the best care possible for the mass casualties expected from nuclearweapons use they can identify radia tion casualties decontaminate and evacuate casual ties and perform selfaid buddyaid and combat lifesaver cls procedures commanders should use medical advice and in formation to weigh the options of keeping soldiers with radiation injuries in the field or sending them to chs facilities as well as handling radiation injured patients the nuclear medical science officer staff officer of the medical brigade and staff officer of the medical group help determine radia tion exposure levels dose rate information is valuable in determining who can return to duty for example soldiers who have transient initial symptoms that are not life threatening or too disabling or who have minor injuries and low res can return to duty this main tains the forces capabilities while ensuring that soldiers only enter the medical system when neces sary or when they become ineffective medical units do not have special hardened pro tection from blast thermal or radiation effects they also do not have an organic decontamination capability therefore unit commanders must pro vide this support to preserve and extend medical capabilities commanders cannot hold medical units in re serve they must plan and continue operations even after medical support is lost

radiological contamination on nuclear battlefield all units when author ized will perform hasty burials of contaminated remains at an interim site as close to the place of death as possible they are to mark the entire site with the standard nato nbc markers recovery and decontamination of remains occurs after hos tilities end earlier if the tactical situation time and other resources permit decontamination of re mains is last priority airdrop requirements significantly increase in nuclear environment airdrop expedites resupply and allows swift bypass of contaminated areas units and airlift assets must consider the following when planning air movements or airlifts in nuclear environment protective nbc clothing degrades aircrew per formance and increases mission time navigators may have to rely on their own vision if they lose air and ground navigational aids avoiding contaminated areas requires planning air corridors on alternate routes loss of available airfields aviation maintenance facilities andor stores and refueling facilities will reduce aircraft available for css missions offloading cargo and servicing aircraft under contaminated conditions will increase mission time contaminated aircraft cargo and personnel will require special handling procedures in uncon taminated locations ideally only uncontami nated aircraft will support uncontaminated units air

and major end items in support of the force these classes of supply include all the systems that support the soldier combat service support units conduct supply op erations according to current doctrine when the potential for nuclearweapons use is not likely as nuclear risk increases supply stockage for non essential items will dwindle this improves mobil ity and lessens the divisions vulnerability to nu clear attacks in an active nuclear environment css units will reduce stockage to level sufficient for mission accomplishment units must reduce stock ages by the most expedient means in order to hance mobility and dispersion and to avoid contamination combat service support units should issue the most critical supply items on an automatic basis using the position locator reference system plrs or similar system forward units ensure that full basic loads of supplies are on hand and protected against contamination so they can accomplish their missions until css can resupply them command ers should consider emergency resupply by air combat service support units should disperse their stocks to avoid presenting lucrative targets and to minimize risks of destruction or contamination they should always issue uncontaminated stocks first so they can decontaminate stocks without in terrupting supply support using containers with protective overwrap enhances decontamination combat service support units do not normally issue contaminated stocks units keep contami nated stocks segregated from clean stocks until they can be fully decontaminated however units may issue certain contaminated supplies in emergency situations when insufficient uncontaminated sup plies are available but only if the supplies will provide decisive tactical advantage to the receiv
