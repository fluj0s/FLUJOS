in ternational research report february 2008 summary existing measures to promote peace in afghanistan are not succeeding this is not only due to the revival of the taliban but also because little s been done to try to ensure that families communities and tribes the fundamental units of afghan society get on better with each other war has fractured the social fabric of the country and in the context of severe and persistent poverty local disputes have the potential to turn violent and to exacerbate the wider conflict but there is effective strategy to help afghans deal with disputes in peaceful and constructive way the nature causes and effects of insecurity in afghanistan vary widely and there is corresponding variation in the most effective mean s by which insecurity can be addressed often range of steps are required in different degrees such as to strengthen the rule of law build professional security forces reduce poverty or improve governance peacebuilding is one important means of addressing insecurity yet most of the peacebuilding work in afghanistan has been at political level wh ere there are links to warlordism corruption or criminality or it has been targetlimited such as the disarmament programmes other initiatives such as the action plan for peace justice and reconciliation and the peace commission are significant but lack clarity and are primarily concerned with peace and reconciliation at national level with sufficient resources and political will these in itiatives have the potential to improve security but they only marginally indirectly or partially concern the people of afghanistan the capacity of afghan communities to resolve their own disputes and build and sustain peace has largely been neglected the recent deterioration in security particularly in the south and southea st of afghanistan is evidence that topdown approaches are by th emselves inadequate without parallel nationwide peace work at ground level moreover insecu rity in afghanistan often has local causes decades of war have not only undermined social cohe sion at local level they have also exacerbated poverty which is itself an underlying cause of insecurity nearly 20 years of oxfam programme experience in afghanistan interviews with pe acebuilding practitioners and recent oxfam security survey of 500 people in six provinces show that local disputes are often related to resources particularly land and water to lesser degree they also relate to families and women or to ethnic tribal and intercommunity differences th is is aggravated by range of factors such as natural disasters refugee flows badly delivered aid corruption abuse of power or the opium trade in many cases local disputes lead to violence an d while the strength and importance of family and tribal affiliations in afghanistan can be source of stability they can also lead to the rapid escalation of disputes the resulting insecurity not only destroys quality of life and impedes development work but is also exploited by criminal or antigovernment groups to strengthen their positions in the wider conflict perceived security th reats also impact on loca l security such threats are diverse and configured differently in different localities the taliban are not the only threat as is sometimes portrayed but warlords criminals an d international and national security forces are also perceived as posing significant threats the oxfam survey shows that predominantly local mechanisms are used to resolve disputes or address local problems in terms of formal mechan isms those most often used are the police for immediate purposes and district governors wh ile the courts are approached comparatively infrequently the type of mechanism used for the resolution of any given dispute depends on local factors and on the nature of the dispute but the most favoured mechanism particularly in rural areas is the community or tribal councils of elders known as jirgas or shuras there is clear need for community peacebuildin g which has been undertaken with much success in other developing countries for example ox fams longstanding peacebuilding programme in 3 community peacebuilding in afghanistan oxfam in ternational research report february 2008 northern kenya has helped to sustain many years of peace there and it may be helping to contain the violence which has followed the recent election this is participatory bottomup approach based on the premise that people are the best resources for building and sustaining peace such an approach aims to strengthen community capacities to resolve disputes peacefully to develop trust safety and social cohesion within and between communities and to promote interet hnic and intergroup dialogue the means of achieving this is through building the capacity of communi ties especially jirgas and shuras to resolve disputes through mediation negotiation and conflict resolution supporting civilsociety involvement in peace and development and promotin g peace education it is not fixed or defined activity but adapts to local circumstances and s eeks to incorporate peacebuilding values skills and techniques into broader governance and development work local peacebuilding in afghanistan has been fr agmentary and inchoate with extremely limited coverage however number of organisations have successfully implemented such programmes including two afghan nongovernment organisa tions ngos cooperation for peace and unity cpau and the sanayee development organizatio n sdo independent evaluators concluded that this is creative initiative at the forefron t of enabling and supporting what is truly wanted by afghan partners and communities local peac ebuilding has had range of positive often interconnected outcomes increased resolution of disputes lower levels of violence including domestic violence greater community cohesion strong er resilience to external threats or events the expansion of development activity and the successful reintegration of returnees given that existing community peacebuilding has such significant impact on peace and development yet benefits only fraction of the population there is powerful case for greater donor support for ngos engaged in peacebuildin g as well as the development of national strategy the strategy could be developed through convening national conference attended by ngos and experts from afghanistan and overseas as well as government officials parliamentarians religious leaders united nations representatives an d others this meeting would aim to establish framework for national strategy for community peacebuilding and national steering group followed by series of parallel provincial conferences to elaborate local strategies key elements of the national strategy could be dorsed by the afghan government and national assembly and supported by an alliance of ngos and civilsociety actors that carry out peacebuilding work the strategy would not detract from bottomup approach indeed it would be configured precisely to support this and allo w for local flexibility potential components of national strategy could be phased capacitybuilding throughout the countr which is participatory inclusive and flexible measures to ensure that peacebuilding is taught in all schools and is fully incorporated into teacher training awarenessraising initiatives at national and local levels mainstreaming peacebuilding in relevant sectors of government and in national programmes mechanisms to monitor the consistency of shuras decisions with the afghan constitution and human rights and separately to ensure reporting research information collation and monitoring of peacebuilding activities and measures to clarify links between peacebuildin g work and state institutions in particular the relationship between informal justice and the courts there are significant challenges to developing and implementing national strategy not least the impact of peacebuilding is difficult to measure and there needs to be government involvement but not ownership other challenges include ensuring the full and meaningful participation of women 4 community peacebuilding in afghanistan oxfam in ternational research report february 2008 dealing with potential spoilers managing with lack of human resources and introducing sufficient flexibility however existing progra mmes in afghanistan have developed means of overcoming these challenges and there is ever reason to believe that the success of these programmes could be replicated nationwide current programmes are being implemented in insecure areas of the country and using established techniques they could be introduced incrementally to the south and southeast it is essential for the afghan government and international community to recognise the inadequacies of existing peacebuilding initiatives for the vast majority of afghans disputes have local causes and people turn to local institutions and individuals to resolve them yet little work has been done with communities especially shuras to enhance their capabilities to resolve these problems peacefully peace work at community level strengthens community cohesion reduces violence and enhances resistance to militants it is an essential and complementary part of wider strategy to secure lasting national peace including concerted measures to promote better governance rural development and the professi onalisation of police and security forces national strategy for community peacebuilding is alre ady five years too late with increasing levels of violence there is time to lose 5 community peacebuilding in afghanistan oxfam in ternational research report february 2008 governmental and international responses to insecurity existing initiatives the 2001 bonn agreement which set out framework and timetable for the establishment of constitution and democratic institutions in afghanis tan was intended to end the tragic conflict in afghanistan and promote national reconciliation lasting peace stability and respect for human rights building on this the afghanistan compact of ja nuary 2006 recognises that security remains fundamental prerequisite for achieving stability an d development in afghanistan it states that security cannot be provided by military means one but requires good governance justice and the rule of law reinforced by reconstruction an d development therefore in sense the compact as whole is intended to address the problem of insecurity measures which aim more directly to address insecurity are set out in annex i to the compact in particular the presence of international forces an d provincial reconstruction teams combined with the expansion of the afghan national army and national and border police are intended to promote peace and stability while there is doubt that such measures promot stability they are intrinsically limited in their capacity to consolidate peace in society with wellfounded mistrust of foreign interference and in which local and tribal affiliations are powerf ul foreign and government forces may be in position to enforce peace in some areas but have limited capacity to strengthen it the compact also provides for the disbandment of all illegal armed groups but so far only limited steps have been taken to implement this and as the biannual joint coordination and monitoring board jcmb 1 has observed rearminghas taken place in some areas in response to the perceptions of growing security threat the afghanistan action plan on peace justic and reconciliation is the measure which most directly aims to strengthen peace it contai ns programme for the acknowledgement of the suffering of afghan people reforming state institutions and purging them of humanrights violators and criminals truth seeking and documentation promotion of national unity and reconciliation and the establishment of mechanisms for accountability this programme has significant potential but was only formally launched in december 2006 and is notably absent from the afghan governments pa per afghanistan challenges and the way ahead of january 2007 it is only briefly referred to in the jcmb annual report of 1 may 2007 variable progress has been made on institutiona l reform and the proposal for mechanisms of accountability has been brought into question by re cent moves on the part of the national assembly to grant legal protection to former mujahadeen and others who have committed war crimes the action plan covers the inclusion of peace and reconciliation messages in the national education curriculum but contains little which will have direct impact on ordinary afghans in addition the government of afghanistan has established an independent commission on strengthening peace to promote dialogue with combatants and through which current and former combatants can renounce violence and engage in lawful political activities international organisations and foreign diplomats have also engaged in such efforts separately the afghan government has also facilitated peace jirga involving tribal leaders fr om both southern and south eastern afghanistan and northern pakistan 6 community peacebuilding in afghanistan oxfam in ternational research report february 2008 limitations with the necessary resources political will an d commitment to implementation many of these initiatives have the potential to improve security but it is crucial to recognise that they only marginally indirectly or partially concern the people of afghanistan the capacity of afghan communities to resolve their own disputes an d build and sustain peace has largely been overlooked the deterioration in security in afghanistan partic ularly in the south and so utheast is evidence of the minimal impact of highlevel and targetlimit ed initiatives without parallel nationwide peace work at ground level as two peacebuilding experts have put it in cont emporary conflicts the community represents the nexus of conflict action it is at the community vel where contending claims for peoples hearts and minds are fought and where most of th physical violence and suffering occurs2 as the international crisis group icg concluded as earl as 2003 local disputes often lead to violence discussed further below and the cumulative impa ct is an environment of insecurity which is readily exploited by warlords criminals and militants 3 understanding conflict dynamics requires an derstanding of local conditions and causes4 the following section outlines the diverse causes and consequences of insecurity at local level in afghanistan it indicates why in conjunction with other measures to improve security development and local governance5 national programme of community peacebuilding could help to lay the foundation for lasting peace 7 community peacebuilding in afghanistan oxfam in ternational research report february 2008 disputes and insecurity current security situation despite considerable regional variations there is doubt that the overall security situation in afghanistan has deteriorated significantly the estimates that the frequency of attacks bombings and other violent incidents in 2007 was up 2030 per cent on 20066 in one of afghanistans largest public opinion surveys fr om 2007 conducted by the asia foundation one third of respondents said that security was quite bad or very bad in their area at least as many respondents said they have some fear in partic ipating in the resolution of community disputes voting in an election joining peaceful demonstration or holding public office 7 fortynine per cent of people say that they sometimes or often fear for their own or their familys safety up nine per cent on 2006 8 this section highlights key sources of disputes at local level the underlying causes of insecurity and the impact on individuals and communities it is based on oxfams many years of programme experience in afghanistan preexisting resear ch and analysis dozens of interviews with peacebuilding practitioners and survey conducte d by oxfam for the purposes of this report box 1 gives details of the methodology used to carry out the survey it should be noted that the survey is not the only basis of this report but was conducted in order to verify the findings of broader research and inferences drawn from the fi eld experience of oxfam and other ngos box 1 oxfam security survey methodology afghan nationals interviewed 500 afghans in mid 2007 in six pr ovinces in different parts of the country with varying security conditions herat n angahar balk gazni daikundi and kandahar9 the categorisation of access risk for these provinces which reflects general levels of security is as follows kandahar extreme risk gazni and nangahar areas ranging from medium to extreme risk daikundi largely low risk but for two southern extremerisk districts he rat and badakhshan low risk with limit ed areas of medium risk and balk low risk10 regrettably security concerns and administrativ problems limited the number of interviews which could be undertaken in daikundi and kandahar11 multistage random sampling procedure was used to select participants who reflect crosssection of the afghan population in terms of age x ethnicity and occupation refl ecting national demographics roughly twothirds of respondents lived in rural areas sampli ng points within villages or urban areas were also selected at random each respondent was asked about major causes of disputes greatest security threats and principal dispute resolution mechanisms respondent s could identify multiple causes threats and dispute resolution mechanisms in response to each question which were then recorded and are reflected in the figures below the survey findings were supplem ented by ten focusgroup discussions with participants selected at random two such discussions were conduc ted with men and women and two with women only there were also over 40 indepth intervie ws with randomly selected interviewees the research findings reflected the enormous variability of circumstances and conditions in different regions and localities of afghanistan regrett ably there is space in this report to examine local and regional variations and the research does not fully reflect circum stances in extreme risk areas primarily the south the analysis should be read with these caveats in mind causes of disputes legacy of conflict decades of conflict in afghanistan have led to an environment which is physically socially economically and politically insecure as citha m aass summarises manifold divisions of previous victimization mixed experiences postwar frustrat ed expectations and discrimination have created fragmented perceptions of the war its causes repe rcussions suffering and political responsibilities it reveals how deeply afghan society is still split even if the survivors currently avoid addressing the dividing lines12 8 community peacebuilding in afghanistan oxfam in ternational research report february 2008 war has fractured and strained the social fabric of the country whole generation has grown up amid pervasive tension and insecurity and all dimensions of violence whether physical psychological structural or cultural are evident in afghan society at the same time conflict has caused widespread poverty having devastated the rural economy on which the majority of afghans depend and crippled local government infr astructure for the delivery of essential services poverty and unemployment it is clear from the oxfam survey results focus group discussions and indepth interviews that poverty and unemployment are the biggest factors in causing local insecurity unemployment in afghanistan is extremely high at 4060 per cent and in some places higher given that those who are unemployed receive social benefits and ma ny have large families to support its impact is severe and can drive people to desperate measures as one young man from herat put it i have five family members who depend on i can only fi nd work two days week if i am lucky i cant find money for bread to give my family twice i decided to commit suicide an elder of the same district explained when people have mean s of surviving they commit robbery other focus groups expressed similar views often linking unem ployment to criminality disputes and violence particularly over resources as one man from be hsoud district of jalala bad said most of the conflicts in our area are on water and land and this is among people who are jobless oxfams programme experience in southern afghanistan so suggests that difficult social and economic circumstances can be significant factor in the decision of ordinary afghans to grow poppy or join antigovernment groups figure 1 oxfam security survey major causes of disputes13 the graph shows for each issue how many respondents believed that it was major cause of disputes in their community 050100150200250300 land water family differences between tribes regarding womenothers differences between communities commanders ethnic differences taliban or other extremistsaid respondents land and water in the oxfam survey figure 1 half of respondent s said that land was major cause of disputes and this is corroborated by other surveys major survey in 2006 by the independent afghan human rights commission aihrc found that close to half of all local problems related to 9 community peacebuilding in afghanistan oxfam in ternational research report february 2008 property14 likewise according to an asia foundation rvey majority of local disputes relate to land or property15 this is due to range of factors multiple systems of land ownership incoherent attempts at land reform the seizure of private and public land by successive powerholders the destruction of legal records population expansio n forced migrations and waves of displacement and returnees the situation has been exacerbated by the impact of war and drought in causing steady contraction in the supply of cultivable land sometimes by as much as 8090 per cent for given district the oxfam survey indicates that water is the seco nd biggest cause of disputes this is due to waters importance both domestically and agricult urally and the disruption of established patterns of supply and demand caused by conflict the situation has been exacerbated by poor water management insufficient irrigation and environmental degradation frequent natural disasters compound existing hardship as result of the 2006 drought for example some two and half million people faced chronic food shortages currently similar number of afghans face highrisk food inse curity the capacity of the government and communities to minimise the impact of disasters and to ensure swift and effective responses remains inchoate and variable family disagreements another major source of conflict as demonstrated in the oxfam survey is disagreements within or between families such disputes can easily spread to tribes or communities and in significant number of cases relate to women marriage or sexual relations16 violence can result from the transgression of traditional conjugal norms such as the provision of dowries arranged marriage the custom of family providing girl for marriage as compensation for crime baad or to resolve dispute badal or the practice whereby widow is expected to marry her deceased husbands brother domestic violence against wome n or severely discriminatory treatment is also often cause and consequence of family tribal or community disputes tribal and ethnic disputes afghanistans people are patchwork of different ethnicities and in some areas these differences hinder social cohesion for example oxfam research ers in the ghourian district of herat reported that the biggest reason for conflict is land disputes which mainly happen between pashtuns and tajiks despite strong sense of national identity ethnic and tribal affiliations have long been of significance inequalities and rivalries between ethni cities existed prior to the saur revolution of 1978 but were intensified by conflict as tensions increased and commanders sought to exploit differences for their own ends displacement waves of displacement both internally and beyond have placed additional pressure on communities that have been forced to accommo date large numbers of newcomers or returnees disputes arise when returnees seek to reclaim their land or other property and social and cultural difficulties can be caused by the fact that many returnees acquire different attitudes or mindsets as result of their experiences overseas some fo ur million afghans have returned to afghanistan since 2002 and communities could be placed under mo re pressure given statements by officials in pakistan that afghan refugees who number some two million in that country should return in the near future 17 the opium trade the production and trafficking of opium and the re sponses to this can also be highly destabilising for afghan communities in particular aggressive eradication timetables or the provision of development assistance which is conditional on counternarcotics progress can result in breakdown in relations between key local actors the impact is particularly severe where there is failure to provide genuine alternatives especially in licit agriculture heavyhanded interventions 10 community peacebuilding in afghanistan oxfam in ternational research report february 2008 risk causing hardship and resentment among the ordinary people and strengthening the hands of local warlords thus forcing poor people to ffer while powerful traffickers are unaffected aid broadly speaking foreign aid has ameliorated the mate rial impact of conflict but in some cases it has also undermined community stability during the 1980s aid was used by both soviet occupiers and mujahadeen for political purposes and was at times deliberately used to divide communities where aid has been delivered without care or prop er consideration of local circumstances it has consolidated existing power imbalances favoured one community or part of community over another been used to extract bribes or been diverted for criminal or subversive purposes18 some aid programmes even those of established agenci are still perceived to be exploited by local powerholders for their own benefit19 local government capacity the lack of effective institutions of local govern ment and accepted processes for the management of civil affairs is inherently destabilising and this is compounded by the fact that afghan civil society is not yet well established this and the lack of both physical and human resources has rendered local government open to exploitation thus the abuse of power at local level for personal criminal or other illicit purposes has so been the cause of local disputes impact of disputes oxfam research suggests that while majority of locallevel disputes are resolved peacefully significant minority of cases result in violence in major study the describes how land disputes lead regularly to violence between communities 20 likewise the icg concluded that local disputes frequently flare into violence and lead to wider problems21 while the strength and importance of family and tr ibal affiliations in afghanistan can be source of stability they can also lead to the rapid escalation of disputes dispute between two individuals can ultimately lead to conflict between families extended families communities or even tribes violence is perpetrated against both men and women women suffer especially as result of disputes within families as the concludes millions of afghan women and girls continue to face systematic discrimination and violence ei ther in their homes or in their communities22 although local disputes attract little attention compared with the resurgent taliban they generate fear and uncertainty and produce an environment of insecurity which destroys all quality of life for ordinary civilians 23 they also prevent or deter familie s and communities engaging in joint initiatives or providing mutual support so often necessary in impoverished rural areas divided communities are also vulnerable to exploi tation or domination by powerholders such as warlords criminal groups or the taliban in order to strengthen their positions and undermine the government 24 for example in 2006 the taliban took hold of gezab district in daikundi as the observes pashtun tribalism has taken considerable toll on the overall stability of the district the rivalry between the malozai and nikozai tribes s been used to great advantage by the taliban both tribes wish to exert their control over the di strict and the taliban have managed to exacerbate their divisions to further their own agenda 25 in helmand also in 2006 the taliban exploited protracted disputes and rivalries between the alzai itzhakzais and alikozai tribes in order to help reestablish taliban authority in the province 26 threats while this section has focused on the causes an d consequences of disputes real and perceived threats also impact on local security although threats do not appear to cause disputes at local level they contribute to an environment of tension and insecurity in which it is difficult to promote 11 community peacebuilding in afghanistan oxfam in ternational research report february 2008 peace resolve disputes or strengthen social cohesi on the intention here is not to address this issue in any depth but to highlight key points the oxfam survey and discussion groups reveal that while the majority of afghans feel relatively safe in their families and communities they face range of threats to their wellbeing as indicated in figure 2 below the taliban are not as is so metimes portrayed the sole or even predominant threat to afghans rather the picture is more co mplex warlords criminals international forces drug traffickers and the police all present varyin g degrees of threat which are of different types and are variously configured in different localitie s indeed it appears that in some areas the taliban itself is more of network of militant antigovernment groups than coherent group as one observer has put it the war in afghanistan is not against monolithic taliban movement in much of the country it is entwined with older struggles rooted in tribalism27 this study does not seek to examine how commu nities are impacted by and respond to major security threats nor does it examine the relationship between threats and disputes both of which merit further research however this research does at least indicate that in many areas there is single major threat or cause of conflict and that to be effective measures to address these threats must be relevant to local circumstances figure 2 oxfam security survey greatest threats to security28 the graph shows for each issue how many respondents believed this issue constituted major threat to their security 0102030405060708090 taliban warlords criminals intl forces drug traffikers afghan police afghan govt officials afghan army family members work environment another tribe othersrespondents 12 community peacebuilding in afghanistan oxfam in ternational research report february 2008 existing mechanisms for dispute resolution and conflict management having identified that many of the causes of in security originate and escalate from community level the question then is how do communities address and resolve these tensions or disputes formal mechanisms in terms of formal state instit utions the oxfam survey figure 3 shows that police are often consulted to help resolve conflicts this is particularly true in urban areas where there is much larger police presence the involvement of police appears to reflect the fact that disputes either involve violence or have the potential to turn violent focusgroup discussions and indepth interviews also reveal that people tend to approach the police either for the shortterm physical control and management of dispute or when ternative means of resolving the dispute have failed nevertheless it is questionable whether there is sufficient awareness among policy makers of the extent to which local police have disput eresolution role and are trained accordingly figure 3 oxfam security survey principal mechanisms for the resolution of disputes29 the graph shows for each mechanismentity how many respondents said that they would turn to such mechanism to resolve dispute 020406080100120140160180200 police community shura district governor other officials tribal shura courts religious leadercouncil community development council commander civil society ngos members of political institutionsrespondents local government institutions suffer from lack of capacity and in some cases legitimacy to be in position to resolve disputes au thoritatively however the survey indicates that where district governors have popular respect they are often called upon for this purpose certain community disputes are not suitable for judi cial resolution but even where national courts are appropriate they are not frequently used co urts have limited national presence and most 13 community peacebuilding in afghanistan oxfam in ternational research report february 2008 afghans tend to regard them as slow expensiv and in some cases corrupt many judges are insufficiently qualified or informed to administer local justice recent re port suggests that only about half of judges hold degrees in law or sharia and over third have not completed their training 30 there is also backlog of up to 6000 cases awaiting adjudication31 for these reasons as the oxfam survey shows the courts tend to be st resort for the resolution of serious or long running disputes informal mechanisms any individual decision as to whether to use form or informal mechanisms of dispute resolution undoubtedly depends on wide range of factors which differ from one community to another as well as the nature of the dispute for example for rious crimes such as murder it is apparent that formal state courts are preferred32 however the oxfam survey indicates that overall the single most popular mechanism for the resolution of disputes is community or trib councils of elders usually known as jirgas or shuras these councils of elders which in this report shall be referred to collectively as shuras have variable and ad hoc membership comprising elders and others with relative wealth influence or power in the locality such as mullahs they rare ly include women youth or the poorest members of the community they have degree of legitimacy and institutional constancy but fail to be properly representative or inclusive and members generally have little or training in dispute resolution or conflict management they tend to apply customary laws such as pushtanwali or sharia law comparatively shuras are perceived as being more effective than formal state mechanisms in the asia foundation 2007 survey over 75 per cent of respondents agreed that shuras were fair and trusted followed local norms and values and were effective at delivering ju stice whereas just 57 58 per cent believed the same of state courts33 in the aihcr survey 58 per cent of people said that state institutions had failed to help them resolv problems whereas just 13 per cent said that shuras had failed to help them34 indeed the afghan government has recognised the positive elements of traditional institutions in its justice for all strategy of 200535 consistent with these findings research co mmissioned by the united nations development programme undp suggests that when shuras address disputes the most common outcomes are peace between the disputants an d compensation for the victim36 however shuras lack agreed processes systems or ru and usually adopt an authoritarian approach thus although shuras are the preferred method of dispute resolution they sometimes act in way that either fails to resolve disputes fair ly or neglects their underlying causes which could lay the seeds for future disputes or violence shuras are almost solely reactive rather than proactive and in some cases their composition alone can aggrav ate sociocultural tensions it is also of grave concern that in significant proportion of disputes addressed by shuras the outcome is baad37 modern shura structures such as elected community development councils cdcs under the national solidarity programme nsp of which there are some 16000 nationwide are more representative but can at the same time be hampered by lack of local legitimacy and tend to be associated with government although recent bylaw gives cdcs role in consensual dispute resolution they are taskorientated and have been used predominantly for the channelling of aid rather than as mechanisms for peacebuilding this perhaps explains why only small proportion of respondents in the oxfam survey said that they would turn to cdcs for the resolution of disputes local mechanisms in the oxfam survey roughly equal numbers of respondents said they would use formal and informal mechanisms of dispute resolution ho wever when first preferences are taken into account it is clear that majority of respondents in the oxfam survey would turn first to shuras and 14 community peacebuilding in afghanistan oxfam in ternational research report february 2008 elders before using formal mechanisms for exam ple resident of angeel district of herat province told us we have local shura where people are trying to solve their problems and sometimes it is arbabs landlords or the elders or the head of the shura who solves the problem but if not then they will go to the police in diffe rent part of the same district we were told if there is problem or conflict first people try to solve their problems through the shura and then go to the district governor because we trust the shura to solve our problems with justice oxfams research confirms that preferred mechan isms of dispute resolution are almost always local involving community institutions such as shuras and to lesser degree local police or officials such as the district governor these findings are confirmed by the aihrc survey which found that 55 per cent of people used traditional or informal mechanisms to resolv problems and 38 per cent used formal state mechanisms of the court government or police38 the asia foundation survey from 2006 indicated strong overall bias in favour of informal mech anisms of dispute resolution finding that 70 per cent of people would approach local community or tribal elders or the shura 39 however the asia foundations 2007 survey differs from that of 2006 and is broadly similar to the findings of the oxfam survey40 despite the centrality of local institutions and individuals in resolving community disputes few resources have been devoted by the international community or afghan government to building community capacities for doing this in way which is fair effective and sustainable historically the role of ngos has been primarily to mitigate some of the hardships caused by the conflict rather than address underlying ca uses or support social capital 41 donors have also tended to support projects which yield rapid and visible results rather than give support to longerterm processes whose benefits are less tangible local peacebuilding work is currently being dertaken by small number of national and international organisations in afghanistan with very positive impact in terms of the resolution and prevention of conflict as will be examined late r in this report some larger ngos have also incorporated peacebuilding into their broader deve lopment work for instance as part of the nsp but localised peacebuilding is not component of the interim afghan national development strategy what is currently being done is fragmented both geographically and structurally and benefits only tiny fraction of the afghan population moreover the overwhelming focus of donors remains on material and physical support wi th visible results rather than the promotion of social or institutional capacitybuilding at local level 42 15 community peacebuilding in afghanistan oxfam in ternational research report february 2008 peacebuilding what is peacebuilding as recently recognised by the united nations high level panel on threats challenges and change peace and security cannot be considered in isolation from development and human rights thus to some extent all of the political state building reconstruction and development work in afghanistan can be considered as peacebuilding work activities that more directly seek to promote peace have been defined from theoretica l perspective as either political structural or social political peacebuilding is concerned with highlev political or diplomatic arrangements usually to bring conflict to an end or to prevent an impe nding conflict structural peacebuilding focuses on creating structures institutions and systems that support peace culture and often involves promotion of more equitable and participatory systems of governance soci peacebuilding seeks to influence attitudes behaviours and values by creating social infrastructure or fabric which promotes peace in practice however different forms of peacebuilding are often connected and overlapping in form and effect and all seek to st rengthen the prospects for peace and decrease the likelihood of violence community peacebuilding community peacebuilding is predominantly both so cial and structural it is participatory bottomup approach founded on the premise that people are the best resources for building and sustaining peace it posits that the promotion of peace must be undertaken not only at the highest levels but also at local level with families tribes and communities where disputes can escalate to violent conflict community peacebuilding aims to develop trust safety and social cohesion within and between communities to strengthen social and cultural capacities to resolve disputes and conflict and to promote interethnic and intergroup interaction and dialogue it aims to prevent conflict and achieve conditions which reduce community vulnerab ilities to violence from internal or external causes and ultimately it seeks to influence attitudes and behaviours through promoting values of peace and tolerance the means of achieving this is through strengthening the capacity of community institutions especially shuras to resolve disputes through mediation negotiation and conflict resolution supporting civilsociety involvement in peace an d development and promoting peace education community peacebuilding promotes restorative justic in that it seeks to provide restitution to victims and to restore relationships between offenders and victims peacebuilding is not about imposing solutions or pr econceived ideas or processes it involves self analysis and helps support communities to deve lop their own means of strengthening social cohesion and of building capacities to reach solutions that are peaceful and just it aims to encourage gradual and progressive change in tr aditional community institutions for them to become fairer more representative and more constructive community peacebuilding promotes inclusive partne rships between people institutions and civil society it is not fixed or defined activity but is an ongoing social process that adapts to local circumstances and seeks to incorporate peacebuildin g values skills and techniques into all aspects of governance and development work 16 community peacebuilding in afghanistan oxfam in ternational research report february 2008 community peacebuilding in practice impact what impact does community peacebuilding have community peacebuilding has been carried out with much success by local and international organisations in range of conflict and postconf lict countries such as cambodia viet nam and nepal oxfam has been implementing peacebu ilding and conflictmanagement programmes since the early 1990s in northern kenya where disputes often arise over scarce resources the programme works with communities partners offi cials and peace and development committees in 14 districts and focuses on enhanc ing and improving traditional conflictresolution mechanisms it also supports initiatives of the national steerin g committee on national policy advocacy and co ordination of peacebuilding and peace and development network peacenet as result of this programme in northern kenya there has been marked reduction in conflict and more peaceful coexistence among pastoralists the capacity of local and national partners communities government officials and ngos to work on conflict prevention and peacebuilding has been enhanced and their coordination improved more effective local approaches to address the root causes of conflict have been recognised and supported by the government and the national steering committee the programme helped to sust ain many years of peace in northern kenya before the recent upheaval which followed the di sputed election and reports from oxfam field staff in kenya suggest that the work may be helping to contain the current violence the government has incorporated peacebuildin g and conflictmanagement mechanisms into training curricula for administrati ve and security personnel additionally harmonised guidelines have been developed for the operation of district peace structures and best practices disseminated through peacenet oxfam is implementing similar pr ojects with pastoralist education as an entry point in east africa tanzania ethiopia and sudan west africa mali and niger and south america number of highly effective community peaceb uilding programmes have been undertaken by various organisations in afghanista n as described later in this section the impact of this work depends on where and how the programmes are desi gned and implemented the local context and many other factors however some key outcomes which are often interconnected are highlighted below increased resolution of disputes the most direct impact of peacebuilding work is an increase in the number of disputes which are resolved for example the afghan peacebuilding organisation cpau has successfully helped to resolve range of disputes between families co mmunity factions and commanders in particular cpau has been able to facilitate the resolution of marriage disputes longrunning tribal feuds and competing claims for land and water resources sim ilarly oxfam staff in two districts in northeast badakhshan have observed significantly higher vels of dispute resolution after less than two years of peace work in kharistan badgis province the head of the peace shura echoed many others spoken to in the course of this research observ ing that by first analysing disputes and using mediation approach they had been ab to resolve protracted disputes 43 lower levels of violence peacebuilding has led to marked reduction in the incidence of violence which is partly due to the increased resolution of disputes one afghan ng sdo has helped to resolve an impressive number of violent disputes including conflic t of 25 years in farah province between two neighbours and their factions which had caused the deaths of eight people in baghdis two groups had been skirmishing since the 1990s killing 30 people sdo brought the two groups together for 17 community peacebuilding in afghanistan oxfam in ternational research report february 2008 the first time and conducted peace work with them after which they said that if they had been given this support in the beginning the killings could have been avoided44 an independent evaluation of sdos peacebuilding work in west ern afghanistan conclude d that inspirational achievements have been made within very short time period with concrete outcomes and impact 45 the evaluators observed that once init ial suspicions are overcome the new peace shuras have quickly set up structures systems and pe acebuilding mechanisms and are successfully implementing their own violent conflict resolution and prevention strategies46 lower levels of domestic violence there is strong evidence that peacebuilding pr ogrammes have led to improved attitudes towards women and lower levels of domestic violence one sdo peace shura in badghis for instance ended long tradition of forced marriages in the commu nity another determined that beating of wives and children was longer allowed47 given the extent to which such practices are entrenched in parts of afghanistan these achievemen ts are nothing short of extraordinary cpau also has found that its programmes have brought about reduction in domestic violence in particular the resolution of small number of individual cases was found to have positive knockon effect on the wider community lower levels of violence amongst children peace education has helped to bring about mo re peaceful relations between children and adolescents sdo for example has developed peaceeducation curriculum for grades one to 12 covering primary secondary and high schools and ensures peace education component runs through its development activities peace education now forms part of the official national education curriculum improved social relations peacebuilding programmes in afghanistan have helped to strengthen community cohesion and relations within and between communities while th ey can rarely expunge grievances accumulated over years or decades they have helped to improve understanding between different ethnic groups especially in areas where one group is in minority which has reduced tensions and allowed for more positive interaction for example in gazni province exposure visits by shura members to different ethnic communities lasting seve ral days have helped to strengthen relations between hazara and pashtun people stronger resilience to external threats or events peacebuilding has enabled communities to resist or minimise militant interference for example peace shuras established by cpau in district of ward ak province helped communities to present unified front to militants and thus for several months prevented them from dominating the area regrettably this could not be sustained as the militants had taken control of neighbouring areas but it is indicative of what the impact of more widespread peacebuilding could have been especially if undertaken in conjunction with ot her measures such as strengthening and improving local policing and governance peacebuilding has also helped communities to resp ond peacefully to external events which might otherwise have triggered violence for example cpau shuras played an important role in ensuring peaceful response to the publication of the danish cartoons of the prophet in february 2006 expansion of development activity the resolution of major disputes can help to tablish an environment in which development can take place in district of wardak province cp aus work helped to facilitate an end to long standing feud between rival commanders which d prevented the delivery of any international assistance to the area for several years in an other case prior to national elections peace shuras in badakhshan province facilitated the provision of civic education to areas which had previously resisted such work 18 community peacebuilding in afghanistan oxfam in ternational research report february 2008 successful reintegration of returnees peacebuilding has helped to facilitate the reintegr ation of returnees for example in number of locations the norwegian refugee council nrc pr ovides assistance to refugees and displaced people for the resolution of disputes sdo supported by the office of the high commissioner for refugees unhcr has implemented coexi stence initiative which provides range of assistance to returnees in two districts of kabul mitigation of oppression peacebuilding has enhanced community capacities to mitigate the impact of oppression for example in jaghori district in hazarajat strong and inclusive community institutions with shared values and considered strategies for preserving the peace had considerable success in mitigating the impact of taliban occupation protecting wo men retaining basic education for girls and preserving community cohesion 48 local peacebuilding in afghanistan the following section outlines some of the acto rs currently engaged in local peacebuilding in afghanistan49 this outline is not definitive and there are other ngos that undertake such work in some cases as part of their role as facilitating partners under the nsp cooperation for peace and unity cpau cpau is one of the leading community peacebuilding organisations in afghanistan50 it engages primarily in capacitybuilding of existing or ne wly established community institutions to resolve conflict and promote peace its practical approach to peacebuilding prioritises longterm solutions and sustained efforts for developing and strengthen ing local mechanisms for dealing with violence the organisation believes that this requires participatory approach to enable community members to understand the root causes of their problems and to help them find effective solutions it has 76 peacebuilding staff of whom just six are based in the main office in kabul and its total budget for peacebuilding activities in 2008 is 800000 cpaus approach comprises the following key activities counterparts for peace are identified for example youth groups shuras cdcs schools provincial councils and partnerships are developed cpau staff then undertake capacitybuilding programmes which focus on participatory learning through community workshop s and they give support for the development and implementation of peace plans they provide ongoing coaching together with onsite teaching interethnic exchange and exposure visits are rranged and efforts are devoted to strengthening the involvement of civil society its capacityb uilding activities cover essential concepts and analysis of peace and development skills such as communication negotiation mediation and strategies such as conflict management sanayee development organization sdo sdo has similar approach to cpau and has dertaken highly successful work through the establishment of 88 peace shuras in eight districts of four province s of afghanistan it focuses on the capacitybuilding of community institutions to resolve conflict and promote peace sdo staff implement peacebuilding workshops produce monthly peace journal and promote peace education sdo has 15 peacebuilding staff and its budget for peacebuilding activities in 2007 was 340000 according to the evaluators this is creative and innovative initiative at the forefront of enabling and supporting what is truly wanted by afghan partners and communities it is clear that this is an area that people see as absolutely crucial to th eir needs people voiced that they do not want emergency or physical inputs but preferred this type of support which empowers their own means of development 51 19 community peacebuilding in afghanistan oxfam in ternational research report february 2008 oxfamafghanaid in conjunction with afghanaid oxfam has undertaken major programme of community peacebuilding in badakhshan province it provid ed six rounds of peacebuilding training for programme staff and community leaders this led to the establishment of conflictresolution committees which work closely with community in stitutions on peace and conflict management since its recent inception the programme has ready reached more than 40 target groups some 3000 people directly and over 17000 indirectly as result communities are now better equipped to deal with disputes manage conflicts and initiate their own peace and development programmes new round of training for staff work ing on the nsp is being undertaken by oxfam based on the oxfamafghanaid working manual for peacebuilding and conflict management tribal liaison office tlo the tlo was established in 2003 and works on tribal issues in logar kabul kandahar helmand and uruzgan its mission is to engage with tribal institutions supporting them better to serve their communities and facilitate the formal integration of communities and their traditional structures within afghanistans governance framework52 it also works to promote better dialogue and co operation between tribes and with the government build the capacity of shuras to improve peace and security facilitate reconstruction and develo pment and improve understanding about tribal structures and decisionmaking afghan womens skills development center awsdc this centre was established by women in 1999 to reduce the suffering of women and children through the promotion of peace and by spreading awareness of human rights with the support of trocaire and in collaboration with cpau and sdo the centre has implemented programmes to establish and support six peace committees with one central womens shura in two districts of parwan province the programmes focus on promot ing the economic independence of women as means of escaping violence office of the high commissioner for refugees unhcr as mentioned above the unhcr coexistence init iative consists of participatory projects implemented by sdo to assist refugees and in ternally displaced people to integrate into communities53 the projects also seek to strengthen community institutions promote group ownership of projects and work with local govern ment and other actors they involve monitoring capacitybuilding training peace education pr otection alliancenetworks direct intervention mediation and advocacy in each case the work is preceded by extensive conflict analysis and participatory needs assessments norwegian refugee council german development service ded unicef and habitat as indicated above nrc has established eight in formation and legal aid centres these centres provide assistance and support to refugees and in ternally displaced people with civil disputes which can arise when they return they also engage in enhancing the capacities of communities to resolve such disputes mobile legal team s provide support in other provinces the german governments civil peace service programme offers support to media and ngos working on peace education and conflict resoluti on separately unicef has been working with the ministry of education to establish centre for peace education and has given assistance on peacebuilding elements of the curriculum bitat also incorporates peacebuilding into its family and community rehabilitation programmes afghan civil society forum acsf acsf arose out of the first afghan civil society forum in germany in late 2001 it is partnerbased organisation committed to encouraging the active participation of civil society through 20 community peacebuilding in afghanistan oxfam in ternational research report february 2008 targeted civic education advocacy reconciliation peace and capacitybuilding programmes in 2006 it implemented capacitybuilding programme s in peacebuilding for 14 afghan partner organisations which operate in 14 different provin ces including in helmand nimroz and paktia in 2007 these organisations then conducted peacebuild ing workshops in two districts of each of the provinces in which they work afghan civil society organizations network for peace acsonp acsonp was established in january 2005 with the primary purpose of improving coordination among afghan organisations working in the field of peacebuilding and organising national events to promote culture of peace its current members are afghan civil society forum acsf afghan peace and democracy act apda afghan womens skills development center awsdc afghan youth foundation for unity ayfun cooperation center for afghanistan cca education training center for poor women and girls of afghanistan ecw mediothek afghanistan sanayee development organization sdo training human rights association thra on 20 june 2006 acsonp initiated the first afgh an peace day in more than 30 provinces of afghanistan which constituted afghanistans bigge st single peace campaign organised by civil society acsonp also organised international pe ace day events on 21 september 2007 which took place in all afghan provinces with the exception of zabul and which received widespread media coverage 21 community peacebuilding in afghanistan oxfam in ternational research report february 2008 towards national strategy it is evident that community peacebuilding in afgh anistan is highly effective in promoting peace stability and an environment which fosters develo pment however only tiny proportion of afghanistans population perhaps less than one per cent benefit from locallevel peace work which has been undertaken on an ad hoc fragmentary and uncoordinated basis collaboration between ngos engaged in peacebuilding has proved elusive perhaps due to lack of time and resources and competition over limited donor funding for peacebuilding projects it is essential for donors to provide greater support for peacebuilding programmes so that they reach and benefit more afghan communities this requires building the capacities and expanding the operations of peacebuilding organisations and the peacebuilding units of broader organisations as an immediate first step dono rs should commission assessments of the current capacities of these organisations an d the scope for expanding their work it is also essential for ngos and other civilsoci ety actors engaged in peacebuilding to lead the development and implementation of national strategy for community peacebuilding as discussed earlier in this report the caus of disputes and of violence and their interrelationships undoubtedly vary between re gions and communities effective peacebuilding must be adapted to local circumstances and be d by local people national strategy would not conflict with this it would allow for flexibility at provincial level and would not affect project adaptability at community level moreover the stra tegy would be at macro level and is essential to ensure the systematic expansion of peacebuilding activities share best practices institute monitoring and ensure high standards spread awareness mainstream peacebuilding into government institutions and enhance coo rdination between all relevant actors the first stage in developing national strate gy could be national conference on community peacebuilding attended by experts and ngo practitioners from afghanistan and overseas as well as government officials parliamentarians repr esentatives and others it would aim to establish broad framework for national strategy and steering group preferably with representation from the government civil societ academia and religious organisations which would oversee the development and implementation of the strategy if such strategy is not included in the afghan national development strategy due to be finalised early this year it could at least be endorsed by the afghan government and national assembly the national conference could be followed by series of parallel provincial conferences to elaborate how the strategy would be adapted to provincial conditions and to establish parallel series of provinciallevel steering groups thes conferences would ensure the national strategy incorporates appropriate provincial variations consideration should be given to strengthening and expanding the existing afghan peacebuilding network of ngos and civil society which could play an important role in driving the process forward with sufficient support there may even be the potential for the network to develop into peace movement ideas for this could perhaps be drawn from the oxfam south asia we can campaign in terms of the mobilisation of largescale public support potential components of national strategy ar outlined below and would include phased capacitybuilding education aw areness raising mainstreaming reporting research information collation monitoring and coordination with state institutions phased capacitybuilding one of the first tasks of national steering gr oup would be to agree comprehensive training manual which could draw heavily on existing materials the steering group would arrange for peacebuilding experts and organisations to institut the training of capacity builders who would 22 community peacebuilding in afghanistan oxfam in ternational research report february 2008 operate at district level these individuals would sequentially train other capacity builders and the programme could be expanded to an increasing number of districts over given timeframe for example it might be possible optimistically for the programme to be introduced nationwide over fiveyear period as there are approximately 400 districts in afghanistan the programme could be initiated in 60 districts in the first year and 70 80 90 and 100 new districts in each of the following years clearly it would not be possible to introduce the programme into those areas of the south and southeast where there is intensive fi ghting given that there are 34 provinces each with varying number of districts this translates to an achievable provincial target for the programme to be introduced into one to three new districts annually in each new district the first step would be an analysis of security conditions to establish key priorities and opportunities for peacebuilding work variably known as conflict map audit or baseline survey initially the programme would be introduced in limited number of areas of district to be consolidated and expanded into further areas over time key targets for capacitybuilding would be community institutions peace shuras for large villages or clusters of villages or cdcs district shuras and provincial councils civil society community organisations uth and womens groups religious leaders including local and national networks with support from international networks key individuals community leaders and mullahs local government officials at district and prov incial level especially district governors the afghan national police especially at district level some organisations such as sdo and oxfam have included peacebuilding training for cdcs there may be case for ensuring the formal inclusion of peacebuilding training for all such councils within the framework of the nsp 54 the key objective would be to bu ild the capacities of existing institutions so that they could take on the additional role of peace shura or peace and development committee the process could be replicated so that peace coun cils are established at the level of clusters of communities and districts in order to addre ss disputes between tribes and communities the afghan constitution envisages the election of district councils and it may be that these institutions could take on peacebuilding role participatory inclusive and flexible approach the approach would be to build longterm peac ebuilding and conflictmanagement capacities through participatory training workshops on key i ssues exposure visits to existing programmes and ongoing coaching combined with monitoring and evaluation minimal resources would be required to support small projects or peacerela ted events or activities the programmes would be responsive rather than prescriptive incorporat ing the flexibility to adapt according to local conditions rather than imposing values or prec onceived processes they would encourage self analysis and would focus on building human capital the programmes should be as inclusive as possible particularly in respect of women this may pose challenges in some areas of afghanistan part icularly in the south and strategy for securing female participation and capacitybuilding could be developed where female participation in the shura is blocked dedicated womens peace groups could be established as undertaken by the afghan womens skills development center and dialogues initiated with locally influential figures in light of past experience careful cons ideration must be given to ensuring that such groups have central role in community peace and development with strong links to maledominated institutions 23 community peacebuilding in afghanistan oxfam in ternational research report february 2008 gender training could be incorporated into peac ebuilding programmes to increase future prospects for female involvement at the same time peacebu ilding training could also be provided to women through other channels and could form part of existing media vocational literacy and teacher training55 strategies could perhaps draw on the experience and factors for success of womens peace groups in other states such as in uganda or sudan at the same time efforts must also be made to incorporate local religious leaders who often have considerable influence and authority as well as young people who comprise the vast majority of the afghan population education number of organisations have already produc ed peaceeducation courses for children cpau and sdo in particular have developed full curricu lum for grades one to 12 this has been tested in schools in pakistan and is currently being taught as supplementary material in around 100 education centres in kabul and ghazni provinces alongside the national curriculum the development agency gtz has also recently fac ilitated the inclusion of peacebuilding into the national curriculum measures should be taken to monitor and evaluate how successful this is in practice working group comprising national and international experts on peacebuilding together with educationalists could seek to ensure that peacebuilding is being taught effectively and that it is fully incorporated into teacher training awarenessraising general and specific awareness campaigns involving pu blications events and other initiatives could be organised to target the public government officials and elected representatives at national and provincial level these campaigns could emphasise the value of peacebuilding and encourage inclusive participation separately part of the strategy could consider ways of ensuring awareness within communities of peacebuilding activities as well as their purpose and outcomes 56 mainstreaming projects would be developed to mainstream peacebuilding into other relevant sectors of government particularly those connected to governance and into national priority programmes such as the nsp for every project and for each relevant government department there should be focal points at national provincial and district levels with clear responsibilities to promote peacebuilding reporting research informa tion collation and monitoring new body could be established or perhaps it coul d be part of the aihrc with responsibility for monitoring the outcomes of shuras to ensure that they are consistent with the afghan constitution and with international humanrights laws th ere should be comprehensive monitoring of baad and other practices which discriminate against women to ensure that measures are taken by the government to address such abuses separate body could be established perhaps linked to an academic institute such as kabul university and thinktank like the afghan resear ch and evaluation unit to collate information on community peacebuilding activities monitor progress evaluate success and promote best practice preferably it would have small secret ariat in each province which would work closely with the provincial steering group links could be established between this body and international academiesthinktanks specia lising in peacebuilding 24 community peacebuilding in afghanistan oxfam in ternational research report february 2008 coordination with state institutions legislation or official guidelines should address th role of informal justice recent undp paper concluded that informal mechanisms of dispute resolution may be crucial in postconflict countries and that informal systems are usually the primary means of resolving disputes in many countries as such their effectiveness determines wh ether they can be resolved in peaceful way or whether they will descend into violence it argues that engaging with informal justice mechanisms is essential for enhancing access to justice for poor and disadvantaged people as part of broader holistic justice strategy which covers both formal and informal sectors 57 more specifically undp has recently argued for hybrid model of justice in afghanistan whereby institutional links are established between the form and informal mechanisms of justice and for state regulation of the latter58 this could bring clarity to current arrangements which are diverse and uncoordinated and could help avoid abuses such as baad which occur under the informal system as the afghan government stated in january 2008 afghanistans jirga and shura systems can contribute with assistance and oversight from the formal system to resolve disputes fairly efficiently and according to constitutional principles59 more broadly legislation or guidelines could set out the relations between shuras and state institutions and would stipulate when and how i ssues should be referred to local government political entities or the courts given the lack of public and official awareness of the roles and responsibilities of subnational state institutions it might be useful for these measures to be included in the awarenessraising strategy referred to above they may need to incorporate degree of flexibility for variations in local and provincial approaches donor and afghan government commitments the strategy should set out the commitments that are required from donors and the afghan government for its successful implementation donors should be prepared to make longterm financial commitments to support the expansion of peacebuilding activities and the other elements of national strategy for example expert technical assistance in capacitybuilding or the establishment of body for research and monitori ng the afghan government especially relevant ministries should be willing to endorse the strategy and give it the support it needs 25 community peacebuilding in afghanistan oxfam in ternational research report february 2008 challenges there is doubt that there would be consid erable but not insurmountable challenges in developing national strategy and achieving its implementation these are set out below intangible results it is difficult to measure or demonstrate the results of community peacebuilding given that the focus is on building social and not material capital and it is impossible to measure the disputes or conflicts which are prevented this could impact on funding donors would not have concrete results to present to domestic populations however over time greater security and lower levels of violence should be achieved and research on pa st levels of insecurity would allow comparative analysis donors could also be made aware of the success of peacebuilding in other developing countries government involvement in order to ensure the participation of the broadest possible spectrum of individuals in peacebuilding it is important for it not to be associated with military forces thus it could not be undertaken by or associated with provincial reconstruction teams given negative perceptions of the government in some parts of afghanistan espe cially the south it would be preferable for the strategy to have wide ownership rather than being simply considered government programme existing community peacebuilding in afghanistan has been undertaken by range of actors in conjunction with civil society and cal officials there is reason why national strategy couldnt replicate this approach gender as highlighted above there may be considerable challenges in incorporating women into peacebuilding programmes and ensuring that peac ebuilding includes work to prevent domestic violence this is not only due to male dominance in afghan community institutions and in society as whole but also the fact that the programme envisages building the capacities of existing community institutions rather than attempting to establish another layer of institutions however current ngo programmes have managed successfully to promote the involvement of women in peacebuilding and best practices could be replicated the eviden ce that peacebuilding programmes result in improved attitudes towards women fewer abuses against women and reduced domestic violence suggests that when ch programmes are combined with other means such as gender training for existing shuras and alternative approaches the opportunities for female involvement in peacebuilding will ex pand as the programmes develop any monitoring mechanism established as part of the national strategy should have as one of its primary responsibilities the duty to monitor the inclusion of women in peacebuilding programmes in particular it should identify where women continue to be excluded from peacebuilding and make recommendations as to remedial action such as the establishment of womens shuras as well as promote and spread awareness of best practices spoilers it is possible that influential individuals such as warlords commanders or politicians could perceive peacebuilding as threat to their positions and try to impede or influence the work however existing programmes have been able to overcome this problem by using various strategies such as including these individual s in the programme and there are cases where 26 community peacebuilding in afghanistan oxfam in ternational research report february 2008 warlords have been transformed and taken an active role in peacebuilding it is also unlikely that the proposed work would be perceived as majo r threat given that the programme would operate primarily at community level diversity afghanistans geographical diversity and the wide range of types of dispute means that the most effective type of peacebuilding will vary accordin g to local circumstances although national strategy would require unified framework there is reason why it shouldnt incorporate flexibility and accommodate local variations this ma even help to facilitate the identification of best practices due to local circumstances culture or securi ty conditions there may be variable commitment between districts or provinces to the implementation of the programme if proper monitoring and evaluation mechanism is established this should be able to identify those areas where there are gaps or weaknesses in implementation it could then propose appropriate remedial steps to the provincial or national steering group lack of implementing partners and human resources there is lack of competent implementing partners with experience of peacebuilding and general lack of qualified and reliable human resources however cpau sdo and number of other organisations have high level of institutional experience and knowledge of peacebuilding which could be drawn on in order to implement the strate gy experts from other countries some of whom have already worked in afghanistan could also make significant contribution security coverage and effectiveness high levels of insecurity will inevitably lim it the extent to which the programme can be implemented in south and south east afghanistan however current peacebuilding programmes are being implemented in insecure areas which suggests that this could be accomplished on an incremental basis through established techniques such as using local partner organisations engaging with community and tribal leaders an d demonstrating the value of peacebuilding by implementing the programme in areas adjacent to insecure areas aside from highly insecure areas in the initial phases of the rollout of the programme significant disputes will undoubtedly occur in areas not co vered by the programme however local steering groups could take steps to identify and prioriti areas where serious disputes have arisen even where peacebuilding is taking place certai n disputes may also prove too difficult for local mechanisms to resolve but community peacebuilding is not intended to be panacea it cannot be expected to resolve all disputes and nor should it be regarded as substitute for appropriate judicial governmental or political activities weather and access afghan physical limitations would apply access to remote areas would absorb time and resources weather conditions would prevent work in rural areas during winter these constraints apply to the majority of afghan development programmes whether local or national but sufficient donor funding could help ameliorate their impact such as for reliable transportation to remote areas 27 community peacebuilding in afghanistan oxfam in ternational research report february 2008 conclusion there is an urgent need for recognition that existing measures to promote peace in afghanistan are not succeeding this is not only due to the reviva l of the taliban it is also explained by the fact that little has been done to try to ensure that families communities and tribes the fundamental units of afghan society get on better with each other as oxfam research shows for the vast majority of afghans problems have local causes and people turn to local institutions and individuals to reso lve them yet little work has been done with local institutions and other actors especially with shuras to enhance their capabilities to promote peace peace work at community level strengthens commu nity cohesion reduces violence and enhances resistance to militants range of steps are required in order to achieve lasting national peace in afghanistan not least concerted measures to promote better governance rural development and the professionalisation of police and security forces local peacebuilding is an essential and complementary component of this strategy as the icg has argued recently the internationa l community should be focussing on community outreach to ease local conflicts and fault lines60 donors should substantially increase their support for ngos engaged in peacebuilding and national strategy for community peacebuilding should be developed which is phased flexible and led by civil society the afghan government should provide its full support and cooperation dono rs should ensure longterm funding for its implementation it is five years too late with increasi ng levels of insecurity there is time to lose 28 community peacebuilding in afghanistan oxfam in
