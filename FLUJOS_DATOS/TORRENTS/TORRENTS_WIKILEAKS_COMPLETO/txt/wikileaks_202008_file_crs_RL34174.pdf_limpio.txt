endangered species act background the american bald eagle haliaeetus leucocephalus is longer protected under the endangered species act esa1 as of august 8 2007 with the exception of population of eagles located in the sonor an desert of arizona efforts to halt the declining population of the bald eagle began as early as 1940 with the passage of the bald eagle protection act2 that act aimed at stoppi ng hunters had little effect and in 1963 the audubon society estimated th ere were only 487 nesting pairs left in 1967 the federal government listed the ba ld eagle as an endangered species under predecessor of the the endang ered species preservation act of 19663 despite this legislation the real prot ection to the eagle came in 1972 when the pesticide ddt was banned th pesticide had caused the bi rds eggshells to be too thin and the species decline is attributed primarily to the effects of this compound in 1978 the eagle was listed as endangered under the in 43 of the lower 48 states and threatened in michigan minnesota oregon washington and wisconsin4 the states followed suit today most st ates have their own laws protecting the bald eagle as one of list of species in peril or under rule specifically protecting it5 list of state laws and re gulations is included in the appendix to this report in 1995 the bald eagle population had incr eased and the species was

ecovery plans prior to the arrival of europeans in north america the bald eag population in the area that is now the lower 48 states was estima ted at between 250000 and 500000 the delisting process removing species from prot ection under the is called delisting under the species may be delisted for number of reasons such as extinction or more happily in the case of the bald eagle recovery the delis ting process considers the same five factors that were reviewed at the time the eagle was placed on the list the destruction modification or curt ailment of its bitat or range use for commercial recreational sc ientific or edu cational purposes disease or predation the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms or other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence9 decision to delist species is to be made solely on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data available10 the fish and wildlife service fws the federal agency charged with most endangered species tasks the other be ing the national oceanic and atmospheric administrations national ma rine fisheries service nmfs found that the population of the bald eagle had rebounded to the point where protection under the was longer necessary delisting the bald eagle was brought by fws without being petitioned by private party but it was not without contr oversy more than six years after the proposed delisting notice was published final decision had been made one lawsuit was filed to hasten the process11 real estate developer who had an eagle nest on his property sued to force the agency to act arguing that the delay was harming his planned subdivision since he wa s unable to build within 330 feet of the nest at the time the district court heard the case the comment period on the delisting had been reopened by fws the court agreed that the data received from the first comment session was old and allowed fws more time however the court set february 16 2007 deadline for the

biological divers ity cbd filed petition and then lawsuit to have the eagles of the sonoran desert of arizona defined as dps in an effort to keep those eagle s protected under the act fw s rejected the petition finding it lacked substantial scientif ic information fws argued that the suit was mooted by delisting the species the finding that the sonoran desert bald eagle was not dps was in the same federal register notice as the species delisting fws wrote that the while the sonoran desert bald eagle was geographically distinct population it did not behave differently from other eagles although it lived in hot climate it was still located near riparian areas the fact that it nested in cliffs was unusual but fws found that more and more eagles were becoming opportunistic nesters and would nest in places other than treetops fws found the sonoran desert bald eagle was not significant discrete population segment and therefore was not entitled to special protection14 federal district court deemed fwss decision arbitrary and capricious and remanded it to fws15 because the petition had been filed while the bald eagle was still listed species the c ourt ordered the sonoran desert bald eagle to be listed as threatened while fws pr epared 12month finding as required under the esa16 postlisting monitoring by fws when species is delisted the agency is required to monitor the wellbeing of the species for at least five years17 as part of its review fws prepared postlistin g monitoring plan which was included in the july 9 2007 delisting notice in the federa l register fws has indicated that the bald eagle faces certain haza rds primarily loss of habita t although it does not believe any of the risks threaten to reverse the overall recovery of the species18 fws has noticed that to some extent the eagle has adapted its nesting practices in some instances nesting closer to people and ot her eagles and some times choosing nesting locations in places other than trees also the eagle is able to exist in wide range of settings in all states but hawaii any future losses of habitat are not expected to imperil the species environmental risks also threaten the

in june 200722 the guidelines do not have the effect of law but provide info rmation on what behavior could disturb the eagles the guidelines recommend different types of buffers to limit harassment of the birds such as distance buffers nd landscape buffers for example for construction that will be visible from nest the guidelines recommend buffer of 660 feet if that activity is not vi sible from the nest 330foot buffer is recommended23 in conjunction with the delisting fws promulgated new regulations under the bald and golden eagle protection act bgepa24 defining disturb 25 and allowing permits for incidental takes of eagles both bald and golden26 these will be discussed in detail later in this report the endangered species act the bald and golden eagle protection act and the

ecosystems provide program to conserve species and to achieve the purposes of treaties and conventions29 the also prohibits trading transporting taking or selling fish or wildlife listed under the act30 bgepa and the mbta are more narrowl drafted bgepa prohibits taking selling trading or transporting bald and gold eagles or their parts nests or eggs31 the mbta makes it illegal to hunt take capture kill posse ss sell barter trade or transport any migratory bird or part nest or egg of the bird32 how habitat is protected under the bgepa and mbta all three statutes prohibit destroying the bird its eggs or its nest but the protects the eagle its eggs its nest and its habitat bgepa and the mbta appear to be drafted to prohibit only direct harms to the eagle whereas the has been structured to prevent indirect harm such as habitat destruction the difference is significant based on the plain langua ge of bgepa and the mbta developer could remove all the trees near bald eag nest provided it did not touch the eagle the eggs or the nest33 it has been up to the courts to find whether bgepa and the mbta prohibit only direct harm to the bird or also ban the indirect harm of habitat destruction all three statutes use the word take which is clarified under the and bgepa but is not defined in the mbta the defines take as to harass harm pursue hunt shoot wound kill trap capture or collect or to attempt to engage in any such conduct34 bgepa defines take as pursue shoot shoot at poison wound kill capture trap coll ect or molest or disturb35 because the mbta is silent the courts have had to interpret how the statute defines take the ninth circ uit has held that the act pplies only to direct taking such as by poisoning or hunting and not to indirect takes made by

definition was not as broad as the final rule defining disturb as to agitate or bother bald or golden eagle to the degree that interferes with or interrupts normal breeding feeding or sheltering habits causing injury death or nest abandonment 71 fed reg 8265 february 16 2006 under the draft rule an action would have had to cause injury death or nest abandonment to be violation causes harm to the owls under the but does not take them within the meaning of the mbta37 other courts agree that habita t destruction does not amount to take under the mbta for example dist rict court found that habitat destruction and logging even during the birds nesting season were not take38 based on these decisions it appears the mbta does not pr ovide habitat protection for the eagle the next question is whether bgepa protects habitat in the same way as the based on the plain terms of the respective acts there is lesser standard toward habitat protection in bgepa than in the one of the purposes is ecosystem protection yet habitat is not mentioned in bgepa because habitat is not specifically provided for in bgepa c ourts have reviewed the take provision to find whether habitat protecti on is implied one district court found the protections under bgepa were the same as under t he respective definitions of take do not suggest that the provides more pr otection for bald eagles than the eagle protection act39 the court compared the definitions of take which under the includes the word harm to find there was difference the issue can be focused on how the definition of disturb which is found in bgepa compares to harm in the fws issued regulatory definition of disturb in 2007 to clarify that some habitat ma nipulation could be considered take the rule defines disturb as to agitate or bother bald or golden eagle to degree that causes or is likely to cause based on the best scientific information available 1 injury to an eagle 2 decrease in its productivity by subs tantially interfering with normal breeding feeding or shelteri ng behavior or 3 nest abandonment by substantially interfering with normal breed ing feeding or sheltering behavior40 under this standard harmful behavior c ould be halted before the death or injury actually occurred provided it was likely to occur thus the government would not need to show an eagle died to make its case however the extent of hab itat protection provided by th is regulatory change has not been reviewed by the courts because the bgepa definition of disturb is now similar to the definition of harm it is worth reviewing how courts have interpreted harm to see how disturb may be applied under bgepa fws defines harm as follows harm in the definition of take in the act means an act which actually kills or injures wildlife

in the lower cour ts the us supreme court upheld fws definition of harm finding it was reasonable42 destruction of habitat could be considered an indirect taking of the eagle and indirect as well as deliberate takings were contemplated by congress when writing the according to the court despite this the courts have not uniformly found when habitat intrusion amounts to taking under the the dispute centers on wh ether species must be injured or killed before there is cause of action the ninth circuit has interpreted section 9 broadly as it applied to habitat m odification so long as the injury to wildlife occurs either in the past present or future the injury requirement in the definition is satisfied43 other courts have been more circumspect for example one district court said that an injury must occur before section 9 taking may be found in response to the broad misperception of the intent of the rule an additional sentence has been added which is similar to the original definitions language this additional language makes it clear that habitat modification or degradation standing alone is not taking pursuant to section 9 to be subject to section 9 the modification or degradation must be significant must significantly impair essential behavioral patterns and must result in actual injury to protected wildlife species44 it is possible that the language in bgepa will be subject to less legal wrangling while the regulation states that there must be an actual injury for there to be harm leading to these contradictory hol dings bgepa clarifies that actions likely to cause injuries are disturbance that phrase moots the dispute regarding actual injury while the wording differs regarding whether an action actually kills listed species the degree of harm for injuring species appears to be similar between the two acts where the prohibits behavior that significantly impairs essential behavioral patterns including breeding feeding or sheltering the bgepa regulations would now prevent actions that substantially interfere with normal breeding feeding or sheltering behaviorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34174crs8 45 7 15 usc 1536a2 46 72 fed reg at 37363 47 see turtle

sometimes against other private parties but mostly against the federal government although the issue has not been discussed in the bgepa contex t courts that have considered whether there is private

waiver of sovereign immunity but doe s not confer authority to grant relief if another statute impliedly forbids the relief which is sought49 in an apa suit the court reviews whether an agency action was arbitrary capricious an abuse of discretion or otherwis not in accordance with law50 two of the three federal courts of appeal s to consider the issue have held that the mbta cannot be used to sue the fe deral government even using the apa51 the eleventh circuit said that under the apa an agencys actions must first be subject to law before they could be found not in accordance with it52 the eleventh circuit looked at the plain language of the mbta nd the legislative history to hold that the act did not apply to the federal government the mbta states that person associations partnership or corporation could violate the act and does not mention the government the court compared that language to the which includes any officer employee agent department or instrumentality of the federal government in its definition of person saying cong ress has demonstrated that it knows how to subject federal agencies to substantive requirements when it chooses to do so53 accordingly the government was not subject to the mbta the eighth circuit also rejected the idea that the mbta could be used along with the apa to challenge forest service action that would kill migratory birds the court said that the mbta did not appear to apply to federal agencies but based its decision on different factor s than the eleventh circuit the court noted that the mbta did not provide private right of ac tion and found it could not be used as the underlying basis for an apa injunction54 the court then considered whether the government could be liable for criminal c onduct the court reviewed the definition of take under the mbta to hold it woul d stretch this 1918 statute far beyond the bounds of reason to construe it as an ab solute criminal prohibition on conduct such as timber harvesting that

provided only injunctive relief against the government in contrast to the eighth circuit which had expressly rejected the argument the dc circuit held that because the underlying treaties within the mbta app lied to the federal government the act applied to the government56 the court also said that person under the act could apply to person acting on behalf of the government however in light of the common interpretation that person does not mean the government the court said that the criminal provisions of the mbta would not apply to federal agencies57 but injunctive relief under the act was still available lower courts are also divided general rule regarding apa complaints is that the plaintiff must identify substantive statute that the agency has transgressed and show how that statute applies to the united states58 however most courts considering complaints against the federal government for violating the mbta have not considered whether the statute applies59 some distinguish between using the mbta to enjoin federal action and using it for criminal enforcement60 there is every reason to expect that similar schism will occur when courts consider whether the bgepa applies to ta kings by the federal government because the statute has not been exercised in this capacity due to overlappi ng coverage by the it is not clear how this issue will be resolved like the mbta the language of bgepa applies to person which is defi ned as associations partnerships and corporations61 mention is made of the g overnment and there is provision for citizen suit bgepa differs somewhat

is an ea gle and bird of large proportions62 this language addresses hunting eagles not the harm to eagles that may result from government projects it appears that loggi ng and other federal projects that would take eagles were not contemplated by c ongress as being covered under this statute if plaintiffs lack the ability to use bgepa or the mbta to stop government projects that may harm the eagle they will have lost significant litigation tool permits to take eagles before delisting one way in which bgepa was more protective of the eagle than the is that it did not allow permits for taking the birds as an unintended consequence of other activities such as the incidental take permit issued by fws under section 1063 or section 7 for federal actors however fws issued rule to allow in cidental takes under bgepa similar to section 10 permit fws says it is au thorized to allow these permits under 16 usc 668a which allows the secretary of the interior to issue permits where it is compatible with the preservation of the bald eagle or the golden eagle this rule allows existing take permits under section 10 to be used it also creates process to issue permits under bgepa for actions that were covered by section 7 incidental take statements64 for any permit the take must be consistent with the preservation of the eagles and fws did not anticipate that permits will significantly affect eagle populations permittees under the bgepa regulation woul d include federal state local and tribal governments as well as private parties according to fws65 however crs could not find any language in the regulations pertaining to these permits that includes the federal government or tribal governments despite the definition in the statute the regulations define person as an individual corporation partnership trust association or any officer employ ee agent department or instrumentality of any state or political subdivision of state66 fws estimates that twothirds of

bgepa will be less burdensome to obtain than the incidental take permits under the esa70 one way the permit process will be less burdensome is that there is public notice and opportunity to comment as under the also the per mittees do not need to prepare habitat conservation plan as require d under section 10 of the esa71 bgepa continues to authorize permits for scientific and exhibition purposes72 indian religious purposes73 and taking depredating eagles74 and falconry purposes75 fws also allows states to petition for depredation control orders but only for golden eagles these orders are issued fo r seasonal protection of domestic herds and have limited duration unlike the per mits which have public notice or publication requirements the orders must be published in the federal register permitting provisions under the mbta ar very limited and do not appear to apply to the federal government the fact that the permitting regulations did not provide for federal agency permits was further justification for the 8th circuit to find that the mbta did not apply to federal actors76 however that fact was not commented on by the dc circuit when finding the forest service violated the act by not having permit77 some permitting is provi ded for under the mbta78 knowing violations under bgepa and mbta prosecuting violation under bgepa and the mbta freque ntly requires less proof than

which pr ovides for penalties only for knowing acts80 knowing violation occurs if th person knew they were taking certain action for example if they knew that they were firing gun at bird it does not depend on whether the person committing the violation knew the bird was an eagle81 or that the eagle was protected in one case under bgepa defendant argued that he thought he was shooting big brown hawk nd claimed he could not be convicted of knowingly killing an eagle under these circ umstances the court rejected this parsing of the statute finding that knowingly modified the taking of the bird not the species of the bird82 under this construct knowingly means only that the defendant knew he was ta king certain action not th at he knew the action was illegal this is distinct from willfully committing violation which could be described as knowing the action itself was illegal with the expanded definition of disturb this could make prosecution of vi olators easier than under the for example under bgepa cutting down trees in wanton disregard for whether it would harm bald eagles could be prosecuted as an offense it would not be necessary to show that the person knew cutting down the trees would hurt eagles felony violations under the mbta are based on the knowing standard just as under and bgepa in contrast misdem eanor violations ve strict liability standard83 with the

the offenses enumerated in the mbta therefore when there is proof satisfying the requirements of the bgepa that w ill be sufficient for conviction under the mbta86 one common feature to all three statutes is that they all provide for forfeiture of all guns traps nets and other equipm ent vessels vehicles aircraft and other means of transportation used to take bald eagle87 state laws most but not all states have th eir own laws protecting the eagle see table listing states with eagle protection laws at the end of this report the allowed states to have stricter laws without being preempted and so states could continue to list the bald eagle as endangered or threat ened without running afoul of the act the mbta also expressly allows states to ma ke and enforce laws not inconsistent to give further protection to migrato ry birds their nests and eggs88 similar provision is found in bgepa however under standard rules of statutory construction state laws that are consistent with the act would not be preempted we found that two states have changed th eir rules to reduce the protected status of the bird since the delisting was proposed florida and maine virginia acknowledged that the federal law was changi ng but stated the eagle continued to be protected under state law n otwithstanding the prosp ective removal of the bald eagle from the federal list of endangered or threatened species the bald eagle continues to be threatened in the commonw ealth of virginia and is hereby declared to be threatened species in virginia effective as of and simultaneously with the date of its removal from the federal list89 at least one state louisiana links its protected species to those listed under th however it has not changed its listing of the bald eagle which indi cates its status as endangered90 like the federal government many states have multiple protections for the bald eagle those that do for example georgia and kansas have statutes that protect endangered and

executive order required each federal agency to enter memorandum of understanding mou with fws if the agency will take actions that have or are likely to have measurable negative effect on migratory bird populations103 the order also requires the agencies to take into account numerous conservati on measures such as support the conservation intent of the migratory bird conventions restore and

endangered species act with the exception of the s onoran desert population there are host of other laws both federal and state that c ontinue to protect it although arguably not to the same extent the most significant protections come from the bald and golden eagle protection act and the migratory bird treaty act which prohibit killing the bird or its eggs or taking its nests the enforcement provisions appear to remain the same allowing criminal and civil fines as well as civil forfeiture at the initiation of the delisting process it appeared that the eagles habitat would lose most of its protection by the delisting however new rule expanded the regulatory definition of disturb under bgepa to include habitat destru ction courts have yet to consider this definition so its impact on protectin g the bald eagles habitat is still unknown the significant changes after the delisting are as follows federal agencies will not have to consult with the fish andwildlife service before developi ng project that could harm bald eagles private citizens will not be able to initiate actions against otherprivate citizens to claim eagles are harmed the federal government probably will be immune from mostenforcement the incidental take permit unde r bgepa is not as involved as the permit under the and does not require any public notice or comment even for federal
