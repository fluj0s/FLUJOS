the conference agreement on the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act hr 4818 hrept 108792 which combined nine annual appropriati ons bills into one measure the president signed hr 4818 into law pl 108447 on december 8 2004 division of the act provides the us department of agriculture and related agencies with 8528 billion in budget authority for fy2005 which is 13 billion below fy2004 and 2023 billion above the fy2005 h ousepassed hr 4766 and senate reported s 2803 bills and the administrations fy2005 request an estimated 664 billion or nearly 80 of the total fy2005 spending in division is for mandatory usda progra ms primarily farm commodity support programs and various nutr ition programs the mandatory total for fy2005 is 145 billion below fy2004 mainly because imp roved farm commodity prices have required reduced spending for farm comm odity support authorized by the 2002 farm bill fy2005 mandatory spending is approximately 2 billion above the recommendations of the house senate nd the administration mainly because of revision in nutrition program funding n eeds subsequent to these recommendations for all discretionary programs us da and related agencies receive 1698 billion for fy2005 before taking into account the effect of 08 acrosstheboard rescission on all discretionary accounts required by pl 108447 discretionary spending is the category over which appropr

level and 413 million above the administra tion request once it is applied the rescission likely will bring fy2005 spending close to the fy2004 and house level of 1684 billion in order to meet an fy2005 discretiona ry allocation that was close to the fy2004 enacted level appropriators as in past years placed limitations on authorized levels of spending in the 2002 farm bill for various mandatory conservation rural development and research programs pl 108447 reduced authorized fy2005 mandatory spending levels for these programs by total of about 12 billion and applied those savings toward meeting the discretionary allocation among the provisions that were deleted by conferees in the final law were senate provision that would have relaxed licensing rule s for businesses seeking

involves how these two categories of spending are tr eated in the budget process congress generally controls spending on mandatory programs by setting rules for eligibility benefit formulas and other parameters rather than pproving specific dollar amounts for these programs each year eligibility fo r mandatory programs is usually written into authorizing law and any individua l or entity that m eets the ligibility requirements is entitled to the benefits authorized by the law spending for discretionary programs is controlled by annual ppropriations acts the 13 subcommittees of the house and senate appropriations committees originate bills each year which decide how much funding to devote to continuing current activities as well as any new discretionary programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32301crs4 1 all fy2004 figures cited in this report including the table at the end have factored in the effect of 059 acrosstheboard rescission to all nondefense

the fy2005 budget and appropriations process the bush administration released its budget reque st on february 2 2004 for all federal department agencies and programs the administrations budget contained an fy2005 ppropriations request of 829 billion for the us department of agriculture and related agencies which includes all of usda except the forest service and also includes the food and drug administration and commodity futures trading commission the fy2005 requested total was down 365 billion from the enacted fy2004 level of 866 billion primarily because of an anticipated reduced need in fy2005 to reimburse the commodity credit corporation for its realized losses1 an estimated 663 billion or nearly 80 of this requested spending is for mandatory programs administered by usda primarily the ccc crop insurance and most food and nutrition programs actual spending for these programs is highly variable and is dr iven by program participation rates and prevailing economic and

for usdas mandatory ag riculture and cons ervation programs was authorized by the 2002 farm bill p l 107171 and is funded through usdas commodity credit corporation ccc the ccc is wholly owned government corporation it has the legal authority to borrow up to 30 billion at any one time from the us treasury these borrowed f unds are used to finance spending for ongoing programs such as farm commod ity price and income support activities and various conservation trade and rural development programs the ccc has also been the funding source for large portion of emergency supplemental spending over the years particularly for adhoc farm di saster payments and direct market loss payments to growers of various commoditie s which were provided in response to low farm commodity prices the ccc must eventually repay the funds it borrows from the treasury because the ccc never earns more than it spends its losses must be replenished periodically through cong ressional appropriati on so that its 30 billion borrowing authority debt limit is not depleted which would render the corporation unable to function congress generally provides this infusion through the regular annual usda

effects of this rescissionuncontrollable variables the ccc in recent years has received current indefinite appropriation which in effect allows the ccc to receive such sums as are necessary during the fiscal year for previ ous years losses and current years losses as in past years the ccc will receive an indefinite appr opriation such sums as necessary for fy2 005 the admin istration estimates the required fy2005 appropriation at 16452 billion compared with revised estimate of 22937 billion for fy2004 the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act pl 108447 hr 4818 concurs with this request the estimated appropriation for fy2005 is not reflection of expected outlays for fy2005 but is instead an estimate of the required reimbursement to the ccc for its losses incurred primarily in fy2003 although the estimated fy2005 appropriati on is nearly 65 billion below the estimated fy2004 appropriation the reduction is not because ccc spending is being cut by congress instead it is primarily attributable to improved farm commodity prices in recent years which have contributed to reduction in required spending for farm commodity support under the 2002 farm bill crop insurance the federal crop insurance progra m is administered by usdas risk management agency rma it offers basically free catastrophic insurance to producers who grow an insurable crop pr oducers who opt for this coverage have the opportunity to purchase additional insura nce coverage at subsidized rate most policies are sold and completely servi ced through approved private insurance companies that have their program sses reinsured by usda the annual agriculture appropriations bill traditionally makes two separate appropriations for the federal crop insurance program it provides discretionary funding for the salaries and expenses of the rma it also provides s uch sums as are necessary for the federal crop insurance fund which funds all othe r expenses of the program including premium subsidies indemnity payments and reimbursements to the private insurance companies annual spending on the crop insu rance program is difficult to predict in advance and is dependent on weather and crop growing conditions and farmer participation rates in its fy2005 budget request the administr ation requested such sums as are necessary for the mandatoryfunded federa l crop insurance fund and estimated this

rate subsidy provided by th government as well as projection of anticipated loan losses caused by farmer nonrepayment of the loans the amount of loans that can be made the loan authority is several times larger pl 108447 provides an appropriation of 1578 million to subsidize the cost of making 3747 billion in direct and guar anteed fsa loans an additional 3018 million is appropriated for salaries and administrative expenses to carry out the loan program most of which is included by transfer in the total fsa salaries and expenses the enacted fy2004 loan subsidy was 1955 million to support fsa loans totaling 3246 billion thus pl 108447 provides loan subsidy that is 19 below the fy2004 level but loan authority is increased in fy2005 by 15 the ability to increase loan authority while decreasing the appropriation is possible due to two factors usda adjustments in historical loan costs and loan repayment ratios and relatively bigger increases in the lowercost unsubsidized guaranteed loan programs the administration had requested an fy2005 loan subsidy of 161 million to cover 38 billion in loans pl 108447 follows both the house and senate bills in not funding the

conservation program ta including crp and wrp although the house adopted floor amendment to hr 4766 that would have fixed the problem the amendment was dropped in conference on december 7 2004 congress completed action on s 2856 which limits the transfer of funds between conservation programs for ta and requires each program to pay for its own ta if the president signs the measure it will restrict ccc funding for ta to the specific program for which that funding wa s made available effectively prohibiting borrowing ta funding from donor programs the bill would also lift the 1996 ta
