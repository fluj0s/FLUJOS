and poultry products summary the us department of agricultures usdas food safety and inspection service fsis has monitored numerous reca lls of meat and poultry products sold in the united states the recalls have i nvolved beef products possibly contaminated with coli o157h7 beef and poultry products possi bly contaminated with salmonella and canned meat products possibly c ontaminated by botulism these recalls raise issues of consumer confiden ce in the meat industry and questions about the adequacy of the usda oversight of these products the issue received new attention in february 2008 when usda announced the largestever recall of 1434 million pounds of fresh and frozen beef products from california slaughtererprocessor the class ii recall meaning only remote possibility of adverse health effects was in response to evidence that nonambulatory downer cattle had been mistreated nd periodically slaughtered for food in violation of federal humane slaughter law and of meat safety regulations respectively following these recalls congress incl uded in the 2008 farm law pl 110246 new requirements for establishments to promptly notify usda about potentially adulterated or mislabe led meat and poultry products and also to develop and maintain plans for conducting recall other issues th at remain for congress to consider are whether usda should be given mandatory recall authority whether notification andor recall planning rules should be more prescriptive and whether new recordkeeping and product traceab ility requirements are needed currently usda does not have authority to mandate recall of meat and poultry products rather usda through fs is monitors food companies recalls when fsis learns of potential recall it convenes recall committee which makes recommendations based on in formation such as any pertinent production and distribution data provided by the company once the company initiates recall fsis immediately issues press release to notify the public posts it on its website and provides information directly to stake holders including congress the media federal state and local officials and constituents via email and faxes at the

authority to order companies to recall meat and poultry however none has been enacted number of bills with recallre lated provisions are pending again in the 110th congress69 following is brief discussion of selected issues and bills is mandatory authority needed consumer and food safety advocacy groups have long argued that fsis as well as fda should be granted explicit statutory authority to impose mandatory recalls of adultera ted and misbranded products these advocates contend that fsis and fda needs such authority to ensure products can be quickly remove d from the market any time company declines to do so voluntarily is reluctan t to act swiftly or fails to conduct comprehensive recall mandatory authority would expedite the current process make it clear that public health is the agencies top priority reduce companies exposure to lawsuits and bolster cons umer confidence in the food supply they maintain in 2004 gao concluded that fsis and fda do not know how well companies carry out recalls and have not effectively tracked them as result most recalled food products are not recovered and thus may be consumed gao found70 others including meat and poultry i ndustry trade associations and some administration officials have countered th at current authorities are sufficient few if any meat or poultry establishments have refused to comply with an fsis recommendation to recall suspected conta minated product they argue critics contend that this claim is based upon an ecdotal reports rather than factual accounting industry representatives assert that fsiss existing authority to suspend or withdraw its inspection service which effectively denies plant the right to market its products is strong incentive fo r establishments to ensure their products are safe to consume fsis authority also enables it to detain meat and poultry products of concern for up to 20 days and the agency can with courts permission seize condemn and destroy unsafe food as well these implicit threats along with the potential for adverse publicity and legal liability make the current system effective its pr oponents maintainhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34313crs10 71 us department of health and human services fda food protection plan an integrated strategy for prot ecting the nations food supply november 2007 at http wwwfdagovoc initiativesadvancefoodplanhtml 72 see roberts supra note 65 it is also argued that voluntary procedures encourage cooperation between industry and its regulators whereas manda tory recall authority might discourage it mandatory authority would foster more dversarial system of mistrust and possible litigation making recalls less rather than more effective they argue the house agriculture subcommittee on livestock dairy and poultry held november 7 2007 hearing to review recent fsis recalls responding to questions from several subcommittee members usda under secretary for food safety dr richard raymond reiterated the departments view that it does not need additional enforcement tools including mandatory recall authority day earlier the bush administration had announced new food sa fety strategy proposing such authority for fda however71 several pending bills w ould provide mandatory r ecall authority for products currently regulated by fsis under the safe and fair enforcement and recall for meat poultry and food act of 2007 hr 3484 all appropr iate persons first would be given the opportunity to cease distribu tion of potentially unsafe product recall it and to notify all others in the marketin g chain including consumers and state and local health officials the bill would further direct fsis to mandate such actions if voluntary actions are not undert aken in timely fashion comparable provisions in the bill would cover pou ltry and poultry products several other bills would authorize new agency to mandate recall if voluntary recall actions are not sufficient these include the safe food act of 2007 hr 1148s 654 which is much broader proposal to consolid ate all federal food safety responsibilities under new food safety administra tion fsa and the food and product responsibility act of 2007 s 2081 this proposal also would require anyone who distributes food products including meat and poultry products to have certification that heshe is financially capable of paying for the entire cost of recall of that product if n ecessary including any associ ated administrative costs responsibility questions among other components that might be considered for sensible mandatory f ood recall system according to the roberts article72 are extension of due process prot ection to food companies ie hearing before an administrative law judge and possibly some limitation on the liability of companies that comply with government recall request to protect them from civil actions these particular aspects of the issue appa rently have not been widely discussed among stakeholders at least not publicly more specifically if congress empowered fsis with mandatory recall authority would it also be shifting whether implicitly or explicitly the burden of proof from the companies to the agency might fsiss reasons for ordering recall be subject to protracted challenge during the hearing proceedings potentially undermining the r ecalls effectiveness what if fsishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34313crs11 73 id 74 this notification requirement is in lieu of somewhat more prescriptive provision in the senatepassed version that would have created reportable meat and poultry registries the registries would have been similar in c oncept to the registry in the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 pl 11085 which now requires the secretary of hhs to create registry for reporting f daregulated foods with safety problems erroneously ordered recall out of an abundance of cau tion that ultimately caused business to fail on the one hand if on the other hand fsis waited until it had additional evidence of problems would it be jeopardizing consumer safety notification requirements fsis does not have ex plicit statutory authority to require company to notify it when th company has distributed an unsafe product or knows that such product is in commerce many including roberts73 believe that such mandate for prompt notification is prerequisite for an effective recall policy in the enacted 2008 farm bill sec tion 11017 food safety improvement amends both the fmia and ppia to require any establishment subject to inspection to promptly notify usda if it believes or has reason to believe that an adulterated or misbranded meat or poultr product has entered commerce74 section 11017 also requires meat and poultry establishments to prepare and maintain recall plans and any reassessments of their process control plans and to have them available for usda inspectors to review and copy other pending bills also include mandatory notification language for example hr 1148s 654 would require any person with reason to believe that food entering commerce is in violation of the law to immediately notify the newly established fsa hr 3484 and s 2081 also would require persons other than household consumers to notify the departme nt as soon as practicable if they had reason to believe that carcass carcass part meat or meat food product they are handling is adulterated or misbranded another somewhat different measure the ending agricultural threats safeguar ding americas food for everyone eat safe act of 2007 s 2418 would provide for mandatory public notification of food products that have been fraudulen tly brought into the united states in response to the westlandhallmark recall of beef products that were distributed to school lunc h and federal nutrition prog rams hr 5762 would require anyone who voluntarily recalls meat poultr or egg products to submit to the secretary list of retail stores or public school distri cts known to have purchased products subject to the recall within five days after the recall began that person would also be required to notify the secret ary of any store or district that was not included on the original list within five days of learning of the omission the secretary must make this information publicly available within five days of receiving it the bill would also amend the definition of adulterated meat to include that

several pending bills would require fsis to establish programs to achieve these goals the tracing and recalling agricultural contamination everywhere trace act of 2007 hr 3485 would require fsis to establish system enabling it to retrieve the history use and location of meat or poultry food from the animal of origin and its locations prior to slaughter through processing and distribution to the ultimate consumer the system would include recordkeeping and auditing elements the meat and poultry products traceability and safety act of 2007 s 1292 also would require fsis to blish meat and poultry traceability system covering all stages of production processing and marke ting from live animals before slaughter to distribution of finished products to the ultimate consumer s 1292 would require persons and companies to maintain records and allow access to them when needed to trace products hr 1148s 654 also contains traceability requirements recovery rates and recall effectiveness recalls rarely recover all products76 since 1994 the quantity of produc ts actually found have constituted anywhere from 17 to 28 annually of the total pounds recalled recoveries did reach 64 in 2004 40 in 1997 and 58 in 1996 among the reasons that many products are not recovered is that they lik ely have been consumed or destroyed by purchasers according to fsis one issue is whether recoveries offer evidence that recalls are effective fsis officials ve asserted on severa l occasions that pounds recovered is not reliable measure of reca ll effectiveness preferring to evaluate its success on such factors as whether the number of illnesses associated with an outbreak has been halted since recall was announced and whether or not the product has stopped flowing through the distribution chain77 notwithstanding these assertions the 2004 gao report claims that both fsis and fda told us recovery was an important indicator of successful recall78 fsis testified that it has improved the ffectiveness of the recall process since the release of the critical oig report in 2004 fsis included revisions in directive 80801 designed to enhance recall verification instructions to agency

inspected at slaughter that yearagency also stated that it has increased the number of effectiveness checks and shortened their completion times such checks rely on riskbased statistical sampling plan to determine the number of consignees that fsis program personnel will contact during the effectiveness checks for recall to be deemed effective or successful the number of consignees found to have product in commerce must be equal to or less than critical number established in the fsis riskbased recall effectiveness checks sampling plan79 fsis also published final rule on july 17 2008 providing for the agency to post on its website list of all retail outlets to which recalled product has been distributed in response to comments r eceived fsis limited the application of the rule to class i recalls only the agency believes that this would enable consumers to identify and return or destroy more products than currently are found80 significance of recall data another issue is the usefulness of recall data generally does high number of recalls indicate that current food safety measures are ineffective in keeping unsafe products ff the market or rather does it signify that industry and the federa l government have heighten ed testing improved their ability to find the sources of more foodbor ne illness outbreaks and have otherwise become more vigilant in their oversight even after the products leave the plants usda under secretary raymond was asked at house appropriations subcommittee hearing about the significan ce of recall numbers he responded that the number had declined in recent years nd that it tells that our food safety system has improve d dramatically81 in arguing that their own inspection programs provide at least as much safety at the federal program states have long made the claim that they experience far fewer recalls of their inspected products than doe s fsis however might it be argued that states conduct fewer recalls because they ma intain different level of vigilance than fsis one consumer advocate told crs that most recalls of federally inspected products are announced after routine fsis or plant testing finds instances of bacterial

and other raw cuts of beef together constitute the majority of reas ons for recalls measured by volume of products these two pathogens alone accounted for more than 80 of the total pounds recalled during the period more specifically listeria concerns were associated with 243 or 314 of all recalls and tota l of more than 146 million pounds or 489 from 1994 through november 2007 coli o157h7 concerns were associated with 150 or 194 of all recalls and tota l of more than 97 million pounds or 324 of the total number of recalls 164 or 212 were variety of products found to be misbranded often because they contained an undeclared substance or ingredient these substances were freque ntly allergens such as undeclared nuts in processed product anothe r 67 or 87 of all recalls during the period again of variety of products were due to reports of foreign materials from sharp objects such as glass or metal to potentially less hazardous matte r such as pieces of plastic wrap another 149 recalls

freezer for testing and the laboratory returned positive finding of coli o157h7 from that sample on september 7 it took series of followup tests and mee tings before fsis was ready to tie the illness and other similar illn esses to the topps plant with the recall announced on september 25 by october 6 the center s for disease control cdc had cited 32 illnesses that appeared to be related to the recall according to trade press reports the in itial september 25 recall covered three days of ground beef production june 22 ju ly 12 and july 23 2007 the expansion to 217 million pounds covered one year of production back to september 25 2006 because the plant was carrying over rework ing each days production to the next rather than processing the ground meat in separate batches which would create clean break in production critical contro l stressed by industry experts and fsis officials in addition the plant had not followed its own haccp plan according to the reports86 more

eventually recovered the initial recall was limited to 20000 pounds even though the plant produced 400000 pounds per shift and though meat fro m one day was being reworked into hamburger being produced on subsequent da ys which led to the greatly expanded recall this was the same problem that reemerged 10 years later in the topps recall the hudson recall was viewed as an example of the breakdown of the voluntary food recall system critics noted that fsiss lack of recall authority results in dangerous delays when companies such as hudson question the extent or basis for recall and
