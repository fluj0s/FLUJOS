this section of the report highlights selected provisions from the 2005 epact relating to these topics it also addresses selected provisions that were included in either the house or senate bill but were not included in the final legislati on the topics addressed by this section can be classified into four categories 1 streamlining and expediting oil and gas development processes 2 nepare lated provision 3 the arctic national wildlife refuge and 4 miscellaneous provisions streamlining and expediting oil and gas development processes the 2005 epact requires the secretary of the interi or and

icant new source of natural gas for many western states141 in 1999 the supreme court held that cbm could be leased separately from coal142 recently environmental groups developers and blm have litigated issues surrounding wh at actions constitute compliance with flpma and nepa in the context of cbm development these issues have developed through several cases adjudicated by federal courts

were issued but did not specifically address cbm extraction the buffalo rmpeis 2 draft eis deis that was prepared after the leases were issued but did address the potential environmental impacts of

environmental groups by finding that nepa had not been satisfi ed and remanding to blm for additional appropriate action148 the ibla found the buffalo rmpeis to be inadequate because it did not specifically address cbm development which the ibla considered to be significantly different than the conventional development analyzed by the buffalo rmpeis149 for example the ibla concluded that water production resulting from cbm extraction is signifi cantly greater than water production from conventional oil and gas velopment and that cbm development posed unique air quality concerns150 further the ibla explained that the wyodak deis did not satisfy nepa because it was postleasing analysis151 in particular because it was postleasing analysis the wyodak deis did not consider reasonable alternatives available in leasing deci sion including whether specifi c parcels should be leased and appropriate lease stipulations152 although the iblas decision was reversed by federal district court153 the tenth circuit court of appeals agreed with the ibla154 in pennaco energy inc v united st ates department of the interior the tenth circuit held that the ibla gave due

blm completed eas and made fons is for numerous cbm wells159 based on the fonsis blm approved the apds without preparing an eis160 blm later recognized the energy industrys intention to engage in fullfield cbm development on some land prompting it to prepare new statewide eis and proposed rmp amendments addressing the environmental impacts of largescale cbm development161 the united states district court for the district of montana rejected the plaintiffs argument that the orig inal rmp and eis were inadequate thus violating flpma and nepa162 it held that the disputed apds were all for test wells and thus fell within the scope of the expl oratory drilling contemplated by the original documents163 further the court explained th at once blm had begun preparing new eis to address fullfield development it was not required to halt lease sales as long as the leases were in c onformance with the existing plan164 the ninth circuit court of appeals affirmed this decision on procedural grounds because the plaintiffs challenge was barre d by the statute of limitations165 in subsequent litigati on the same plaintiff challenged the new statewide eis and proposed rmp

arbitrarily and capriciously thus viol ating nepa by approving cbm wells at twice the density that was contemplated by existing environmental documents170 prior to approving the challenged cbm wells blm had issued statewide eis as well as preparing an ea and making fonsi for smaller area within the state171 however the plaintiffs claimed that bl m should have either created new eis or supplemental eis seis to sufficiently address the cumulative environmental impacts of the existing wells combined with the impacts of the newly approved wells172 plaintiffs asserted that new inform

approving cbm development that allegedl did not conform to the rmp174 the defendants moved to dismiss and the united states di strict court for the district of colorado denied the motion175 several ibla decisions also address similar issues in the 2003 matter of wyoming outdoor council the ibla ruled that blm had not taken the nepa mandated hard look at wate r quality issues associated with cbm development in one area176 the ibla found the blms water quality analysis to be inadequate because it was based on only one cbm we ll sample and neither of blms eas addressed any deleterious impact of cb m discharge water due to its chemical composition177 the ibla also found that blm should have considered the cumulative environmental impacts of the new wells combined with some nearby wells that

that the appellant s had not met their burden of proof in this particular case181 evidence indicated that the disputed coalbeds were located far beneath the surface and that there was lack of
