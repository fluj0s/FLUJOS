assistant secretarygenera type mission visit unm itaustralia signature date of submission 01122008 objectives of the mission assess the work of the rule of law and security sector reform components in unmit determine the level of cooperation and coordination with the government and with donors in the areas of police justice corrections and ssr mission participants mr dmitry titov asgirolsi mr kevin steeves policy and planning officer oasgirolsi summaw of findinas timorleste 1 the overall security remains stable in timorleste however despite the progress made recently the country remains extremely weak and potential for rapid deterioration is still there in mv view there are three main elements that will define the short and mediumterm oroswcts in timorleste the continuation of oolitical dialoque the economic environment and institution buildinq on the political front the country is admittedly more tolerant having overcome the trauma of the armed attacks against the president and the prime minister in february but much depends on the political chemistry of the four main state actors president ramoshorta prime minister gusmao mr alkitiri and brigadiergeneral rauk ably assisted by srsg khare the international community continues its intense interaction with these actors which helps to moderate the ongoing adversarial undercurrents and political divisions at the same time to achieve more fundamental stability it would be vital to focus on considerably enhancing political institutions particularly the arliament and invest an extra effort in grooming secondline of national leaders 2 with the precipitous fall of oil prices manaaina the economy presents particular challenge to the government during our visit the prime minister and others were actively engaged in balancing the next budget which poses two dilemmas the need to improve the still dismal socioeconomic conditions and to rapidly strengthen security institutions in order to solidify the precarious social conditions the country may need special massive employment generation projects for example in the areas of infrastructurebuilding and agriculture with regard to the security institutions there will be easy choices and donors should be prepared to provide new reinvigorated assistance in the security area while the government continues to be under pressure to redeem on its social promises in this sphere the major underlying fault lines persist albeit at diminishing level the mistrust between the ffdtl and the pntl is still obvious with the former claiming that the police are not yet ready to resume responsibility for law and order 3 the pntl is developing progressively with the assistance of unpol at the individual level there is growing professionalism and even enthusiasm that permeates the rank and file however tremendous institutional gaps persist including weak management and command and control lack of core capacities eg investigations and an almost total absence of logistics and systems maintenance capacity we were told that after protracted procurement delays some modest communications and transport equipment is expected to be received in early 2009 in many respects the pntl is still dependent on unpol at the same time there is some tension emerging between unpol and pntl with regard to divergent views on the readiness of pntl to resume responsibilities from unpol also most troubling was that we could not get any certainty about the budget for the police the prime minister informed us however that the defence budget was prioritized and agreed upon our observations confirmed unmits intention to delink any possible drawdown of unpol from the transfer of policing duties back to the pntl we recommended that while keeping the initial transfer deadlines and benchmarks as leverage the mission take more pragmatic but energetic stepbystep approach to identifying together with the government and donors and filling in police and other law enforcement gaps to confirm the pntl status it should also undertake joint untimorese assessment of the polices readiness to resume full operational responsibility perhaps with the participation of independent expertise 4 there is widespread understanding of the need for longterm strateav on iustice that could go further than the 2005 national justice policy in order to address judicial and legal bottlenecks to this end we agree with unmits recommendation for an independent review of the entire sector areas requiring particular attention include the politically sensitive backlog of over 5000 pretrial cases the figure being contested by prosecutorgeneral political interference in the independence of the judiciary and legislative action acute shortage of judges public defenders and rehabilitated court structures the expectation of massive increase in civil cases and the consequences associated with the use of portuguese in the judicial and legal systems president ramoshorta also informed of his determination to have only timorese judges presiding by june 2009 an apparent indication of tension with some independently minded international judges 5 assuming better policing and prosecution in the future prisons reform will certainly become an area of increased priority in timorleste it would be imperative therefore to deal with the issues related to prisons capacity in preemptive manner there will also be parallel need to further develop penitentiary programmes including vocational and rehabilitation activities we visited the impressively rehabilitated becora prison in dili some elements of its development could possibly be promoted in other peacekeeping missions demonstrating how unmit undp and bilateral donors have succeeded in coordinating their support in the meantime international partners and the timorese are already aiming at developing additional prison facilities in 200910 6 president ramoshorta told us that he has made one of his wo priorih together with the fight against poverty we agreed with him that ssr should be based on highlevel national consensus and longterm sustainability taking into account sound threat assessments and fitting into the changing economic context yet i was struck by how elusive the concept and the various activities of ssr remain in timorleste most of our interlocutors stressed the lack of clarity in the government in regard to undertaking ssr in comprehensive and holistic manner in this environment the ffdtl has positioned itself as the guarantor of stability even though it has clearly defined role or responsibilities if not corrected this may present longterm security danger and may portent further friction with the pntl 7 in the meantime great deal of attention is being placed on the forthcoming international ssr symposium from 11 to 12 december in dili which should be seen as the entry point into much longer process we advocated better coordination between unmit and the main donors as well as among the donors themselves whose individual approaches and lobbying make it difficult for the government to review multiple offers in such an environment there is danger that decisions may not be solely based on clear assessment of threats and the optimal use of resources in this regard unmit could help the government by presenting to it simplified ssr options including on the roles of security agencies and ensuring their adequate oversight finalizing the definition of the benchmarks to guide the resumption of policing responsibility by the pntl etc we also stressed with unmit that these and other ssr issues should be given priority in the next report of the secretarygeneral on timorleste to be discussed by the security council in february and at which the president expressed his wish to participate 8 main donors believe and we fully agree that unmit inducting its strong leadership continues to be an indispensable element of the overall peace and reconciliation process particularly in the rule of law area its presence and activism are appreciated by the population and many in the government at the same time it would be desirable for all donors to lower their positive pressure on the tirnorese government allowing it to develop and gradually expand its own space australia 9 the oneday visit to canberra served to brief australian government representatives on our trip to timorleste the recent general trends and priorities in peacekeeping and the forwardlooking agenda of orolsi we placed particular emphasis and found agreement on the pressing need to expand the operational capacity of the police division and the standing police capacity as well as other elements of the pillar and discussed in detail the considerable agenda of interaction between australia and unmas first assistant secretary woolcott agreed with our assessment of developments in tirnorleste and stressed the need to avoid any artificial deadlines in the rule of law area in timorleste in particular in regard to the transfer of policing responsibilities 10 we also visited the international deployment group idg of the australian federal police which is impressively developing into worldclass centre for training australian pacific islands and other regional police the 1dg is keen to further support the development of policing including increased collaboration on such issues as oredeployment training and doctrine development we were also briefed on the idgs operational response group org which is designed for quick police intervention the orgs robust configuration deserves to be carefully studied as we finalize our fpu concept we also visited the recently inaugurated asia pacific centre for civilmilitary cooperation which is willing to establish ties with dpko in regard to researching variious aspects of postconflict stabilization as well as rapidly deploying civilians into crisis management situations which we strongly welcomed recommendations brief the core group of friends of timorleste on the visit unmit to consult with gotl on the major gaps related to the resumption of full policing duties by pntl unmit in coordination with poldiv to organize joint assessment of pntl unmit to further consult gotl on the comprehensive assessment of the justice sector including linking up with donors unmit together with gotl and
