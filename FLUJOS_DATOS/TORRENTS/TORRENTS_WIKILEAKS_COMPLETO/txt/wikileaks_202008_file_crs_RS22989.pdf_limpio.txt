2008 japan the united kingdom and the united states announced their intention to create set of funds at the world bank to help developing countries bridge the gap between dirty and clean energy and boost the world banks ability to help developing countries tackle climate change1 the world bank held the first design meeting for the proposed climate investment funds in march 2008 in paris france second and third meetings were held in washington dc in april 2008 and berlin germany in may 2008 on may 23 2008 representatives from 40 developing and industrialized countries reached agreement on the funds design at the september 2008 pledging conference 62 billion was pledged to the two funds with over 50 billion for the clean technology fund ctf alone the aim of the ctf is to slow the growth of greenhouse gas ghg emissions in developing countries by helping fund the costs of transitioning to lowcarbon economic growth this would be accomplished by helping developing countri deploy commercially available cleaner technologies instead of cheaper higher ghg emitting alternatives such as traditional coalfired power plants the world bank hopes to secure 10 billion for the ctf the bush administration has asked congress to authorize and appropriate us funding of 2 billion over three years fy2009 to fy2011 as the first contribution toward this pledge the administration has requested appropriations of 400 million in the fy2009 treasury international programs request 2

poverty reduction some view climate change mitigation and adaptation as part of this agenda since the least developed countries are disproportionately impacted by the negative effects of climate change due to rising sea levels temperatures droughts changes in rainfall patterns access to drinkable water and disease patterns thus the world bank has increased its efforts over the past two decades to prepare environmental assessments for its projects and provide developing countries greater access to finance and technology for climate change mitigation efforts 3 however in 2005 the world resources institute wri an environmental think tank estimated that climate change mitigation was considered in less than 20 of the world banks energy sector lending4 at the 2005 gleneagles summit the group of eight g8 countries launched an initiative focusing on climate change clean energy and sustainable development by creating forum outside of the formal united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc process the g8 aimed to quickly increase transfer of technology to poor and developing countries 1 henry paulson alistair darling and fukushiro nu kaga financial

g344g561and to help them increase energy access while lowering ghg emissions5 at the summit the g8 and the socalled 5 countries brazil china india mexico and south africa agreed on the gleneagles plan of action on climate change cl ean energy and sustainable development the world bank was asked as part of that plan to work with other multilateral development banks mdbs to among other tasks make the best use of existing resources and financing instruments and develop framework for energy investment to accelerate the adoption of technologies which enable cleaner more efficient energy production and use in 2007 the bank began developing strategic framework on climate change and development 6 since january 2008 the united states has led efforts to create 10 billion ctf located at the world bank to help fund deployment of clean technology to reduce ghg emissions in developing economies primarily large growing economies such as china and india the incremental carbon dioxide co 2 emissions from china and india alone have accounted for an estimated 62 of new global emissions from 2000 to 2006 and are projected to account for over half of all future global emissions through 20307 research suggests that under current conditions emerging market countries emissions will proba bly exceed those of developed countries by 20258 without transformation in china india and other emerging economies it will be very difficult to achieve meaningful global reduction in ghg emissions according to the world bank potential sectors for ctf investments are in the power sector renewable energy as well as increased efficiency in generation transmission and distribution transportation modal shifts to public transportation improved fuel economy and fuel switching and large scale adoption of energy efficient technologies in the industrial commercial and residential building sectors9 while the costs of embracing clean technology may be prohibitive for many poor and developing countries agreement by developing countries to reduce their ghg emissions is becoming increasingly central to any post2012 agreement on global climate change efforts 10 many countries thus believe that the ctf would help engage the large emerging market countries such as china and india in the runup to the 2009 copenhagen conference11 if funded the ctf would invest in countryidentified sector and program

would be technology neutral financing technologies ranging from solar thermal and wind power to nuclear and cleancoal while the ctf would be administered by the world bank it is expected to cofinance projects with bilateral donors the regional development banks african development bank interamerican development bank asian development bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development and the private sector the costs to developing countries of switching to clean technologies without financial assistance could be prohibitive according to the international energy agency iea an additional global energy investment of 93 trillion would be needed between 2008 and 2030 to keep atmospheric co 2 levels below 450 parts per million to keep global warming under 2 degrees celsius13 iea analysis suggests that to achieve this goal lowcarbon energy needs to account for 36 of the global primary energy mix by 2030 according to iea executive director nobuo tanaka to achieve this outcome we would need concerte d action from all major emitters our analysis shows that organization for economic cooperat ion and development countries alone cannot put the world onto 450ppm trajectory even if they were to reduce their emissions to zero 14 us policymakers therefore believe that the ctf may be way to provide financial incentives to developing countries to help defray the cost of energy technologies that are cleaner than traditional coal use prior to any us contributions to the new fund congressional authorization and appropriations are required requests for auth orization of the ctf and appropriations of 400 million are included in the fy2009 budget request this funding would be additional to existing us appropriations to the world banks lowincome lending facility the international development association ida and the global environment facility gef the us contributions to the ctf would help meet obligations under the united nations framework convention on climate change in wh ich developed countries pledged to provide new and additional financial resources including for the transfer of technology needed by the developing country parties art 43 proponents of the ctf argue that the fund would enhance incentives to developing countries to mitigate ghg emissions and he lp secure their commitments to abatement in postkyoto international climate change agreement 15 concerns about the ctf however have been raised by policymakers and nongovernmental organizations ngos primary of which is whether the ctf should fund coalfired power plants

could be used to promote coalbased power generation options with only marginal reductions in ghg emissions these critics claim that supercritical and ultra supercritical coal plantscompared to the less efficient class of subcritical plantsare not transformational16 additionally these more efficient technologies are increasingly the preferred choice in many developing country markets as coal prices and equipment costs rise if these plants were to be built by the private sector anyway why should they receive multilateral funding critics claim that these plants lock in intensive carbon dioxide emissions for decades to come they generally argue that renewable energy options with zero carbon dioxide emissionsare better target for multilateral development agency incentives however many developing countries and multilateral development agencies are concerned that renewable energy such as concentrating solar power wind and biofuels may not sufficiently meet the growing demand for electricity in an affordable and reliable manner many developing countries view renewable alternatives with skepticism especially if they are not already widely used in industrialized economies until these cleaner technologies are commercially deployed in developed countries potential recipients in developing countries will likely continue to prefer more traditional coalbased options even if the environmental consequences are more damaging an example helps to illustrate the debate noted above the international finance corporation ifc recently voted to help finance 4000 megawatt supercritical coal plant in gujarat india the ifc notes that the project would result in 70 fewer greenhouse gas emissions than typical coal plants in india and that it is the first project in india to use 800 megawatt supercritical technology critics of the ctf note that projects like this still result in very significant co 2 emissions according to one analyst carbon ac counting framework is used in the financing decision and that using one would result in very competitive costs between coal and other zero emission options such as concentrating solar power17 he also argues that supercritical coal plants have been built in india and that many more projects are under development thus he believes that ctf financing may not be critical to the development or initiation of this approach some supporters note that the ctf could accelera deployment of carbon capture and storage ccs which enables the capture and underground storage of co 2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion plants according to the world bank however ccs is not currently viable technology and thus is not eligible for ctf financing critics disagree however about the viability of ccs technology18 according to the iea ccs in the power sector could account for 810 of global ghg emissions reductions by 205019 while allowing ccs in the power sector could enable coalfired combustion to continue to provide reliable dispatchable baseload power this is particularly true for china and india the largest and thirdlargest coal users in the world respectively 16 the more efficient supercritical and ultra supercritical plants which operate at about 3943 efficiency compared to 3436 for subcritical units offer only modest greenhouse gas reductions carbon dioxide emissions from power plants are directly proportional to efficiency so plant going with an 18 absolute increase in efficiency would produce 18 less carbon dioxide these are the higher heating value hhv thermal efficiency rates not be confused with lower heating value lhv efficiencies see the future of coal mit 2007 table 31 p 19 17 david wheeler world bank power projects crossroads on renewable energy center for global development may 5 2008 18 see

at commercial scale in the power sector to date there is only one integrated operating ccs coalfired power plant vattenfalls 30mw shwarze pumpe plant in germany in addition ccs is very expensive relative to conventional coalfired power in large part due to the energy penalty or reduction in efficiency to power the capture technology integrated gasifi cation combined cycle igcc plants with ccs the most costeffective application is estimated to be 75100 more expensive than conventional power today ctf funding may speed deployment of ccs in developing countries on the other hand developing economies may react negatively if they perceive that the rich world is withholding ctf financing for needed investment in efficient fossil fueled power plants in favor of an unproven technology that the rich world itself is only tepidly embracing 20 g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g146g152g151g138g149g561g3g140g157g146g152g151g561 to date several pieces of legislation have been introduced in the 110th congress that would authorize us participation in the ctf and begin appropriations on us contributions to the fund the most recent to be introduced is hr 7160 to authorize united states participation in and appropriations for the united states contribution to an international clean technology fund and for other purposes on september 28 2008 this legislation would restrict the world banks use of us funds for coalintensive investments unless they incorporated ccs technology and use ultrasupercritical coal technology in addition hr 7160 seeks to require the multilateral development banks to implement greenhouse gas accounting method to date the world bank has been resistant to introducing such measures due to what they argue are various technical and political obstacles21 action has been taken on this legislation in the 110th congress it is expected that hr 7160 will be reintroduced in the 111th congress especially as international negotiations proceed toward deadline of the
