summary the us merchandise trade deficit is part of the overall us balance of payments summary statement of all economic transactions between the residents of the united states and the rest of the world during given period of time some members of congress and ot her observers have grown concerned over the magnitude of the growing us merchandise trade deficit and the associated increase in us dollardenominated assets ow ned by foreigners this report provides an overview of the us balance of payments an explan ation of the broader role of capital flows in the us economy an explanation of how the country finances its trade deficit or trade surplus and the implications for c ongress and the country of the large inflows of capital from abroad the ma jor observations indicate that foreign private investors sharply increased their purchases of us treasury securities in 2007 as they also increased their purchases of us corporate stocks and bonds at the same time foreign official purchases of us treasury securitie s rose slowly in 2007 as foreign governments curtailed their purchases of such securities the inflow of capital from abroad supplements domestic sources of capital and likely allows the united states to maintain its current level of economic activity at interest rates that are below the level they likely would be without the capital inflows foreign official and private ac quisitions of dollardenominated assets likely will generate stream of returns to overseas investors that would have stayed in the us economy and supplemented other domestic sources of capital had th assets not been acquired by foreign investors this report will be update d as events warranthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33274contents background 1 c p i t l f l w s n d t h d l l r 2t h u

the us trade deficit background by standard convention the balance of payments account s are based on doubleentry bookkeeping system as result each transaction that is entered into the accounts as credit must have corres ponding debit and vice versa this means that surplus or deficit in one part of the accounts n ecessarily will be offset by deficit or surplus respectively in anot her account so that overall the accounts are in balance this convention also means that deficit in one account such as the merchandise trade account is not n ecessarily the same as debt1 the trade deficit can become debt equivalent depending on how the deficit is financed and the expectations of those who hold the offsetting dollardenominated us assets the balance of payments accounts are divided into three main sections the current account which includes the exports and impor ts of goods and services and personal and government transfer payments the capital account which includes such capital transfers as international debt forgivene ss and the financial account which includes official transactions in financial assets and private transactions in financial assets and direct investment in bus inesses and real estate when the basic structure of the ba lance of payments was established merchandise trade transactions dominated the accounts financial transactions recorded in the capital accounts generally reflected the payments and receipts of funds that corresponded to the importing nd exporting of goods and services as result the capital accounts generally re presented accommodating transactions or financial transactions ssociated directly with the buying and selling of goods and services during this early period exchan ge rates between currencies were fixed and private capital flows such as foreign investment were heavily regulated so that nearly all international fl ows of funds were associat ed with merchandise trade transactions and with some limited government transactions since the 1970s however private capital flows have grown markedly as countries have liberalized their rules g overning overseas investing and as nations have adopted system of floating exchange rates where the rates are set by market forces floating exchange rates have spu rred demand for the dollar the dollar also is sought for investment purposes as it has become vehicle itself for investment and speculation this means that the bala nce of payments record not only the accommodating flows of capital which corre spond to imports and exports of goods and services but also autonomous flows of capital that are induced by broad range of economic factors that are unrelated directly to the tr ading of merchandise goodshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33274crs2 capital flows and the dollar liberalized capital flows and floating exch ange rates have greatly expanded the amount of autonomous capital flows between countries these capital transactions are undertaken in response to commercial in centives or political considerations that are independent of the overall balance of payments or of particular accounts as result of these transactions national econo mies have become more closely linked the process some refer to as g lobalization the data in table 1 provide selected indicators of the relative sizes of the vari ous capital markets in various countries and regions and the relative importance of international foreign exchange markets in 2006 these markets amounted to nearly 600 trillion or more than 30 times the size of the us economy worldwide

aspect of capital mobility and capital inflows is the impact such capital flows have on the international exchange value of the dollar demand for us assets such as financial securities translates into demand for the dollar since us securities are denominated in dollars as demand for the dollar rises or falls according to overall demand for dollardenominated assets the value of the dollar changes these exchange rate changes in turn have secondary effects on the prices of us and foreign goods which tend to alter the us trade balance at times foreign governments have intervened in international

role of global cu rrency disruptions in this role have important implications for the united states and for the smooth functioning of the international financial system this prominent role means that the exchange value of the dollar often acts as mechanism for transmitting economic and political news and events across national borders while such role helps facilitate broad range of international

transactions first quarter of 2008 survey of current business july 2008 p 67 the data also indicate that the us financial accounts were in substantial surplus because they represent the opposite and offsetting transac tions to deficits in the current account indeed the accounting of the balance of payments is such that the surplus in the financial accounts is quivalent to the deficit in the combined balance in the capital account the statisti cal discrepancy and the balance on the current account the balance in the fina ncial accounts represen ts the difference between the capital outflows associated with us investments abroad which are recorded as negative value and the capital inflows associated with foreign investment in the united states which are recorded as positive value this investment is combination of both private and official investme nts or investments by private individuals and institutions and investments by governments and governmental institutions respectively data for 2007 indicate th at foreign official purchases of us treasury securities were down substantially from similar purchases in 2006 and private foreign purchases of treasury securities in 2007 rose sharplyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33274crs5 from the negative amount recorded for 2006 data for first quarter of 2008 however show strong increase in foreign official purchases of us treasury securities while foreign private purchases of us treasur securities increased slightly over the previous quarter the data in table 2 also indicate that private capital flows account for the largest share of both us capital inflows nd outflows another way of viewing the data is presented in table 3 which shows the net amount of the flows in the major accounts or the difference between the in flows and outflows in 2007 for instance total net capital inflows representing th net balance on the current account the capital account and the statistical disc repancy were negative 774 billion markedly less than the record deficit of 839 set in 2006 this decrease in the overall net capital inflows occurred in part because of slight decrease in the deficit in trade in manufactured

foreign private purchases of treasury securities turned negative between 1998 and 2001 as foreign private investors experienced net sales of treasury securities as indicated in figure 1 by 2002 foreign private investors returned to ac quiring treasury securities but the amount they acquired remained re latively level at 100 billion per year from 2002 to 2005 in contrast foreign official net acquisitions of treasury securities trended slightly upward between 2000 and 2002 but such net acquisitions more than doubled over the 2002 to 2004 period rising to 261 billion in 2004 in 2005 though official purchases of treasury securities plummete d to less than 100 billion and were less than private purchases in 2006 private foreign investors again reduced their net holdings of treasury securities this action was offset by large increase in acquisitions of treasury securities by foreign governments directed at least in part to slow the decline in the internationa l exchange value of the dollar in 2007httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33274crs6 however foreign private investors accumu lated more than 157 billion in treasury securities as foreign governments sharply reduced their net purchases of treasury securities from209 billion in 2006 to 59 billion in 2007 the deficit in the net capital inflow acc ount was financed by an offsetting net inflow in the financial account one striki ng feature of the financial flows is the recent change in the composition of the bala nces in the net financial account except for 2004 total net private inflows were greater than total net official inflows this trend was reversed in 2004 when net official inflows were nearly double that of the net private inflows as indicated in figure 2 in 2006 and 2007 net official inflows exceeded net private inflows in 2007 fo reign private inflows of capital increased by more than 2 but similar private outflows by us citizens increased by more than 11 so that the overall net private fl ows fell in 2007 or were sightly more than half of those received in 2005 the declin in net private inflows in 2007 reflects higher level of us direct investment abroad rising to over 335 billion in 2007 from 241 billion in 2006 whic h is entered into the balance of payments accounts as negative amount and lower holdings of fo reign assets by us banks data for 2007 also indicate that the united states again experienced net positive income inflow from us assets held abroad as us investors received more in income on their investments held abroad than foreign investors received from their investments

8ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33274crs9 the us net international investment position as indicated above the data in tables 2 and 3 show that the trade deficit is accompanied by an equal capital inflow that represents an accumulation of dollar denominated assets by foreig ners some observers have equated the trade deficit and the associated accumulation of foreignowned dollardenominated assets as debt that the us economy owes to foreigners that will have to be repaid this characterization however is not entirely ppropriate the debt s owned by foreign investors represents claims on assets rather than loans where payments on the principle and interest are specified according to fixed schedule and where failure to meet the repayment schedule can result in the loans being called in and made payable in full while foreign investors have expectations of positive return on their dollardenominated assets returns except for treasury securities are not guaranteed but are subject to market forces an important feature of claims by foreign investors on us assets is that some or all of the profits or returns on the assets can be repatria ted to the home country of the fo reign investor thereby reducing the returns that would otherwise remain in the us economy according to the most commonly accepted pproach to the balance of payments macroeconomic developments in the u s economy are the major driving forces behind the magnitudes of capital flows because the macroeconomic factors determine the overall demand for and supply of capital in the economy economists generally conclude that the rise in capital inflows can be attributed to comparatively favorable returns on investments in the ited states when adjusted for risk surplus of saving in other areas of th world the welldevel oped us financial system and the overall stability of the u s economy in turn these net capital inflows inflows net of outflows bridge the gap in the united states between the amount of credit demanded and the domestic supply of funds likely keeping us interest rates below the vel they would have reached without the foreign capital these capital inflows also allow the united states to spend beyond its means including financing its trade deficit becau foreigners are willing to lend to the united states in the form of exchanging goods represented by us imports for such us assets as stocks bonds us treasur securities and r eal estate and us businesses while this exchange of assets is implicit in the balance of payments the department of commerce explicitly accounts for this broad flow of dollar denominated assets through the nations ne t international inve stment position the us net international investment position represents the accumulated value of us owned assets

at yearend 2007 survey of current business july 2008 p 9 foreign investors who acquire us assets do so at their own risk and accept the returns accordingly unlike the debt owed by developing countries where principle and debt service payments are guaranteed in advance while foreign investors likely expect positive returns from their dollardenominated assets the returns on most of the assets in the international i nvestment position except for bonds are not guaranteed and foreign investors stand to gain or lose on them similar to the way us domestic investors gain or lose as table 5 indicates the investments in the international investment position include such financial asse ts as corporate stocks nd bonds government securities and direct investment5 in businesses and real estate the value of these assets measured on an annual basis can change as result of purchases and sales of new or existing assets changes in the financial value of the assets that arise through appreciation depreciation or in flation changes in the mark et values of stocks and bonds or changes in the value of currenc ies the department of commerce also uses three different methods for valuing direct investments that yield roughly comparable estimates for the net positi on although the three methods do provide estimates on us direct investment abroad and foreign direct investment that can be considerably different at times6 the foreign investment position in the united states continues to increase as foreigners acquire additional us assets and as the value of existing assets appreciates these assets are broadly divi ded into official and private investments reflecting transactions by governments among themselves and transactions among the public while the foreign official sh are of the overall amount of capital inflows has grown sharply as indicated in table 3 the overall foreign official share of foreignowned assets in the united states has remained relatively modest as figure 3 indicates official asset holding s were valued at about 34 trillion in 2007 or about 17 of the total foreign investment pos ition share that has remained relatively stable over the 13y ear period of 1993 to 2007 official assetshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33274crs12 7 for additional information see crs report rl32462 foreign investment in us securities by james k jacksoninclude such monetary reserve assets as gold the reserve position with the international monetary fund imf and hol dings of foreign currency an important component of foreign official holdings in th united states is the acquisitions of us treasury securities by foreign governments at times such acquisitions are used by foreign governments either through coordinated actions or by themselves to affect the foreign exchange price of the dollar foreign currency holdings account for relatively small share of the total foreign investment position7 private asset holdings are comprised primar ily of direct investment in businesses and real estate purchases of publicly trad ed government securities and corporate stocks and bonds as indicated in figure 4 the composition of us assets abroad and foreignowned assets in the united states differ in number of ways the strength and uniqueness of the us treasury securities markets make these assets sought after by both official and private foreign investor s whereas us investors hold few foreign government securities as result foreign official assets in the united states far outweigh us official assets abroad both foreign private and official investors have been drawn at times to us government securities as safe haven investment during troubled or unsettled econo mic conditions1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 20060246810121416trillions of dollars foreign

implications the persistent us trade deficit raises concerns in congress and elsewhere because of the potential risks such deficits may pose for the long term rate of growth for the economy in particular some obser vers are concerned that foreigners will become saturated with dollardenominated assets and will become unwilling to accommodate the trade deficit by holding more dollardenominated assets the shift in 2004 in the balance of payments toward larger share of assets being acquired by official sources generated speculation th at foreign private investors had indeed reached the point where they were long er willing to add more dollardenominated assets to their portfolios this shift wa s reversed in 2005 however as foreign private investments rebounded another concern is with the outflow of profits that arise from the dollar denominated assets owned by foreign investors this outflow stems from the profits or interest generated by the assets and represent clear outflow of capital from the economy that otherwise would not occur if th assets were owned by us investors these capital outflows represent the most tang ible cost to the economy of the present mix of economic policies in which foreign capital inflows are needed to fill the gap between the demand for capital in the ec onomy and the domestic supply of capitalofficial assets direct invest govt

foreign investment position by major component 2007httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33274crs14 indeed as the data presented indicate it is important to consider the underlying cause of the trade deficit according to the most commonly accepted economic approach in world with floating exchange rates and the free flow of large amounts dollars in the world economy and interna tional access to dollard enominated assets macroeconomic developments particularly the demand for and supply of credit in the economy are the driving forces behind the movements in the do llars international exchange rate and therefore the price of exports and imports in the economy as result according to this approach the tr ade deficit is reflection of macroeconomic conditions within the domestic economy and an attempt to address the issue of the trade deficit wi thout addre ssing the underlying macroeconomic factors in the economy likely would prove to be of limited ffectiveness in addition the nations net international investment position indicates that the largest share of us assets owned by fore igners is held by private investors who acquired the assets for any number of reasons as result the united states is not in debt to foreign investors or to foreign governments similar to some developing countries that run into balance of paymen ts problems because the united states has not borrowed to finance its trade deficit instead the united states has traded assets with foreign investors who are prepared to gain or lose on their investments in the same way private us investors can gain or lose it is certainly possible that foreign investors whether they are private or official could eventually decide to limit their continued acquisition of dollardenominated ssets or even reduce the size of their holdings but there is firm evidence that such presently is the case
