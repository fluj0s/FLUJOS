year of each conflict and of overall defense spending as share of gdp at the peak this report will be updated periodically to reflect add itional appropriations for ongoi ng conflicts and to adjust constant dollar figures to prices of the current fiscal year since the terrorist attacks of septem ber 11 2001 congress s appropriated more than 800 billion for military operations in af ghanistan iraq and elsewhere around the world including 65 billion to cover costs for the first few months of fy2009 almost as soon as the next administration takes ffice the military servi ces are expected to submit requests for additional funds quite possibly 100 billion or more to cover costs of overseas operations nd of repairing and replacing worn equipment through the remainder of the fiscal year in the face of these rather substantial and growing amounts recurring question has been how the m ounting costs of the nations current wars compare to the costs of earlier conflicts the following table provides estimates of costs of major wars from the american revolution through korea vietnam the persian gulf war of 19901991 and current conflicts it also provides timates of war costs as share of the economy comparisons of costs of wars over 230 year period howev er are inherently problematic one problem is how to separate costs of military operations from costs of forces in peacetime in recent years the defense department has tried to identify the additional incremental expenses of engaging in military operations over and above the costs of maintaining standing military forces before the vietnam conflict however the defense department and others did not view war costs in such termshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22926crs2 military costs of major us wars updated to include appropriations

allies except for costs of the american revolution and the civil war costs of the confederacy all estimates are based on us government budget data current year dollar estimates of the costs of the war of 1812 tho ugh world war ii represent the increase in army and navy outlays during the period of each war compared to average military spending in the previous three years for the civil war costs of the confederacy the estimate is from the statistical abstract of the united states 1994 for the american revolution the estimate is from an unofficial financial history of the united states published in 1895 for the korean war the estimate represents increased expenditures of the department of defense during the period of the conflict compared to the projected trend from the average of three years before the war to three years after for the vietnam war and the persian gulf war figures are department of defense estimates of the incremental costs of operations meaning the costs of warrelated activities over and above the regular nonwartime costs of defense for operations since september 11 2001 figures reflect crs estimates of amounts appropriated to cover warrelated costs the cu rrent year dollar estimates are converted to constant prices using estimates of changes in the consumer price index for years prior to 1940 and using office of management and budget and department of defense estimates of defense inflation for years thereafter the cpi estimates used here are from data base maintained at oregon state university the data base periodically updates figures for new official cpi estimates of the us department of commerce most persian gulf war costs were offset by allied contributions or were absorbed by dod net costs to us taxpayers totaled 47 billion in current year dollars source department of defense annual report to congress for fiscal year 1994 january 1993 b totals for post911 operations include all funds appropriated through the enactment of fy 2008 supplemental appropriations and fy2009 bridge fund appropriations in pl 110252 which the president signed into law on june 30 2008 totals are for military operations only and do not include costs of reconstruction assistance diplomatic security and other activities by other agencies figures for post911 costs are for budget authority all other figures are for outlays c reflects funding for operation enduring freedom the bulk of which is for operations in afghanistan but which also includes amounts for operations in the philippines the horn of africa and other areas d based on data available from dod crs is not able to allocate 55 billion in current year dollars in fy2003 by mission that amount is included here in the total for all post911 operations figures are problematic as well because of difficulties in comparing prices from one vastly different era to anothe r inflation is one issue perhaps more significant problem is that wars appear more expensive over time as the sophistication and cost of technology advances both for wars and for civilian activ ities adjusted for inflation the war of 1812 cost about 13 billion in todays prices whic h appears by contemporary standards to be relatively small amount but using comm only available estimates of gross domestic product the overall us economy 195 years ago was less that 11400th as large as it is today the data in the attached table theref ore should be treated not as truly comparable figures on continuum but as snapshots of pe riods of us history viewed through very different lenses over time varying

tables budget of the united states government fiscal year 2009 february 2008 table 31 and table 101warrelated expenses and 2 allo cations of funds in reports on obligations of appropriated amounts by the department of defense1 these figures appear to reflect broader definition of warrelated expens than earlier dod estimates of incremental costs of the vietnam and persia n gulf conflicts in years prior to the vietnam war neith er the defense department nor any other agency or organization attempted to calcula incremental costs of warrelated operations as opposed to normal peacetime activities in the absence of official accounts of war expenditures crs estimated the costs of most earlier wars except for the american revolution the confederate side of the ci vil war and the korean conflict by comparing wartime expenditures of the army and the navy with average outlays for the three years prior to each war the premise is the cost of wars reflects in each case temporary buildup of forces from the prewar level during the korean war however the united states engaged in large buildup of forces not just for the war but elsewhere in the world as well for the korean conflict therefore crs compared outlays for the department of defense during the war with trend line from average expenditures of the three years before the war to average expenditures of the three years after the war data on the costs of most conflicts from the war of 1812 through the korean war are based on official estimates of the budgets of the army navy and for korea the air force such official figures are availa ble however for the revolution or for the confederate states during the civil war estimates of the costs of the american revolution are from financial history of the united states cited in thorough

based on the consumer price index cpi that the us department of labor bureau of labor statistics bls maintains nd updates quarterly that index extends back to 1913 for earlier years crs used an extension of the cpi by academic researchers which is maintained at oregon state university5 that index also uses the official bls cpi from 1913 forward and periodically update s both earlier and later figure s to reflect new official cpi estimates inflation adjustments extending over peri od of more than 200 years are problematic in many ways the estimates used here are from reliable academic sources but other experts might use different indi ces of prices or might weight sources differently and come up with quite different results in addition over long periods the relative costs of goods within the economy change dramatically it is difficult to know what it really means to compare costs of the american revolution to costs of military operations in iraq when 230 years ago the most sophisticated wea ponry was 36gun frigate that is hardly comparable to modern 35 billion destroyer comparisons of costs in inflation adjusted prices therefore should not be taken as anythi ng more than very rough exercise finally the inflation indices used here are more specialized for more recent periods figures since 1940 are adjusted using factors specific to defense expenditures but such index is available for earlier years
