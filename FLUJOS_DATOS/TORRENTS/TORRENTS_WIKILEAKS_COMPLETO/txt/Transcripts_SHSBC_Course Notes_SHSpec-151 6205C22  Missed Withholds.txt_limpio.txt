6205c22 shspec151 missed withholds q and is really q an some of the forms of q and are 1 double questioning auditor questions the pcs answer 2 changing because the pc changes you are questioning the fact that he is changing 3 following the pcs instructions that is q an of hubbard you are questioning his answers by assuming that the pc knows more about his case than you the auditor do the auditor must stay at cause over the session and put the pc at cause over his case if the auditor doesnt make the pc confront the pc will obey his bank which says dont confront full cycle of action must exist with an auditing command this puts tremendous responsibility on the auditor to ask the right question so there can be two mistakes 1 wrong auditing question like what should we run on you today or have you had motivator lately 2 failure to let an auditing cycle complete itself you can get in trouble by asking have i missed withhold on you because the pc can give motivator response this throws endruds out the first endrudiment question is have you told any halftruth untruth or said something only to impress or tried to damage anyone in this session see hcob 21dec61 model session script revised which puts the pc out of session then you have to question the pcs answer to handle the situation so dont ask an ambiguous question ask the type of question that makes q and very unlikely perfect question is one that produces an answer that doesnt have to be questioned since if you question his answer he will feel unacknowledged he will feel he cant talk to you and will go out of session even do you have an arc break is imperfect since if he says yes the non q and response is only an acknowledgement not what is it an auditor who changes when the pc changes is demonstrating so much impatience to produce an immediate effect that he will never give anything chance to get completed he lacks confidence in the usual working often because he is unaware of what the usual is he will easily go off into extraordinary solutions because he lacks confidence in the ordinary solutions because he has never done it sometimes auditors q and because the pc gets nasty and furious and they back out the commonest form of q and however is failure to acknowledge the pcs answer because one is questioning it this can cause pc to react furiously or eventually to go into apathy as an extreme response to being made to feel that he is having withholds missed before this point there is twilight zone of semioutof sessionness where all the rest of the ruds keep flying out as result of occasional nonacknowledgement or wrong questions if you ask an auditing question like do you have ptp and get an inadequate answer you can meter check it if it still reads dont just keep asking the same question ask something that will be answerable without producing q and when pc drifts out of session he is drifting on his feeling that he is unable to communicate with the auditor the way to throw him out permanently is to punish him for getting off withholds and to make him feel that he will never be able to communicate his withholds to the auditor the auditor doesnt have to be sweet and nice he does have to get his auditing questions answered permitting the pc to answer something else also throws endruds out and makes the pc feel the auditor didnt hear him since he knows really when he is really answered you must ask question that can be answered and get that question answered if you do that smoothly pcs will do almost anything for you when you see session running off the rails dont look at the pc as peculiar ape and dont develop good communistic selfcriticism just look at the questions you are asking in session ask yourself if they are answerable by the pc and if you are accepting the pcs answers if you are doing these things right it must be the pcs environment that is caving him in
