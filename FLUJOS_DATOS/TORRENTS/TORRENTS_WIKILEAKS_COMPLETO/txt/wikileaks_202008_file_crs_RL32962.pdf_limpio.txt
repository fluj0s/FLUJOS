vocational and technical education through the carl d perkins vocational and technical education act of 1998 pl 1053321 the act authorized funding for vocational and technical education through fy2003 although the c ongress continues to provide funding under the act the 109th congress has acted to reauthorize the perkins act on january 26 2005 hr 366 the vocati onal and technical education for the future act was introduced in the house it was subsequently referred to the house committee on education and the workfor ce on march 9 2005 the full committee ordered the bill to be re ported on may 5 2005 the house approved hr 366 as amended by vote of 41692 three amendments were considered and adopted during deliberation of the bill on the house floor the amendments made changes to the amount of funds that could be used for techprep activities added new provision allowing local funds to be used to support transitions from sub baccalaureate education to baccalaureate education and added new provision allowing local funds to be used to provi training for automotive technicians in alternative fuel automotive technologies3 on february 1 2005 s 250 the carl d perkins career and technical

for the carl d perkins career and technical education improvement act of 2006 s 250 legislative language is currently available for the bill as the conference committee considered recommendations for the agreement rather than statutory language this report analyzes selected changes that s 250 house and s 250 senate would make to current law and key differences between the bills it begins with an examination of changes to relevant definitions made by both bills this is followed by detailed analysis of changes to f unding formulas both state allotments and within state allocations the next section of the report considers changes that would be made to the techprep pr ogram particularly by s 250 house following this discussion the report analyzes accountability requirements in both bills including changes to the core indicators of perfo rmance and data reporting the report concludes with an examin ation of state and local plans and uses of funds table 1 provides general comparison of so of the key changes to current law that would be made by s 250 house and s 250 senate each of these changes is discussed in detail in subsequent secti on of this report purpose of the act the house and the senate bill would make several modifications to the current wording of the purpose of the act such as including as one of the purposes of the act to integrate rigorous and challenging s 250 house or challenging s 250 senate academic vocational and technical instruction the senate bill would also add three new provisions to the purpos of the act focused on professional development partnerships and the development of highly skilled workforce definitions both the house and senate made changes to the definitions section 3 this section discusses some of the key chan ges made by each bill and their related implicationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32962 crs3 table 1 overview of proposed changes that would be made by s 250 house and s 250 senate current law provisions pl 105 332 house bill s 250 house nate bill s 250 senate refers to vocational and technical education same as curre nt law would replace vocational and technical education with career and technical education specifies set asides for outlying areas indian programs native hawaiian programs and incentive grantswould reduce the percentage of funds set aside for outlying areas from 020 to 012same as current law includes specific formula for state allotments for the basic state grants program and techprep program set asides only apply to funds for the basic state grants programwould maintain current formula but would combine funding from basic state grants program and techprep program into single grant subjecting what would be considered techprep funding under current law to set asideswould provide all states with hold harmless grant at the fy2005 level while distributing all funds in excess of the fy2005 level ie new money to states that would not otherwise receive 05 of the total funds available to states once all states reach at least 05 new money would be distributed across the states authorizes separate techprep program would eliminate separate techprep program same as current law division of state allotment at least 85 to local recipients up to 10 for state leadership activities and up to 5 for state administrationdivision of state allotment at least 88 to local recipients up to 10 for state leadership activities and up to 2 for state administrationsame as current law establishes performance accountability system based on four core indicators that are identical for the secondary and postsecondary levels only includes performance accountability requirements for eligible agencieswould establish five core indicators for the secondary level and four core indicators for the postsecondary level includes performance accountability requirements for eligible agencies and eligible recipientswould establish five core indicators at the secondary level and five core indicators at the postsecondary level includes performance accountability requirements for eligible agencies and eligible recipients sanctions for eligible recipients failing to meet performance requirementswould create sanctions for eligible recipients failing to meet performance requirements that could result in loss of fundingwould create sanctions for eligible recipients failing to meet performance requirements that could result in loss of funding state plans are developed for fiveyear period would requir sixyear state plans would require sixyear state plans requires techprep programs to combine two years of secondary education and two years of postsecondary education in nonduplicative sequence of courseswould require the development of model sequences of coursessame as current law and would also require the development of career pathways under basic state grants and the inclusion of career pathways in techprep programs to the extent possiblehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32962crs4 5 if more fouryear institutions begin to partic ipate in the program there might be greater overlap among institutions participating in both vocational and technical education programs and programs authorized by the higher education act 6 professions requiring postbaccalaur eate degree would still be excluded 7 s 250 house would continue to use the phr ase vocational and technical education in instances where both the house and senate bills would make similar changes to current law that involve the phrases vocational and technical education and career and technical education respectively this report uses the current law and house bill language in discussing the changesvocational and technical education s 250 house would make substantial changes to the current defin ition of vocational and technical education the most significant change would focus on what vocational and technical education should be preparing students to do current law states that sequence of vocational and technical education cour ses should prepare students f or further education and for careers other than careers requiring baccalaureate masters or doctoral degree in current or emerging employment sectors the house bill would drop the prohibition on preparing students for careers requiring bachelors degree which could result in an increase in the number of fouryear institutions participating in the program5 at the same time however s 250 house would also specify that the sequence of courses provided by vocational and technical education programs must provide at the postsecondary level oney ear certificate associates degree or industry recognized credential6 last the definition would be revised to allow students to receive the training needed to enroll in sequence of courses that is students could receive remedial coursework or training to prepare them to enroll in their desired sequence of courses career and technical education since s 250 senate would replace the term vocational and technical educati on with career and technical education throughout the bill7 it would drop the current defin ition for vocational and technical education replacing it with career and t echnical education the definition of career and technical education would deviate from current law in at least one critical way similar to the house bill s 250 s enate would lift limitations on the types of careers for which students should be prepar ed the senate bill however would go further than the house bill and eliminate the entire restriction on preparing students for careers requiring bachelo rs masters and doctoral grees that is students could be prepared for careers requiring an degree level unlike s 250 house the senate bill does not specify the types of awards that must result from career and technical education at the postsecondary level providing general requirements that the sequence of courses lead to technical skill proficiency credential certificate or degree similar to the house bill this could result in an increase in the number of fouryear institutions participating in the program techprep the house bill would drop the current definition of techprep program this is probably due to the proposed elimination of separate techprep program in s 250 house references to techprep however are made in various places throughout the house bill secti on 135b3 would define the components of techprep program under local uses of funds for example the components would include the participants in consor tium that write an articulation agreementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32962crs5 8 the house bill includes the development of m odel sequences of courses rather than career pathways but the term model sequences of courses is not defined in the definitions section 9 by specifying public or nonprofit institutions ra ther than institutions of higher education both bills would prevent private forprofit p roprietary institutions from being considered eligible institutions under this act if the defi nition of an institution of higher education changed during the reauthorization of the hi gher education act to include proprietary institutions see for example hr 609 101 it should be noted that neither bill would continuedprogram length areas in which technical preparation must be provided and use of performance indicator data while the senate bill would retain the definition of techprep program it would make substan tial revisions to the current definition for example the proposed definition specifically includes the use of workbased and worksite learning where appropriate nd available current law addr esses the strengthening of the applied academic component the defin ition in s 250 senate would longer specify areas in which tec hnical preparation should ta ke place eg engineering technology applied scien ce rather the bill would focus on the provision of technical preparation in career field including high skill high wage or high demand occupations the curre nt definition refers to participation in the techprep program resulting in an associates degree certificate or high skill high wage employment the definition in s 250 sen ate would require student competencies to build in technical skills and core acade mic subjects through applied contextual and integrated instruction which may include workbased learning current law focuses on building student competencies only in mathematics science and communications it does not address how th competencies should be built the proposed definition would not limit degree ttainment to specific degree level current law limits degree attainment to an associates degree the senate bill definition would also require the use of car eer pathways to the extent practicable career pathway the senate bill but not the house bill would add definition for career pathway8 the definition would state what is expected from the coordinated and nondupli cative sequence of courses that form the career pathway in addition to including secondary and postsecondary education components career pathways could also prepare students for dual or concurrent enrollment programs to obtain postsecondary education credits student participation in career pathway would be required to result in technical skill proficiency an industryrecognized credential certificate degree or completion of recognized apprenticeship program limits would be placed on the level of degree student may earn as result of participation in career pathway eligible institution s 250 house would change the definition of an eligible institution from an institution of higher education to public or nonprofit private institution of higher edu cation s 250 senate would make similar change but would require that courses provided by the institution lead to technical skill proficiency an industryrecognized credential certificate or degree9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32962crs6 9 continued change the definition of postsecondary educational institution which includes an institution of higher education that provides not less than 2year program of instruction that is acceptable for credit toward bachelo rs degree thus if the definition of an institution of higher education is chan ged during hea reauthorization proprietary institutions providing not less than twoyear program of study that is acceptable as credit toward bachelors degree would be consid ered postsecondary educational institutions for the purposes of this program 10 articulation agreement is defined in current law under title ii techprep 11 although the house bill would eliminate separate techprep program it would define an articulation agreement as an agreement designed to support programs to provide students with nonduplicative sequence of progressive achievements leading to degrees certificates or credentials in techprep ducation program linked through credit transfer agreements 12 proprietary institutions are not currently considered community colleges under the current law and s 250 senate definitions of commun ity college as eligible institutions must be institutions of higher education as currently defined in hea 101 if the definition of an ihe changes to include proprietary institutions as proposed by hr 609 101 for example proprietary institutions would be considered community colleges based on the current law and s 250 senate definitions it should be noted however that under this definition fouryear institution offering bachelors degree s or higher could be considered community college based on the requirement that the institu tion provide not less than 2year program that is acceptable for full credit toward baccalaureate degree 13 as previously mentioned community college is defined under title ii in current law continuednontraditional fields both bills would change nontraditional training and employment to nontraditional fields s 250 house would add that fields of work for which students are prepared can include current high skill occupations the current definition l imits preparation to emerging high skill occupations s 250 senate does not make this additional change articulation agreement both s 250 house and s 250 senate would add definition for articulation agreement10 the house and the senate however have proposed different definitions of articulation agreement that would expand upon current law the house definition would specify that the articulation agreement be established at the state level or approve d annually and facilitated by secondary and postsecondary consortia member s the definition would also retain reference to techprep education11 s 250 senate would require that articulation agreements be approved annually by seconda ry and postsecondary institution or sub baccalaureate degreegranting postsec ondary education institution and baccalaureate degreegranting postsecondary education institution thus under the senate bill it would be possible to develop articulation agreements that do not include representatives from the secondary level community college the senate bill would add definition of community college to the definitions section curre ntly community college is defined under title ii techprep the proposed senate definition is identical to the existing definition12 the house bill does not include definition of community colleges in the definitions section or elsewhere in the bill13httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32962crs7 13 continued s 250 house

105811680 1300142976special populations both bills would retain the current law definition of special populations making only minor m odifications special populations would continue to include individuals with disabilities individua ls from economically disadvantaged families sing parents and displaced homemakers individuals preparing for nontraditional training and employment would be replaced by individuals preparing for nontraditional fi elds in both bills both bills would modify an existing provision to eliminate individuals with other barriers to educational achieveme nt retaining only language about individuals with limited english proficiency s 250 house would add separa provision for individuals with other barriers to educational achievement as determined by the state that would not be included in s 250 senate outlying areas both bills would drop the republic of the marshall islands and the federated states of micronesia fro m the definition of outlying areas the senate bill would also dr op the republic of palau changes related to other laws both the house and senate bill would add definition based on the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 esea as amended by the child left behind act and the senate would add one based on the workforce investment act of 1998 wia pl 105220 s 250 house would add definition for scientifi cally based research that is aligned with the definition used in esea references to carrying out research in current law would be modified in s 250 house to focus on carrying out scientificallybased research s 250 senate would add defi nition for core academic subjects the senate bill would also add definition for local workforce investment board that references wia authorizations and reservations authorization of appropriations section 8 of the perkins act authorizes appropriations for the basic state grant program14 s 250 senate would continue th currentlaw authorization at such sums as may be necessary and would update the fiscal years to which the authorization applies to fy2006 throug h fy2011 s 250 house would also authorize appropriations for th fiscal years but would specify an authorization of 1307 billion for fy200615httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32962crs8 16 for discussion of the definition of outlying areas see above 17 palau would longer be eligible for perk ins funds after signing new compact of free associationreservation of funds section 111 of the perkins act specifies reservations of funds for certain activities and specifies the state allotment formula table 2 shows current law reservations and proposed rese rvations under the two bills in brief s 250 senate would preserve current law reserves s 250 house would change only the reservation for the outlying areas from 02 of the overall ppropriation to 012 the provision of funds for outly ing areas is discussed below table 2 reservations and proposed reservations under current law s 250 senate and s 250

and s 250 house require 054 to be used for incentive grants assistance for outlying areas section 115 of the perkins act authorizes grants to the outlying areas16 hr 366 would increase the speci fied grant amounts as follows for guam an increase from 500000 to 660000 for american samoa an increase from 190000 to 350000 and for northern mariana islands an increase from 190000 to 350000 in addition specific grant for palau would be required of 16000017 under current law any additional funds are provided to the pacific regional educational laboratory prel for distribution to the outlying areas in the pacific s 250 house would eliminate prels par ticipation and require the secretary to distribute any remaining funds in equal pr oportions to american samoa guam andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32962crs9 18 s 250 senate would appear to continue to authorize funds for the republic of palau although the bill would remove it from the definition of outlying areas 19 under current law and the senate bill the techprep allotment provision simply cross references the basic state grant formulathe northern mariana islands s 250 sen ate keeps the same initial grant amounts as under current law and would continue to have additional funds flow through the prel18 native american programs sections 116 and 117 of the perkins act authorize funding for native american programs including programs for alas ka natives and nativ hawaiians and for tribally controlled postseconda ry vocational institutions neither s 250 house nor s 250 senate would make substantive changes to 116 currently two institutions receive gran ts under 117 united tribes technical college in north dakota and crownpoint institute of technology in new mexico the major changes s 250 house would make to this section involve expenses and indirect costs the house bill would per mit funds to be used for institutional support costs of the grant as well as for vocational and technical education programs for indian students the bill would also prohibit the secretary from using restricted indir ect cost rate for grants issued unde r this section finally the house bill would eliminate the requirement for th secretary to repor t on facilities needs this study which is required in current w has been completed s 250 senate would continue to require th is study and would require th at it be undertaken annually the senate bill like the house bill would prohibit the use of restricted indirect cost rate the senate bill would provide the opportunity for tribally controlled postsecondary vocational institutions to ppeal decisions on the determination of ineligibility for 117 grant and on the amount of the 117 grant before an administrative law judge finally the senate bill but not the house bill would authorize 10 million to be appropriated for fy2006 nd such sums as may be necessary for subsequent years state allotment formula under current law basic state grant funds19 are allotted based on states proportional shares of three population gr oups individuals ages 15 to 19 20 to 24 and 25 to 65 in addition the formula ad justs allotments based on states per capita income pci such that states with lowerthanaverage pcis receive somewhat larger grants and those with above average pcis receive somewhat reduced grants in addition certain minimum grant and hold rmless provisions ar applied assuming that funds are sufficient to meet these provisions the minimum grant provision provides that state shall receive gr ant less than 05 of the overall amount allotted to states however this minimum amount is limited so that state as result of the minimum grant provision receive s an allotment that is more than 150httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32962crs10 20 this amount is calculated by dividing the total amount allotted to states by the total us population ages 15 to 65 21 the senate bill would eliminate the require ment that allotment may be more than 150 of the national average per pupil payment times the number of individuals in the state ages 15 to 65of the national average per pupil payment20 times the number of individuals in the state ages 15 to 65 at current appropria tion levels the minimum grant is about 04 of the total allotment finally states ar held harmless at their fy1998 grant level that is assuming funds are sufficient states grant will be less than what it received for fy1998 both the house and senate bills would keep the basic structure of this formula intact however each bill would make cer tain alterations since s 250 house would repeal the techprep program and llot funds through one state formula it would change the hold harmless provision fro m one based on basic state grants only to hold harmless based on states combined allotment from the basic state grants program and techprep for fy2005 the nate bill would change the minimum grant provision the b ill would remove current constraints on the 05 minimum grant21 and provide for 100 hold harmless based on states prior year grant through fy2008 for fy2009 through fy2011 s 250 senate would provide hold harmless based on 95 of states prior year grant based on crs analysis of estimated allotments from the us department of education ed it would appear that ed would interpret the senate bill language as follows money in addition to the amount appropriated for fy2005 new money would first be distributed to states below the 05 minimum grant in proportion to how much they needed to achieve the 05 minimum in other words states with initial grants that were further from 05 of the total state allotment would recei ve more funds than states with initial grants that were nearly at the 05 of th total state allotment other states would receive their hold harmless amounts until all states received at least the 05 minimum grant table 3 compares estimated fy2005 state allotments under current law to estimated allotments under the two proposed formulas using the s 250 house fy2006 authorization of 1307 billion while the allotments for both bills were calculated using the same amount differen ces between the two bills would result in slightly more money reaching the states under the senate bill in combining the basic state grants with the techprep pr ogram grants s 250 house would subject the techprep portion of those funds to taside requirements under current law and under the senate bill techprep is not subject to set asides eg funds for outlying areas s 250 house would also reduce the percentage of funds going to the outlying areas from 020 to 012 despite this decrease the net effect of combining the two perkins programs would result in slightly more funds being used for setasides than would be used under current law or s 250 senate s 250 senate would preserve the current setaside percentages and applies them only to the basic state grants program as result of these differences in the two bills table 3 shows 1279 billion being allotted to states under s 250 house and 1280 billion under s 250 senatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32962crs11 22 for fy2005 techprep grants accounted for 81 of the total funding allotted for basic state grants and techprep grants the same percentage was used to determine how much funding s hould be allotted for techprep grants under s 250 senate using the s 250 house

programs combined based on data available from ed column 3 provides the estimated total amount of f unding states would receive under s 250 house at the proposed fy2006 authoriza tion level of 1307

grants and tech prep combined states would receive under s 250 senate at the fy2006 authoriza tion level proposed in s 250 house unlike s 250 house s 250 would preserve the basic state grants program

follows under s 250 house if state reserved 250000 rather than 2 for administra tion there would long er be 10 of state funds available for state leadership if the am ount still available for state leadership was less than the amount for state leadership in fy 2005 the state may reserve the same percentage of funds for state leadership as were rese rved in fy2005 the additional funds would be taken from the funding designated for local recipientswithinstate allocation section 112 of the perkins act specifies how states are to allocate their basic state grant with respect to local activities state leadership and state administration in general current law requires states to distribute at least 85 of their grants to local recipients while permitting them to reserve up to 10 for statewide leadership activities such as professional development and program assessment and up to 5 for state administration the s 250 house proportions would be at least 88 for local recipients up to 10 for leadership and up to 2 for administration the s 250 senate proportions would be at least 85 for local reci pients and up to combined 15 for leadership and administration table 4 which compares these provisions in current law with those in the two bills shows that there are certain complexities within these distributions for example under current law state may reserve the greater of 5 or 250000 for state administration if state chooses to reserve 250000 for state administration because that amount is more than 5 of its grant it must reduce how much it reserves for statewide activities because it mu st allocate at least 85 of its grant to local recipients under s 250 senate state may reserve the greater of 15 or 750000 for state administration and leader ship state that would choose to reserve 750000 would apparently be able to allocate less than 85 of its grant to local recipients somewhat similarly s 250 house would permit states to reduce the amount required to be allocated to local recipients ordinarily 88 of the total grant if the amount availabl for state leadership ordinarily 10 of the total grant was less than the amount allocated for fy200524 current law and both bills permit states to target up to 10 of local funds for specified local recipients both bills preserve currentlaw categories of recipients in rural areas and recipients with high per centages or

reauthorization pl 105332 the senate bill would add two uses of these targeted funds for innovative statewide activities and for developing and implementing career pathways or clusters current law

s 250 house requires the same amount of funding to be allocated for techprep activities as was allocated for the techprep program in fy2005 there is provision in the bill to increase the amount of funding allocated for techprep activities over time section 135b3 provides details on the required use of funds for techprep activities by eligible recipientsboth s 250 house and s 250 senate would maintain most of these required and permitted uses in some cases with certain alterations for example the house bill would add meeting teacher certification or licensing requirements especially in core subjects as defined under esea under the required us of leadership funds for professional development the senate bill for example would add encouraging lifelong learning under the required use rela ted to technology in addition both bills would require leadership funds to be us ed for technical assi stance which is permitted use of state leader ship funds under current law finally both bills would add to the list of permitted uses of state leadership funds both bills would permit these funds to be used to facilitate the transition of subbaccalaureate career and technical education students into baccalaureate degree programs in addition the house bill but not the senate b ill would permit funds to be used to support entreprene urship education and training techprep program current law authorizes separate st ate grant program to support techprep programs these programs aim at articul ating vocational and academic course work in the last two years of high school with vocational and academic course work at the postsecondary level s 250 house would eliminate separate state grant program for techprep however the bill would still require states and local grant recipients to spend some of their perkins grant funds on techprep activities26 such activities would be similar to current techprep programs with certain changes for example s 250 house crossreferences 1111 of esea regarding academic standards for the high school students particip ating in techprep programs s 250 senate would continue separa tely authorized techprep program with relatively minor changes for example the bill would modify the aim of the program to provide preparation and placement in high skill high wage or high demand occupations current law aims at preparation for specified careers in technical fields such as engineering technology nd applied science as well as careers in agriculture and health occupations and is to lead to an associates degree or postsecondary certificate in specific career field s 250 senate would specify that the high school component of the program have common core of technical skills and core academic subjects and higher education component that would lead to technical skill proficiency credential certificate or degree in specific career field the senate bill would broaden program requirement from providing inservice training specifically for teachers to inservice professional development specifically for principals faculty and administrators as well as for teachers s 250 senate would elimin ate

section 114 of the perkins act author izes certain national programs and activities such as nati onal assessment of vocationa l education research and dissemination s 250 house and s 250 s enate would make certain technical changes to this section for example the house bill would replace references to research wherever it occurs with scientif ically based research the senate bill would replace vocational with career everywhere it appears in this section both bills would continue to require the secretary to collect performance data on vocational education s 250 senate would add requirements that performance data be disaggregated by special populations for posts econdary institutions and by categories required under esea and special populations for secondary institutions28 both bills would continue to require an independent evaluation and assessment of programs under this act but would make various changes for example each bill would require somewhat different membership on the independent advisory panel which advises the secretary on the assessment in addition each bill would have somewhat different requirements for the cont ents of the assessment current law authorizes the secretary to establish national center or centers to conduct research on vocationa l education and to disseminate findings both bills would continue this authority however s 250 senate would authorize one center while s 250 house would continue to authorize one or more centers29 in addition each bill would establish somewhat differe nt research agendas for the center or centers finally s 250 senate would re quire an independent governing board for the center which would ensure that the research and dissemination activities carried out by the center are coordinated with the research activities carried out by the secretary while s 250 house would continue au thorization for demonstrations and dissemination of results it would drop the re quirement of demonstration partnerships between postsecondary institutions and cer tain groups such as local educational organizations and volunteer groups s 250 senate would continue this provision30httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32962crs19 30 continued postsecondary institution local public educa tion organizations and other entities such as business to provide programs related to emerging as well as established professions and for retraining certain personnel such as grant workers and individuals displaced from employment due to corporate or military restructuring 31 under current law and the senate bill this setaside comes only from appropriations for the basic state grants program not from the techprep appropriation under the house bill this setaside would come from the appropriati on for the single state grant that the house bill would authorizeas noted above the two bills like current law would require setaside of 054 from total stategrants appropriations31 for incentive grants current law authorizes these funds for carrying out 503 of pl 105220 the workforce investment act wia for fy2000 through fy2003 s 250 senate would simply update the fiscal years for this provi sion to fy2006 through fy2011 and continue to authorize funding for 503 of wia s 250 house would add authority for the secretary of education to award incentive grants to states it would separate the perkins incentive grant funds from the incentive grant funds authorized by wia the house bill would add to the perkins act factors the secretary could consider in awarding incentive grants whether the eligible agency has successfully developed connections between secondary and postsec ondary vocational education and whether such agency has integrated rigorous and challenging academic and technical coursework performance on wia progra ms would longer be considered in making awards finally s 250 house w ould specify that these grants could be used to supplem ent activities authorized under 124 related to state leadership activities see discussion above occupational and employment information section 118 of the perkins act authorizes the secretary to provide assistance and funding to statedesignated entities th at collect and disseminate occupational and employment information these entities are jointly designated in each state by the governor and the state agency that ove rsees vocational and technical education s 250 would include state application pro cess that would require states to provide in addition to information required by the secretary information based on labor market trends to inform program development and information onacademic content standards and student acade mic achievement standards adopted by the state as required by esea both bills would make alterations in authorized statelevel activities under 118 for example current w states that designated entities must provide programs to assist individuals to improve career and occupational decision making s 250 house would change this language to students and parents as appropriate and s 250 senate would substitute students and parents possible impact of such changes would be to target occupation and employment information programs rather than to make such programs available to the population in generalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32962crs20 32 under s 250 house the eligible agency continues to have the option

measured the final core indicator of performance at the secondary level in s 250 house would be nearly identical to an existing indicator except that it references nontraditional fields instead of nontrad itional training and employment s 250 senate would make similar change but would also include student participationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32962crs23 35 for more detailed discussion of accountability provisions under current law see crs report rl31747in and completion of career and technical education programs that lead to employment or selfemploym ent in nontraditional fields core indicators of performan ce for the postsecondary level as previously mentioned s 250 house w ould include four core indicators of performance for the postsecondary level wh ile s 250 senate would include five indicators for this level the bills core indicators of performance share some similarities for example both bills would require the eligible agency to develop measures for placement in military service or employment s 250 house would require the eligible agency to measure retention as well as placement in these two areas while s 250 senate would require measures for placemen t in apprenticeship programs both bills would include core indicator focused on student participation in and completion of career and technical ducation programs in nontraditional fields the senate bill however would focus on programs leading to employment or self employment in nontraditional fields or in high skill high wage high demand occupations or professions both bills would also require measures of retention in pos tsecondary education and transfers to bachelors degree prog rams s 250 house would also require measures for the attainment of an associ ates degree or postsecondary credential s 250 senate contains mo re specific list of the types of student attainment for which measures must be developed m easures must be developed for student attainment of technical sk ill proficiency an industry recognized credential certificate or degree this mirrors similar core indicator of performance for the secondary level that is included in s 250 s enate the senate bill unlike the house bill would not specify degree level fo r which attainment should be measured while other sections of s 250 house w ould permit the attainment of bachelors degree as an outcome of participation in vocational and technical education the accountability requirements do not specifically mention measuring bachelors degree attainment rather they focus on transfer s to bachelors degree programs but not on the actual attainment of said degree s 250 house would require student ttainment of challenging academic and vocational and technical skill proficiencies this is similar to the first core indicator in current law s 250 senate however takes different approach to student achievement linking achieve ment on technical assessmen ts and the attainment of career and technical skill prof iciencies with na tional recognized industry standards in instances where this is possible and appropriate35 s 250 senate includes fi fth core indicator of perfo rmance that is not part of current law or s 250 house the senate bill would require the eligible agency to develop measures of increases in ear nings if the data are availablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32962crs24 36 under current law there is sixth year for which agreements need to be established 37 with respect to this requirement substantial is not definedstateadjusted levels of performance as previously mentioned the eligible agency must determine how to measure each of the core indicators and establish performance levels for each these performance levels must then be negotiated with ed to develop the stateadjusted levels of performance while s 250 hous and s 250 senate would retain many of the elements of current law with respect to these issues several changes made to current law in both bills are discussed below with respect to the measurements used for each of the core indicators at the secondary and postsecondary levels s 250 house and s 250 senate would continue to require that m easures be quantifiable ie expressed as percentage or number they would also require that the state make progress in improving its performance on the indicators unlike current law however the house bill would require states to make continuous and substantial improveme nt and would specify that improvements must be made in stude nts academic and vocational and technical achievement s 250 sen ate would include s imilar addition requiring continuous and significant improvement in career and technical achievement of career and technical educa tion students including sp ecial populations neither substantial improvement in s 250 hous nor significant improvement in s 250 senate is defined by the respective bills the house bill does not specifically mention special populations under s 250 house and s 250 senate the process for establishing the state adjusted levels of performance would rema in largely unchanged the process for establishing agreement on state adjusted levels of performance for the first two years is identical to current law the process for establishing agreement on stateadjusted levels of performance for subsequent year s differs from current law in two ways first agreements would be established for the third through sixth program years under current law agreements are estab lished only through the fifth program year36 rather than reaching agreement on all subsequent years prior to the third year as required by current law agreement on the third and fourth pr ogram years would be reached before the third program year and agreement on the fifth and sixth program years would be reached prior to the fifth year second both bills would modify the factors that must be taken into account when establishing agreement on the state adjusted levels of performance current law requires an analysis of the extent to which the levels of performance prom ote continuous improvement on the core performance indicators s 250 house woul d expand this analysis to consider the extent to which the levels of perform ance promote continuous and substantial improvement on the core performance indicators37 s 250 senate would make similar modification changing conti nuous improvement to continuous and significant improvementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32962crs25 38 s 250 house would require eligible recipients receiving allotments under 111 to prepare an annual report section 111 provides allotments from the federal government to states it does not include disbursements to eligible recipients section 112 within state allocations includes information about provid ing funding to eligible recipients with respect to the annual report required of local recipients the proposed legislation may have intended to reference 112 131 or 132local levels of performance both s 250 house and s 250 senate w ould require eligible recipients to be accountable for localadjusted levels of performance on the core indicators of performance for the most part the proce ss by which adjusted levels of performance for core indicators of perform ance would be established at the local level mirrors the process at the state level except that the eligible recipient would negotiate with the eligible agency instead of ed the house bill would establish requirement that eligible recipients establish levels of performance for each of the core indicators in their local plans the senate bill would requi re eligible recipients to either accept the state adjusted levels of performance as their local levels or to negotiate directly with the state to establish their own caladjusted levels of performance similar to the state level local recipients would also have to establish levels of performance that are quantifiable s 250 house would also require eligible recipients to make continuous and substantial improve ment in student achievement while s 250 senate woul d require continuous and significant improvement both bills would require that in establishing agreement on the local adjusted levels of performance the eligible recipient and eligible agency must consider the performance of given eligible recipient with the performance of other eligible recipients taking into account va rious factors eg characteristics of the students served they would also have to consider the extent to which such levels of performance promote continuous and s ubstantial improveme nt s 250 house or continuous and significant impr ovement s 250 sen ate on the core performance indicators by the eligible recipi ent in addition similar to current law with respect to stateadjusted levels of performance both bills would allow an eligible recipient to ask to have the localadjusted levels of performance modified if unanticipated circumstances result in significant change in the factors taken into consideration when negotiating the adjusted performance levels reporting both bills would retain some of the reporting requirements contained in current law and add several new pr ovisions most notably with the addition of reporting requirements for eligible recipients u nder s 250 house each eligible recipient receiving an allotment under 111 must sub mit an annual report to the eligible agency describing its progress in meeting the localadjusted levels of performance on the core performance indicators as well as their progress in meeting these levels of performance on the core performance indicators with respect to techprep program participants if the local recipi ent receives funds for this purpose38 s 250 senate would require eligible recipients receiving an allocation under 131 to publicly report each year on its progress in meeting the localadjusted levels of performancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32962crs26 39 s 250 would require eligible recipients receiving allocations under 131 to provide annual reports section 131 distribution of f unds to secondary school programs focuses exclusively on allocations to local educational agencies thus assuming this section reference is correct it is unclear if an eligib recipient at the postsecondary education level would have to prepare report it should be noted that state currently allocates all its funds to the postsecondary education level us department of education office of the under secretary policy and program studies service national assessment of vocational education final report to congress 2004 40 data would have to be disaggregated by the groups described in 1111h1ci of the esea including race ethnicity gender disabil ity status migrant status english proficiency and status as economically disadvantagedon the core indicators of performance39 eligible agencies would not be required to report on performance with respect to techprep activities under either bill both bills would add new requirements regarding the dissagregation of data s 250 house would require both the eligible agency and eligible recipients to disaggregate data for each of the core performance indicators using categories of students specified in 1111b2cvii of the esea these categories include economically disadvantaged students st udents from major racialethnic groups students with disabilities and students with limited english proficiency in addition the eligible agency and eligible recipients would be required to identify and quantify any disparities or gaps in performance fo r specific category of students compared with overall student performance the eligible agency but not the eligible recipients would also be responsible for reporting data on special populations as defined under this act and the populations referenced in 1111h1ci of the esea40 this would include the populations referenced in 1111b2cvii of the esea as well as reporting data for students by gender and migrant status s 250 senate would not require data to be disaggregated in the aforementioned categories by eligible recipients eligible agencies however would be required to disaggregate data at the postsecondary levels for special populations and by gender at the secondary level data would have to be disaggregated by special populations and by the categories included in 1111h1ci of the esea neither the eligible agency nor eligible recipients would be required to report on disparities or gaps in performance among categories of students also in line with the esea neither bill would require data to be disaggregated if the number of students in partic ular category was too small to produce statistically reliable data or if the results would reveal personally identifiable information about an individual student data comparability current law provides states with flexibility to select performance measures most appropriate for meeting their goals this has resulted in mu ltitude of definitions and measurement strategies across states making statetostate data comparisonshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32962crs27 41 us department of education carl d perkins

retain ed in s 250 house and s 250 senate 43 it should be noted that the maximum setaside for local administration would remain at 5 and that the proposed increase in funds to the local level under the house bill from 85 to 88 would increase the amount upon which th 5 for local administration is based providing eligible recipients with additional funds to meet substantial new reporting

measures for academic and career and technical programs that build on existing stat and local data systems final report on this initiative however is not expected until fall 200542 s 250 senate contains language that may partially address the data comparability issue the senate bill requires that when identifying core indicators of performance and other indicators of perf ormance states shall to the extent possible define the indicators so that they are aligned with similar data collected for other federal and state programs the usefulness of this requirement however would depend upon how it is implemented by st ates for example if states looked to other states for definitions it could be that handful of states use one definition for measure while another group of states uses another defin ition this could become even more complicated if some st ates opt to use federal definitions for measures while other states used state definitions that do not match the federal definition similar problems could also evolve within states if local recipients were given similar levels of flexibility in developing their own measures of the core indicators of performance under the senate bill eligible recipients could either accept the stateadjusted levels of performance or negotiate with the state to develop local adjusted levels of performance the house bill would permit eligible recipients to develop levels of performan ce as appropriate for the eligible recipient it is possible that since all local recipients would be required to negotiate their performance indicators with the state the state would require all local recipients to use the same definitions for various meas ures this however is not specified in either s 250 house or s 250 senate without standard set of definitions however it could be difficult for states to determine how particular local recipient is performing relative to other local recipients funding for meeting acc ountability provisions as previously discussed s 250 house would reduce the percentage of funds available for state administration fro m 5 under current law to 2 while simultaneously increasing state adminis trative requirement s eg accountability requirements43 during floor debate on s 250 house representative woolseyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32962crs28 43 continued requirements it is not clear however

the bill rightly strengthens accountability for state and local purposes but at the same time it cuts by 60 percent the funds that states can use for that very purpose44 s 250 senate would combine funds set aside for state leadership and state administration at an amount not mo re than 15 of states allotment state provisions this section analyzes changes that would be made with respect to the state plan and improvement plans under th house and senate bills state plan current law requires states to submit state plan to receive funding under this act the plan must meet specific require ments eg cover fiveyear period and contain numerous elements with respect to the plan content that are specified in statutory language such as the programs that will be provided and how these activities will help the state meet or exceed its levels or performance how professional development will be provided and how activities will be evaluated under both the house and the senate bills the state plan would cover sixyear period rather than fiveyear period in current law both bills would increase the number of groups that must have an opport unity to comment on the state plan s 250 house or be consulted on its development s 250 h ouse and s 250 senate s 250 house and s 250 senate woul d also make numerous changes to the plan content for example under both b ills the plan content would be required to describe how the eligible agency will select eligible recipients s 250 house also requires the eligible agency to explain how it will report on the integration of rigorous and challenging academics in vocational and technical education programs to allow for the quality of the integration to be evaluated while the senate bill requires the eligible agency to explai n how funds would be used to develop new courses that meet state academic st andards adopted in response to esea requirements that will prepare students for high skill high wage or high demand occupations the senate bill but not the house bill would also require the state plan to address transitioning students from the subbaccalaureat level to the baccalaureate level and collaboration with other state institutions i nvolved in education eg state institutions the remainder of this section highlights changes made by s 250 house and s 250 senate with respect to model sequences of courses career pathways techprep and professional developmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32962crs29 model sequences of courses s 250 house would require the development of model sequences of c ourses for vocationalcareer and technical content areas under s 250 house thes sequences of cour ses would have to include both secondary and postsecondary education and include rigorous and challenging content in coordinated nonduplicative prog ression of courses the coordinated nonduplicative prog ression of courses is s imilar to requirements under the current techprep program the goal of participation in model sequences of courses under s 250 house would be to prepare students for postsecondary school success the sequence of cour ses would be required to lead to oneyear certificate associates or bachelors degree or prof iciency credential in conjunction with high school diploma career pathways the senate bill would require eligible agencies to support eligible recipients in developing or implementing career pathways designed to meet relevant workforce needs the state plan would have to desc ribe how the eligible agency would assist eligible recipients in developing articula tion agreements and in using labor market information to identify career pathways that will prepare students for high skill high wage high demand occupations eligible agencies would also be required to explain how they would publiciz the availability of career pathways they would also have to describe how th ey would work with business and industry and use industryrecognized standard s and assessments when appropriate techprep although s 250 house would eliminate separate techprep program it would require that the state pl an include provisions specifically focused on techprep activities the state plan would be required to describe how funds would be awarded by competition or fo rmula to support techprep activities how measurable sustainable and coordinated techprep activities would be carried out in the state how the plan would be veloped with input from various groups and organizations and how students would be prepared for postsecondary education or employment in highdemand occupations the techprep activities would have to include advanced academic and technical cour ses with at least two years of education at the secondary level prior to graduation and at least two years of postsecondary education or at least two year apprenticeship program professional development both bills would include substantial emphasis on professional deve lopment s 250 house would specify goals for professional development such as increasing the percentage of teachers that meet certification and licensing re quirements s 250 senate would include focus on teacher recruitment and retention and teacher training programs state and local improvement plans section 123 includes requirements for developing implementing and evaluating the implementation of improvement plans both the house and the senate bills would include new requireme nts related to local imp rovement plans but few substantial changes related to state improvement plans state improvement plans both bills would primarily make technical changes to the requirements for state pr ogram improvement with few exceptionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32962crs30 45 for more information see previous discussion on accountability requirements 46 these include not implementing an improvement plan when required failure to show improvement after one year of implementing an improvement plan or failing to meet the stateadjusted levels of performance for two or more consecutive years 47 eligible recipients have the option of adop ting the stateadjusted levels of performance as the localadjusted levels of performances 250 house would require that stat program improvement plans specifically address performance gaps between the categor ies of students for whom data must be disaggregated45 in addition the bill would allow eligible agencies to be penalized for failure to meet the purposes of this ac t in addition to other reasons for sanction in current law46 the senate bill does not include these changes rather the senate bill would modify one of the criteria leading to sanction current law states that the secretary may sanction an eligible agency for failing to meet the stateadjusted levels of performance for two or more consecutive years s 250 senate would alter this requirement to sanction eligible agencies if they fail to meet more than one of the stateadjusted levels of performance for two or more consecutive years local improvement plans both the house and the senate bills would make substantial changes to the requirements for local improvement plans under current law eligible agencies are required to assess the progress of each eligible recipient in achieving the stateadjusted levels of performance and to take various actions if an eligible recipi ent is not making substantial progress s 250 house and s 250 senate would require eligible r ecipients to be evaluated based on their progress in achieving localadjusted levels of performance rather than state adjusted levels of performance47 under both bills if local recipient is not making substantial progress in achieving these levels of performance the eligible agency would be required to take th ree actions each of the three actions is included in current law but both bills would modify them in different ways first the senate bill would require that as part of the assessment of the educational needs that the eligible recipient must address to overcome performance deficiencies the performance of special populations must specifically be in cluded in the assessment the house bill does not specifically mention special popula tions both bills would require that based on the results of the assessment the eligible agency must enter into an improvement plan with the eligible recipient to be implemented the first program year after the eligible recipient failed to meet performance requirements current law and both bills would require eligible agenci to consult with group of stakeholders in carrying out these actions s 250 senate would expand the group of stakeholders to include principa ls administrators and faculty the house bill would require additional actions to be taken if an eligible recipient was not making subs tantial progress s 250 hous would also require the eligible agency to take action if the evaluation of progress being made by the eligible recipient revealed persistent or widening of performance gaps between multiple categories of students for whom data must be disaggregated when compared with students overall the house bill would also require that the improvement plan agreement include strategies for professiona l development rather than requiring the consideration of professional development where necessary in addition the house bill would require the improvement plan to give special consideration to performancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32962crs31 gaps between the aforementioned categories of students the senate bill does not include these provisions s 250 house and s 250 senate w ould add new requirements for technical assistance sanctions for failure to perfo rm and the use of funds withheld from eligible recipients these requirements mirror the requirements established for eligible agencies with respect to state program improvement local plans and uses of funds all eligible recipients that want to r eceive funding must submit local plan to the eligible agency the eligible agency has some discretion over the contents of the local plan but current law s 250 hous and s 250 senate specify required items that must appear in the plan current law and the house and senate bills also indicate required and permissibl uses of funds by eligible recipients this section considers changes to local plans and the uses of funds that would be made by s 250 house and s 250 senate local plans both bills would make several changes to the requirements for local plans many of the changes would involve incor porating language used throughout each of the respective bills eg addi ng language about model quences of courses in the house bill and adding language about career pathways in the senate bill for example s 250 house and s 250 senate would both add requirement that local plans must describe how the eligible recipient will meet localadjusted levels of performance s 250 house would also requi re that the local plan describe how at least one of the model sequences of courses developed by the state will be offered while s 250 senate would require the elig ible recipient to explain how at least one career pathway will be offered the house bill would also require that rigorous and challenging academics be integrated with vocational and technical education programs in core academic subjects as fined by the esea the house bill would add new requirement focuse d on professional velopment s 250 senate would require eligible recipients to describe how career gu idance and academic counseling would be provided to all car eer and technical education students and include links to services provided through the onestop deliver system established by wia it would also require eligible recipients to describe how they would improve the recruitment and retention of career and technical education personnel including transitions from business and industry to teaching both bills would expand on the groups that must be involved in the development and implementa tion of vocational and tec hnical education programs that receive funding they would also re quire local plans to describe how activities will be provided to prepare special populations for highskill highwage jobs leading to selfsufficiencyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32962crs32 48 similar provision would be added to perm issible uses of state leadership funds under both s 250 senate and s 250 house s 250 house however does not contain similar provision on the permissible uses of local fundslocal uses of funds current law s 250 house and s 250 senate in clude provisions for the required and permissible uses of funds by eligible recipients both s 250 house and s 250 senate would make changes to the required and permissible uses of funds included in current law adding ne w uses and modifying existing provisions required uses of funds under current law eligible recipients are required to use funds for various purposes such as strengthening the academic and vocational and technical components of vocational nd technical programs conducting program evaluations and providing pr ofessional development both the house and senate bills would make changes to these uses of funds for example s 250 house would add language focused on using model sequences of courses ensuring learning in core academic subjects as defined by the esea increasing the focus on math and science education and requiring profe ssional development to be ba sed on scientifically based research the senate bill for example would add language focused on the use of career pathways addressing linkage s between secondary and postsecondary education and supporting ar ticulation agreements permissible uses of funds under current law eligible recipients may use funds for multiple purposes including provi ding career guidance and counseling and supporting mentoring services as with the required uses of funds both s 250 house and s 250 senate would make numerous changes to existing provisions for example the house bill would modify th allowable uses of funds for counseling to include the provision of informati on on the range of postsecondary options available and information for adult students in the process of changing careers or updating skills it would also allow funds used to develop new vocational and technical education courses to be used to develop mode l sequences of courses and dual enrollment opportunities s 250 house woul d allow funds to be used to support techprep activities and to train au tomotive technicians in new technologies such as alternative fuel automotive technolog ies both bills would allow funds to be used to support entrepreneursh ip education and training the senate bill for example would in clude provision to develop and support careerthemed learning comm unities and would add provi sion allowing funds to be used to support the transition of subb accalaureate career and technical education students into bachelors degree programs48 s 250 senate w ould specify that career guidance and academic counse ling be based on current bor market indicators and should result in impr oved graduation rates and provi information on postsecondary education and career options as well as providing assistance for postsecondary students including adult learners ch anging careers or updating their skills
