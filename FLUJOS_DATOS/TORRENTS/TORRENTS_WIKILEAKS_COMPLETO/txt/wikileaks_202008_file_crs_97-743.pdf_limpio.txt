issues updated april 25 2002 paul s wallace jr specialist in american public law american law divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97743federal cocaine sentencing legal issues summary the antidrug abuse act provided mandatory minimum sentences of imprisonment for possession with intent to distribute powder and crack cocaine in this statute congress established quantitative 100to1 sentence ratio between the two ie it takes 100 times as much powder cocaine as crack cocaine to trigger the same sentence under this distinction person convicted of possession with intent to distribute pound of powder cocaine 4536 grams would serve considerably less time in federal prison than one convicted of possession with intent to distribute 5 grams of crack the united states sentencing commission incorporated the ratio into its generally binding sentencing guidelines since enactment it has become apparent that the incidence of this sentencing differential falls disproportionately on africanamerican defendants the disparate impact has been attacked without great success on several judicial fronts equal protection and due process arguments have floundered on the finding that the distinction was not motivated by racial animus or discriminatory intent but rather was related to the legitimate government purpose of protecting the public against the greater dangers of crack cocaine thus far defendants have encountered similar difficulties proving the requisite corrupt motivation to establish selective prosecution or sentencing entrapment defenses further the federal appellate courts have found that the stiff minimum sentences for offenses involving crack cocaine are rational and not disproportionate to the seriousness of those offenses consequently they do not offend the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the eighth amendment and the courts have been more receptive to pleas to mitigate the disparate impact by departing from the severity of the sentencing guidelines instructed to study the situation the sentencing commission promulgated amendments that would equate crack and powder cocaine for sentencing purposes and recommended that congress drop the 100to1 ratio from its own mandatory penalties congress rejected both the amendments and the suggestion for equation but directed the commission to reexamine the issue and report back recommendations reflecting more moderate adjustments the commission subsequently recommended that the penalties be adjusted to ratio somewhere between 1to1 23 and 1to 15 the commission has made further recommendations legislative efforts to reduce or eliminate the disparity have thus far come to impasse over two issues 1 the appropriate ratio and 2 whether and to what extent crack penalties should be reduced or powder penalties enhanced to achieve the proper balancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97743contents background 1 the sentencing commission 2 rejection of initial recommendations by congress 3

widespread concern particularly because the use and sale of crack cocaine appear to follow racial line with the result that africanamericans are prosecuted more and subject to the more severe crack

of the concerns that led to the adoption of the 100to1 ratio by congress were based upon opinions that crack cocaine is intensely addictive it is causing crime to go up at tremendously increased rate the physiological effects of crack cocaine lead to higher rates of psychosis and death and because it is cheap it is available to broader and more vulnerable part of the population10 after examining the disparity in the sentencing issue the commission following public hearing on march 14 1995 voted 43 to eliminate the disparity between conditions of possession of crack and powder cocaine11 on may

defendants contend that the statutes which provide for the mandatory minimum sentences for crack cocaine and the federal sentencing guidelines are unconstitutional because they violate the equal protection component of the fifth amendment due process clause which causes disproportionate impact on minorities who are more likely to use crack cocaine than caucasians the dispositive question for

adverse effect upon racial minority it is unconstitutional under the equal protection clause only if that impact can be traced to discriminatory purpose24 thus far the challenges to the constitutionality of the 100 to1 ratio have not been very successful in the federal courts of appeals25 when challenging legislation such as the 100to1 sentencing disparity which on its face is not racially discriminatory two methods are available to raise an equal protection claim 1 there is an allegation of discriminatory intent by the plaintiff and if not alleged the rational basis standard will be used to review the challenged legislative scheme to determine whether it is rationally related to legitimate governmental purpose26 and 2 where the plaintiffs allege and demonstrate that the law was passed with discriminatory purpose the courts will review the challenged law under the demanding strict scrutiny standard27 applying this standard the federal courts generally have upheld the 100to1 quantity ratio by holding that congress and the commission had rational basis for mandating harsher penalties for crack cocaine as opposed to powder cocaine the distinction was not motivated by

relation to the object29 the gist of the due process challenges to the crack cocaine penalties has been that because crack and powder cocaine are chemically the same drug congress and the commission should not have enacted two different penalties the courts have rejected these challenges stating that even if crack and powder cocaine are derived from the same drug cocaine base is different drug from cocaine and because it is prepared for inhalation concentrates and magnifies the effect of one gram of cocaine to such degree that dealers profitably can sell it in very cheap yet stillpotent quantitieswhen cocaine is changed into cocaine base it becomes different chemical substance30 although the court in united states v singleterry31 rejected the due process challenge it urged those with the proper authority and institutional capacity not to become complacent stating that although the defendant has not established constitutional violation he has raised important questions about the

violate its prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment the circuits which have ruled on these challenges have generally upheld the stiff minimum sentences required by 21 usc 841b33 the analysis underlying these decisions is based on solem v helm34 which set out the following threeprong test for courts conducting an evaluation of whether the punishment is cruel and unusual under the eighth amendment the determination should be guided by objective criteria including i the gravity of the offense and the harshness of the penalty ii the sentences imposed on other criminals in the same jurisdiction and iii the sentences imposed for commission of the same crime in other jurisdictions35 the federal appellate courts which have applied the solem test have found that the stiff minimum sentences for offenses involving crack cocaine are rational and not disproportionate to the seriousness of those offenses for which congress concluded that there was need for severe penalty

only one white defendant was convicted for crack violations while 55 blacks and 1 hispanic were convicted during this period raises an inference that unconscious racism may have influenced the decision to severely punish blacks for violations involving their form of cocaine while hardly touching whites who utilize another form of the same drugboth are forms of cocaine39 in order to establish selective prosecution based on race the defendant must show discriminatory effect and purpose40 he also bears the burden of showing that others similarly situated have not been prosecuted41 statistical evidence alone which shows high percentage of africanamericans and hispanics being prosecuted for possession with the intent to distribute cocaine is not enough to establish selective prosecution42 in united states v armstrong 43 the supreme court decided that the defendant was not entitled to discovery on his selectiveprosecution claim because his study failed to identify

law enforcement officer would not purchase cocaine in powder form until it had been converted to crack the conversion could be accomplished by cooking the powder cocaine in microwave for few minutes consequently under federal law the defendant would have been sentenced for 120135 months for providing crack cocaine to the undercover agent as opposed to 60 months for powder cocaine the court in taking note of the inevitability of the situation said the agents purpose in causing the conversion was to expose the defendant to the more severe crack sentence in order to double the time she must spend in the penitentiary for the drug offenses the confluence of the mandatory statutory minimum the mandatory guidelines and the actions of the government agent if implemented would lead to an

maintained that the 12500 he had available for the drug deal would have enabled him to purchase on the open market only between onehalf and threequarters of kilogram of cocaine instead of the more than 50 kilograms attributed to him the appellate court held that the in excess of five kilograms of cocaine was properly attributed to him and the court was compelled to impose the statutory minimum sentence of 10 years imprisonment51 f departure from guideline sentencing levels upon motion by the prosecutor52 the court can depart from the sentencing guidelines when the defendant has provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of others who have committed an offense53 although the motion is made by the prosecutor the court will determine the extent of the reduction based upon variable relevant factors which are set forth in the sentencing commission manual54 section 3553e of title 18 gives the court the authority to impose sentence below level established by statute as the minimum sentence so as to reflect defendants substantial assistance in the investigat ion or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense55 however the determination of whether the defendants cooperation merits motion for reduction of sentence is within the sole discretion of the prosecution56httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97743crs11 56continued otherwise just sentence under

5865 crim l rep bna 2073 may 7 1997 available at wwwusscgov 59idthe question raised in melendez57 was whether government motion for departure from the sentencing guidelines is sufficient to authorize court to impose sentence beneath the statutory mandatory minimum even though the government has not filed motion under 18 usc 3553e the supreme court affirmed the decisions of the district court and the court of appeals for the third circuit and ruled that the defendant could receive suspension on part of his guidelines sentence of up to 14 years but he still had to serve at least the statutory minimum of 10 years the court indicated that trial judge could go below the statutory minimum to reflect defendants cooperation with the government if the prosecutors specifically made such request however this did not happen motion requesting departure from the guidelines but not mentioning the statutory minimum sentence is not sufficient to satisfy 3553es requirement of motion requesting departure from statutory minimum most recent commission recommendation as directed by section two of pl 10438 the us sentencing commission on april 29 1997 recommended narrowing the wide difference in federal sentences for trafficking in crack cocaine and powder cocaine in its report to congress we submit this report in compliance with the 1995 congressional directive that the sentence imposed for trafficking in quantity of crack cocaine should generally exceed the sentence imposed for trafficking in like quantity of powder cocaine58 the recommendation which would reduce the disparity rather than closing it altogether as previously recommended received the endorsement of the president although research and public policy may support somewhat higher penalties for crack than for powder cocaine 100to1 quantity ratio cannot be justified the commission said in its report the commission recommended that for crack cocaine congress raise the 5gram trigger for fiveyear mandatory sentence to somewhere between 25 and 75 grams for powder cocaine the commission said the 500gram threshold for the same sentence should be lowered to level between 125 and 375 grams59 the commission has made

reagan administration the drugfree federal workplace act of 198660 this proposal s 2849 would have provided several mandatory minimum sentences for drug trafficking offenses based on the quantity of the drug involved in the offense under the bill 500 grams of powder cocaine would have triggered 5year mandatory minimum while it would have taken 25 grams of crack to trigger the same 5year mandatory minimum this was 20to1 ratio of powder to crack cocaine ultimately congress passed and president reagan signed the omnibus anti drug abuse act of 1986 that set the current mandatory minimum sentences for various quantities of illegal drugs61 with respect to cocaine the law was amended to provide that 5year mandatory minimum sentence would be triggered by trafficking in only 5 grams of crack cocaine or by trafficking in 500 grams of powder cocaine 100to1 ratio62 10year mandatory minimum sentence was imposed for trafficking in 50 grams of crack or 5 kilograms of powder cocaine also 100to1 ratio63 in 1988 congress passed and president reagan signed into law the antidrug abuse act64 in addition to the mandatory minimum penalties enacted in 1986 for the trafficking in crack cocaine and other drugs this act added mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years for the simple possession of crack cocaine65 as data from the sentencing commission became available during the mid 1990s many federal and state officials began to doubt whether the 100to1 ratio between crack and powder cocaine continued to be justified in 1995 and 1997 the sentencing commission unanimously concluded that the crack to powder cocaine disparity was longer justified66 they also pointed out that the federal sentencing guidelines provide the criteria other than drug type to determine sentence lengths so that violent and dangerous dealers receive longer sentences congress rejected the recommendation which marked the first time it hadhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97743crs13 67see congress nixes amendments to sentencing

import and export act to eliminate mandatory minimum penalties relating to crack cocaine offenses hr 939 introduced by rep charles b rangel on march 3 1999 would essentially have the same effect as hr 1241 in the senate s 146 was introduced by senator spencer abraham on january 19 1999 introduced as the powder cocaine sentencing act of 1999 this bill would adjust the federal policy toward powder cocaine dealers by reducing from 500 to 50 grams the amount of powder cocaine person must be convicted of distributing in order to receive mandatory 5 year minimum sentence the bill also reduced the differential between the amount of powder and crack cocaine required to trigger mandatory minimum sentence from 100 to 1 to 10 to 1 this would be accomplished by making the ratio of powder cocaine the same as the ratio of crack cocaine for offenses involving the distribution of 50 grams see s 146 sec 2 sentencing for violations involving cocaine powder under current law person would have to distribute 500 grams of powder cocaine before receiving 5year mandatory minimum prison sentence whereas distribution of 5 grams of crack cocaine will cause to be imposed the same mandatory sentence on november 5 1999 senator spencer abraham introduced an amendment s amdt 2771 to s 625 sponsored by sen orrin hatch to overhaul bankruptcy laws to stiffen the federal penalty for the sale of powder cocaine for the purpose of bringing it closer to the penalty for selling crack cocaine 145 cong rec s14105 daily ed nov 5 1999 the measure would adjust and strengthen the sentence for powder cocaine by triggering the 5year minimum sentence with the sale of 50 grams this would narrow the sentencing disparity from the current 100 to 1 ratio down to 10 to 1 the amendment would also increase penalties for the sale of all illegal drugs to minors and for selling them near schools and other places where young people congregate it would also stiffen penalties for makers of methamphetamine 145 cong rec s14463 daily ed nov 10 1999 on november 10 1999 the senate agreed to the measure by vote of 5049 however it did not pass the house id at s14471done so since the establishment of the sentencing commission on october 30 1995 president clinton then followed congress and signed the rejection into law67 several bills were introduced in the house and senate in the 106th congress which would have equalized the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine68 these legislative efforts to eliminate the disparity have continued through the current congress in the 107th congress s 1874 was introduced by senator jeff sessions for himself and senator orrin hatch on december 20 2001 introduced as the drug sentencing act of 2001 the bill would among other things make two changes to the federal sentencing system for drug offenders first it would reduce the disparity in sentences for crack and powder cocaine from ratio of 100to1 to 20to1 it would do so by reducing the penalty for crack and increasing the penalty for powder cocaine second the bill would shift some of the sentencing emphasis from the drug quantity to the nature of the criminal conduct as well as the degree of the defendants involvement on february 14 2001 representative charles rangel introduced hr 697 which in effect would amend the controll ed substances act and the controlled substances import and export act to eliminate specific mandatory minimum penaltieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97743crs14 relating to crack cocaine offenses this would have the effect of lowering the penalties for crack offenses to those now imposed in powder cases on march 20 2002 hr 4026 was introduced by representatives roscoe g bartlett and referred to the house judiciary and house energy and commere committees introduced as the powdercrack cocaine penalty equalization act of 2002 the bill would amend the controlled substances import and export act to eliminate the disparity in sentencing between crack and powder cocaine with regard to trafficking possession importation and exportation of such substance by raising the applicable amounts for powder cocaine to those currently applicable to crack cocaine which is ratio of 100to1 overview critics of the current federal crack cocaine sentencing policies argue that the 100to1 quantity ratio is unfair and ineffective they claim it has led to harsher punishment of smalltime crack cocaine dealers than is imposed on more sophisticated powder cocaine dealers who are higher up in the same drug distribution chain they also argue that the crack penalties are unevenly applied to africanamericans especially in situations which depend upon whether they are prosecuted in state or federal court at every quantity level federal defendants convicted of trafficking in crack cocaine receive the same sentences as those who are convicted for trafficking in one hundred times as much powder cocaine thus far defendants have been largely unsuccessful in their challenges at the federal level minnesota v russell however is an example of successful challenge on the state level some of the concerns that led to the adoption of the 100to1 ratio by congress were based upon opinions that crack cocaine is intensely addictive it is causing crime to go up at tremendously increased rate the physiological effects of crack cocaine lead to higher rates of psychosis and death and because it is cheap it is available to broader and more vulnerable part of the population the proponents of the current cocaine sentencing policies also argue among other things that crack is very destructive in the africanamerican communities and the current policy will help those communities in their view the penalties are not racially biased and the fact that higher number of africanamericans is prosecuted for crack cocaine rather than powder cocaine simply reflects that more of them commit crack cocaine offenses the disparate treatment has been attacked without great success on several judicial fronts equal protection and due process arguments have floundered on the finding that the distinction was not motivated by racial animus or discriminatory intent but rather was related to the legitimate government purpose of protecting the public against the greater dangers of crack cocaine united states v stevens 19 f3d 93 97 2d cir 1994 thus far defendants have encountered similar difficulties proving the requisite corrupt motivation to establish selective prosecution or sentencing entrapment defenses moreover the federal appellate courts have found that the stiff minimum sentences for offenses involving crack cocaine are rational and not disproportionate to the seriousness of those offenses consequently they do not offend the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the eighth amendment and thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97743crs15 courts have been more receptive to pleas to mitigate the disparate impact by departing from the severity of the sentencing
