decl 04012019 tags elab econ eind pgov soci rs subject russian middle class not dead yet ref moscow 03242 2008 classified by econmincouns eric t schultz reasons 14 bd summary 1 c leading russian sociologists concur the gor missed the chance to invest in the middle class during the economic boom as result the middle class remains only approximately 20 percent of the population that said experts assert that the small middle class is nonetheless well positioned to weather the current crisis owing to its savings and human capital moreover they see the middle class less as revolutionary class than an inert mass inclined to support the administration neither sociologists nor the administration consider the middle class threat to the regime even in the throes of an economic downturn as such the government has decided to focus its anticrisis resources on bluecollar workers instead of providing the support and institutional reform needed for middle class development and ultimately the innovation economy that medvedev and putin advocate end summary middle class surviving but not thriving 2 u during last months annual conference on the sociopolitical challenges of the 21st century sponsored by the independent institute for social politics isp panels of sociologists and economists many of whom advise president medvedev said the russian middle class would survive the economic crisis but would not thrive igor yurgens of the institute for modern development opened the conference by underscoring the gors neglect of investment in the public and social institutions necessary to nurture the middle class during the eight year economic boom that coincided with prime minister putins presidency the opportunities provided by massive petrodollar inflows were now gone he stated owing to the governments failure to capitalize on these opportunities and the reversal in russias economic fortunes the vertical impetus for social mobility had stopped functioning 3 c xxxxxxxxxxxx further stressed the lack of quantitative middle class growth in spite of russias economic prosperity she used studies from 2000 and 2007 to demonstrate that the size of the middle class remained relatively constant at anywhere from 12 to 20 percent of the population by her estimate the core of the middle class was between 57 percent of the population although by lowering the income standards and the standard set for social and professional status the middle class would then range between 1220 percent of the population in her calculations the middle class was made up primarily of managers of large companies bank directors financial specialists business owners restaurants retail trade part of the intelligentsia and middle to highlevel bureaucrats the latter category had grown during the crisis owing to the slowdown in the private sector and she said now comprised about quarter of the middle class getting through the crisis 4 c during separate meeting with us xxxxxxxxxxxx claimed that the fall in real incomes not job losses was now the biggest threat to middle class prosperity xxxxxxxxxxxx estimated that middle class incomes would shrink this year by 10 to 15 percent with negative gdp growth rate of 35 percent in comparison middle class incomes dropped by 25 percent during the 1998 crisis she added that the core of the middle class had actually contracted slightly from 69 to 53 percent which she said was probably due to the fact that number of white collar workers bankers managers as well as small and medium sized entrepreneurs had fallen out of the middle class since the beginning of the crisis she contended however that the employment situation with the middle class had for the most part stabilized 5 c xxxxxxxxxxxx commented that the middle class had certain cushions which gave it an advantage over the blue collar or poorer classes during the crisis first of all many of the middle class had accumulated moscow 00000821 002 of 003 savings during the boom years comprising between seven to 10 percent of their total incomes or the equivalent of four or five monthly salaries between october 2008 and february 2009 they tended to take advantage of the gors gradual devaluation to purchase foreign exchange trade it for rubles and then purchase large consumer items and durables such as automobiles and refrigerators which were priced in rubles she said as of february however the middle class consumer binge had pretty much run its course owing to the decline in real incomes depletion of personal savings and persistent inflation not revolutionary 6 c despite claims by political activists like garry kasparov that the middle class will create problems for the administration when job cuts start and salaries freeze most sociologists here portray the middle class as conservative force rather than potentially disgruntled constituency eager to defend its interests xxxxxxxxxxxx argued the number of entrepreneurs within the middle class had not grown during the putin years he claimed virtually all of the growth had come instead from the rise of government bureaucrats who benefited from impressive pay increases under putin as result the mentality of the middle class has shifted considerably away from the more independent and marketoriented conceptions of the yeltsinera in which entrepreneurial types dominated 7 c during the putin era russia has developed what xxxxxxxxxxxx termed third world middle class with conservative mentality shaped by hierarchical thinking and largely risk averse indeed according to his research the core of the middle class has now absorbed much of the bureaucratic worldview of the majority this explains the broad support for putin and medvedev across society the power of social conservative values and reluctance to challenge authority 8 c paradoxically russias youthful middle class is more western in its lifestyle but still very antiwestern in its politics according to xxxxxxxxxxxx she sees russias young social innovators her company eschews the term middle class as too controversial as characterized by more western lifestyle including the willingness to take bank loans use the internet pay for fitness centers etc their better education makes them mentally more flexible but does not make them more politically liberal far from afraid of the economic downturn most are confident that their abilities allow them to reinvent themselves and adapt to challenges 9 c xxxxxxxxxxxx commented to us that todays youth are firmly indoctrinated in patriotic mindset that blames the us and the west for much of russias ills they remain largely apolitical but more attuned to the interests of the state rather than the rights and opportunities of the individual as such he sees russias youth as more inclined to rally in defense of the state than to agitate for revolutionary change middle class well positioned but lacks support 10 c that said xxxxxxxxxxxx and xxxxxxxxxxxx told us in separate meetings that the middle class still had the best chance of stimulating russias development in the postcrisis world it had invested more in its own human capital education and training during the high growth years whereas the lower socioeconomic strata used most of their newfound cash to purchase basic consumer items in addition the middle class had acquired work experience and professional skills enabling them to adapt to shifts in labor market demand bluecollar households in contrast were suffering disproportionately from inflation downsizing and salary reductions xxxxxxxxxxxx concluded the middle class would be the best candidate for supporting collaboration between the state society and private sector to address russias economic problems 11 u however these analysts pointed out that the gors focus on bluecollar workers in its anticrisis measures had moscow 00000821 003 of 003 deprived the middle class of resources and opportunities to stimulate growth or reform according to tambovtsev the main hope for middle class to play transitional role in society lay in small business entrepreneurship unfortunately the absence of secure property and contract rights biased judiciary and administrative barriers impeded sme growth falling consumption was also hurting smes which tended to orient themselves toward household consumers without the resources and institutional reforms necessary to improve their productivity middle class entrepreneurs were unlikely to serve as strong countermeasure to current economic trends comment 12 c while not dead the russian middle class does not show signs of rapid growth in the near term nor does it seem likely to be the engine of democratic change in russia better equipped to deal with the downturn than the working classes but politically inert the middle class poses little threat to political and social stability moreover despite the administrations emphasis on preparing for postcrisis development through innovation and smallmedium businesses the most likely candidate to help the government achieve those aims the middle class has largely been ignored by the state we expect this process to continue budget constraints will leave minimal resources for cultivating the human capital of the middle class end comment beyrle
