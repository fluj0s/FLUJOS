bridge publications inc newsletter apr 16 2008 the three component parts of theta its restraint in other words its telling the person that he has right to conquer the physical universe its denying him part of the mission of life and denying him part in of groups missions in conquering the physical universe that drives him down disassociates him from his fellows and that finally will put him in an aberrated state you put him into too much of an aberrated state about that life will then start removing him this is the cycle on which life might be said to be engaged this cycle of he comes up here till hes effective then he can longer affect the physical universe around him on out but this can happen at any point in the career the age of the organism should not be postulated on how many years this organisms got to go because that will only tell you what will be his usual his physical decay if other factors enter you take into consideration this fact of at that time when he ceases to be able to adequately effect change or conquest of the physical universe around him he will then decline rapidly and die l ron hubbard excerpted from the special course in human evaluation lectures by l ron hubbard rehabilitating mans conquest of the physical universe an article by l ron hubbard from the special course in human evaluation lectures man ceases to postulate desirable futures in other words ceases to dream in direct ratio that the physical universe has proven itself antipathetic toward him and that other lifeforms have proven themselves antipathetic toward him in other words he ceases to dream and postulate large vast desirable survival goals just in the ratio that he begins to drop away from the purest purpose of life he starts to single himself off into an individuality he begins to fall back the second he does that and the further he goes actually the more and more dangerous he is to other lifeforms he becomes dangerous to those lifeforms because he is not in full cooperation with them and has individualized to point you might say i am using that word individualized he is actually withdrawn to himself so that hes detached himself from the main regiment hes become johnnyoutofstep and he is not going to be able to do as much to the physical universe as before those vast dreams were burst now he starts then when he falls away from his you might say his brotherhood with the physical universe and with man his brotherhood with other men with other lifeforms and his attack on the physical universe and his uniting with it when he falls away from these things he has lost his directional thrust his goal starts to glimmer little bit waver hes not quite able to cite exactly what hes doing he will begin to strike indiscriminately he does not recognize his interdependence with other lifeforms and he may start striking out indiscriminately to quote protect himself to destroy things that are evil that arent evil to do all sorts of strange things and he becomes dangerous because hes not lined up with the primary goal so life will do away with him and life will put him on the chute you go down here and look in the jail if you dont believe there are people down there who are arsonists well theyve lost their target so they say well im supposed to have something to do with the physical universe and i dont know what the physical universe is and i supposed to become dangerous to something and im im im perfectly sane i i know because i im so lets burn down this house thats good burns down the house now with dianetics you can straighten out and realign this person you dont even have to go in on the case and tell the fellow now what youre trying to do is conquer the physical universe now youd better line yourself up with the rest of the lifeforms around you and youd better tackle this thing or youll know the reason why you dont do that you just start knocking out all the physical pain that he has suffered in former attacks on the physical universe and from other organisms and you just knock this stuff out and hell come back up more or less automatically into alignment with his purpose and hell keep on going but when hes hit
