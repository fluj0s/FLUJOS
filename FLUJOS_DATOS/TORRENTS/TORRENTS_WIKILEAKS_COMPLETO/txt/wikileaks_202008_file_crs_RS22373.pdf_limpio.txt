international governmental and nongovernmental agencies to address mutual concerns ongoing discussions of 1000ship navy continue the name itself captures the scope of the effort the concept is not actually about having 1000 international ships at sea rather it is more about capabilities such as speed agility and adaptability membership in this navy is purely voluntary and has legal or
