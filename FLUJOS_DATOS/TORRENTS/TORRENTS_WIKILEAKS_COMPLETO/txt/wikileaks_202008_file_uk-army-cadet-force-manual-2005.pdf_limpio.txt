general 1 this manual supersedes the army cadet force acf manual 1999 it forms the regulations for the acf and in addition contains factual information policy statem ents and administrative instructions 2 by its nature the manual is handbook for use by all ofﬁ cers and adult instruct ors in the acf and for those who are in any way responsible for the smooth management nd functioning of the acf 3 where cases of conﬂ ict occur between any provision of the manual and those of ny primary source document the decisions of the authority responsible for the latter are to prevail 4 any conﬂ icts or queries in the interpretation of the provisions of the manual shoul d be referred in the ﬁ rst instance to cadets otc branch headquarters regional f orces at headquarters land command 5 ofﬁ cers and adult instructors are expected to interpret the army cadet force manual reasonably and intelligently with due regard to the interests of the army cadet force bearing in mind that attempt has been made to provide for necessary and self vident exceptions 6 throughout the manual the terms ofﬁ cers adult instructors and cadets should be taken t refer to both sexes as the case may be so as to avoid the repetitious use of he she his hers etc the male gender only has been used in the text except in special instances b the term ʻcountyʼ is used for an acf commanded by an acf cadet commandant throughout notwithstanding those rfca areas where the terms ʻbattalionʼ and ʻsector ʼ are used c the term ʻareaʼ is used to denote the level of command commanded by ma jor and for which the terms ʻcompanyʼ or ʻgroupʼ can also be used primacy of sources 7 chapter 4 of the manual which is concerned with terms and conditions of service affecting acf ofﬁ cers derives its authority from the reserve forces act rritorial army regulations and queenʼs regulations chapter 5 deals with the terms and conditi ons of service of adult instructors the legal status of these members of the army cadet force ac 14233 the army cadet force manual ii 2005 editionis exceptional and for that reason these volunteers are not covered by any other regula tions issued by the ministry of defence chapter 5 therefore is to be regarded as the pri authority on this subject abbreviations 8 abbreviated words and acronyms form part of the everyday language of any organization and many are used in this manual although it is sensible conve ntion for new or uncommon abbreviations to be fully expanded when they are introduced into document it is natural for many authors to assume that their readers will unde rstand the more common abbreviations they use many acf readers may be unused to some of the abbreviations commonly appearing in military documents similarly some army re aders may not be aware of some of the abbreviations used in the acf and in the voluntary sector for ease of reference glossary of abbreviations is included in this manual after chapter 20 9 although the majority of abbreviations used in this manual are explained or expanded the ﬁ rst time they appear in the text readers may come across them w hile referring to subjects later in particular chapter so for ease of reference at part 1 of the glossary is consolidated list of abbreviations occurring in this manual omitted from the list are certain specialized terms whose scope of use is limited to few pa ges of the manual and whose deﬁ nitions may therefore readily be found it should be noted that some acronyms nra for example may have more than one meaning depending on its context 10 users of this manual may also ﬁ nd themselves referring to documents which have been written assuming general knowledge of military abbreviations they will need short glossary of such abbreviations some readers may also wish to write conci notes to be read and understood by others in the acf or in the army they need short list of abbreviations they could use to meet both those needs short glossary of mili tary abbreviations is at part 2 of

support to wider government youth activities is their support t the army cadet force acf in line with mod youth policy 2 as the acf has evolved it has depended for support upon three separate and distinct organisations which protect its unique status as uniformed youth movement the are hq land which provides mod policy advice from drfc resources including ﬁnancial support and military activity and command function through the regional brigades b the army cadet force association acfa which acts as the guardians of t he youth movement ethos and provides the nonmilitary aspects of acf activities c the reserve forces and cadets associations rfcas who provide the full time permanent staff accommodation and administrative support the links into the loc community and who are responsible for the regional marketing of the acf 3 army recruiting although encouraging members of the acf to join the army is an important role of the acf recruiting for the army is biproduct rather than core role of the acf more intrusive recruiting regime could alienate schools pare nts and gatekeepers and many of the volunteer adults who join the acf however introducing cadets to military activities at an early age encourages substanti number of cadets to join the army regular and territorial and experience shows that they tend to be m ore committed than recruits with cadet background 4 acf marketing the acf is not particularly wellrecognised youth movement nationally when compared with other voluntary youth organisations such as the scouts and guides there is therefore need to keep the acf in the public eye if i t is to be able to attract both cadets and adult instructors currently cadetsʼ numbers are at historically high level but there is signiﬁcant and increasing shortfall of quality adult instructors to correct this shortfall will pose signiﬁcant challenges at both national and regional levels 5 hq recruiting group in order to improve the ability of the acf

and standards extracted from values and standards of the british army ac 63812 and ac 61813 commanderʼs edition in the form of guidance for acf adults introduction 1 the british army has reputation second to none based largely on its ﬁghting s pirit and on the high standards of professionalism behaviour and self discipline that britis h soldiers have consistently displayed the army depends on team work which comes from demanding training strong leadership comradeship and trust such trust can only exist on the basis of shared values the maintenance of high standards and the personal com mitment of every individual to the task the team the organisation and the nation 2 in line with its charter as national voluntary youth organisation this trust forms the basis of the ethos of the army cadet force and every adult by joining the acf has duty to develop such trust and to uphold the core values shown below core values 3 selﬂess commitment personal commitment is the foundation of service you must be prepared to serve when you are required and to do your best at all times this means that you put the needs of others ahead of your own interests 4 courage you must have the morale courage to do always what is right 5 discipline to be effective the acf must be disciplined the best form of discipline is selfdiscipline only that will earn you the trust and respe ct of your comrades and the cadets and equip you to cope with the difﬁcult individual decisions that you will have to make during your service with the acf 6 integrity integrity involves honesty sincerity reliability and unselﬁshness it is an essential requirement of both leadership and comradeship unless you maintai n your integrity others will not trust you and teamwork will suffer integrity somet imes requires you to show moral courage because your decisions may not always be popular but it will always earn you respect 7 loyalty the nation and the acf rely on your commitment and support you must therefore always be loyal to your commanders comrades and your duty if you are not you will be letting others downac 14233 the army cadet force manual 1m2 2005 edition8 respect for others as an adult in the acf you have exceptional responsibility of leading supervising and training young people it is particularly important that you show the greatest respect tolerance and compassion for others because comrades hip and leadership depend on it 9 adherence to law all members of the acf whether cadets or adults are subject to the civil law and have duty to uphold it in that respect they are differe nt from other citizens such laws establish the baseline for the standards of personal c onduct of members of the acf as citizens ofﬁcers in the acf receive ta general l ist section b ta gl sect b commission and are therefore subject to military law 10 avoid any activity which undermines your professional ability or puts others at risk in particular the misuse of drugs and abuse of alcohol b any behaviour which damages trust and respect between you and others in your team and the county area and detachment such as deceit or social misc onduct in particular you must not commit any form of harassment bullying or discrimination whether on grounds of race gender sexual orientation or any other behaviour that could undermine good order and discipline ultimately you must always measure your conduct against the following test have your actions or behaviour adversely impacted or are they likely to impact on the efﬁciency or effectiveness of the army cadet force 11 duty of care see also chapter 2 those of you in positions of authority at whatever level have duty of care towards your subordinates and cadets looking after their interests and ensuring that they fully understand what is expected of them this duty of care extends to ensuring that those individuals who raise concerns have their c omplaint deal with in thorough and timely manner application 12 you will receive further instructions in your county on the values and standards in the acf if you are uncertain or unclear about what is expected of you you should ask your commander the challenges you will face as an adult in the acf will test you and the team that you work with that is why your commitment to these values and standards is essential 13 the values and standards described above should be understood and embraced by all members of the acf and explained to those wishing to join the organisation by s elﬂessly dedicating themselves to the cadets under their command and by attending evenings and weekends with their counties and detachments acf adults already show com mitment to the youth of this country that far exceeds that of most of the populationac 14233 the army cadet force manual 2005 edition 1m3 reverse blankconclusion 14 all adults joining the acf are required to commit themselves to achievi ng and maintaining values and standards which are in some respects different from and more demanding than those which apply in society at large 15 this commitment is needed to underpin the ethos of the acf and thereby contribute s directly to the maintenance of its effectiveness as national volunta ry youth organisation and to the leadership and comradeship that together are so essential to the maintenance of morale 16 it is therefore the duty of commanders at all levels to ensure that these values and standards are accorded the highest priority are fully explained to those under the ir command and are applied consistently 17 commanders must themselves lead

2 duty of care guidelines for acf adults general 2001 the welfare and safety of cadets is both function of command and an individual responsibility the senior adult in the acf at every level has overall res ponsibility for the welfare and safety of everyone involved while every individual adult is personall responsible for their own actions and for the welfare and safety of the cadets ent rusted to their care the welfare and safety of cadets must be the paramount considera tion at all times and in all circumstances 2002 while the acf as an organisation and the army as its sponsor have ge neral responsibility in law for the actions of all acf members legislation now pl aces greater degree of legal responsibility than before on each individual entrusted with the ca re of children in the acf this applies equally to ofﬁcers adult instructors and civi lian assistants of whatever rank appointment qualiﬁcation or experience any acf adult who fails t observe proper duty of care to cadets in their charge may well be in breach of the law and liable to court action and is likely to be in breach of the accepted code of practice in the acf as expressed in these guidelines and subject to possible discipli nary action or dismissal 2003 the principal legislation governing duty of care in relation to children is the children act 1989 which confers certain rights upon children and obligations on adults entrusted with their care in law child is deﬁned as person below the minimum school leaving age and young person as between the minimum school leaving age and the age of eighteen years cadets over the age of eighteen years while remaining subject to the rules and conventions applied to cadets within the acf are adults in the eyes of t he law and are subject when they are in charge of other cadets to the same duty of care obli gations as are adults in these guidelines therefore an adult is deﬁned as anyone over the age of eighteen years 2004 these guidelines lay down the responsibilities of acf adults some responsi bilities are clearly deﬁned legal obligations while others are rules and conventions appropri ate to the acf all are framed to protect acf adults and the children and young people i n their care from the consequences of actions that may cause injury or adversely affect the rights or welfare of others adults who adhere to these guidelines and to any other instruct ions with which they are properly issued may be conﬁdent that they are discharging their duty of care towards their cadets the cadet training safety precautions pamphlet jsp 535 is the principal document within the acf that is issued to every adult leader in ccordance with these guidelines and lays down the safety rules governing all ofﬁcial acf act ivities other documents pertaining to the acf such as the land command directive for safety health environmental protection and fire shef for the acf and ccf security instructions for cadet forces landso 2901 and training pamphlets also contain guidance and regulat ion on safety responsibilities that are to be followed by acf adults however publication of this nature can cover every combination of circumstances that may be encountere d ac 14233 the army cadet force manual 22 2005 editionthere will be occasions when only common sense and experience can guide individua ls bearing in mind that the safety and welfare of cadets must come ﬁrst at all times 2005 acf cadet commandants are to ensure that their acf adults are familiar w ith these guidelines standing orders should be produced to compliment these guidelines and cover any circumstances or conditions peculiar to an acf county training in sa fety and duty of care is essential for all adults joining the acf many of whom may have little comprehension of the burden of personal responsibility in law that they will be ass uming mandatory training based on these guidelines is to be included by each acf county in all adult induction and initial training courses given to adult leaders and cadet commandant s are to provide refresher training for all adult leaders which is to include an annua l test on the safety rules contained in jsp 535 and any other test that they may speci fy training in safety and duty of care is also to be included in each appropriate acf course run at the cadet training centre child abuse 2006 all adult leaders in the acf must know what to do if they believe ca det is being physically or sexually abused or if someone tells them that this is happening even if the alleged offence is taking place outside the acf they still have duty t act child abuse is term used to describe the situation where someone causes some form of harm to person under the age of eighteen the abuser is usually someone more powerful than the young person being abused often the abuser is an adult but it can be another young person abuse happens when someone either deliberately inﬂicts harm on child or does nothing to prevent child being harmed annex describes various types of child abuse that may be inﬂicted on cadets and contains guide on what to do and what not to do if n incident of alleged abuse is reported to an adult or if an adult believes that an offenc may have taken or may be taking place any such incident may be reported in the ﬁrst ins tance to the cadetʼs detachment or area commander as appropriate but must also be re ported to the ceo as quickly as possible it must be remembered that it is the interest of the cadet concerned that is of key concern and not that of the mod the acf or any other body 2007 adults must ensure that they and anyone under their command do not place themselves in situation from which an allegation of physical or sexual abus might arise adult supervision of cadets 2008 all cadet activities are to be supervised by suitably qualiﬁed and authori sed adults when female cadets are participating female adult is to be present an acf adult is to accompany cadets whenever they are attached to or supervised by any other individual or organisation other than when cadet is engaged on an individual and authorised ca det in the community project or attending an authorised course individually with the permi ssion of hisher parent or guardian it is the responsibility of the acf adult accompanying cadets to ensure that instruction and supervision given to cadets by individuals from another ac 14233 the army cadet force manual 2005 edition 23organisation including the regular army and ta is conducted in accordance with acf regulations practices and safety guidelines cadet under the age of eightee n years is to be accompanied by an acf adult of the same gender when travelling on acf business unl ess written permission is obtained from the parent or guardian for the cadet to travel alone 2009 an ofﬁcer must attend an area commanderʼs course at ctc to be eligible to command an area or equivalent to command detachment an ofﬁcer or adult instructor ai should attend kgvi memorial leadership course at ctc and such other training as is laid down in chapter 3 ofﬁcers and ai are to be authorised by their cadet comm andant to supervise cadet training and activities and such authorisation should only be gra nted when the cadet commandant is satisﬁed with their competence to do so thi s would normally be on completion of their induction and initial training the cadet commandant should consider withdrawing his authorisation if an ofﬁcer or ai is failing to maint ain satisfactory level of competence 2010 adult leaders must be sensitive to the conﬂicting demands of ensuring that c adets are properly supervised and allowing reasonable degree of freedom and privacy the sensible test is to ask ʻwould the general public consider it reasonable and appropriate to treat children or young people in this wayʼ for example it is necessary to ensure that cadets pay proper regard to personal hygiene by washing themselves and wearing clean clothes however it is not nece ssary to stand in the ablution block while they wash or shower indeed in most circumstances it would be regarded as highly improper to do so b it is correct to prohibit sexual relationships between cadets during acf activities therefore it is necessary to implement proper control over accomm odation arrangements to prevent opportunities occurring for illicit visits by either sex it would be wrong nevertheless to impose constant and intrusive checks far into the night 2011 when supervising cadets adults must ensure so far as is possible that the do not allow themselves to be compromised in any way for example adults should void being alone when supervising cadet activities and should not interview cadets wit hout another adult being present unless it is absolutely essential to do so when to obse rve an open door policy would be wise whenever male and female cadets have to remain ove rnight in cadet or training accommodation both male and female adults must be prese nt to ensure correct supervision equally an adult should not enter the sleeping accommodation of cadets of the opposite sex unless heshe is accompanied by an adult of the oppos ite sex except in an emergency when report of the circumstance must be made to t he ceo as soon as possible after the event 2012 if an adult believes that heshe has been placed in compromising situati on he she should report it to the area commander cadet commandant or ceo any resulting allegation can then be dealt with properly particularly if the circumstance s merely reﬂect mistake or careless or misunderstood action on the adultʼs partac 14233 the army cadet force manual 24 2005 edition2013 cadets may not be enrolled into the acf until they are twelve years old and in

their responsibilities by their adults and are to be supervised in the discharge of their duties 2017 cadets may be encouraged to overcome their fears in tackling challenging pursuits however they are

wishes nor prevented from taking part i n religious observance should they so wish 2018 guidance for the training of cadets with disabilities is given in chapters 3 and 10 to this manual adult leaders have the same duty of care towards disabled cadets as they do towards ablebodied cadets and are expected to provide only such additional care s is described in chapter 1 arrangements for female cadets to participate in acf activities during pregnancy are to be agreed by their detachment commander with their parent guardian and the cadet herself the detachment commander is to brief the adul t in charge of any activity in which the cadet intends to participate 2019 sports and games are to be played so far as is possible on pitches grounds or in buildings designed for the purpose and supervised

cadet commandants if they so wish may also appoint an appropriate person preferably chaplain or medical ofﬁcer to fulﬁl the role of independent listener cadet discipline 2021 the maintenance of good discipline in the acf is the responsibility of all adults and senior cadets under adult supervision there are sanctions or punishments avai lable to adults to enforce discipline on cadets other than suspension or dismissal or in the case of cadet ncos reduction in rank adults must therefore rely almost enti rely on leadership and personal example to maintain good discipline there is therefore heavy responsibility placed on adults to set good example at all times and w hen necessary to behave in better manner than would be expected outside the acf 2022 the following practices are speciﬁcally forbidden group punishments for an offence by an individual the removal of group privileges for collective poor behaviour would be permissible when appropriate b corporal punishment or the

not put it off until later make sure that you are out of the hearing of others although for your own sake you may wish to remain within sight of others give sympathetic consideration to the person talking to you they may prefer to speak in detail to another adult perhaps older or of the opposite sex if so make immediate arrangement s for this to happen remember that the cadet commandant may

you to determine the validity of the allegation conﬁrm your understanding of the allegation by repeating what you have heard back to the cadet for veriﬁcati on and try to ascertain that the cadet tells you as much as heshe wishe s of the allegation reassure the cadet that heshe is right to report it and that heshe is not to blame for what has happened or for what may happen as consequence do not question or challenge the cadetʼs statements do not proffer an opinion or convey your own feelings on the subject but do explain the action you intend to take and ensure that the cadet understands what your intention is 4 make contemporary note of what is said if possible while the conversation is taking place so that you can remember exactly what is being said put time and date on it and keep the notes in safe place however rough this note is much more i mportant as evidence than ʻcleaned upʼ version prepared later if it is not possible to take notes at the time do so immediately

child abuse if contacting the ceo is going to cause any delay the ofﬁcer or instructor in charge to whom the allegation is initially reported or if nece ssary the adult to whom the allegation was made should report the allegation to the area com mander or directly to the cadet commandant for advice and instruction about contacting the soc ial services or police 8 the appropriate formation hq is to

1 this guideline deals with bullying of cadets by cadets such bullying may occ ur anywhere and at any time within the acf this guideline does not include dea ling with physical or sexual abuse which is to be dealt with in accordance with the law and it does not include the bullying of cadets by adults which is to be considered and dealt with as child abuse deﬁnition 2 person is bullied when he or she is exposed regularly and over time to negative actions on the part of one or more persons research indicates that between 25 nd 50 percent of children are bullied in schools the types of bullying vary boys are more physical whilst girls often exclude others from groups the signs 3 the following can be signs that cadet is being bullied poor attendancepoor concentrationappears distracted distant

these signs will be much more noticeable awareness 4 acf adults should be aware that bullying occurs in every walk of life and must learn to deal with it and be conﬁdent in doing so it is not trap waiting to ca tch the unwary and there is plenty of advice and assistance available if needed 5 watch for the signs and be aware that bullies are often very adept at putti ng on respectable facade when adults are around the bullied person may be keen to deny it is happening for fear of reprisals 6 learn the procedure to be adopted when bullying or harassment is discovered reported 7 guard against inadvertent bullying behaviour thoughtless attitudes or actions by adults can easily aggravate the situation monitor and consider modifying managem ent styles to prevent it action to be taken 8 when bullying is identiﬁed the victims isare to be interviewed and offered support by an appropriate person this could be the detachment commander or sub unit commander or if appropriate more senior ofﬁcer b if necessary advice may be sought from specialists such as medical sta ff or chaplains or the person appointed by the cadet commandant to be the the independent listenerac 14233 the army cadet force manual 2005 edition 2a13 reverse blankc if initial disciplinary procedures do not in themselves quickly bring an end to the bullying possibly because the victim will not identify the bully support group should be formed d support group is formed from the victimʼs detachment it consists of the victim and hisher peers and should include the bullybullies suitable adult nominated by the support group should attend to observe but not play an active part in the discussions if the victim is evidently under stress medically t rained person should be coopted to attend the idea is that the bully is confronted with the re sult of hisher actions and has the opportunity to discuss the situation this syste m has proved more successful than isolation and threats of reprisals hopefully the support group will make some progress and together unaided by adult intervention make some decisions regarding the way forward it should meet again few days later if appropriate to discuss progress f if at the end of second meeting there has been improvement in the situat ion areacounty hq should take the necessary disciplinary action which is 1 to dismiss the offending cadets 2 to consider referring the case to parents or to the social services records 9 records of cases of cadet bullying should be maintained at acf area hq as follows brief details of the case the individual making the report and any disciplina ry interviews b brief record of any subsequent support group meetings minutes should not be taken nominal roll of who attended date and time are all that is required in conclusion 10 bullying is common phenomenon among children and young people and must be dealt with quickly and effectively adults need to be able to recognise the signs and deal conﬁdently and ﬁrmly

landrf2018 of jan 05 b jsp 535 cadet training safety precautions ctsps introduction 3001 this chapter contains the policy for acf training and its safety aim 3002 the aim of acf training is to produce selfreliant ﬁt young cadet with an understanding of basic military subjects initiated in the art of leadership ware of his responsibilities as citizen and with well developed interest in the army and the community responsibility 3003 the mod has the overall duty of care to ensure the safety of all cadets who take part in training activities under its auspices 3004 training policy is formulated by headquarters land command hq land in consultation with the army cadet force association acfa and the army cadet executive group aceg which is advised by the acf national training committee divisi onal and formation commanders have general responsibilities for the implementation of training and policy for county acfs within their own boundaries see chapter 1 paras 1006 1009 the acfa has appointed committees and panels such as the acfa shooting committee and the first aid panel to provide specialist advisers and expertise to assist in training in the subjects in the army proﬁciency apc acf syl labus hq land appoint an adventure training at adviser 3005 the acf cadet commandant is the commanding ofﬁcer of the acf in his county or counties see chapter 1 10231024 and is responsible for the training and the safety of the adults and cadets under his command to the appropriate comma nder described in 1024a in accordance with these instructions ac 14233 the army cadet force manual 32 2005 edition3006 commanders at all levels have personal responsibility for ensuring that act ivities are undertaken in the safest possible manner taking due regard to any risks to pers onnel or the environment this responsibility cannot be delegated the mechanisms for di scharging this duty may be delegated and assistance and support obtained but legal responsi bility remains with the chain of command and respective commanders all personnel have legal duty of care both to themselves and to others and may be liable to crim inal or civil action if there is wilful or reckless disregard of health and safety and trai ning safety requirements part 2 training safety risk management 3007 risk management is fundamental and statutory requirement for the safe management of any activity although the terminology may be unfamiliar to some the safe system of training sst process which includes where necessary the conduc t of risk assessments has been carried out in the army for many years unit sta nding orders range standing orders operating procedures and training pamphlets are all the result of this process which provides the structure for training safety if all elements of the sst safe persons safe equipment safe practice safe place see annex re not in place then there is need for risk assessment to identify the signiﬁcant ris ks arising from the activity the acf adult conducting the activity and therefore the risk ass essment must identify and prioritise the measures that need to be taken to ensure so far as is reasonably practicable the safety of the participants or of others who may be affected by the activity there is full section on risk management in reference the manageme nt of shef and ts guide issued by cadets otc branch hq land and risk assessments are referred to again in this chapter b pamphlet 21 ac 71751 regulations for the planning conduct and supervision of firing and training with infantry weapon systems and pyrotechnics describes the infantry training safe system safe weapons and ammunition safe ranges safe planning and conduct of training safe exercising troops investigation of accidents in chapter 1 section 1 this is to be abided by when training takes place that involves weapons or pyrotechnics 3008 training safety advisors tsa under the direct command of regional formation commanders are available to advise cadet commandants and county training ofﬁcers cto on all safety matters see 3044 below cadet training safety precautions jsp 535 3009 reference b ctsp known as the red book provides an onthespot reference to the ʻrules of safetyʼ which are to be obeyed when training cadets all acf adults must ac 14233 the army cadet force manual 2005 edition 33carry copy at all times when on acf duty it is detailed reference on training safety designed for the cadet forces and covers all major aspects of the subject 3010 in many instances the safety rules differ from and are more stringent than the equivalent regulations applicable to the regular and reserve forces cadet hqs and service formation headquarters are to ensure that instructors from regular and rese rve force sponsor units who are called upon to train cadets are made aware of this fact and are issued with copy of the jsp they are to be instructed to carry it when t raining cadets to be conversant with it and to comply with its rules implicitly 3011 particular attention is drawn to the regulations for the protection of hearing section 7 because damage to ears in young people may not become apparent until later years it is important that these instructions are strictly complied with training accidents and incidents 3012 if an accident or an incident does occur the ﬁrst action is to deal with the situation to keep persons safe from harm and to prevent further injury jsp 535 ctsps section 4 and the management of shef and ts guide provide guidance on the followup action to be taken this is expanded at annex b which also lays down how such incident s are to be reported once the situation allows every effort is to be made to ensure t hat any lessons that come out of any subsequent investigation are to be recorded in order to prevent reoccurrence and if appropriate the relevant risk assessment reexamined 3013 ctsps section 33 gives speciﬁc guidance on action in the event of an amm unition incident first aid 3014 an acf adult trained in first aid and in possession of an authorized first id kit see chapter 18 1807118073 should be present during all training for physical activities which inherently involve danger to life and limb this requirement i s mandatory such activities include all adventurous training and challenge pursuits see p art 7 below live ﬁring dry training involving the use of blank ammunition andor pyrotechnics and obstacle course training this list is not exhaustive and common sense is to be used 3015 ʻtrained in first aidʼ is to be interpreted within the acf

fully equivalent to and compatible with that paragra ph acfa will publish details of any such changes and the advice of acfa should be sought where there is any doubt 3017 adult first aid training may be obtained in any of the following ways within the acf by trainersassessors approved by the acfa b by ʻbuying inʼ training from hse approved agencies or voluntary aid societies this may include some mod centres brigade specialist t raining teams or military establishments approved by the hse c by relying on individuals obtaining training through their employment cadets with physical disabilities or special needs 3018 the great majority of cadets are expected to be able to undertake all as pects of acf training but there may be some who are unable to do so because of physical disabi lities or special needs whilst there is intention of preventing them from joining the acf provided that their parents or guardian wish them to do so and cadet commandants are prepared to accept them and are able to put any necessary safeguards in place it is necessary to impose certain rules and restrictions to ensure the safety of such cadets and those with whom they will train see chapter 10 the acf is unable to provide specialist carers cooperation with schools and youth services 3019 the acf maintains close partnership with the education authorities and the youth service as whole at the national level this is effected by the acfa which is responsible for policy guidance on the subject county acfs should maintain liaison w ith the schools in their area and as far as possible with any forum of the youth rvice which is established locally see chapter 15 in order to obtain specialist advice and to keep up with any changes in legislation that affects young people particularly as it affects their safety 3020 reservedac 14233 the army cadet force manual 2005 edition 35part 3 training obligations of acf adults background 3021 ofﬁcers and adult instructors ai in the acf must have the

to be planned so as to allow cadets to steadily progress through t he syllabus for the 5 years or more that they can serve in the acf to become fullytra ined cadet senior ncos or senior cadets and go on to become master cadets 3035 the gaining of the apc ʻstarʼ qualiﬁcations basic training 1 4 star and master cadet which are tests of an individualʼs basic knowledge is to be considered the normal achievement of the majority of cadets who make the necessary effort nd have been properly trained 3036 design of syllabus the syllabus is designed so that cadetʼs training is carried forward at steady rate compatible wi th the increasing abilities of growing cadet and with view to maintaining his interest in this sense it provides basis for planning training programmes b it sets standards of achievement by which the progress of an individual cadet can be measured c it provides the cadet with clearly understood and easily recognizable standards of achievement 3037 the subjects in the syllabus up to and including 3 star level are compulsory s that all cadets comply with the aim of training see 3002 above which in turn m eets the requirements of the charter of the acf see chapter 1

39conduct of training 3038 key aim of the cadet forces is to develop the personal qualities of cadet s and to give them responsible sense of adventure this is achieved through the progress ive introduction to challenging military and adventurous activities which by their nature have an inherent or perceived risk this level of risk must be as low as is rea sonably practicable and it is essential it is properly managed through the medium of sst this proc edure which includes carrying out risk assessments ras must be conducted prior to any training activity taking place see 3007 above 3039 training must always be carried out safely at the same time training should be interesting imaginative and challenging b lessons and tests should be practical and out of doors whenever possible c cadet ncos should be taught methods of instruction and given the opportunity both to teach and to command training and testing responsibility 3040 the responsibility for the satisfactory implementation of an acf county training and testing system based on the apcacf syllabus rests with the cadet comm andant through his cto and with the assistance of the individuals referred to in paras 3043 3044 and 3045 below he is to prepare an annual training scheme for the guidance of his detachment commanders citizenship training 3041 although the mere fact of being cadet in the acf is citizenship traini ng something further must be done to give positive proof of good citizenship and this can only be achieved by the specialized training given to cadets in the ʻcadet and comm unityʼ part of the syllabus it is the responsibility of the acf training committee see appendix 3 to annex to chapter 1 with advice from the acfa to keep the syllabus uptodate for t he training in this subject which is part of the apcacf syllabus 3042 spiritual values are to be encouraged in all cadet activities and it i s important that both cadets and staff have their spiritual needs met as far as that is practically possible during centralised and other weekend training there ought to be act of worship which cadets are encouraged to attend the structure and content of that act of worship s hould be sensitive to the religious background of those attending where possible the partic ular denominational needs of both cadets and staff should be met and this is best facilitated through the

practices and the safe environment requirem ents of legislation with training requirements is recognised hazardous training acti vities must be managed to ensure that the mod complies with the law deﬁnitions 2 hazard hazard is the actual or potential condition that can cause injury both immediate and delayed illness or death of personnel or damage or loss of equipment or property 3 severity severity is the degree of injury numbers of personnel affected property damage or other factors that could occur as result of hazard 4 risk risk is the probability of exposure to injury or loss from hazard this annex is concerned with the risk of accidents occurring during training and risk management by both the acf adult in charge and his subordinates 5 controls controls are actions taken to eliminate hazards or reduce their risk 6 residual risk residual risk is the level of risk remaining after controls have been applied for hazardsac 14233 the army cadet force manual 3a2 2005 editionduties 7 persons undergoing training personnel undergoing training are to adhere to any instructions supplied before or during training and recognise any hazards they will face during training 8 acf adults acf adults at all levels have personal responsibility for ensuring that activities are undertaken in as safe manner as is reasonably practica ble taking due regard of any risks to personnel this responsibility cannot be delegated although the mec hanisms for discharging this duty may be delegated and assistance and support obtained safe system of training sst 9 the sst consists of 4 separate elements where the hazards have been ssessed and the consequent controls have been integrated in order to reduce the risks to as low as is reasonably practicable the 4 elements are safe persons safe equipment s afe practice and safe place safe persons safe persons are cadets or adults who have received the correct training for the activity they will carry out competent person within the s st is an instructor who has passed the relevant course in order to carry out safe training it is essential that acf adults provide an appropriate level of supervision and thos conducting the training take the necessary time and pay sufﬁcient attention t detail in order to eliminate mistakes b safe equipment acf adults must ensure that their subordinates have and make use of the correct equipment to carry out an activity acf adults must ensure that equipment is used and maintained appropriately and ensure that only competent persons are allowed to operate and service the equipment completed training and maintenance records must be kept c safe practice practices are to be conducted in accordance with drills and instructions speciﬁed by the service authorities safe practices include following correct procedures the presence of adequate training and supervision the provision of warnings and the use of personal protective equipment ppe and special clothi ng it is essential that all training be monitored to ensure that procedures are s trictly adhered to adventurous training activities are to follow the procedures as speciﬁed by the appropriate authority d safe place safe place is one in which the controls necessary to enable authorised training to be conducted safely have been identiﬁed by sitespeciﬁc risk assessment ra and directed through appropriate standing orders such as range standing ordersac 14233 the army cadet force manual 2005 edition 3a3conﬁrmation that the safe system of training is applicable 10 prior to carrying out ra in training it must be established whether or not l elements of the sst are in place if all elements of the sst are in place t here is need to proceed further with ra see also 23 below persons at risk during military training 11 there are 3 categories of people at risk in training members of the acf this involves those conducting and undergoing training b controlled personnel that is civilian staff employed in support of training c the general public this includes all those who are unaware of the traini ng activity including such people as the trespasser those who disregard warnings or those who do not understand the warnings risk assessment 12 the aim of ra in training is as follows to establish which elements of the sst are not in place whether the re are any hazards not covered by the sst and consequently if there is any residual risk b to analyse the residual risk to decide if the residual risk is 1 adequately controlled where the risks are deemed to be acceptable by the acf adult in charge of the training activity in which case the activit can then be carried out 2 not adequately controlled where there are unacceptable risks in which case further measures are to be introduced to adequately control the risks 13 if the measures are still not considered to produce safe training the activi ty must not be carried out 14 ra as set out below paras 1518 is to be carried out on the following occasions when ras for activities at speciﬁc site are not provided and endorsed by the appropriate authority together with the controls required to reduce the risk to as l ow as reasonably practicable b when instructions for the activity proposed are not covered by or are contrary to drills and instructions issued by the appropriate service authorityac 14233 the army cadet force manual 3a4 2005 editionc when changes to training exercises are proposed it is essential that t he effects of any proposed changes to training exercises be subjected to ra the health and safety executive has commented that many military training accidents are the result of lastminute changes to exercises the consequences of which had not been thought through generic risk assessment 15 generic risk assessments gras are employed where similar activiti are undertaken or repeated these assessments describe the hazards involved and identify the routine control measures to reduce the risk repetitive training activities carri ed out in training units lend themselves particularly to gras the methodology for carrying out gras i n military training is the same as the ra process set out below the

ra has been completed for the activity and that all the instruct ors involved are fully qualiﬁed c suitable and sufﬁcient insurance policies have been taken out to cover all appropriate activities this may be satisﬁed by obtaining copy of the provider ʼs insurance policy or by taking out speciﬁc insurance not already provided for under the acfa insurance scheme conclusions 21 good training adherence to safety procedures and good supervision can all help to reduce the hazards or severity of the risk for instance rock climbing could be as sessed as not acceptable an accident is very likely to happen and if it does t he result could be major injury put in place safety ropes properly trained supervisors and ensure tha t the climb is within the capability of the cadet and the risk becomes acceptable 22 ra is largely matter of common sense but the important point is that record of the assessment is made before embarking on the activity the record must be re tained so that if an incident occurs the supervisor can show that proper assessment was m ade and that all reasonable precautions were in place commanders and supervisors must get into the habit of making ras and recording them for example making ﬁle and referring to it ach time an activity is planned 23 this annex will assist instructors to carry out ras it must be remembe red that just conducting an

introduction 1 this policy supersedes reference which should now be destroyed 2 clay target ct shooting is an excellent sport for cadets as it helps promot self discipline hand eye coordination and gives the young person great sense of achieveme nt when they begin to master the sport for these reasons it should be encouraged both as routine activity and for special occasions such as part of summer camp how ever clay target shooting is sport and not part of the acf training syllabus consequently h q land command will not fund it participating units must fund it themselves 3 as with all shooting sports there are inherent dangers however the risk is reduced to negligible proportions if the rules in references b to are adhered to aim 4 the aim of this policy document is to outline the safety requirements given in the references and to add additional safety procedures which are required for cadets undertaking ct shooting policy for cadets 5 clay shooting ranges cadets may only shoot on clay ranges as follows mod land mod land may be used for ct shooting provided that the rules laid down in jsp 403 are adhered to permission is to be sought from the commanding ofﬁcer deol or ate whichever is appropriate it should not be assumed that shotguns may be used on any military landac 14233 the army cadet force manual 3m2 2005 editionb civilian ranges civilian ranges may be used so long as they have an exemption certiﬁcation section 11 subsection 6 of the firearms act 1968 which allows shooters who do not have shotgun certiﬁcate to ﬁre on that range c private land private land may only be used with the landownerʼs permission and he must personally supervise the range the owner must have valid shotgun certiﬁcate it is requirement of the law that only the landowner can s upervise someone who does not have shotgun certiﬁcate for this reason the use of privat land is not recommended for cadet organisations 6 cadet firers the following rules regarding the physical attributes of cadets and tuition are to be followed physical attributes cadet ﬁrer must be big enough and strong enough to have full control of the gun heshe must also be enthusiastic about ﬁring the gun and not pressed into participation in such activities b tuition all cadet ﬁrers are to receive formal tutorial on basic handling of the weapon and thorough brief on gun and range safety before ﬁring in addition they should be briefed on the methods of breaking moving target this is best done by qualiﬁed instructor or coach 7 range conducting ofﬁcer the range conducting ofﬁcer rco must either be clay pigeon shooting association cpsa or army riﬂe association ara qualiﬁe d safety ofﬁcer so1 details of courses and contact details for the cpsa and ara are given in paragraphs 20 to 23 of this paper other qualiﬁcation is acceptable and commandants are not to authorise rcos this ruling may seem prescriptive but the reason is that most injuries on ct ranges result from accidents with traps and clay targets this is an area in which rcos holding cadet range qualiﬁcation full bore or other full bore rco qualiﬁcation have knowledge rcos should be familiar with reference and be prepared to conduct formal risk assessment as appropriate 8 supervision of shooters there are rules laid down in any reference document as to how many shooters an rco can supervise however in the case of cadets the following guidelines are to be followed until shooters have passed safe shot course they are to be closely supervised in other words coached by an ara basic instructor the rco may act as the coa ch if only one shooting position is in operation at time if more shooting positions re in operation each must be manned by an ara basic instructor b when cadets have passed the safe shot course there is need for the shooter to be coached however the rco must be in position to monitor all the shoot ing footnote 1 the ara courses which now attract an ara qualiﬁcation have superseded thos that were previously awarded an actsa qualiﬁcation those safety ofﬁcers and basic instructors holding actsa qualiﬁcations are deemed ara qualiﬁed ac 14233 the army cadet force manual 2005 edition 3m3stands and ensure that they are running safely to achieve this level of supervi sion the rco is not to have more than 6 stands in operation at any one time and they must all be visible from central point to aid supervision c the responsibility for devising safe shot course for cadets now lies with the ai who is taught the basics on the ara basic instructors course 9 insurance clay target shooting is recognised military activity according to home ofﬁce criteria provided therefore that clay target shooting has been authorise d by the commandant and that all the correct procedures including risk assessments have been carried out in the preparation and conduct of each range in short that the activity has been made as safe as is reasonably possible normal mod indemnity will provide adequate protection to the ai in charge in the event of an accident it should be noted that membership of acfa personal accident policy also provides cover for public liability when mod indemnity would not apply for example in the event of suspec ted negligence b qualiﬁed ais who are full members of cpsa and who have successfully completed the cpsa coaching course may apply for cpsa coachrefereesafety ofﬁcer insurance at small cost ais who have attended ara clay target safety ofﬁcer and basic instructor courses are not eligible to apply for such insurance eve n if members of the cpsa 10 shotgun certiﬁcate there is requirement for an rco or any other qualiﬁed ai to hold shotgun certiﬁcate 11 shotguns the law is not prescriptive about the type of shotgun which may be used for ct shooting however there are sensible guidelines which should be observed by rcos these are only single trigger over and under ou shotgun of good make and in good condition should be used by cadets other guns are perfectly adequate for ct shooting but all are at disadvantage to the ou gun b only 12 bore or 20 bore shotguns are to be used this avoids any confusion with ammunition types however on account are both gauges to be allowed on the same range c all guns used by cadets are to be serviced once year by qualiﬁed gunsmi th the rco is to inspect all guns for serviceability before they are used guns w ith any defect are not to be used by cadets 12 ammunition the restriction on shot sizes and weight for ct shooting are given in reference d although these rules must be followed the main concern for the rco runni ng range for cadets is one of recoil the rco is to use cartridges which generat very little recoil which generally means cartridge with small weight of shot and low muzzle ac 14233 the army cadet force manual 3m4 2005 editionvelocity mv for young cadets low velocity trainer cartridge is recomme nded it should be noted that many 24 gram loads are designed for olympic disciplines whi ch require very high mv and consequently they can produce great deal of felt or percei ved recoil use of steel shot felt or plastic wads will be dictated by the ground on which the shoot is being held and by the prooﬁng of the gun note it is necessary to consider the chamber length of the guns being used when purchasing cartridges 13 storage cartridges must be stored in unit ammunition stores in dry and temperate conditions loose cartridges should be returned to the store 14 traps where possible the use of manual traps should be avoided traps should be checked before they are used and anyone working with manual trap or electric trap must be briefed on its operation 15 trappers the rules for employment for trappers are laid down in reference d these rules are to be adhered to cadets are not to be employed as trappers if under 14 years old or if the trap is placed in the danger area ie in the line of ﬁre 16 personal protection it is mandatory for all ﬁrers to wear ear and eye protection and it is strongly recommended that they should wear cap only service issue ear protection is to be worn ear muff type and not ear plugs eye protection must be worn over prescripti on glasses unless the wearer can prove that hisher glasses are shatter resistant 17 target debris rcos are to ensure that target debris does not fall on the shooter the waiting detail or spectators to meet this requirement the rco must choose his target ﬂight line very carefully and ensure that those not shooting are kept out of the way 18 first aid and emergency aid the rco is to have ﬁrst aid pack for minor injuries and first field dressings to provide immediate aid in an emergency the rco must have communications with the emergency services landlines and mobile telephone links must be proven before ﬁring commences 19 safe shot course cadet organisations are encouraged to pursue the sport to the level where the cadet can pass the ara safe shot course cadets are now

proﬁciency certiﬁcate apc syllabus as an optional activity in ʻcadet and the communityʼ and ﬁnally into the apc as core skill in 1986 in 1999 first aid was included in the re vised syllabus as progressive subject at every level of the apc reﬂecting the armyʼs nd the cadet forceʼs view that first aid is core skill 2 ccf army sections have followed similar arrangements first aid being part of the ccf basic syllabus since 1986 3 the aim of this document is to set out the policy for first aid training in the acf background 4 defence medical services lack the resources to sponsor first aid traini ng for cadet forces 5 it is essential that cadet first aid training meets accepted nd recognised civilian standards and hq acfa liases with national bodies through its first aid p anel to

requirements of the safety and responsibility guidelines b to provide training for cadets as speciﬁed in the apc syllabus 17 the duty of care guidelines for acf adults chapter 2 of reference f state in 2044 that ﬁrst aid trained or appointed person is to be present for all cadet activi ties for training in the ﬁeld or on ranges an adult with current first aid certiﬁcat is to be present for some activities particularly of an adventurous training nature it is mandatory for an adult with specialist ﬁrst aid qualiﬁcation to be prese nt the details of which are contained in jsp 535 2005 states acf cadet commandants are to ensure that their acf adults are familiar wi th these guidelines standing orders should be produced to compliment these guidelines and cover any circumstances or conditions peculiar to an acf county 18 it is the responsibility of the county cadet commandant to ensure that adequate provision is made to meet the requirements for adult first aid training this can be achieved in three ways through ctc courses b inhouse county courses or jointly with other counties or jointly with ccf or atc using acfa accredited trainersassessors at minimal cost c by buying in the training from health safety executive approved agency to deliver course of minimum 24 hours plus assessment and meeting all the costs 19 relying on the goodwill of employers or the voluntary commitment of adult staff to go elsewhere for their training is unlikely to satisfy all the requirements for adequate first aid provision inhouse courses through acfa is the most cost effective and practic able route and fully supported by hq landac 14233 the army cadet force manual 2005 edition 3n520 it is recommended that ctc courses are used to train cfatos and adult trai ners or potential trainers the trainer courses can provide accreditation to allow successful candidates to run inhouse adult training to accepted and recognised civilian cert iﬁcated standards 21 the courses and events available at ctc are set out at appendix 2 cadet first aid training 22 the acf carries out first aid training required by the apc to nationally recogni sed standards using its own instructors and its own syllabus this involves additi onal cost other than minimal cost at 4 star where first aid is chosen as an opti onal progressive subject 23 additional documentation is required only at 2 star level where to gain nationa lly recognised certiﬁcates for their cadets unit must provide list of name s to the acfa on completion of course the documentation needed is simple form obtainable from the acfa this can be done retrospectively there is requirement to register 2 star first aid courses trainers or assessors not so at 4 star 24 the syllabus follows accepted civilian standards and achieves civili an recognised award at 2 star it is important that when the cadet comes to this third level of training and is senior and experienced enough and likely to be in situations where he might have to use his skills the training is franked by appropriate civilian recognition 25 the requirements of the apc syllabus are set out in reference c reference sets out the detailed subject matter for basic training and 1 star reference b set s out the detailed subject matter for 2 star and 3 star these requirements are summarised as follows basic training this single period teaches the cadets how to deal with an emergency and obtain help it covers the ʻincident action planʼ and introduces fi rst aid b 1 star 1 the first aid syllabus at 1 star called casaid can be taught and t ested by any suitable person it requires special documentation or cost it equips cadets to cope with minor as well as more serious first aid problems re lated to outdoor activities and should be completed before the cadet undertakes the 1 star expedition or similar activities 2 it will provide the basic first aid knowledge required for the 2 star expedition and also for the duke of edinburghʼs award bronze expedition if these are undertaken before first aid is completed at 2 starac 14233 the army cadet force manual 3n6 2005 editionc 2 star 1 recognised youth first aid certiﬁcate must be obtained to provide 2 sta r pass this should be achieved in single weekend training and testing can be undertaken by adult leaders with current first aid certiﬁcate b ctt staff with current first aid certiﬁcate c cadets with an adult first aid certiﬁcate d other accredited civilian first aid trainers approved by acfa 2 it is possible to conduct the training from the cadet training manual but inexpensive additional materials are available from cadet kit shop 3 the acfa has put in place very simple arrangements to provide recognised youth first aid certiﬁcates alternatively training and testing can be undert aken by the voluntary aid societies but their syllabus timetable and costs must be met d 3 star the syllabus provides older cadets with the equivalent of the adult lifesaver course and can be achieved over 16 periods 8 hours and ﬁtted into single day completion of the lifesaver course does not provide an adult with first id certiﬁcate when conducted as apc training it is not necessary to regist er the course and cost is involved the course should however be conducted by suitably qualiﬁed adult leader with first aid certiﬁcate and practical fi rst aid experience over three year period 4 star 1 first aid is an attractive option for 4 star it counts as progressive subject and if linked with one other progressive subject or leadership course or scic will provide the cadet with full 4 star pass it will also give the cadet valuable adult qualiﬁcation valid for three years that will meet all t he first aid requirements of the acf manual or any other civilian or military requirements for first aid qualiﬁcation 2 if the cadet has properly followed the syllabus at 3 star then lifesaver plus can be achieved in just 8 hours 16 periods training and testing can be carried out inhouse but the training must be registered in advance with the acfa and conducted by approved trainers suitably qualiﬁed adult leaders who hold first aid certiﬁcate and can show practical first aid experience over three year period may be approved by hq acfa for this purpose subject to assessment of their skills evidenced in portfolio ac 14233 the army cadet force manual 2005 edition 3n73 the

within detachments with another afﬁliation there re some 238 combined cadet force ccf contingents of which some 200 have an authorised signals platoon under local arrangements the signals platoon may be known as platoon troop or section for the purposes of this paper the acf and ccf will be known as the ca det force unless distinction has to be made within the ccf the term signa lling refers to army sponsored signalling 2 commander regional forces crf supports signalling in the cadet force because it enhances and develops the cadetʼs ability to communicate in the wides t sense radio communications require forethought accuracy discipline and quickthinking b the selfconﬁdence generated by signals training including the instructional and leadership aspects is beneﬁcial not only for cadet training but in helping the cadet with challenges such as the duke of edinburghʼs award scheme c the practical application of good signalling can enhance cadet training and provide the opportunity to allow the cadets to make positive contribution to other activities d signalling provides an interesting form of advanced continuation training for the cadet the system of training is progressive and rewards application determinat ion and commitment there is visible recognition of achievement through the crossed ﬂags badge and course certiﬁcates advanced signalling and attendance at courses at the royal school of signals rss can engage the cadetʼs interest with an idea of the technology required i n the modern army 3 the purpose of this paper is to make clear the policy

developed rapidly over the last few years as result of t he work of the national and regional music advisers and the band support unit that were stablished in 2002 as result hq land produced cadet music policy in 2003 to provide support structure to enable county commandants to fully utilise the skills of their adult volunteers without imposing another unnecessary layer of bureaucracy and to make best possible use of all resources available nomenclature 2 for the purpose of this document the word bands or cadet bands includes military bands wind bands pipe bands corps of drums buglers or any ensemble of cadet musicians background 3 with the demise of many regular and ta bands in the united kingdom the army cadet force acf is the only organisation that can produce marching band of sufﬁci ent quality in military uniform in many areas additionally the number of youngsters invol ved in cadet music who are opting to enlist in the regular forces is signiﬁcant enough for the royal school of music kneller hall the school of ceremonial pirbright and the arm school of piping in edinburgh to actively support the excellent musical training gi ven to the cadet organisation 4 attendance at annual concentrations continues to rise from twentynine cadets in 1998 more than two hundred in subsequent years many cadets achieve associated boa rd gradesand btec award for music is also available in 2003 there were now fortyfour cadet corps of drums fourteen cadet bands and seven pipe bands encompassing some 2000 youngsters 5 in most cases acf bands are too small for their potential to be fully real ised and only when incorporated with other bands can cadets feel the excitement of playing in large group whilst beneﬁting from the training experience similarly limited

syllabus the contents should therefore be read in conjunction with chapter 17 insurance ofﬁcers and adult instructors 10002 the medical standards required by acf ofﬁcers and ai are at annex to this chapter cadets 10003 enrolment the majority of cadets in the acf are able to undertake the activities included in the apc acf training syllabus however there may be some who are not able to undertake all the activities because of physical disabilities there is intention of preventing them from joining the acf provided that the parents or guardians concerned and head teachers in the case of category 1 and 2 detachments wish them to do so and acf cadet commandants are prepared to accept them under the terms and conditions of this chapter to this end it is strongly advised that the parents or guardians of potential recruit shoul d declare to the detachment commander concerned any illness or disability from which he or she may be suffering at the time of joining in particular it is i mportant that the effects of the medical condition on the individual are clearly st ated so that the acf can determine how this may affect their ability to take part in acf activities and whether any reasonable adjustments will need to be made to help the individual take part notiﬁcation of the following aspects of daily activity w ill be needed 1 mobility 2 speech 3 physical coordination 4

cadet commandant concerned b the commanding ofﬁcer of any service establishment or ship to which cadet may be attached for training retains the responsibility to decide tha t cadet is unﬁt to undertake the form of training planned even if previously considered ﬁt by the parents and acf cadet commandant concerned c the oic party will be responsible for carrying out careful local risk assessment which will consider medical conditions unsuited to the acti vities proposed see part 2 below d cadets suffering from enuresis bed wetting or motion sickness may only take part in sea or air

likel to be carried out during any training period this list is reproduced on the back of the medical certi ﬁcate at annex b 10006 prior to cadets being required to undertake strenuous training whether at annual camp on course or during adventurous training copy of the medical certiﬁcate at annex b should be given to every cadet with request that it is to be shown to hisher parent guardian and returned to the detachment duly completed and signed before the relevant activity starts 10007 cadets suffering from the disabilities listed below may only take part in limited number of activities during adventurous training the ministry of defence has duty t ensure that cadets are not placed at risk because of medical condition they may have which would require level of supervision or care that is not available through the acf as such the acf follows the following regulations young people with epilepsy or conditions rendering them prone to episodes of loss of consciousness are not allowed to undertake such activities as rock climbing swimming ﬁring weapons canoeing orienteering expeditions in wild country etc b young people with diabetes dependent on insulin treatment may not undertake activities involving irregular meals certain overnight activities or periods of prolonged exertion c young people with heart conditions are of such variable nature that they must be judged individually by acf medical practitioners d other signiﬁcant medical conditions will need to be assessed on their individual merits asthmarespiratory disorders 10008 exceptionally cadets who suffer or who have suffered from asthma or other signiﬁcant respiratory breathing problem may take part in selected adventurous t raining activities provided the criteria at annex c are complied with and where permitted by the lack of severity of the asthmatic condition b the physical demands of the training activity c the degree of environmental protection g the level of appropriate medical supervisionac 14233 the army cadet force manual 104 2005 edition10009 young people with asthma are subject to additional procedures and restrictions including the completion of an additional consent form and medical certiﬁcate should any doubt exist on whether cadet is ﬁt to undertake all the activities doctor should be consulted before this certiﬁcate is signed when cadets with asthma are considered for an adventurous training activity the oic party will be responsible for carrying out loca l risk assessment bearing in mind that both exertion and cold are independent risk factors which may trigger acute attacks the following checklist which is not exhaustive may be used as guide the general health of the individual b the advice from the parent or guardian c the distance involved in

c that those at higher risk may possibly undertake the activities described in serials 1 4 5 7 8 and 9 only however even cadets at lower risk should not take part in any adventurous training with recent respiratory infection s advised by medical ofﬁcer 10011 the distinction between lower and higher risk is deﬁned as follows lower risk those who 1 have never required hospital or emergency treatment for their asthma 2 have never needed oral steroids tablets or nebulised bronchodilators 3 have not required preventative treatment with inhaled steroids or cromoglycates within the previous

if at any stage it is the view of the adult supervisor that despite the m edical consent the cadet should not take part in the training activity the supervisor is to take all steps to effect this 10015 all personnel should note that the change in rules concerning the participation of asthma sufferers in acf adventurous training activities does not imply any rel axation of the medical bar on

the qualities of good citizenship and spirit of service is one which parallels that of the nationʼs youth services in general it is important therefore that whenever possible the acf as voluntary youth organisation should cooperate fully at all l evels with other youth organisations and play its part in the youth service as whole the national council for voluntary youth services 16002 the

19a1annex to chapter 19 the history of the army cadets the formation of todayʼs ccf and acf is the result of the threat of invasion in 1859 in that year the country was seriously alarmed by the political unrest and growing pow er of napoleon iii and france most of the british army was abroad policing the empire nd there were few soldiers left to defend the country should an invasion occur the g overnment felt impelled to call for volunteers to prepare to defend the county within twe lve months 100000 volunteers had been armed and were being trained the formation of the new v olunteer force in 1860 was the foundation of todayʼs territorial army combined cadet force and the army cadet force at the outset in 1860 number of schools formed volunteer cadet corps amongst them were eton felstead harrow hurstpierpoint marlborough rossall rugby shrewsbury and winchester in the same year queen victoria reviewed the v olunteer arm in hyde park and at the head of the queenʼs westminster riﬂe v olunteers marched t hirtyﬁve cadets the london riﬂe brigade 1860 and the south middlesex riﬂe v olunteers 1861 also included cadets in their ranks by 1863 the opportunity for all boys to join the ca dets was recognised formally in the v olunteer regulations the national riﬂe association was also formed in 1860 and the ashburton shield competition started the following year although the objective was to provide pre military training the ʻclosedʼ school units acted for the most part as riﬂe clubs the threat of invasion soon passed but cadet training remained the cadet riﬂe clubs had become popular and wellestablished with the additional military training support ing the schoolsʼ aims by encouraging leadership and selfreliance outside of the schools the victorian reformers saw the cadet organisation as means of rescuing poor boys and working boys from the excesses of misbehaviour brought on by deprivation through living in urban slums the most noted reformer in cadet terms was miss octavia hill who wa s also one of the founders of the national trust miss hill wanted to actively encourage the virtues of ʻcleanliness discipline and honestyʼ and to promote in boys sense of citizens hip in order to realise these laudable aims she formed the east london cadet corps in 1889 thus she was instrumental in giving the army cadet movement social as well as military aim the 1st manchester cadet battalion formed in 1884 became the ﬁrst selfadmini stered battalion for working boys by 1900 it was six hundred strong birmingham also formed an independently administered cadet battalion and in the same year the ﬁrs t public school camp was held at church downs where the cadets were inspected by kaiser wilhelm ii the cadet corps have always expanded in times of national crisis during the boe r war in south africa 1898 1902 the number of school contingents increased from fortyone to ninetynine an ʻopenʼ townbased cadet battalion the 1st cadet bn the kingʼs royal ac 14233 the army cadet force manual 19a2 2005 editionriﬂe corps actually sent contingent to ﬁght in the boer war and it is the only cadet unit to have battle honour the boer war highlighted the shortage of ofﬁcers in the army and reserves and as consequence in 1907 an ofﬁcers training corps was formed there were two divisions the senior otc being in the universities and the junior jtc in the public schools in 1908 the v olunteers became the territorial army and two years later in 1910 the territorial cadet force tcf later the acf was formed as part of the ta it was deci ded in 1917 to set up the public and secondary school association to cater for those schools not in the junior training corps but still part of the territorial cadet force it was m ainly for grammar schools most of which joined the jtc at later date the cadet force experienced large expansion during the first world war 191418 and numbers in the tcf increased to 120000 with the war ofﬁce taking over the adminis tration the first world war had devastating effect on postwar cadet recruitment with over threequarters of million british servicemen killed and many more injured during the war interest in the military naturally declined after 1918 this decline result ed in the church lads brigade and boys brigade withdrawing their afﬁliation from the tcf and at the same time the government ceased to recognise the territorial cadet force kit or clothing was authorised and the wearing of regimental buttons and badges was forbidden by 1928 the total strength had dropped to 49510 the junior section of the otc in the public schools was fortunately kept going by the ﬁnancial generosity of parents the british national cadet association bnca was formed by fieldmarshal lord allenby and general jeudwine to keep the territorial cadet force alive the re was some success and by 1932 the bnca had control of the cadet force under the guidance of the territorial army association but cadet numbers in the tcf had by then slum ped to 20000 with the rise of hitler in germany in the 1930s and the subsequent need for traini ng future soldiers the war ofﬁce was galvanized into action acceptance and recogni tion of the tcf was restored fully and the organisation was renamed the army cadet force the second world war 193945 saw huge expansion and 80 of todayʼs detachments were formed during world war ii there were over 200000 army cadets with 40000 going into the armed forces each year the jtc was 30000 strong and now included raf and naval sections the war ofﬁce again took control of the acf under the command of general the vis count bridgeman cb dso mc who was also in charge of the home guard training was geared to getting cadets ﬁt and ready for military service uniforms were iss ued free of charge and 16 yearold cadets could volunteer to serve as messengers for the civil defence and the home guard the army cadets were expected to join the home guard w hen reaching 17 years of age and several schools supplied whole companies for the hg some army cadetshome guard members served with antiaircraft batteries and thus saw active service on the home front ac 14233 the army cadet force manual 2005 edition 19a3at the end of the war in 1945 the bnca changed its name to the army cadet force association acfa today the acfa is responsible for directing activities out side of military training and advising the ministry of defence on cadet matters in 1948 the jtc changed its name again and became the combined cadet force five years fter the war in 1950 the cadet forces medal was granted to ofﬁcers and instructors of the cadet movement for long and efﬁcient service this was in part recognition of the invalua ble service they did during the war in 1957 the government published the amery report which considered the future of the acf as result of the amery report the cadet training centre at frimley w as founded substantial grants were given to the army cadet force association from the l ate king george vi memorial trust fund and cadet ofﬁcers and instructors courses known as kgvi leadership courses were thereafter run at the ctc frimley park three years later in 1960 the army cadet movement celebrated its centenary as part of the celebrations the duke of edinburgh presented his banner to the acf and the pres ident of the ccf general sir oliver leese on behalf of the queen presented the ccf w ith banner both are lodged at frimley park there was review of the acf and ccf in the grounds of buckingham palace by her majesty the queen and hrh the duke of edinburgh whilst up and down the country other celebratory parades and thanksgiving services were held adventurous training was introduced into the apc syllabus after the second world war and in the mid1950s training expanded to include the duke of edinburghʼs award trips to baor in germany and canada along with participation in the nijemegen marches added new challenges to cadet activities later in 1968 cadet training teams were established in order to supplement the work done by the staff at the ctc frimley park the 1970s was period of important change the old wartime and b certiﬁcate s were replaced by the now familiar army proﬁciency certiﬁcate which provides challe nging training up to four star level and the duke of edinburghʼs award was further integrate d into the apc syllabus along with the nationally approved first aid awards uniforms have evolved over the years in the nineteenth century cadets wore the uniform of the v olunteer unit to which they were afﬁliated from 1914 to 1942 cadets wore first world war style uniforms with peaked caps and puttees in 1942 free beret batt dress and gaiters were issued cadet attire has continued to change and today cadets wear the same combat kit

forces along with the cadet target riﬂe for competitive shooting ca dets are also taught to ﬁre the light support weapon lsw the early 1980s saw the biggest change of all when at long last girls were allowed to join the cadet movement today about one third of all acf detachments and ccf contingent sʼ members are female ac 14233 the army cadet force manual 19a4 2005 editionthe present day programme is much more diversiﬁed than ever with the inclusion of national qualiﬁcations for cadets in the form of the btec in public services diploma and the city guilds certiﬁcates in youth leadership and management for adults in addition many acf counties run outreach courses in conjunction with local authorities for young offenders the spirit of octavia hill lives on today there are around 1700 acf detachments and 250 ccf contingents the cadet movementʼs number which includes the sea cadet corps and the air training corps is in excess of 130000 cadets with approximately 45000 in the acf and 25000 in the ccf cadet training is geared to the development of an individualʼs powers of leadership self reliance whilst at the same time encouraging team work encouraging an int erest in the

at the start of its centenary year existence for hundred years is in itself nothing very spectacular what ma tters is the record of service and achievement in this respect the army cadet force has m uch to celebrate through this century of vastly changing circumstances through periods of crisis and patriotic fervour and through the peaceful years when people are inclined to neglect the essential preparations for emergencies the army cadet force has never fa ltered in its work of training and preparation for this we remember today the hard work of countless ofﬁcers who gave their own time to train many thousands of cadets and to administer the units we are fortunate in their successors at work today and the future wellbeing of the army cadet force will depend on the right men continuing to come forward to offer their services there are 2 sides to the army cadet force there is the practical side which is the nationʼs need to be prepared for any kind of crisis or emergency the members of the army cade t force are part of that preparation although the cadets are primarily under training the occasion might easily arise when their services might be required the other side is the effect which service and training in the army cadet force can have upon individual boys the discipline and comradeship the tough and serious training the inﬂuence of their ofﬁcers and the knowledge that their services are needed and ppreciated all go to help the boy develop into self reliant decent man with an intel ligent sense of patriotism who can be relied upon to act rightly in moments of

14233 the army cadet force manual 2005 edition 201chapter 20 acf public relations general 20001 the main aim of acf public relations acf pr is to establish and maint ain the general understanding and sympathetic support of the acf and its reputation by the general public through media initiatives 20002 the subsidiary aims include the recruitment of the required numbers of acf ofﬁcers and adult instructors of good quality without which the acf cannot succeed b the attraction of healthy level of acf cadet enrolment 20003 speciﬁc acf pr target categories include the regular army the ministry of defence mod and service organisations upon whose active support and sponsorship the acf depends critically b the territorial army ta with whom the acf closely works and lives c the educational world from whence the cadets come d parents and guardians who naturally are the greatest inﬂuence on the cadets the local community including local authorities public and emergency services and other nonpolitical community organisations and in particular wouldbe employers and the business community as potential supporters and sponsors f national audiences such as government ministries agencies and public bodies politicians nongovernmental organisations and ʻopinion formersʼ for whom knowledge of the acf would be of beneﬁt 20004 none of the above target categories may be assumed to have either an acc urate or comprehensive knowledge of the acf the acf image 20005 the following strategic factors must be borne in mind when acf subjects are presented to the public through media outletsac 14233 the army cadet force manual 202 2005 editiona the acf is voluntary national youth organisation sponsored by the army it is not part of the army but it is managed by the armyʼs chain of command b the acf offers disciplined well organised framework upon which spirit of service and social responsibility is developed amongst young people it also contributes to the spread of knowledge and understanding of the army and ta the experience of responsibility and the encouragement of self discipline develop personal qualities that may be of beneﬁt for future employment in any walk of life c suitable young people are helped in their preparation to join either the armed forces or the uniformed civilian services but there is commitment or pressure on any cadet to do so the acf also helps to produce future citizens who are awa re and supportive of the work and role of the acf and hm armed forces d membership of the acf is an opportunity to have access to the armyʼs unrivalled ability to instruct interest and inspire young people as well as t enjoy some opportunities of challenge adventure and widening of experience as far as is practicable the acf is inclusive 20006 there is an essential need to counter any general misperceptions concerning the acf by presenting it in its role as national youth organisation that of fers varied interesting and personally challenging activities to young people regardless of thei r background it must be emphasised that the most popular appeal of the acf is it s youth service ethos particularly its contribution in terms of help advice companions hip having fun developing personal qualities exercising responsibility and enjoying valuable experiences reports should not be focused on the military side of the acf exclusively 20007 it should also be noted that the acfa is an operating authority for the duke of edinburghʼs award and through it and their acf activities both acf adults and cadets may gain btecscotvec awards
