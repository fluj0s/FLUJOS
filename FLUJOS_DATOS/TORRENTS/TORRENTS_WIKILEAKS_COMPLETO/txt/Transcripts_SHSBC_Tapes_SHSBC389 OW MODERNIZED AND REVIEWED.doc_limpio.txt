ow modernized and reviewed lecture given on 2 july 1964 thank you all right what have we got here have we got date audience second of july second of july there is date all right and this is the subject of ow modernized and reviewed now this lecture is given into the teeth of the fact that it is notorious that very few scientologists would ever inquire very deeply as to just exactly what was did this is given into the teeth of that knowledge and theres good reason for that in order to do something for somebody you have to have communication line to that person communication lines depend upon reality and communication and affinity and where an individual is too demanding the affinity tends to break down slightly and the scientologist is very afraid of breaking that affinity line with his pc and so he doesnt want to break that affinity line with his pc so he never then gets to the second stage of processing processing goes in two stages one is to get into communication with that or which you are trying to process thats number one and number two is do something for them and theres many many pc will go around raving about his auditor whose auditor has not done anything for the pc all that has happened is tremendous communication line has been established with the pc and this is so new and so novel and so strange to the pc that he then considers that something miraculous has occurred well yes something miraculous has occurred but in this particular instance the auditor has totally neglected why he formed that communication line in the first place he formed the communication line in the first place to do something for the pc and he very often mistakes the fact that he has formed communication line and the reaction on the pc for having formed one with having done something for the pc there are two stages here is 1 form communication line and 2 do something for the pc those are two distinct stages that is something like walking up to the bus and driving off do you see theres two stages you walk up to the bus and then you drive off if you dont drive off you never go anyplace so many an auditor bogs down at this one point of walking up to the bus which is putting in communication line with the pc and then they never go anyplace do you see that and where auditing broadly breaks down and you say well mamie glutz had lumbosis and were going to have to make list of scientology diseases thats one of them mamie glutz has lumbosis and she loves her auditor but shes still got lumbosis now exactly what has happened is the auditor has formed his communication line to the pc has actually done this heroic thing of getting in communication with the pc and that is very tricky and that is small shakes thats something to be able to communicate to human being who has never been communicated to before this is quite remarkable and that is such remarkable feat that it appears to be the end all of scientology to some but you see thats just walking up to the bus now weve got to go someplace now how do we go someplace well actually any upset that the individual has is so poised it is so delicately balanced it is so difficult to maintain you know you look at this fellow hes in wheelchair you know and you say to yourself how is he keeping himself in wheelchair and you think well itd be very difficult to get him out of that wheelchair oh its very difficult to stay in that wheelchair that is whats difficult unless you learn this reverse look youll have trouble with psychosomatics and things like this particularly battinesses more than psychosomatics psychosomatics are not good example battiness of some kind or another is much better example because they surrender so easily this individual is very sure that horses sleep in beds now you dont look at what it takes to maintain that that is based on such slippery logic that the least little cogwheel goes adrift in it itll collapse in other words its very hard to remain batty its not difficult to get well but its hard to remain batty fellow has to work at it youll see an odd look coming into somebodys eyes sometime or another when youre getting right close to and youll see pc suddenly start veering sideways from you when you start approaching too closely to piece of battiness lets supposing that having formed communication line we merely and only did this we just did this and we didnt worry about these vast complications and this terrific sea of aberration we didnt do anything like that we just said now what are you doing thats sensible and why is it sensible and you know guys case will just fall to pieces right in front of your eyes this is zone to which i invite your attention because its untrodden its virgin its native its the bush in completely unspoiled condition you see this communication line is only valuable to the degree that you can walk around in your big muddy feet in the midst of all this morass and if your communication line is very good and very smooth and if your auditing discipline is perfect so that you see your auditing discipline is perfect so you dont upset this communication line then you can walk around in this wild jungle that he calls his ideas and if you just made foray of more importance and more breadth than what are you doing thats sensible and why is it sensible and kept your communication line up the while and kept your affinity up with the pc the while did it with perfect discipline you would see more aberration fall to pieces per square inch than you ever thought could exist see now thats what i mean when im saying to you do something for the pc see i tell you audit well get perfect discipline get your comm cycle in dont arc break the pc let the cycles of action complete dont you see all of that well that is simply an entrance to the you see the discipline of scientology makes it possible to do this and one of the reasons why other fields of the mind never got anyplace and never could get near anybody because they couldnt communicate to anybody see so that discipline is important that is the ladder which goes up to the door and if you cant get to the door you cant do anything you see so theres two stages here two stages and youre busy completing communication cycles and so forth and i will admit sometimes i get impatient with you you see because im merely trying to teach you how to communicate to somebody so that you can do something for him you see and i sometimes believe that your whole attention gets tremendously absorbed in merely communicating with somebody see that and use that as an end all see and i get little upset because its something on the order of well lets say youre trying to make an actor you see its something like this and you get him all set on the subject of makeup you know but he keeps standing in the wings made up and thinks hes acting and he isnt hes standing in the wings see so this perfect discipline of which we speak the perfect communication cycle the perfect auditor presence perfect meter reading all of these various things are just to get you in state where you can do something for somebody and because this is so new strange and novel and is so unheard of in this universe it looks so startling that you can say well thats auditing thats processing thats it thats the end product man thats more the end product than can of dog food see i mean its still there in the can its supposed to be eaten you know its the difference between reading recipe book and dining so when youre real slow picking up the discipline when youre when youre real slow picking up keeping in communication cycle when youre pokey on this subject and so forth you see you just still nine miles from the ball you know youre not even attending yet see so what you want to be able to do is audit perfectly by that we mean keep in communication cycle be able to approach the pc be able to talk to the pc be able to maintain the arc get the pc to give you answers to your questions be able to read meter get the reactions be able to do this be able to do that all of those little things you see theyve all got to be awfully good because its very difficult to get communication line in to somebody anyway and they all have to be present and they all have to be perfect but if theyre all present and theyre all perfect then we can start to process somebody then we can start to process somebody and all of that looks so beneficial that you could mistake it for processing now im giving you some kind of an entrance point here of if all of your cycles were perfect if you were able to sit there and confront that pc and meter that pc and keep your auditing reports and do all these other multiple various things and keep pleasant smile on your face and not chop his communication and if you can do those various things now lets find out what do you do because there is something you do with those things well at level vi this is very easy you run gpms but thats doing something for somebody and try to run gpms sometimes without all these other factors near perfect its not possible but lets take it down to lower level what could you do for somebody if you were perfect auditor from the basis of your auditing technique and presence and handling somebody now what could you do thats the burning question what could you do now we used to have this all on backwards we used to try to teach people what they could do for somebody but they could never get in communication with him to do it see so therefore you had failures in processing well the most elementary procedure the most elementary procedure what are you doing that you think is sensible and why is it sensible thats perfectly elementary procedure and the guy would all of sudden gawp at you and hed say oh you know because these things are very difficult to maintain as an insensibility you have to work hard to have something in crosswise horses sleep in beds all right you say well what are you doing what do you think is sensible or what are you doing thats sensible or anything of this sort and the fellow says well i think horses sleep in beds thats sensible all right now why is that sensible well thats nuts see you actually wouldnt have to do anything more than that see see now one of the things thats horrible about all this is its so easy to do but you keep looking for some magic well your magic was getting into communication with the person the rest of it is very easy to do all you had to do is remain in communication with the person while youre doing this and realize that these huge boulders that hes got in his skull are poised with the most fantastically delicate balance on little pinheads see little pinpoint balance and all you have to do is go phooh like that and this thing goes brrooomm crash now if youre not in communication with this person he takes it as an accusative action he tries to justify thinking that way he tries to make himself look good to you he tries to put on public front of some kind or another sitting in the pcs chair he tries to hold up his status and any time i see bunch of pcs around jumping happily to something else because its only sane people can run on that you see and crazy ones run on something else well everybody immediately will have the same computation so they never have to be run on the crazy one i right away know their auditors are not in communication with them and that auditing discipline itself has broken down because the pc is trying to justify himself and trying to hold uphold his own status so he must be defending himself against the auditor so the auditor couldnt possibly be in communication with him could he so right back were right back to the fundamental of why didnt the auditor get into communication with the pc in the first place well you get into communication with the pc in the first place by doing the proper scientology discipline that is not any trick it is goes off one two three four you sit down and you start the session and you start talking to somebody and you start handling the pc and you start handling his problems and that sort of thing and you do it by completing your communication cycles and not cutting his communication and by this and by that the very things youre taught in the trs and youll find youre in communication with the person and where you fail and why he maintains his status is youve gotten into communication with the person and then youve never done anything for the person unless having gotten into communication you now do something for the person you lose of course your communication line because the r factor breaks down he doesnt think youre so good and you go out of communication with the person do you understand you can get into communication with the person then not do anything for the person the r factor of why you are in communication with the person can break down and break down with you you say well here i am in communication with the person what am i supposed to do now youll go out of communication with the person and youve somehow taken little circular trip which was in toward the person and then away from the person see all right that having happened now the person will be in sort of defensive and status and wonder why hes being processed and you see he could wonder all these questions it takes process now now youve got to do something for the person and it takes process but it takes an understanding of what process is and process is simply combination of mental mechanisms which by which when inspected will pass away all auditing is negative gain you never add anything to the case all auditing is subtractive youre as ising things on the case and thats all youre doing so you say all right what do you think is sensible the guy says horses sleep in beds ah hey that isnt sensible cognition total duration of process see was that you actually will get probably get big blowdown or something like that on your meter be huge blowdown on your meter now you try to get more tone arm action out of the fact that horses sleep in beds you dont get there you flattened the process so it requires sensitivity to know when the process is flat you can over audit and under audit you can try to run that tone arm action out of things which have tone arm action left in them and you can walk off and leave things which have ton of tone arm action left in them you can do one or the other of these things but this requires observation of the pc and it only answers this question have you done anything for the pc once more you only have to answer that question have you done something for the pc well if youve done something for the pc you are not likely to get any more tone arm action out of it now this is becomes elementary you see were breaking this down into 1 and 2 so 1 theres the auditing discipline and 2 theres doing something for the pc if youve done something for the pc youve gotten the tone arm action out of it it isnt that you really even do anything for the pc by having the tone getting the tone arm action out of it you see thats simply an indicator of whether youre doing anything or not this becomes im beating dead horse to death now dont you see because this is not its not that complicated thats its less complicated than anybody imagines you say to the pc whats sensible well he says oh well so well yes psychiatry and psychoanalysis and congressmen and elections and governments theyre all sensible and something is sensible and something else is sensible and so on and so on and theyre all sensible well lets observe the pc have you done anything for the pc yet well the funny part of it is that your tone arm is going to be moving during this period see we havent done anything really for the pc yet and he goes on and he says well my old teacher was sensible my old teacher used to tell well id never succeed in the world and he was right and he was sensible and youre still getting tone arm action see and he was i dont know was he sensible or wasnt he sensible i dont know you know i have done some things in life you dont suppose i could be failing all the time because he was so sure i would uhgnh this doesnt make any sense you know i think that man was blithering ass i think he was complete fool how would he know that i would never succeed in life hes silly i dont think he was sensible well forget about that being sensible well that that wasnt sensible that you know thats why i failed in life because he was so sure i would and i always thought he was so sensi well ill be of gun right about that moment your ta action goes bzzp bzzp zzp thup bup theres more ta action see now you knucklehead not having noticed i should be polite i laid down maxim always be polite to somebody who is trying to learn something you see you dont notice this one answer has come your way you have done something for him so now you start beating up the brush to do something for him this is very bad timing dont you see now you could go on with the process in some other way and some other field or some other channel but youve handled something and youve done something and if you keep him working on that one thing that he has now youve now done something for him on your ta action will disappear and your pc will get resentful and not only will your ta action disappear but youll lose your comm line now lets try to press him what about this old teacher see hes already had the cognition see wow see what about this old teacher when did you know him did you have any overts against him and so forth notice your ta ta is not moving youre now restimulating the pc youve gotten your key out destimulation factor has occurred right before your eyes youve done something for the pc now hear now its just matter of have you done anything for the pc or not and on any given subject when you have done something for the pc your ta action in that zone and area will cease if theres any ta action to be gained in that area while you are doing something for the pc you will get tone arm action but sooner or later it is going to run up to having done something for the pc see your ta action is about to do something for the pc you see that tells you that something there that can be done for the pc and your ta action will go on toward the point where you have done something for the pc and now this is past tense now youre going to get more ta action on his dear old teacher in pigs eye you are that is went proposition now so it requires of the auditor discipline to keep in his communication line hes got to stay in communication with his pc those cycles have got to be perfect he cant be distracting the pcs attention onto the ta im not getting any tone arm action now thats not staying in communication with the pc see has nothing much to do with it youre distracting the pc from his own zones and areas so dont keep his attention out of session you know keep him going on this keep that communication line in and the next requirement is do something for the pc do something productive use the communication line now that youve got the telephone in your hands for god sakes talk see theres nothing quite as silly as receiving transatlantic telephone call where the other person then doesnt talk they phoned you i got one not not month or two ago and the person actually at the other end of the line stood there with the live phone in their hand with nothing to say undoubtedly they had something to say but they just couldnt think of it at the time it finally got through and many an auditor who isnt getting result with pc is sitting there with the telephone in his hand not saying anything see hes got all the lines in hello hello are you there oh yes im here bright and cheerful oh oh see now too much astonishment to say anything to the pc see so we go back to putting communication line in see best thing to do is to call back central and find out if we really do have call to the pc see find out if it was the correct number after all call up the rate operator and find out how much its costing do you see you see you can walk right up you can walk right up to this crucial point and then die on the vine you can start getting tone arm action on the pc and then never press it home this thing all of sudden theres big drop he says something about you said well just lets take this weird little process whats sensible see and he says well the most sensible person i ever knew was my old instructor wiff you know youve got some tone arm you make note over here instructor it gave tone arm action and so on and so on and whats the question again sensible sensible what does sensible mean is sensible sensible word and so forth tone arm action there you see and you say well look there was bit of tone arm motion there when he said the old instructor you said something about this old instructor being sensible oh yeah oh terrifically sensible man more ta see well have you adopted any of his views or anything like that oh yes my whole life has been monitoring by the views you see see big ta going on and well go on this way and all of sudden hes he knew the pc was going to fail pc suddenly gets that in crosswise you see youll see big reaction and then the more reaction more reaction and then all of sudden the pc suddenly cognites maybe thats why im failing all the time i am blaug ow ow oh see yeah that guy is fool i didnt he wasnt sensible at all what do you know about that see big ta action occurs right before that moment and if youre riding right up on your toes you wont expect another whisper to come out of that old man you wont ask for another whisper to come out of it nothing thats gone that is dead thats as dead as yesterdays newspaper you see thats where the tone arm leads you into this and if i was trying to teach you totally mechanically id say you go ahead and make sure there is nothing flat in there but actually your communication line is at risk all the time youre trying to find out if anything else is in that your communication line is at risk youre liable to get unplug the whole switchboard well hell i told you i had the cognition you know i told you already i have how many times do i have to see there goes your communication line you see and after awhile youll get the point youll say look were pulling switches out of the switchboard here were messing things up and come off of it actually if youre very very clever youll run process that cyclically produces this sort of thing by general question so that you dont make that particular goof you dont have to make the piece of judgment which i just gave you all the time see it took long time and really it took as an auditor long time to learn when to give up on somebody you know learn when to give up on subject and i finally got clever and tuned my antenna up on martian wavelength and got it up to point where that thing was flat i could see that was flat see and where if i pursued it any further i would now get into trouble where i had done something for the pc and in trying to do anything further along that particular line would put my communication line at risk and i got to point where i could judge that just like that you know pc happy tone arm increasing every session everything going along swingingly but let tell you that it is very interesting point itd be something i would be very happy to be able to teach you but im afraid its something that you learn on the basis of observation now in level vi youre learning that there is nothing deader than dead item when it has give up its ghost there is more tone arm action there if there is any more cognition in it any more read in it yes yes you could get it out but you develop sensitivity after while as an auditor you know when it has given up its ghost and you know that just mentioning it or referring to it one more time is practically fatal your pc just feels like hes being ground into the dirt see just one more mention of that item and youve had it see and youll start to get tick tocky needle and other undesirable phenomena sets in and if you keep it up yeah well im not sure whether the item has read or not i didnt have my eye on the meter at the time calling pcs attention to the meter always if you want arc breaks i didnt have my eye on the meter and i dont really know whether it read or not and of course i must i must have seen it read before i can go on but maybe i missed it thats the one of the most marvelous arc breaky situations that i could possibly set up and yet its one of the commonest ones now lets take this same situation there was only so much charge see on this old instructor or something like that see there is only that much charge on it youve got it he wasnt an item he was lock of some kind or another but boy you blew it youve seen it blow youve seen the pc change before your very eyes now thats the time to unload thats the time to swing off that freight train and hit the gravel and grab another one not necessarily change the process but certainly dont press that guy any further in the direction of what has just given ta you could now ask him but theres ways of asking auditing questions that are part of communication line there is way of dismissing everything you have been talking about while asking the same question as you did before you know sort of like well all right weve taken care of that youve gotten all of that good good im glad weve got weve finished off with that all right now lets get back to the original process now whats sensible you get an idea there is thing an auditor can do he doesnt have to say all those things i just said but that is the way he is building the atmosphere you know he acknowledges on the idea oh that old tutor you had yeah all right well we got that good we got that lets so on you even do little business here about crossing it all off you know and all right now were getting back in the original process okay here you see now we say same auditing question we say whats sensible but he obviously knows that its now being addressed to some entirely different zone of the mind and as such you shift that youre still doing something for the pc you follow this so theres getting up to the bus and then theres getting in it and going someplace and you could become past master at auditing discipline and motions and so forth and actually have to be past master at it anyhow before you can carry on the rest of it never carry it another sixteenth of an inch have lot of pcs that absolutely loved you and swore by you who went right on having lumbosis and you would say what in the name of heaven has happened to what terrible catastrophe am i looking at here well everything is fine except youre not doing anything for the pc you got right up to there and got on the bus but you never drove off anyplace and you never did anything thats the whole secret of auditing its in two sections of course level vi you do it so fast that you hardly get chance to you call this and boom it goes and thats the end of it and of course there its predicted where the charge is going to be and you know whats going to fire and all that sort of thing so you say well this is something different it isnt any different at all cleverer auditing is below is below iv see youve got to be clever theres ways of asking auditing questions which is the same question which could make the pc believe implicitly that his answer had not been accepted im sure weve all had at one time or another this trouble weve repeated the auditing question and the pc thinks his cognition has been invalidated so then to prove to him that his cognition has not been invalidated we preserve our communication line by wildly changing process that is not flat as general process and that is one of the most flagrant examples and that is the most general reason why auditors run lots of processes they havent mastered the trick of convincing the pc that his cognition has been accepted and that theyre all done with that particular zone or area of the process and that the process that is being run is now expected to go into some other zone or area direction of attention this comes under you can do some pretty wild things with direction of attention you can exaggerate this up like mad pc says oh oh yes yes yes yes yes see youre asking sensible oh yeah textbooks yeah ho ho ho ho ho big blowdown see and you say whats with textbooks oh well good god you know they pretend theyre sensible and nobody can make any sense out of them at all gone that ta now is gone you understand it thats as far as youre permitted to pursue it youve now done something for the pc it isnt manifested in any degree that you will notice right there at that moment but how do you now convince the pc that your next same auditing question is not actually going to be addressed to textbooks well there are crude mechanisms for doing it all right weve taken care of textbooks now in some other zone or area whats sensible thats doing it with an axe we got your communication we consider that that particular zone or area is complete and were not asking you to do anything more in that zone or area because youve already gotten the tone arm action out of that now asking exactly the same auditing question but addressing it to some other zone or area of the mind whats sensible see this is the message which youre putting across in the middle of your communication line now you can make you could do some weird weird weird things with cases you its quite quite unbelievable what you can do with case steering him around in this particular zone on some general process now this is not running an alternate process this is really not running itsa this is merely finished method of handing process to pc is run him to cognition run him to cognition and thats actually not new its running the pc to cognition but its on the same thing and nearly everybody has understood running to cognition change the process when the pc has cognited well that is very far from true you change the sub subject of the process on the cognition you dont change the process your process can be far too specific it can be sub process right around the vicinity of this rug you see have you ever made footprint see well its so circumscribed as an auditing question that its really subquestion anyhow so what you really want to run on pc is broad question which youve already established and running to cognition is knocking off these sub cognitions on it now you take something as broad as whats sensible ooooh thats broad now of course putting footprints on this rug see thats sensible i dont know why its sensible he suddenly says but it doesnt seem to be any reason at all why i should put footprints do you know i see rug of this particular type and i always have to put footprint on it thats real crazy thats real crazy i think thats wadsworth or somebody footprints on the sands of time yeah it already yeah yes i learned the poem when i had scarlet fever yeah yeah there was rug in the room the same as the rug in this room oh thats what thats all about all right good youve had your blowdown all right that thats fine now aside from that and footprints and that sort of thing which weve got and so forth whats sensible see thats just parking it thats how to really smartly run by cognition you can be smarter than tack if you pursue this particular course but im warning you that that particular approach requires some sensitivity on the part of the auditor he has to ask himself this question continually what have i done for the pc i used to run an auditing session until i had done something for the pc you take shortattention pc particularly the session was exactly as long as it took to do something for the pc and horribly enough some of those sessions would go four or five hours and i had thought they would run as long as fifteen minutes but thats because we never got into the communication cycle necessary to do something for the pc and itd take maybe that long to establish communication line before we could start to ask the pc whats cooking see youll sometimes start asking an alternate question of pc back and forth and notice that the answers are dodgy these are dodgy answers well merely and completely recognize out of that dodginess just one thing that your communication line to the pc has failed in some particular way ill give you an example you start to process child you start to process child on the idea of what problems do you have youre going to youre going to process this child you see and the child is sitting there very dodgily answering this question and they appear to be very reluctant to answer the question you realize that this reluctance isnt really any withhold or anything its just that the child cannot talk to you then you suddenly realize that the process you should have started in on was what could you say to you maybe process the child on something very fundamental like what problems do you have and get place because you arent doing anything for the pc so therefore you get minimum tone arm action and so forth well you havent established communication line to the pc you shift your gears and ask something that has nothing to do well the child has been sick let us say and the child feels badly and theres lot of things wrong with this child and you shift off onto process such as what could you say to and what would you rather not say to and the you say well theres lots of mechanisms in this such as withholds coming off and all that sort of thing but the surprising thing about it is you now have tone arm action you now have session running because youre getting in your communication line at the same time youre incidentally getting off few withholds which is doing something for the pc too at the same time youre getting in communication line process like that tends to confuse you you see why itd be confusing because its putting in the communication line and its doing something for the pc at the same time well there are great many of these processes in scientology which get in the communication line and do something for the pc at the same time so therefore this breakdown of getting into communication with the pc and then doing something for the pc becomes obscured because youre doing them both at once and then you begin to become confirmed in the idea that getting in the communication line is whats doing something for the pc see so the whole subject now gets lost all over again even though you do then use combination that accomplishes both at once dont lose sight of the fact that there are two actions and you wont make very many mistakes along this line now all of this is really prelude to ow because ow is just about the greatest handy jim dandy little communication wrecker that an auditor ever had very much to do with and an auditor loses the arc he has with the pc time or two and he becomes very timid and he starts asking do you have any overts have you committed any overts and the pc says yes well i thought people were mean to and it was really an overt to think that against myself and the auditor says well he got off big overt and so forth and they will go on this way and on this way and on this way and on this way sort of motivatorish critical think you know and the auditor never tags it and never nails it and never does anything about it and never corrects it and nothing happens with the pc and the communication line doesnt improve because the pc is actually running falsity and it just winds up in pile of garbage you see we really never get anyplace so were really adventuring on something that is very very intricate when were adventuring on ow its not simple mechanism because although handled rightly it would put in the communication line at the same time it was doing something for the pc the auditor protects his communication line to the pc he protects his communication line to the pc by not asking anything embarrassing and he permits his pc to sit there with withholds in the session half arc broke with the communication line flying out the window and he never presses home to find one of these things out he can even get read on the meter that exists and never really ask for it because he doesnt want to risk his communication line so this makes ow dicey now another thing that made it dicey in the old days is the fact that withhold occurs in the bank and you should not use the word withhold of course withhold is an out of arc condition and its an out of arc process and actually cannot be run solo you can take an out of arc process and run it in combinations with an arc process you can say what have you done what have you not done you could say what have you said what have you not said you could say what have you thought what have you not thought or something like that but again thought is risky one because that also occurs in the bank but done fortunately really doesnt occur in the bank now ive told you that ow is senior to the bank now this might lead you to believe that once youd got the bank gone youd still have ow this is not the case it is senior in that it will key out the bank now lets look at this little more intimately and find why it keys out the bank because the whole common denominator of the bank would be done thats the common denominator of the whole reactive bank in other words high order of lock and anybody who knows the constituency of the bank could look those things over and hed certainly say heh heh yeah thats true its just high order of lock dont you see so its lock on all parts of reactivity now when we specify what things have been done to we err because we might run into another piece of the bank you see so the generalized statement or common or the proper name of somebody is quite allowable we find our pc has present time problem with oswald perfectly proper to say what have you done to oswald were not running into any bank because he hasnt got oswald as part of the basic reactive mind men that might be different that might be too close in but this guy oswald what have we done to oswald now wed find weirdly enough that the communication line to oswald will have been interrupted because of an overt to oswald so therefore one couldnt communicate to oswald present time problem is also produced by failing to complete communication there is really one for the book thats something i dont think ive told you ive known it for long time but i just think ive omitted mentioning it i might have i might have mentioned it but i doubt it present time problem can be created by failure to complete communication cycle this is so much the ease that if your pc coming into session were asked you were to ask your pc coming into session is there any communication you havent completed the pc would rattle off several and the pc would not register on present time problem this is another method of handling ptps they tend to vanish under this now youre not trying to erase the ptps anyway all youre trying to do with these ptps is get them out of the road so that you can audit somebody you never erase in rudiments anyway actually you never erase in anything below level vi now so your action here is destimulative action and that question all by itself will adequately destimulate the pc so the pc can be audited youll find it very seldom that you will fail to get around present time problem with that question of course the problem can still be there but the pressure is gone on it now i got ptps the pc says you say well what communication have you failed to complete or havent you completed with regard to these and the pc says brrow brrow brrrow brrow brrrow brrow and thats the end and you dont get none that will register on ptp that would be common experience now the reason he has ptps with these people and hasnt completed the communication is because hes got overts so we get the secondary consideration on ptps you never have ptp with anything you dont have an overt on of course thats primary really your ptps stem from overts if you have an overt against telephone pole you will have ptp with telephone pole see something like this psychosomatics go back to ptps which go back to overts so you can actually run out psychosomatics on this but its rather adventurous undertaking youre liable to get the pc into more than you can easily get him out of but you can in extremis handle psychosomatic illness on the basis that it must be present time problem see the guy has got lumbosis all right there then you immediately you have two approaches the least adventurous of these approaches and the swiftest one to handle is the guy has got lumbosis of the of the blumjum and you say well what communication havent you completed to or about the blumjum oh well thats simple i had an appointment at the hospital and waf waf saf saf naf and i had an appointment there and i was supposed to go to the drugstore and then get some stuff and so forth and i actually i was telling my aunt maisy the other day about the blumjum was very obstructive mechanism as far as i was concerned and i didnt finish the letter and what the somatic is gone what happened the pc is liable to be very startled at this point because they are apparently not talking about anything that had anything to do with doing something for the blumjum thats what i mean by its very very difficult to keep lumbosis around it is it takes lot of doing so we have these two approaches not just one the unfinished cycle of communication to or about the it the unfinished cycle of communication to or about the object that youre trying to handle which is ptp guy has present time problem with internal revenue well we dont much care about wondering and settling this problem but we certainly want him less obsessively concerned with it so lets do something to get rid of this problem all right the easiest pitch is an unfinished cycle of communication and the second one is done and let call to your attention you have now followed out the exact one two that i gave you for the auditor to pc see this is the way the mind stacks up now its quite sensational just getting communication line straightened out to something this is quite sensational it doesnt really finish off everything there is to finish off it is merely sensational so the best thing to ask pc who has ptp the best thing to ask this pc to get rid of his ptp is what cycle of communication have you failed to complete with regard to this to it or about it see hes given you present time problem present time problem with my wife all right what cycle of communication have you failed to complete or have you not completed better wording to your wife or about your wife hm and it all sort of goes bzz bzz bzz and an awful lot of the time this problem evaporates as problem but you havent taken very much care of this problem yet because youve approximated the one two of the auditor you see youve really not done anything about the problem youve just eased it off see youve gotten in there so that you could do something about it but you will very often find out quite magically that for the purposes of destimulation and getting on with the session on what you were doing yesterday and so forth that its quite adequate and youll very often find that in the field of psychosomatic auditing that its quite adequate the severity of the illness has nothing whatsoever to do with the ease or difficulty of its release these two things are not comparable youll find some guy with some sniffling little sinus condition that merely nags him that takes thousand hours of itsa before it finally surrenders and this other bird has got busted back and cant even move his feet and you might cure the whole thing up in five minutes dont ever measure dont ever measure the length of auditing by the violence of the condition because they are not necessarily in keeping one after the other theyre not so anyway theres your first chance just with an auditor an auditor can sometimes sit down and audit pc for few minutes he just gets in his communication line you see the other fellow finds out theres somebody he can talk to the auditor with his good discipline and everything and all of sudden the guy feels wonderful see and he says well its all settled now and the auditor says wait minute that cant be i didnt do anything you know well thats true but as far as this guy is concerned its all settled hes found one human being out of the whole sun moon or stars he could talk to and this was enough to momentarily key him out and make him feel better perfectly adequate action and then you go around waiting for this miracle to happen again dont you see well the miracle maybe wont happen for many pc because of course what the missing thing was is you didnt do anything for this first pc and you knew it so you get lazy and you expect to go on through auditing not doing anything for people and have them feel marvelous i think thats the one shot clear and so on you see if that existed wed all be out of work so you can bless your stars it doesnt but you occasionally get this type of reaction youll get somebody reading just reading book on scientology and all of sudden going well all over the place you see well thats because somebody understands them or somebody knows what its all about or somebody has put his finger on what the score is with life and just the fact that this data could exist all of sudden gives guy resurgence and he gets out of his sick bed this has happened many many times but thats just the first step see thats the communication step now this other step when it doesnt occur automatically you want to be able to do something about it you dont go around expecting the accident to happen all the time you see so you ask this let take it up in the most elementary session form possible terribly elementary session form and that is do you have present time problem oh well yeah oh boy do i have oh oh man you should ask all right well is there any communication you have not completed with regard to those problems oh brr brrzz brzzzz brzzzz brzzz brzzz brzzz brzzz brrzzz brzzz problem is all gone you say what magic how marvelous all right thats fine thats fine but remember what you have just done is the lick and the promise see you have not gone any more fundamentally into it than that now supposing you were in the horrible condition of having said what communication have you failed to complete about those present time problems and the pc says oh well none of that would do any good nothing one couldnt you know thats it now what do you do your favorite card trick has laid an egg now where do we go well theres number two you see you should realize that up to this point you havent done number two you havent done anything for the pc so this second one is done you see doing something is mostly done see they rhyme they go together very nicely now why because its the highest common lock of the whole reactive mind if he has present time problem with something he has overts against it and if you really want to do something about these things now you had better get off those overts and if this has been getting in your way consistently and continuously youd jolly well better get off of those overts you better get them off of that case man because they are big and they are flagrant and they are mad if your card trick wont work of what communication have you failed to complete i keep saying failed to complete you should never use fail as an auditing command its an old habit what communication have you not completed or havent you completed you got the other one the other one now thats doing something for pc and theres such vast difference between the amount of skill required between saying to somebody what communication hasnt been completed see brrrrdada da da it doesnt upset him its not embarrassing theres social status challenged here youre improving his communication so your communication with him improves it requires nothing of your auditing discipline see thats the lazy long sleep why because its really just step one again now youre going to have to done and man that takes auditing that takes some auditing i know of seventeen different ways that you might have to approach case in order to get off its series of overts to actually throw out of the existence all of the pcs upset about it and you might have to use every single one of them there are lots of them theres overts in chains there is the subject of recurring withholds theres the subject of the recurring overt theres the subject of the getting the basic basic of something the formulation of the proper question to ask so that this can get pretty complicated weve had all that technology here over period of time lot of you are here who have been here before and so forth have sweat it out but its very valuable technology some individual keeps telling you that he threw mud at car when he was sixteen and this is an overt and he gives you this overt and he gives you this overt and he gives you this overt nothing happens but he keeps telling you this overt well now you have to know what is happening here and know what to do about it otherwise hell just keep on giving you the overt this is part of chain of overts this is whats known as recurring overt and the trouble with it is is youre nowhere near its basic and now you have to be able to codify the question necessary to get the basic of the chain and you have to be able to audit this sort of thing by chains and this can become very interesting indeed and then you have to be prepared to find overt as the bottom of the chain and that is one of the more mysterious things the guy has always believed that he had an overt there and none was there theres that phenomenon which can hold chain in another is theres plenty to know about this but man is basically good despite his reactive bank the reactive bank is only composed to make man commit overts which is against his better nature if he commits these overts therefore hell trap himself because he wont go on communicating having committed them so its the perfect trap you do not want to talk to people you have wronged i very im very shy of letting anybody wrong not because they will do any damage because they can sure cut themselves up they commit an overt act dont you see and then they will try to withhold and sever the communication line for fear that they will commit another overt act that actually is the fundamental think of man after awhile he goes out of control and he just starts dramatizing and then you have the murderer and the thief and the rest of the fellow who has responsibility or anything hes actually left the human race at this by this time but along some line that individual will still have sensibility he will still be sensible in his responsibility in some zone or quarter and in handling such person an auditor has to be terrifically good he has to find some zone in that persons existence that that person could commit an overt on oh the person has slain cities full of people dont you see and hes done this and hes done that put any put any crime on the book this person has done this crime without the least qualms ah well the auditor contest there is to find what you see hes totally out of communication with everything thats why he can commit the crimes hes gone hes just dramatizing hes not even there hes wooof all right youve got to find as an auditor some zone he can still commit an overt against what overt would be real to this individual and youll find some little corner of his existence is still an overt now theres other ways to build up overts in an individual you say all right what have you done what have you done and the individual will give you perhaps something which is rather banal statement you can ask him well why was it all right to do that and he will give you lot of justifications and so forth theres that approach now what terrible vicious mean thing this is another thing you see just done is just done you know what have you done well ive eaten breakfast thats perfectly adequate answer to the question see but what mean vicious thing have you done now this would be another branch that we call overts see just what have you done that can be used that can be used all by itself as an auditing question what have you done but you wouldnt really except if you were educated your pc into answering the question under some special connotation you really wouldnt get nothing but overts you see but its perfectly valid to do that to get such answers and so forth the only modification which you require are what are you absolutely sure you have done now let tell you why that is vitally necessary that you understand these two branches of done one of what have you done that is socially reprehensible that will prevent you from communicating and doing something else thats what we call an overt and the other one is just having taken an action in the direction of thats just done see it means just that it means having taken an action in the direction of see nothing significance with regard to it at all now if we run just plain done on the individual we could be totally knuckleheaded as an auditor and not guide the individual in any way and he would immediately start doing something else now what would he start doing he would start looking for the explanation hes running process youre running youre saying what have you done what have you done what have you done and the pc is longer running that process now hear now this is the big liability of this done the pc now starts looking for an explanation for what has happened to him and hes now running the process explain what has happened maybe this will explain what has happened to you might as well be asking explain what has happened to you explain what has happened to you explain what has happened to you thats the process hes running hes running explain what has happened to you but youre running what have you done now unless youre aware of the fact that almost any pc under the sun will convert the process done to explain what has happened to you you will never be able to run pure done on pc if you dont know this then you cant run done on pc hell convert it he starts looking for the explanation and he will start inventing things he has not done in order to get rid of the consequences which he is experiencing hes trying to find good enough overt to explain what is occurring in his life now there there is your considerable difference in these processes and what an auditor has trouble with there then well recapitulate very rapidly an auditor then has trouble differentiating between communicating with the pc and doing something for pc and then when he gets into running done he doesnt want to sacrifice his communication line in order to press home any nasty personal little facts you see so he never really presses home his question and the next action is he runs into the square brick wall of the pc doesnt run the process the pc runs explain what has happened well fellow is subject to continuous headaches so he will actually in desperate condition start giving you fictitious deeds fictitious deeds hell very often go on to the far backtrack to give you fictitious deed you always want to beware of that because you know at once that this happens that the individual has done this to you i shot fifteen praetorian guards in rome ah ugh hoo oh that is not an answer to the auditing question because the auditing question is understand what do you jolly well damn well know youve done but what auditor is going to sacrifice his communication line by cutting up pc down in shooting him down in flames to that degree youll listen to couple of these but all right steer it back to where it belongs because hes looking for an explanation he isnt trying to find what hed done all you want is what are you certain youve done bud thats all the answer you want what are you what are you real certain what do you know absolutely that you have done you could work gradient scale up from i know ive eaten breakfast in fact i know that sometime during the last year ive eaten yes what have i done what am i absolutely certain i know i know ive spent some money i know i must have spent some money in the last few days i dont really have any exact recollection of any money but i have less money now than then so therefore i must have spent some money in the last few days all right well do you know youve spent some money in the last few days well that this is an actual auditing sequence you see do you know youve spent some money in the last few well i must have because i have less money now well that is youre just computing that you spent some money in the last few days do you know that you spent any money in the last few days come on what where did you spend some money in the last few days oh my god you ask question like that i oh ooo hum m mm m m hmmmm done hum m m sixpence i spent sixpence for lolly all right good enough heres the next question what have you done well well well lets see what have i done what have i done lets see lets see starts squeezing his head little bit what have i done so on well i was headsman once that worked up in the tower and i missed ann boleyns head and hit her with the flat of the head with an axe you know what hes what hes figured out he tried to answer the question he got headache so he tried to explain why he had the headache so he reaches back into the fast past and he gets some uncertain piece of something so he tries to offer you something that is enough overt to give him that much headache and thats why its very difficult now youll find that people who answer the question that way the test is do they ever get well they have an awful time they have pretty bad time now it isnt actually whether they did do it or didnt do it its their degree of certainty on having done it see and i can very easily go 500 years ago back into france and give you the name rank and serial number of lot of things see and i can give these things to you but after ive run few of them i start running into lets see was her name mary or was it marie or was it and did that happen at agincourt or was that at poitiers and next thing you know im in fog and if i go on this way very long ill start wondering whether i even was alive yesterday because i havent entered it from zone of certainty see ive entered it from zone of dim recollection or something like this you know so done is built up on gradient of certainty not built up on gradient of explanations of what is happening to the pc or has happened to the pc you might even convert the question so that its what are you quite positive that you have done you want to be careful about saying absolutely certain see its criticism of the pc or even the pcs memory but that pc is actually trying to explain something or they wouldnt be shooting back on the backtrack trying to give you an explanation see thats the thing youve got to watch thats the thing youve got to be awful careful of because theyre going to dig themselves in in an awful hurry so again you wouldnt be doing anything for the pc by running done so again it comes under the heading of doing something for the pc well theres lot of things you could do with pc without doing anything for the pc theres lot of phenomena that you can achieve without achieving anything for the pc you can turn on some very very handsome somatics at one time or another on pc without turning them off too so anyway youve got problem here in doing something for the pc because youre liable to be doing and the pc is doing b and then you go on doing while the pc is doing b and then somewhere down the line you wind up in hell of mess and you say well what happened well the pc never did what you said so you didnt do anything for the pc there was in actual fact barrier to your willingness to do something for the pc but there must have been tremendous barrier to your understanding of what was going on that you could ask and the pc answered b in itself showed the auditor observation was very poor so therefore the auditor wasnt in communication with the pc so again the communication factor was out so once more we werent doing anything for the pc now this is where the thing adds up now if youre going to communicate with the pc if youre going to communicate with the pc its to the end of doing something for the pc now if your communication with the pc is good youll wind up then in position to do something but having gotten in position to do something for heaven sakes now do something see dont halfway do something or partially do something this isnt difficult what im talking to you about its just putting things in their right boxes in their right compartments dont ever think because the pc likes you and everything is going along fine and you get along together so well that youre doing something for the pc youre communicating well to the pc so in communicating very well to the pc you now have an opportunity to do something for the pc but then your own communication channel to the pc could go out and you could be asking the pc and be getting answers for b and then again you wouldnt do anything for the pc if there was second place where it can break down now youre just the gist of the situation then is that ow is liable to be the most productive zone or area for big recovery on the part of the pc providing the auditor knows how to steer it and will steer it and isnt being too tender about it theres dozens of ways to run this sort of thing you can get in there and you can say all right what big overt have you committed in this lifetime that was to take ow from the version of overt you know so on all right what overt have you committed what big overt have you committed in this lifetime think think think think think think think think think well i upset joe yes yes that was about the biggest overt in this lifetime i really upset joe all right fine you think youve gotten someplace now of course you havent gotten anyplace your tone arm hasnt moved theres been cognition theres been nothing like this this thing is in situation where there can be set up in dozen different ways you havent gotten anyplace yet but youve gotten big overt now you think perhaps that his having told you now should somehow or another magically discharge this thing why should it magically discharge it he hasnt answered the auditing question for one thing he doesnt think it was an overt what big overt have you committed in this lifetime well this horrible thing i did to joe and he tells you what it is rather proudly and you say well ow doesnt work because nothing happened man you didnt even get your big toenail wet on the side of the pacific the sixty four dollar question now is well why wasnt it an overt oh well it wasnt an overt because joe is heel and because of this and because of that and so forth and he deserved it and its the common thing to do in those circumstances everybody expected to do it and of course it was natural that i would because i have reactive bank and it forced to do it and that guy can go on for some time on the justification of this overt and youll start to get tone arm action tone arm action tone arm action now youre watching the increase of responsibility along certain zones or lines and this person has not flattened the process because he has not come up to cognition or recognition of anything yet but hes sure working on it and that tone arm is moving and its moving and its moving and so forth and were going along on this and after all joe really was heel and he wrote nasty letter once which was greh tajub rub and it was absolutely inevitable and impossible that i would have done anything else but this because everybody expected to do this dont you see and if i hadnt done this it would have committed an overt against great many other people now on this overt against joe is it really an overt after all and so on all of sudden the guy is liable to get this little sensation of the glee of insanity or something like that as far as it goes im not kidding you its sort of glee of insanity that starts coming off the surface and so forth and some little corner of him is taking look at this thing you know he says that there was some part of that that was an overt mostly against myself of course because and guy will actually worry that and worry that and worry that now im not im not prepared to tell you how many hours he could go on worrying this producing tone arm action all the way i dont know it might be twenty five hour intensive on one overt dont you see until you get the thing worn down and eventually all of sudden he says well even though it could have been explained you know that was hell of thing to do to joe i shouldnt have done that to joe id completely forgotten id completely forgotten i had it completely in my choice whether i did it or didnt do it and i did it whoo yes yeah i committed an overt against joe yeah boom pswwwww you see it blow and you wont get another scrap of ta out of that whole thing you got one done see one done off the pc see there are numerous ways to handle these things now while you have him going through all of this and so forth particularly as his being scientologist he may know all the ropes keep him guided into this channel and keep him going right on down the line and keep your communication channel and so forth open to the pc during this period of time thats all trick thats all takes some doing but in the final analysis you will have done something for the pc for the pc not to him now there is there is the auditing of ow now lot of this lecture i apparently have not been talking to you much about the process of ow ive been talking to you about the version and guises of auditing but unless these things are understood in their proper relationship one to another you will never run any ow and never get any overts off anybody and really never get any withholds off anybody you know you have to know the technology you have to know how to audit and you have to yourself be in communication with the pc to know how to handle this situation now all the way along the line of what ive been talking to you about you are raising the cause level of the pc all the way along the line you are raising the cause level of the pc you do these things fairly slippily fairly expertly youre raising the cause level of the pc and hes walking right up and hell be able to as is more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more your pc will be changing under your eyes your pc doesnt come into session with so many ptps your pc is much more able to get the show on the road the pc is this and the pc is that and youre seeing this this thing progress dont you see now you could go into done in numerous other categories id swear i dont know if you piled up all the bulletins on the subject of ow and running withholds and chains and all of this kind of thing man if you stacked those all up together you wouldnt be able to hardly look over the desk theres lots of technology you dont need all that technology perhaps but its very nice to have it if youre going to be very expert along these lines why there it is because the mind is quite funny in the various ways that it works very often you get tremendous failure in this particular field in trying to direct somebody to do something in this field they dont understand some of these ramifications ive been pointing out to you ive asked somebody girl is lying dying in hospital for apparent reason or something of this sort and somebody asks frantically frantically theyll say you know over long distance line or something of this sort what can we do to bring this girl back to life and so forth and frankly its not with any hope at all that i tell them what they can do because i know that ordinarily they wont consider it heroic enough id tell them the exact fact of what to do in such ease as that the exact thing to do was find out what her family doesnt know about that actually was enough they were in sufficient communication with the girl in this particular case that was enough to have gotten her out of that bed and back on her feet again it wasnt that i knew anything she had done but i just knew from the sudden discussion of it that having retreated from home to this and then gone to that point and then suddenly gone to hospital with exclamation point and fireworks and lying there dying from apparent reasons or causes and so forth that obviously there was withhold there and that would have taken enough off the edge of it dont you see because i knew that any situation like that matter how heroic it appears must have been terribly hard to maintain that situation like that is so unnatural you see well look at how hard somebodyd have to work at it to put it all together this way and its just like any other complex situation you touch one corner of the house of cards and down itll come well thats the good point to touch some stranger saying to the person you know what doesnt your family know about the girl might have opened up well they dont know i had this affair with bill and so forth and that im enceinte and then all of sudden it felt much better dont you see and says what am i lying here dying for you know and got out of bed because people people look at the heroicness of the condition they always add it up that it must be an heroic comparable action and its not it might be very complex the reasons theyre there but the very complexity makes it untenably hard to hold on to it madman down here in an asylum he has hell of time poor fellow must work day and night staying in there he just must work overtime you can see him now i will be ferocious you know the point of entrance on the thing its just actually the same points ive been talking to you about you get into communication with him and you ask him whats sensible see or you ask him what hes done or ask him what hes withholding and youll just see it crack up in front of your eyes and thats actually the magic of the world of auditing thats the magic that can be done with auditing and you get the long grind situation it looks like long grind to you because you say what have you done ive murdered the local vicar and youre stopped right there where do you go from there you have responsibility you have nothing and so forth so recently we have developed ways of handling these responsibility its actually new development and compartmented them out so theyre much more easily handled well i wish you lots of luck with it but when i ask you to get some withholds off somebody or get some overts off somebody or raise somebodys cause level now at least you know what i am talking about thank you male voice thank you
