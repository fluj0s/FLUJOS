from sarah raper sraperueaacuk to tar13metogovuk subject chapter 13 review date fri 23 jul 1999 195244 0100 cc mnoguermetogovuk pvanderlindenmetogovuk comments on ch 13 scenarios from tom wigley page and line numbers are from the may 14 zero order draft dear contributors to ch 13 here are my comments on your chapter i think you all know well enough that you will not be offended by my occasional bluntness the chapter needs lot of work not surprisingly but it has at least touched most of the bases it suffers from lack of overview perspective making the detail hard to wade through i was disturbed by the lack of credit given to magiccscengen since this software already addresses many of the key issues that arise in scenario development apologies for not proof reading this by the time i got to the end of typing it id had enough page 3 lines 8689 critically this information doesnt give full assessment of uncertainties 3 110115 sentence too long 3 117 state illuminate uncertainty earlier since this is primary purpose of eg magiccscengen 3 118 indeterminate is far too strong 4 124125 not clear 4 155 what is integrated assessment define andor explain earlier 5 170 clumsy grammar 5 171172 silly scenarios per do not have any uncertainty associated with them by definition they are however very if not the most useful tool for assessing and quantifying uncertainties for example primary purpose of magiccscengen is to quantify uncertainties major text revision is needed to clarify this point part of the problem here is that the boundary between scenarios and predictionsprojections is indistinct as is the distinction between predictions and projections this too needs to be clarified one could argue that scenarios developed using magiccscengen are actually better predictions of some aspects of future climate change than any oagcm results certainly scenarios based on scaling are much more than just scenarios as defined here they are true predictions based on some assumed scenario this is the correct word here for future emissions substantial work is required to the present text to clarify these issues they are the crux of the matter 5 178179 note earlier that scenarios word i will continue to use even though it may be inappropriate in many cases usually define changes in climate they are not in these cases scenarios but scenarios of change strict ie absolute scenarios are then constructed from them by adding the changes to baseline climatology this needs to be explained up front 5 187 delete and art this is derogatory term likely to be misinterpretedmisrepresented 6 220 comma after scenarios the text contains many stylistic and grammatical errors the most common being the failure to isolate parenthetical clauses i will assume that someone with better grasp of grammar will catch all these at some stage so i will not comment further on them 6 225 critical item missed here is intervariable consistency later consistency between climate and co2 is mentioned but there is mention of consistency between eg temperature and precipitation etc this is major issue 7 257 instrumentallybased analogue scenarios were first introduced by wigley et nature 1979 credit should be given also the usdoe state of the art sic reports 1985 and the bolin et scope report 1986 both review this and other methods this reviews should be cited 7 267268 what does extrapolating mean 7 296 wigley et 1979 should also be cited here 8 306 nevertheless they may do better job of getting the intervariable correlations right than gcms 8 315 delete questionable this word is entirely unnecessary here more importantly the authors need to be more careful in their choice of words since there are many critics out there who will be looking for things that can be taken out of context misinterpreted or misrepresented 8 344345 control run so what this is only relevant if the control is used in scenario development this raises the issue of definition 1 versus definition 2 for defining climate change terminology introduced by santer et 1994 jgr later this difference is attributed to cubasch et but it was first clearly enuncited by santer et the difference is whether or not one subtracts the control from the perturbed result more needs to be said about this it is often assumed that subtracting the control will remove any spurious drift in the perturation experiment this of course is clearly wishful thinking both priori and as shown by raper and cubasch 1996 basically there is way to reliably remove drift in perturbation experiment which makes it all the more important to have driftfree models flux adjustments do not necessarily remove drift just look at some of the echam controlrun results there are some very important issues here central to the use of oagcms in scenario generation they need better coverage more is said later but this is still inadequate 9 357 yes they can be different but so what the issue is whether the differences are statistically significant to my knowledge one has addressed this issue properly 9 358 im sure at least i hope you dont mean observed the issue is the difference between the equilibrium patterns of change and the modelled not observed transient patterns of change 9 to 361 youve missed the most inportant point the advantage of an equilibrium result over an oagcm result is that the former is pure signal 9 to 376 the definition 1 versus definition 2 issue is relevant here 9 379 please dont propogate garbage the issue here is natural internally generated variability there is need for such variability to be chaotic so you should eschew use of this word 9 to 387 i presume here that you are talking about oagcms you should not use just gcm you must be specific also youve missed some vital points the natural internal variability problem ie output is signal plus noise noted elsewhere but must be stated here and the modelspecific natureof the climate sensitivity 10399 please give credit to the first work on this santer et 1990 i should point out that this was actually my idea 10404406 totally unclear 10420421 poor wording should be to which changes are added 10423 delete appropriate 10429 insert based after period 10431 weather generators comes as non sequitur here in any event you havent said what they are 10435437 so what the issue is what period one is measuring the impacts from in most cases it will be some nominal presentday so the baseline climatology must refer to the same period whether or not the period has some sulphate effect in it is utterly irrelevant 10437438 what garbage see above 11448450 more garbage think about it the reason 1990 is not so useful as reference period is because the impacts variable is probably not adequately definable over single year you have really messed up this issue 11460 yet more garbage given what i have tried to explain above it is ludicrous to consider daily data as part of the baseline climatology the impacts variable may require daily data from baseline period in order to define its reference level but probably not but this is not the same thing either all this is very badly worded or you dont know what your doing 11468 think about it 11470 this is not the reason 11473 not observed which is past or present but future data 11482483 duplication 12to 492 this is very confused paragraph 12497499 wrong for upper air their is major paper by santer et jgr 1999 which also touches on some surface issues there are also number of papers by trenberth that are relevant 12507 again introduction of an undefined termconcept downscaling 12510 at last mention of changes sadly it is inappropriate here since this is not the reason 12514 why should this figure be here 12518 wrong as scenario this could be justified you are confusing scenario as you have defined it which i have already criticized with predictionprojection 12521 see above 12525527 this is the def 1 vs def 2 issue however you have the history and motivation wrong 12527531 wrong this issue has nothing to do with cold start vs warm start it is to get over the drift problem which it fails to do 12537 not especially mor appropriate may be but only 13543 were grammar 13543545 not clear 13552553 not clear 13579581 so what given your definition of scenario this doesnt matter 14594 why use perceived 14604 this issue was first raised by kim et 1987 it was first addressed in credible manner by wigley et 1990 14606 appending is ridiculous word to use try adding 14608 often to usually 14613 appended to added 14616 appended to added 14617 appended to added 14627628 please cite the key initial papers by kim et and wigley et 15635636 clumsy sentence 15638 isnt the word physical usually used the process does not just involve dynamics 15642648 mention of 1way vs 2way nesting needed here 15657659 you have failed to mention the most important reason for using lams orographytopography 16667 please cite the key initial papers by kim et and wigley et 16673 predict and to predictand 16679683 once again you fail to mention the main advantage viz that statistical downscaling involve realworld data and so ensures that intervariable relationships are realistic of course these relationships may change but lams dont even get the correct relationships for the present 1670317716 these are very important results they need far greater emphasis 17720 in australia or anywhere for that matter 17723724 see eg wigley 1999 pew report and material cited therein 17725 mulitple 17730732 not clear 17739740 this sentence sounds stupid rephrase 17744 you cannot say most areas and then cite only agriculture cases 17748 the first clear exposition of this is in the oftcited paper by wigley nature 1985 see also later paper in climate monitor 17755756 i disagree both methods have strengths and weaknesses 18770 at last definition of weather generators 18778779 unclear 18798 what means more definitive 18803 wilks to wilks 18805 hence the work is irrelevant in the present context delete irrelevant text 19to 821 most of the agriculture studies dealing with the effects of variability changes are flawed since they fail to separate the lowfrequency effect of induced changes in winter soil moisture levels from the specific effect of withingrowingseason variability changes 19826839 since this should refer back to lines 823824 this whole section amounts to giant non sequitur 20880 one could be much stronger than this the use of high spatial resolution information is more than just warranted it is absolutely essential however there is another approach that you have failed to mention at all this is upscaling of the impacts model there is some relevant work on this in papers by jarvis and mcnaughton and vice versa another related approach is the direct modelling of spatial patterns of agricultural yield as in work by wigley and qipu which relates yield patterns to climate patterns presumably one could apply similar approach to direct modelling of river flow these approaches complement the rather boring direct approach of downcsaling and they may well circumvent some of its problems 20898 under this comes model errors sensitivity uncertainties aerosol forcing uncertainties lag uncer tainties regionalization versus globalmean uncertainties 21905 lesser or greater than what 21916 adequacy is not the right word hoe about appropriateness 21928 i disagree reanalysis data for precipitation are simply not good enough and precipitation is the key variable in most impact areas also in the regions where scenario data are most needed real observational data are available reanalyses largely provide useful new data in regions where data are not needed the authors seem not to have thought this through 21to 931 there are two papers by wigley conference proceedings edited by hanisch which address the issue of the relative magnitudes of different sources of uncertainty in globalmean projections emissions aerosol forcing carbon cycle other trace gases climate sensitivity these papers are singularly relevant to this section 21939 actually the range for total emissions is from 79 to 290gtcyr for fossil co2 emissions the range is 65 to 288gtcyr 21943 not just timedependent evolution but anything that has specific time attached to it 22948 the reference to alcamo et here seems either perverse or ignorant recall that the topic is climate scenarios in this context magiccscengen is far better suited to exploring the consequences right down the line of emissions uncertainties 22959960 magiccscengen already does this at the globalmean level furthermore at least three oagcms have fully embedded sulphur cycles already 22968 specifications is the wrong word these things are not specified 22970 determine to have 22972 see also wigleys pew report 1999 22974976 not straightforward this really is utter garbage in magiccscengen this is extremely easy and straightforward 22985 ah the 1way2way nesting issue surfaces at last 22989990 see above 23999 actually this issue was first raised in santer et 1990 it has also been addressed in papers by wigley and palutikof probably before anyone else 2310101011 the wording here is not quite right 231022 first done in santer et 1990 231030 if one assumes stable patterns which has been shown to be okay for the co2 component of change then the snr problem can be minimized by using changes over long time interval 231033 this average response method was alluded to in santer et 1990 it was first implemented in escape and later in magiccscengen good illustration of the method including some relevant discussion of it is given in the wigley pew report 1999 one of the critical aspects of this method which is not even mentioned here is that the results must be normalized by the globalmean temperature before averaging 241040 is this the acacia program run out of ncar this program was established some years ago and it would be extremely confusing if there were two programs with the same acronym 241047 not few but many cmip1 241060 rations to ratios 2410601062 not clear 241073 what means nonstandard forcing in my view something like is92a forcing would be standard whereas 1 compound co2 is nonstandard ie unrealistic and artificial 2410761078 really why i think this statement is wrong there are number of ways to determine snr values from single oagcm run note the continuing confusing use of gcm instead of oagcm 241085 i dont think uncertainties is quite the right word here input emissions scenarios which are scenarios in the strict sense of the word do not directly address uncertainty issues although they can with some trepidation and not inconsiderable amount of ingenuity be used to define uncertainties by the way as far as i can see the only scenario development methodsoftware that does address the input and uncertainty issues is magiccscengen 251090 again these are not the most appropriate references key references are santer et 1990 and papers on escape and magiccscengen 251093 what means annotation here 251102 actually it was my idea 2511051106 the key assumption is actually linear superposition this is the way that so4 effects are handled there are number of papers that show that this assumption works well for temperature and paper by ramaswamy and chen in grl that shows that it works also for precipitation the tricky thing for this variable would be to prove statistically that it doesnt work given the snr it would be very difficult to reject the null hypothesis that papbpab where ab are the forcings and p is the response pattern 251108 plus numerous other papers 2511121113 this is very galling the method may have been used in image but they got it from escape which goes back to santer et 1990 magiccscengen pushes the idea as far as is possible schlesingers cosmic does things quite similarly tp magiccscengen schlesinger was coauthor of the santer et paper 251115 not clear 251122 all you can say here is may not hold not probably does not hold indeed there are reasons to expect it to hold quite well 251123 could begin new paragraph with uncertainties 2511231124 i think this statement is categorically wrong magicc scengen incorporates so4 influences as does cosmic there is evidence at all that the uncertainties are thereby amplified indeed there is evidence to the contrary eg penner et 1997 idle and unsupported speculations like this do nobody any good 2511241125 i suspect you argument here would have to hinge on the possible spatial effects of thc slowdown or shutdown if so say so but if this is the case you must also note that the latest nonfluxcorrected oagcms do not show these major thc changes and scaling approaches may well work out very well for these situations even in stabilization cases please avoid jumping to unsubstantiated conclusions 251125 i refereed this paper and i judged it to be an appalling display of ignorance it should not be cited 261134 why is this figure here 261138 ah at last the normalization issue this must come much earlier 2611441147 this is simply wrong it is true that ramaswamy and chen dreamed up case with big hemisphericscale responses but little globalmean response but this was totally unrealistic in all cases that i have looked at using the method employed by magiccscengen and cosmic this is simply not problem 2611471148 again this is just wrong 261150 again this is my idea and it was first implemented in magiccscengen please give credit where due 2611561159 isnt this always the case in other words the scaling method is almost universally applicable and useful 2611591162 i do not think this has been proven 2611641165 there are other methods too 261172 oh come on scaling handles many types of uncertainty perhaps all not just one type 271181 documented to quantified 27to 1185 etc etc 271193 magiccscengen allows the user to consider this issue by providing data on global precipitation pattern correlations indeed this software was the first to consider this issue in spite of the whetton and pittock paper cited on line 1199 2711981201 very clumsy text 2712031204 this is an issue we considered years ago in developing escape and magiccscengen the trouble with judging model on its regional performance is one of statistical significance it is much easier to get good regional result by chance than to get results that are good globally 2712081211 very clumsy text 27to 1214 you have failed to mention key issue is model skill in simulating presentday climate reliable indicator of its skill in predicting future climate change there is evidence to support this idea although it does sound priori reasonable you must at least raise the issue 281227 cite morgan and keith 1995 here 281231 this is critical point it needs more emphasis 281235 what about intervariable consistency this needs to be discussed 281236 the manifold to possible 281239 insert give after chapters 281252 not clear 281255 so what it is almost certainly irrelevant unless the co2 changes are bigger than anything anticipated or unless there are nonlinear effects associated with thc changes which looks increasingly unlikely 281257 mimics you must be joking how about approximates 281262 equal grammar 2812621263 how can smart people like this make such an elementary mistake 2912801281 this does not seem to be an appropriate reference 291282 albino to albedo 291294 this sea level consistency issue was first addressed by wigley and raper warrick et sea level book it is of course avoided in magiccscengen 291295 dependable to dependent 2912951301 giant red herring maybe some ignorant people produced inconsistent scenarios like this years ago but the issue was also resolved years ago all you need to say is that comprehensive software suites avoid these naive problems concentrate on the strengths of existing methodssoftware dont reraise issues that were solved long ago 2913051308 another misleading red herring that fails to reflect the current state of the science globalmean responses to aerosol forcing can be used to drive regional patterns this is just what is done in magiccscengen and cosmic 2913101311 not clear 291314 delete scenario 291318 to daily to in daily 3013291330 stimulated new techniques oh yeah the magiccscengen method has not changed in 7 years and it still represents the state of the science 3013321333 true but you have not explained them very well could you not have summary table that lists the strengths and weaknesses of the various methods including the direct use of oagcm output this would have helped you lot in planning and structuring this chapter it can still help in revising it and be useful to readers 3013361339 not clear 301342 you have mentioned this before but you have failed to tell us what it is or given any example mention alone is valueless 301344 what means semiformal i thought it was dress protocol 30general crucial need for scenarios and for simple models is to expand the range of cases covered by oagcms end dr sarah raper climatic research unit university of east aglia
