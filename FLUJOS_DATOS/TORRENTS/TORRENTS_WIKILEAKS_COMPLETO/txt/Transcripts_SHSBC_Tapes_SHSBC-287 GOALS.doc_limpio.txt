goals lecture given on 23 april 1963 thank you thank you thank you very much this is the what audience the 23rd twentythird somebody says its the 24th audience twentythird april yeah well what gpm is it the 23rd of all right this is the 23rd of abril after dianetics 13 pretty good huh and we have some goals here i want to congratulate those that found them but its pretty easy to find goal and why do i have to tell you go on find the goal you know you know youre supposed to know that all the time going to talk to you about goals id rather talk to you about the gpm its always more interesting talking about the living lightning you happen to be mixed up in at the moment ill just make little note of that on the side its tricky man were all tricky boy were tricky tsk nuts i just found out that not only does the goal decline to the point of the goalbut thetan not being able to quit now carries it on for few millenniajust to be sure he really gets all the good out of that goal that he possibly can its something like runningrunning tire until its original casing is off you knowand then retreading it and running it until the retread is offand then retreading the retread you see and running it off and thats what he does with goal you say heres goal to want so immediately of course the top is want and not want right obviously just like that the hell it is theres about twenty more items above that point and theres an ultimate accomplishment oppterm that is something like everything wanted and then that goes down through all the ivities everything wantedness everything wantedivity with all the negatives on the terminal side i consider this very fascinating in other words the thetan gets all of the good he possibly can out of goal he even runs it in past tense and i dont know what span of millennia that goal has been dead while he is still using it i had wonderful example of thisthe goal to go away becomes gone away becomes gone and gone then declines through all of the ivities and ishnesses you see oh its remarkable but imagine running on goal that is gone yeah life is strewn with tombstones you know the goneishness you know makes you inhabit cemeteries for few millennia you know if you want to really feel good go down to the cemetery you know and look at all the tombstones so forth thats good goneishness oddly enough this only appears on the oppterm side of the fencethis decline of the goal of course the goal has opportunity to decline before the goal is postulated so it just runs out on the oppterm side so you only find these gone and gone away and that sort of thing over as opptermsand you find the nono gone you see and not gone and not goneishness and all of this thing over on the terminal sidewhich i consider is quite interesting so these goalsyou got goal like to have an audience you see now youd consider that well an audience would be the final opptermand youve succeeded you seesomething like that and maybe thats true itll be some word like audience thats for sure but much more likely to be audienced it has already happened dont you see so now weve got audienced when you were first postulating goals and made up this patternit would have been more courteous of all of you to have done it in accordance with english syntax and we wouldnt have to be bending english around corners and circles and so forthbecause i know of goal right now that everybody is very sure that good must be its top oppterm because in english there is word which is good which can decline from good dont you see so its probably coined word like gooded or goodlied or good ly it wont become saint or something like that theyalways its the same word but it can have another thing in front of itlike it everything or absolute or something like that we have somebody around here thats been saying all the time well its absolute is up there at the top yeah thats right there is something up there above that level about twenty items up which has something like 44 absolute and i got another one here thats been saying the pure light of the pure light of you know and everybody got awful tired of hearing this but the thing would probably rocket read you know the pure light of truth its something like that its truthed however is probably much more appropriate truthed or some such thing but anyway theres where these goals go and what happens to goal after its dead well its carried on for another twenty items remarkable why dont you give up you know say well thats it thats it i postulated this goalpostulated this goal to be saint and uhi became saint so now uhuh thats fine and then ithen i finally started see heres your first decline youd think the guywell he became saint and he should say all right now ill be devil you know and lets have ball here for while as devil he doesnt do anything like that now he begins while declining as saintto fight all of the ideas and attributes of saint until he finally fights the goal to be saint and thats his worst enemy and youd think well hes gone as far as he can go now oh not thetan hahaha theres lot of rubber left on that casing yet cant throw it away i think that these electronics boys who you ever been in an electronics mans basement or backyard you know all of the scrap metal you know and old pieces of wirehe snipped this piece of wire off in 1943 and its piece of coaxial cable you see and its about that long and it might have some use the only use for coaxial cable is if you have twenty or thirty feet of it you see and hes got this piece that long and that has taken its company with all the burned out condensers capacitors and charred rheostats and all that sort of thing so when this goal is deadits good and dead you seeheitshis worst enemy now is this goalnow he carries on you see and the worst enemyness of this goal now declineswith him refuting this all the way you see the goal goes downhill now and may go through two stages lets take the goal to go away it becomes gone away well youd say well thats ithes had it you know or lets takeit wouldnt be this word to be sainted itd be something on the order it wouldnt be deified but itd be like deified you know canonized only it wont be the word canonized it would probably be sanctified you see sanctified so he hits sanctified thats his worst enemy nowanything that is sanctified well you would say all right now hes got lots of ideas all hes got to do is postulate himself new goal and get on his way oh he isnt going to do that man do you realize theres still some fabric inside that casing you know you can still get few more miles out of this goal so he nowit shifts over to sainted see or something like that or itllbe something like superlatively sainted see and boy he goes all the way downhill on that to the final drugs and dregs of the situation and then hes there he cant go any further after this theres nothing left of him there isnt enough left there you see to oppose anything it isnt that he runs out of things but it makes these it jumps these things up to about eighty to hundred something like that ris you better start finding one minute thats all ive been holding you keeping you from going into lot of early banks and grabbing lot of early goals and splattering yourselves all over the track youll thank for it someday you might not be thanking for it now but ive been suspecting all the way along the line that we hadnt the top i ran into it headon and ive been working like mad trying to get the thing squared around its clean as wolfs tooth now between there and the next bank there isnt anything theres always been little shadow of blackness or something in there to the next bank and then much to ones astonishment you seethis little shadow of blackness opens out to be ten items small matter of ten items you know any one of which dropped off the pcs line plot will cause him to moan and scream the big discovery that has been made on all this of course is that these goals are patterned one to the next and that they are patterned pc to pc and that is the big discovery of just the last two or three weeks i never dreamed this was possible but its darned good thingwere just lucky because let tell you trying to get pc to confront any part of banktrying to get him to confront any part of the bankis almost impossible you just have to put his paws right on it man you have to put his paws right on it and you say that is it this is what you are listing for so he will list in that directionhes got prayer of getting it i was just examining list of pc whos gotten quite ill trying to find his top itemand hes been going around feeling very bad about it and so forth and i just examined his list and i dont think its on that list and yet the list is about eighty ninety items long and its not on that list and this is just history as far as this is concerned i look in vain on these lists to find what should belong on the listif the pc is just permitted to list permissively and that we have plot that orients this thing is godsend more important than that the plot itself is getting very rapidly shaped up i would normally take off year or two to shape up something of this magnitude with this much meaningness and you guys are riding right on my heels and i can hardly keep my shoes on you know i mean you keep stepping on my heels and i keep sliding out and its just flat out as matter of fact ive left the better part of fifteen banks just discharged slightlyabout tenth discharged or something like thatin order to pick it up on part of the track where it is in an unmixed up state and ive finally gotten back far enough to where it is fairly obvious what it isand just wont go together unless it is exactly right you see that isnt the worst of the plot the plot is theres switcheroo on your composite goals you get down to the goal level and then it all switches and you have have gameishness is opposed by game haveishness i think thats so cute and then it turns around the other way and makes game haveishness is the oppterm i think at this stage opposed by have gameishness as the terminal in other words its double switcheroo ugh so when we announce that four goals have been found today why the people should be very happy theyre not going to be run into brick wall or off the end of cliffbut they should realize and their auditors should realizewhat theyrewhat theyre facing now on such goals as these for instance on ian right away the auditorsif we didnt have this datais likely to grab something on the order of infallible thats the top oppterm you know and he goes along just fine you know meter reads and hes getting blowdowns and all of sudden the pc is getting nastier and nastier oh ian of course never gets nasty we know that but gets nastier and nastier and uses more and more livid language and snarls and so forth and yet its all going according to hoyle everythings going along just perfect everythings fineexcept of course we took off from about the upperthird of the bank we didnt take off from the top now you have the interesting factor of trying to figure out what is the past tense ne plus ultra nounal version of infallible in limited language which doesnt composite easily like english see all these things are in there as concepts theyre not expressed as words korzybski to the contrary and you very often will find goal on pc and the pc eehhh found i had goal goal and so on and so on and so on and all of sudden hell say yeah you knowyeah yeah whats this comm lag it isnt that hes stupid its the fact that the english words havent met up with the thought concept the thought meaningness dont you see the thought meaningness actually stays there and stands there without words i studied this back in 1952 for quite whilehow it wasnt in wordsit was in thought concepts and the thought concepts matched the words and its all very interesting because it means that nothing is stored in words but english for instance reechoes against these words english echoes in the wordsthat echoes against the thought conceptand that activates your cognition or your blowdown and youll find very fascinatedly youll find some item like catch catfish you see catching catfish and thats fine pc understands that very well and you get yourget your rocket read your blowdown sometimes you dont even get your rocket read once in blue moon catch catfish didnt read the first time then the pc puts his attention on you and itand you call it the second time and it reads like mad well he just didnt have his words into the thought concept you see well thats all very well and that wont happen very often on something like catch catfish but lets get into something catch catfishishness catch catfishishness see mmmmaaaahmmmmahmmmm and you say well it rocket read when you said it doesnt rocket read now and you say blowdown here and the pc well catch catfishishness oh yeah yeah and he gets this sudden idea of somebody standing on the porch of some country store ready to go down to the river you know but he isnt going to go down to the river you know and hes all dressed as though hes going to catch catfish and of course he isnt going to catch catfish or something like that but hes the very model of somebody who catches catfish you see and thats cats uh cat catfishishness and pc will all of sudden get this and all of sudden you get your blowdown he didnt understand it and you sometimes you cant even wrap your tongue around it i dont know what language these were installed in but they were probably never installed in any language you see its method of group thinking which applies to any language person can group great many items under one heading with this one concept and therefore he doesnt have to think and its just handy computational idiocy all hes got to do is take one concept you seeand this covers all of that but its interesting how accurate and how precise these concepts are now these goals then have their first entrance point of understanding at the moment they are found and ordinarily you do not find pcs goal or get the pc to pan out well until the pc understands the goal he can have put it down to catch catfish you see just well so andso and soandso and to catch catfish anduhand to hunt deer and to be great hunter and to uhuhhhspend lot of idle time and hes just been going down goals list dont you see and he gives you all these goals and he didnt bother to look at this when he went bybut there was little red flag out there and it triggered you know and that was it you get back youre nulling this thing pcs sitting there you know what wall you know and youre nulling you see and you hit to catch catfish and your normal reaction is i didnt put that on the list i dont recall putting that on the list see its heavily charged area very often you get this reaction did i put that on the list i remember i had one goal oppose list its very easy finding internal goals theres nothing to this now just make sure your list is complete and youll have the next goal but its so remarkable wentit hadnt happened to for long time that i didnt know i had put it on the list and all of sudden the auditor reads to to be lucky i feel the sensation of rocket read you know to be luckyi didnt put that on the list whered that come from you know and it seemed that it was totally extraneous to the subject matter it had just slid in sideways you see and so its sort of on an automatic action see this thing has charge but the pc hasnt inspected it in any way all right you sometimes will go down goals list and youre busy nulling and so on and you dont get rocket read but you just get tick or dn or something like that around some certain area or you get dr on goal so you leave it in now you come backby reading the goal again the pcs attention goes onto this goaland now by putting in your lefthand buttons the pcs attention goes onto it very thoroughly and because the lefthand buttons take the suppression off of it and put his attention on itwhy you get rocket read off of the right goal that is the mechanism thats followed it isnt that these things rocket read just natural and native it isnt inevitable dont you see it requires some attention and alertness on the pcs part this becomes very manifest when youre checking goals while doing gpm you read this goal and the pc is still all tied up there in catch catfishishness and hes still trying to you knowhes still cogniting on it youve got it and youve got it on the line plot youre writing up something youre writing the line plot down or something like this and hes still aaaacatchcaaahthmmmmmmmmmhmmfififinnn and you say all right to catch catfish to catch catfish to catch catfish and you say well that ticked once yeah and you go on and put down goal one tick you see he didnt have his attention on it yet if you weretheres not any reason to yank his attention over onto this but just as ajust to show you what im talking about if you say to the pcat this stage of the gameyou say to the pc uhnow uhlisten listen to very carefully just for moment there whatwhat are you thinking about oh yeah well all right you just listen to very carefully now listen to very carefully dont even tell him youre going to read the goal but listen to very carefully youve just gotten one tick off of this goal see and you say to catch catfish to catch catfish to catch catfish ah two rocket reads in other words the pcs attention the right thing will tick whether the pc is looking at you or not see theres enough of you penetrates to him to give tick see youll always get some response although of course that could winnow out too but ordinarily the pc could even be doped off and youll get tick on right goal see he didnt even hear you read it but youll get this tick now his attention has to be brought onto this thing in order to get an rr and the reason nobody saw rrs before was the absence of the lefthand buttons you should recognize that it was the mechanics of scientology itself that made possible for goal to be sufficiently unburdened that it would rocket read i predicted the fact that rocket read would existthat goal would read differentlyand then very short time afterwards got some buttons together that would remove the pcs efforts to squash in certain areawhich are of course nothing more than suppress careful of and fail to reveal and for the first time we started seeing rocket reads well thats because by taking the pressure off and putting the pcs attention on we get the phenomenon of rocket read now heavily charged item even with the pcsthe item is different than the goal see the item hesvery immediate hes right in the middle of this thing and he could be just blah and most of the time you read catch catfishishness or to him or something of the sort and pshewww you see nice rocket read now the goal read and all of the items that are immediately attached to goal are rocket reads so that you actually have three allied types of read there are three types of read which are cousins to one another and the first is fall you didnt expect that one the first is fall and the next is rock slam and the next is the rocket read but the fall can turn into either rock slam or rocket read and rocket read does not necessarily convert through rock slam when it fades away but may simply fall rocket read may then degenerate to rock slam and degenerate to fall or may simply strictly and straightly degenerate into fall now rock slama rock slammay become fall but is actually more likely to become dirty needle now what youwhat you must realize about this is you are looking at different meter manifestations youre looking at different meter manifestations but these things all stem from certain pattern or picture and if we get good picture of this i want to show you here what youre really findingin the way of aof an riwhat youre really finding here lets take an ri and lets see exactly whatwhen these goals were found exactly what was being activated now heres your ri and we take that as an item it has mass it has actual mass in it and it is to be considered as sort of core as the center lets say ball bearing dropped in cotton you see it is the ball bearing see all right now around the edges of these things youll be awful baffled if you dont remember this little diagram you can get more baffled running routine 3 than anything else i know because so many things sometimes rocket read you take somebody with an ri like minewhich is practically indestructible and reads on anythingyou give an item at distance of quarter of mile and say the item to and if theres rocket read on it itll rocket read you see and this is very upsetting researchwise you want to know what the next item is youve got to find somebody whose rocket read isnt all that good if youre going to do good research because then only the one thats supposed to be there will rocket read you see now heres whole bunch of items around this solid center item you see that theres whole bunch of items around that item now these things are lock ris those things are just locks see thats lock ri catfish see is chargedso therefore fishing poleno notcatfish is charged so therefore sturgeon see might ri but it isnt the rr and it isnt the ri you understand so youve got all of these lock now theyre all over it its just as though we had crosssectioned it in any direction now theresthese things rr they all rr but when you found catfish they wont any longer rr in other words they borrowed their rrthey borrowed their rrfrom the charge in the core of the thing which is catfish you see they borrowed their charge they dont have any charge of their own now around here this by the way is all routine 3 stuff now well move over into routine 2 now heres another whole series and these things have been mushed theyre probably very neat geometrically theyre probably neat as electrons geometrically but in actual fact they have become mushed and crushed by grouping and that sort of thinguntil they appear to be so much black tar soup and i had one spring out at the other night in its pure pristine form because something was being found out of sequenceand you talk about something hard it was as hard as trying to bite on metal shell it hadnt disintegrated at all and it was little sphere now these out hereare again lock ris of the second rank those are all lock ris and here they are and theres lots of those oh theres lots of those and they rs see these are rrsand these are rses you know this is more than graphic analysis you usually just do your graphic analysis but this isthis is anatomy now this ri if you approached it this closeyour second rankthose that lie right up against ityoud get rrs and if you approach it that much further awayone more rank out from the coreyou get rses see now theres another rank outside of this much more numerous as you can imaginemuch more numerous and these things cant be called ris at all were too far out and itd just be nonsense but they still have some of the connotation in it of this central ri and they dr now what are those things well theyre all the things on your list that you get little dr on when you read them but nothing ever happens to them see they were there now you can examine any series of lists doneif great long list has been done and somebody has kept careful record of all the drsand allyou would keep record anyway of all the rses and rrsbut if hed kept all of the drs that he saw and it was all meticulously keptand it was very long list very long listuntil the needle was totally clean you would have had this population now when you take this picture herethis april 23rd picturewhen you get that you actually are looking at everything the pc has put on the list if he did full list which were not doing now see and thatd be one of these well its not exaggerated this bebut there have been lists as long as eightyseven pages well an eightyseven page list would certainly contain everything connected with it but actually probably everything connected with several fifteenpage list twelvepage list something of this sort pretty well covers the population now as the pc lists on 212 type listinghe simply is taking and repeating the thought concepts which are popping out of these and they pop out of here at randombut theyhe actually will list off at some point where his attention has already been fixated by life in this mass hell start there and hell list out to the perimeter and hell list back in again and hell list out and hell list in and its random pattern of listing you see and eventually his attention will have encompassed this and the charge in the area will have been labeled onto the listso therefore the list ceases to fire or read while listing you see what thats all about now in finding goal you can actually take these things and find the identity of the goal now how do you do this well lets take one more step lets take one more step here this isthis is one now lets just take one more step weve got that much picture and this is picture of ris each one of these spots is an ri and well just make lot of these spots here and you know that big plot i just gave you number one there each one of these little circles im making here is complete one of those see so we get these things and we get something on the order of about eighty to hundred of those groups contained in one gpm there are about fifteensee theyre finite numbers theres about fifteen pages of listing covers the bulk carelessly of one of those ri groupsif you wanted to list them all outand therefore theres about eighty of those ri groups in gpm so ithats just forecast number im sure the number will eventually turn out to be finite im not in the position to say exactly what it is so it is the number of ris in gpm times the average number of items listed on pc to get clean needle in one of those areasthat isnt to four or five you see thats fifteen pages or something like thatwould give you the drs the rses and ris contained in gpm very rough guesstimate sort of figure just to give you the order of magnitude is fifteen times eighty see youre not actually looking at very many dring rsing or rring items at all youre not looking at very many of them somewhat on the order of magnitude of fifteen times eighty now you dont have to find each one of these you see its not necessary to do so im just telling you whats there this is whats in the pot of blackberries which it resembles very closely sometimes anyway heres your gpm now this then is covered in its entirety with goal see thats goal and every one of the fifteen times eightywhich is your rough estimate numberis dependent on the central postulate called goal and they are all built up from the pc having made that central postulate every one of those is built just on that one postulate and all of the behavior and nonsense he goes through is deadon that central postulate therefore when you are trying to find goalsyou can list the goals of any one of those little dring items any of the rsing items particularly the rring items and certainly the central rilist the goals of or the goals it would be an overt against depending if it was terminal or an oppterm and youll come up with the goal of that gpm and its goals finding now theresthese mechanisms ive just been talking to you about are the basic mechanisms of goal finding youve got that anatomy your big ri with the cluster of rrings and then the rses and then the drs and then youve gotwhatever the number isfifty eighty something like thatits greater than fifty its about eighty somethingmaybe little bit greater than that youve got that number of those things contained in here and all of those are covered embracively by goal now the problem of goals finding is only complicated by one thingis lots of these little little dring items and lots of these rring items the secondary items particularly have their own goals well ill give you an idea of this the pc has not postulated this goal but he thinks of streetcarwhich is dr see he thinks of streetcar as having the goal to carry passengers or to clang or something like that see he thinks of it as having purpose or goal all by itself so when he starts listing goalslets get right down to goals here now when he starts listing goals he starts in toward not one gpmand again fortunately very finite numberhe starts straight in against thirty gpms and youve got something on the orderim just giving you general number here but it is its very close to the factual number its an educated guessyouve got about thirty goals thirty of these gpms and when theyre all crunched togetherlets get this now you understand were getting up to were getting up to what to the pc looks like lightyears of space little ri looks to the pc to be about that big about foot fourteen inches something like that see sometimes theyre little fat sausages theyre quite finite in shape pcs get up to point where they can confront mass they describe these and when you get the outer part of the thing peeled off youll see the center shell of the item but in order to get visio on that sort of thing it has to be done very wrong you have to find it all out of sequence and get the pc to tear it to pieces with his little thetan paws and after that hes rather unhappy because its hitting him in the face by nowbut the anatomy is there now all of these gpms crushed together see give you an appearance although each one you see is like thisgive you an appearance of islands of masses see it looks like channel at first glance over hereand then they are liable to be stuff that looks like side channels and you say well heres one channel of goals and over here on the right someplace heres another channel of goals whats this all about am i ambivalent yeah youre worse than ambivalent but but its just the fact that they have grouped on each other its just one channel of goals so heres this terrific mass now lets take this is then goals and well say something on the order of thirty goalsi dont even think its that many all right now lets walk this lecture backwards theres your pc sitting in the chair what are you looking at youre looking at body which hasnt anything to do with it except as masses collapse on the body you get an unfortunate increase of body mass and every time you miss an item or gpm you increase the bodys mass somewhat because it comes in against the body when these items are all found and everything else you decrease the bodys mass its quite spectacular sometimes your pc will become almost frantic because hes putting on mass at an alarming rate well you know that this is direct index of having missed gpm or missed whole series of items in gpm its not very worrisome factorbecause as soon as you find all of the items in the gpm or all the gpms in sequencethat mass factor goes pffft vanishes youre looking at bodywhich can be influenced by it or which can experience the pain of items and so forthbut which it itself does not contain any items now in the skull back in the days of greece they used to go into the stomach i dont know why you did thatmust have been because the greek always said his soul was in his stomach and they still cook well down there today yeah id like to have some greek soup the thetan is resident in or about this body now thetan in very terrible condition very terrible condition is outside the body and cant get in it so hes at some remote point from the bodyand it may be quite remote but hes still in communication with you via the body and then thetan who is not in too bad condition is in body and then thetan who is in terrific conditionis more or less permanently outside the bodybut able to get in or out of it and doesnt worry about it but can control it from distance and then in terrific condition doesnt need one so theres the gradient scale of what youre looking at and the fellow who is sitting in that chair is either then way outside the body and cant get in it or is in the body or is somewhere between these two points he is certainly not outside the body as good being the more he talks about being outside the body as good being the more you should immediately suspect that he aint the worst case that freud ever tackled and the cases he said were just unsolvable were what he called the detached case he didnt know quite what was going on but hed already scented the fact that the guy was unable to approach his body and he called this fellow detached body the fellow was never in his own valence he was also always remote from his valence lecture 28 1 think sigmund freud talks about this at the end he concludes that nothing can be done for these people well thats past history it doesnt even worry you i mean everything can be done for these people so what now such persons goal may or may not be little harder to find but he might not sit still well for you to find his goal and that would be the only difference the only actual differencebut from pc to pc is not the state of case but its how quietly he will sit there and be audited dont you see and some pcs are sufficiently agitated and so forth they wont sit there quietly and be audited and other pcs in pretty good condition who are being loused up also wont sit still and be loused up theres all kinds of gradients of this all right there sits the pc and theres the thetan and the body is communication media for the thetanand the pcs whole personality beingness attributes and so forthare actually expressed as thetan and are as alive as thetan and arent as body so you dont have anything to do with goalswith bodies in goals finding at all youre never going to run across the ge and its goals or get anything crossed up here so stop worrying about it now lets consider then exactly what youre addressing here is goalsthe gpmsthe goals problem masses they are there in their numbers up to about thirty and they are all around and they are at various distances from the pc again finite you alwaysprobably in dealing with the mind thought you were dealing with the infinite you may have thought that you were dealing with fantastic uncalculably great numbers of things and engrams and things like this and its actually quite remarkable to get how finite these things are now to pc sometimes it looks like some of these gpms go out there lightyears and maybe they do but theyre not ready to be run the ones that he is most intimately connected with will be within range of about fifty feet and the ones which you find are at the range of zero feet he is in the one that is firing these are all very finite measurements you neednt be interested in anything closer than fifty feeti mean further away than fifty feet you cant run it anyhow all right so there he sits in his nobility in the middle of all these black masses why are they black thats because the energy has been burned down in them theyve been originally manufactured of good energyand postulated good energy and then the energy and so forth has been consumed and you are looking at the unburnable residue the clinkers and this energy mass these massesare black or gray there are pictures you start seeing picturesyoure in the wrong bank or something theres free track that runs alongside of these things and out here on the boundary someplace you may have some sections of free track that the pc can run on well it has nothing to do with anything you want so you never do anything with picture that is an inviolable rule dont do anything with the picturebecause the actual gpms pictures have long since been crunched and crushed to exactly blah theyre not there and he doesnt see any pictures thatsand he allthinks of all of it as instantaneous and right now only after hes got one partially run hes liable to look at you rather stunned and say i just spotted how old this thing is its about 56 trillion years which you dont even bother to inquire into until moment ago he thought it was right nowits instantaneous there is time in the reactive bank that is what is wrong with it there is time in itso it groups and thats why you can get an instant read on something thats 216 trillion you know itd take long time for afor read to travel up through 216 trillion unless the bank itself was instantaneous well now it may seem instantaneous to the pc but actually there is time difference which is expressed on the meter the pc in various sections of the bank will read in those sections of the bank because of the actual existence of time in the bank looks to the pc to be instantaneous hell swear it is all the results arebut as matter of fact you move him little later or little earlier in the bankyou move him to an earlier gpm is the way this is expressedand the later gpm will not now read in other words you can move him into the proximity of reads this is not something you do im just telling you this is possible all right so there he sits there are these black clouds gray clouds and so forth which are visible or invisible to him sometimes pcs can see these things sometimes they have to be processed quite whileand they eventually come up and their perception on the bank rises to the point where they can see them pc who has perception of these things whatsoever is little more difficult to run than one who is high enough up to have perception of whats actually going on here so there are his goals now youre trying to findthat one of these thirty goals that will read and can be run and thats what youre trying to do with routine 2 youre trying to put your paws on that goal which will read and can be run now in actual fact of these thirty gpms which are scattered about again you understand thats just guesstimate numberof these thirty gpms that are scattered about the bulk of them will not read on the meter because of the actual existence of some time in them he is not necessarily in present time with regard to the gpmand the gpm you get is not necessarily the present time gpm it just happens to be the one hes closest to and usually which is worded to be offered never to be offered will of course get offered on itson its terminal which is to be offered see so negative sounding goal will get handed up immediately or positive sounding goal is liable to be handed up immediately like the goal to find see well auditor is trying to find something so hell get the goal to find see now the single difference amongst thetans is the significance of these goals they have quite few of them in common particularly on the early track but as they continue to livetheir divergences of significance as to the character of the goalbecomes different so you find all kinds of different goals and someday you will get very very bushed and very upset for this one reason you will just realize that all of those goals lists that this pc is handing youthese fantastic numbers of goals that the pc is handing youare almost infinite combinations theres an infinity of word combinations and therefore itlooks like an infinity of goals well dont worry about it thats finite number too the longest pc has ever held out with goal on straight listing is 5000 goals finite number its considered rather uncommon and real rough for pc to hold out 3000 goals very uncommon average number of goals listed to goal on the list is 153 one hundred and fiftythree goals just listed straightfor the pcs actual goal to be found on the list pretty good huh that average does not include some of these heroic numbers of goalsthe average is actually just taken with the small group 153 goals starts listing goals 153 goals later somewhere on that list you have the pcs goal what percentage of pcs is this true of i wouldnt know offhand but its much larger percentage i know than you would suspect its something like 50 60some such respectable percentage this is the majority probably the bare majority of pcs this would be true of and you just tell them to give you the goal and youre talking to them from altitudeand you write it down youre not causing them any trouble at all and when you go over the thing and null that listif you do good job of it and null the thingwhy you will take yourput your left hand buttons in on whats left there with dirty read and youll be staring at rocket reads actually on such list its quite common to find four or five rocket reading goals all right lets get back to anatomy here youre shooting at guesstimate number of thirty banksthirty gpms thirty of which twenty five another guesstimate number are not available because they are too old or too stiff or too big or too overwhelming not because their meanings are too esoteric the hardest goal i ever found had nothing to do with be found or not found that was probably the trouble with it it was just sort of goal like to drink water you know gave an awful lot of hard time nothing in it offered nothing took it away and yet it had to be found because it was the nearest to pt so youre going in toward five available goals any one of five goals is liable to fall into your paws any one of which will be valid goal you just do list of those stretched out along the trackyoull get any one of the top fivewhich of course cuts down the averages enormously i mean it cuts down the liabilities of and difficulties of finding goals enormously you can find any one of those five you will probably find the one which has the most offering or refusing type wording and youll probably miss the one which is most inertwever to have my goal found give any pc who has such goal man because of course his oppterm hands it up instantly itll be number one on the list never to have my goal found that rocket reads thank you very much go over and get it checked out oh i wonder how that ever read i know thats very secret goal spare the inert onesto drink water socially acceptable difficulties connected with it and you just go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and you dont come across this goal and then all of sudden one day the pc is feeling in very lukewarm state of mind with enthusiasm not trying hes very relaxed and that little concept in his mind opens up and he says to drink water pow that rocket reads and away we go so thats the first look you get at the pc youve got five of those banks fivenot just one you probably thought it was just one youve got five and youll get the one of those five that is the most easily offered and then you have goal lets go to the next stage here you have goal goal the pc considers its very precious very remarkable cherishes it pulls it to his bosom and cognites on it as he very well should he doesnt at this stage recognize the horrible fact that this goal has very remote chance of being his first goalvery remote its the first goal to be run and you will run it if you got your hands on it and it rocket reads run it you understand thats rule but it has ver remote chance of being his first goal on the track because it usually is offered as an offering lets looktake these goals who have just been found here and youll see what i mean first one has the words to find in itso naturally it was found the next one is to have an audience naturally the auditor is the audience so the goal is offered the next one is to be infallible the thetan proves it by handing out the goal and saying it is right and the next one is to understand and of course the pc has been trying to understand this goal for some time such factor is understood comes immediately across that has nothing to do with these goals these are all valid fine goals nobodys running these goals down and thank you for giving the use of them ill let you use my goals do you see that audience yeah now theres just complete random selection its just the goals which happen to have just been found naturally they loan themselves to it now two of these goals have narrowing rr as theyre checked out well i suppose you might as well go ahead and run thembut it means they are not up to present time you got your paws on them run them and then the next thing comes in youve got thisyouve got the goal and by the way you try to find the goals forward to present time not back to the beginning of track theyre most easily found back to the beginning of trackbut the ones you want are forward to present time from where you are harder to find all you do is list the reverse ri oppose list however you take the goal youve just foundfind out what goal would oppose itand youll get the goal above it you could actually take any one of these goals at this moment and do an ri oppose list on iteven though it is not runreverse you see what goal would oppose this goaland youll get the goal closer to present time what goal would this opposeany one of these goalsyoull get the goal earlier than this because theyre in an endless chain and interdependent one upon another all right so weve got goal now were going to enter this goaland weve got to go in up at the top of the bank here with the top oppterm and we dont dare enter it anyplace else because if we enter it anyplace else it wont discharge the charge still has to be passed down if you find the middle of goaland you then find the top of the goalyou still have to pass the charge through the middle of the goal youve already found all right so youre going to find that goal and you bring it all the way down through and you are findingin every case where you find an ri thereyou find your first picture hereyou get yourself cluster like this for every ri that youre finding in that bank and they run something like eighty ris in the bank multiply the eighty times fifteenyoull get how many things you might have to list in that one bank if you didnt know what the central ris arebecause ill let you in on itthe pc never will put down the central ris his attention is so bungedoff on each one of these you understand this is picture of each one of those and this is picture of cluster of those and thats exactly what youre finding and exactly what youre doing in clearing thats what youre looking for thats the goal thenthe goalthat you are looking foris simply the goal of one of these and that you can find at least five of those banks are wide open to have their goal found and all you had to do is get into the goal channel and then by opposing goals or goalopposegoals type lists you could move up and down the whole channel i wouldnt advise this but you could probably plot out every goal the pcs got long before you run any ris if it didnt kill the pc because i remember the first time the goal to createto create was checked out the big mid ruds were put in on it because it was ticking and boy that bank started swelling up and going zing cross creak and it did more than tick it wouldnt rocket read you seeit was too beefy to run but the more it was drilled why the more uncomfortable and horrible it got so of course the best answer is to run what youve got your hands on and then try to move forward to present time and then when youve got it all the way to present time then pass the charge all the way backwhich is by reading the line plot of the pc practically move right on back down the track and here we goand we will eventually arrive at the beginning of the track with the pc in good condition and we will have discharged this massthis compulsive mass because it is this mass which holds the thetan prisoner in the universeit is this mass which holds him prisoner in his body it is these masses these significances these clusters which i have seen which make the pc fixate and do aberrated things and they dont help him bit hell say once upon time i could move around freely and now i cant anymore what has happened to well hes just added few too many gpms onto the track now theres the full anatomy of what youre trying to do in running gpms and goals its taken quite while to put together that anatomy but the end is in sight and what youre trying to find when youre trying to find goal should look after this lecture little easier to you youre not really shooting at ain the dark with pingun at knothole 150 paces away in high wind you actually are standing there with sawedoff shotgun inside barn trying to hit the barn the goal you will find will be the goal that the pc is most likely to offer up by its own wordingand lets hope its not so early on the track it halfkills the pc to beto have the goal run if this did happen there is still remedy for it just goal oppose listyou could boost him forward to present time on the whole line if you if he could make it if he could make it if you could move him enough on the track by doing that possibility that will someday become procedure which we use but i havent experimented with it and right now i know that you can get away with it by running any goal you got your paws on as long as you remember to go up toward present time not the easy way back toward the beginning because the whole bank wants to run back toward the beginning and it wont itll go just so far and then brrrr you even try to run bank backwards and the next thing you know this happened to us last night you try to run bank backwards from the bottom to the top and i cut in on bank and tried to run it up to the top and much to our embarrassment couple of hours later i found out id been running from the top down it looked like it was all the other way to you know but it wasnt and in actual sequence i was running toward the bottom of the bank the natural inclination of the bank and the thetan is to go in reverse to the way it was lived and run back toward the beginning and if you keep on doing this and leaving banks in present timeim afraid your pc is going to be terribly uncomfortable because he keeps pulling all of his ptps and hidden standards back through tough goals in the past but its rather easy to run out bank do good job on the bank and then move forward to bank closer to present time the next bank run that out polish it up and then move forward again and dont be too surprised if you find out that youre ten banks from present timedont be too amazed if the pc tends to get sick and creak and have an awful time running bank just assume its too early try to find the later bank all right well thats lot of gen im awfully glad to talk to you out here today and i hope that you lets see youve got about twenty six twentyeight more goals to go lets have those by the next lecture thursday okay audience yes yeah all right good night
