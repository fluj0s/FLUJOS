bliley act any manipulative or deceptive vice or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors the united states district court for the southern district of california4 initially dismissed the case without prej udice on the basis that plainti ffs had not stated claim of securities fraud because they did not explain why the statements ma were false when made or why the defendants had duty to disclose plaintiffs subsequently filed second amended complaint sac which was dismissed by the federal district court with prejudice stating the sac does not contain any allegations that the fdas nonapproval of the albuterol spiros device had any rela tionship to the february price drop accordingly the sac does not explain how the alleged misrepresentations and omissions regarding albuterol spiros t ouched upon the reasons for the decline in duras stock price rather the decline in duras stock price was the result of an expected revenue shortfall accordingl the sacs allegations regarding albuterol spiros are insufficient to state claim5 plaintiffs appealed the court of appeals for the ninth circuit began its discussion by stating that it has been held that for plaintiffs properly to llege violation of section 10b they must satisfy the following requirements 1 defenda nts made false statement or omission with regard to material fact 2 in connection w ith the purchase or sale of security 3 withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22038crs3 6 see binder v

addressed first the issue of loss causation the court stated that in the ninth circuit loss causation is satisfied when the plaintiff shows that the misrepresentation touches upon the reasons fo r the investments decline in value7 the court went on to summarize cases that had held that in fraudonthemarket8 case plaintiffs establish loss causation if they have shown that the price on the date of purchase was inflated because of the misrepresentation9 the court believed that in this case plaintiffs satisfied the re quirements of loss causation appellants have pled that the price of the stock was overvalued in part due to the misrepresentations by dura and the indi vidual defendants that the development and testing of the albuterol spiros device we re proceeding satisfactorily and that fda approval of the device was imminent acco rdingly the district court erred by finding that appellants failed to plead loss causation sufficient to survive motion to dismiss with regard to statements concer ning the albuterol spiros device10 the court next addressed the scienter issue and stated that it had to decide whether the plaintiffs had met the scie nter requirement concerning their allegations about duras ceclor sales the private securities litigation reform act11 sets forth the pleading requirements for securities fra ud actions the complaint mu st specify each statement alleged to have been misleading the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading and if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed12 the plaintiff is required to plead with particularity facts giving rise to strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind13 the ninth circuit had summarized the scienter requirement as follows the complaint must allege that the defendant made false or misleading statements either intentionally or with deliberate recklessness or if the challenged representation is forw ard looking statement with actual knowledgethat the st atement was false or misleading14 the ninth circuit court of appeals noted that the district court had considered separately plaintiffs argument s that dura had made false or misleading statements about its products and sales nd that duras awareness of the in accuracy of these statements was evidenced by such actions as sales by executives of their stock in its considerationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22038crs4 15 84 employerteamster joint council pension trust f und

district court had concluded that each was insufficient to show scienter the court of appeals stated that it had made clear that allegations of scie nter must be cons idered separately beyond each individual allegation we also cons ider whether the total of plaintiffs allegations even though individually lack ing are sufficient to create strong inference that defendants acted with deliberate or conscious recklessness15 the court of appeals vacated the district courts finding of scienter and instructed the district court on remand to consid er collectively the allegations finally the court of appeals considered the argument that plaintiffs should have been able to amend the second amended complaint the court of appeals stated that leave to amend under rule 15 of the federal rule s of civil procedure should be liberally applied in looking at various statements that plaintiffs wish ed to include in an amended complaint the court of appeals stated that because it appears that appellants had reasonable chance of successfully stating cl aim if given another opportunity the district court abused its discretion in nying leave to amend the sac16 the court of appeals therefore reversed and remanded the judgment of the district court on january 12 2005 the united states supr eme court heard oral argument the wording of the question presented to the court as filed in the briefs by petitioners and respondents varies somewhat petitioners state that the ques tion presented is whether securities fraud plaintiff invoking the fraudon themarket theory must demonstrate loss causation by pleading and proving causal c onnection between the alleged fraud and the investments subsequent decline in price respondents state the question as whether to plead loss causation in section 10b open market fraud case plai ntiffs must do more than plead facts establishing fraudbased infl ation and overpayment on the date of their purchase on april 19 2005 the supreme court reversed the ninth circuit court of appeals the court held that the plaintiffs complaint concerning the artificially inflated purchase price was legally insufficient the court began its discussion by statin g that in fraudonthemarket cases an inflated purchase price does not by itself constitute or proximately cause the relevant economic loss the court went on to state that the ninth circuit had precedent among the other circuit courts for its holding further according to the court the private securities litigation reform act requires that securities fraud complaint specify each misleading statement set forth facts which formed the belief that statement is misleading and state with particularity facts providing strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of nd this act also places the burden of proof on the plaintiff to show that the defendants misrepresentations caused the loss for which the plaintiff seeks to recover thus according to the court the act makes clear thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22038crs5 congress intended to allow private securities fraud actions for recovery only if the plaintiffs adequately allege and prove the traditional elements of causation and loss the ninth circuits approach was found to be inconsistent with the laws requirements and its decision was reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with the supreme courts opinion
