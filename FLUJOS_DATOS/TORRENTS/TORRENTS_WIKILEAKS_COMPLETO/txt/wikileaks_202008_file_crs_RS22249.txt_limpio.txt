by claiming losses related to the disaster on the tax return for the previous year usually by filing an amended return tax relief for losses casualty losses can result from the destruction of or damage to property from any sudden unexpected and unusual event such as flood hurricane tornado fire earthquake or even volcanic eruption if property is destroyed damaged or stolen due to casualty taxpayers may be entitled to an itemized tax deduction generally the deduction is limited to the casualty loss minus 10 of the taxpayers adjusted gross income agi and 100 per casualty event further the deduction is reduced by any reimbursement for the damaged property such as insurance in cases where the recovery amount exceeds taxpayers basis casualty gain occurs and is taxable the katrina emergency tax relief act pl 10973 enacted provision that waives both the limitation of the deduction to 10 of the taxpayers adjusted gross income and the 100 per casualty event the waiver applies to losses that arise in the hurricane katrina disaster area on or after august 25 2005 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22249 if property is not completely destroyed or stolen or if it is personaluse property the loss is determined by first figuring the decrease in fair market value of the property as result of the casualty event then the decrease in fair market value is compared with the adjusted basis in the property the adjusted basis is usually the cost of the property plus or minus certain adjustments from the smaller of these two amounts the taxpayer subtracts any insurance or other reimbursement received or expected to be received the result is the loss from the casualty if business or incomeproducing property is completely destroyed or stolen decrease in fair market value is not considered the loss is the adjusted basis of the property minus any salvage value and any insurance or other reimbursement that is received or expected to be received casualty losses are generally deductible only in the year the casualty occurred however if deductible loss occurs as result of disaster in presidentiallydeclared disaster area taxpayers can choose to deduct that loss on the tax return for the year immediately preceding the year of the casualty if taxpayers have already filed tax return for the preceding year the loss may be claimed in the preceding year by filing an amended return form
