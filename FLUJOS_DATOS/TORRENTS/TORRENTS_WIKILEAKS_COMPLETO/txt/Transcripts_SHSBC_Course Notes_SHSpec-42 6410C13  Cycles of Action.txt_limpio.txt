6410c13 shspec42 cycles of action the importance relative value or worth assigned to datum is as important as the datum this is evaluation of importances cycles of action are fundamental of which one must be aware there is particular crisis relating to this topic except insofar as auditors have been failing to get their questions answered we are talking about cycle in the sense that wheel going around and coming back to the same place is cycle the word cycle has picked up some odd connotations as in the modern short story which tries to give an appearance of nochange by starting and ending in the same place in the same mood in the field of mechanics cycle is total revolution in physics and engineering cycle is the motion between the end of one wave and the end of the next wave ie the motion during one wavelength there is an old definition of cycle that has more to do with what we are talking about that is philosophical concept that doesnt involve the word cycle this concept is found in the hymn to the dawn child in the vedas it expresses that there is nothingness from which comes something that grows matures decays and returns to nebulosity and nothingness johann templehof went to india and got people from krishnamurtis group interested in scientology this annoyed krishnamurti the concept of the cycle of action gives us lots of applicable wisdom cycle of action is plot of consecutive incident against time from r6 we know that time is commonlyheld consideration it is big gpm with lot of rootwords with an endword time connected to them it is an agreedupon progress that we are all making and moving forward in view of the fact that we are all in present time since there is nowhere else to be and that we dont really move in time the incident as it goes forward appears to be plotted against time it is the incident that makes the time old humanoids have time because little happens and there is future kids days are interminable because lot happens you could boil this down to tolerance of incident it is ones tolerance for incidents that give one the impression of time going fast or slow when person has an increase in his tolerance for incident life seems to slow down if you measure time by the amount of incident occurring and then didnt have any incident you wouldnt have any time it is not that the more incident the more time you have necessarily you are dealing with false commodity for one thing and for another thing how much time you have depends on the consideration of whether lot of incident makes lot of time or little time you can practically monitor how much time you have by your consideration of how busy you want to be sometimes there gets to be too much incident so there gets to be not enough time you can manufacture time by deciding that you can confront being busier its the consideration of how much incident makes how much time that gives or subtracts time from ones existence it is how much you decide that you can tolerate or confront if you have the consideration that you can be busier or that you have enough time to do something you can and will you can consider time long or short and it will be you can also get up to point where you consider time long or short without measuring it against incident you could get high enough toned to consider that evening was couple of years away and live couple of years before evening since you would thus be out of agreement with other beings it would seem that to do this you would have to have considerable tolerance for being alone for long periods of time the three actually five different attitudes towards time here are 1 unconscious 2 incident monitors the persons time here the person is at the total effect of time and he is habituated to incident monitoring his time but it is certain speed of incident that he is used to having monitor his life when the pace changes he gets reverse consideration the person never affects changes or even considers the incidents this is homo sapiens 3 person monitors time by willingness to confront incident here at the state of release the person considers one of two things if i get busy time goes faster b if i do nothing time will go faster the first of these two considerations is commonest here the being gets the idea that he can monitor time by his willingness to confront incident he can change his own pace by changing incident 4 person just postulates time this occurs around level vi here the persons considerations about time alone determine the amount of time he has he doesnt have to depend on exterior incident to consider whether much or little time goes by he can make party last long time if he wants to 5 pandetermined time at the level of ot the being might have pandetermined attitude towards time which would monitor the time of others as with sleeping beauty mesmerism provides lowerscale example of similar phenomenon with mesmerism you can put someone into total rapport where he feels and thinks the feelings and thoughts of the person who has him mesmerized the mesmerizer can pinch his own back and the mesmerized person will leap convulsively and have fingernail marks on his back this is form of physical pandeterminism it is quite unethical to do this on some poor sap who has only shred of selfdeterminism left but it is lower harmonic of the upperlevel pandeterminism over time to considerations about how much time is passing you could add other considerations like the consideration that the actions people are engaged in are happinessproducing actions in an area where such consideration had been made everyone would think he was doing fine you could also have the opposite consideration that the actions people are engaged in are miseryproducing actions in this case people would feel as though they were committing overts by acting this would change peoples considerations of time the main culprit in doing this is the newspaper which puts out this consideration by reporting only bad news on pandetermined basis but using very lowgrade finite comm line the newspapers are spreading the idea of worthless series of incidents this makes time worthless to people if society depends lot on whether they feel their cycle of action should or shouldnt proceed this consideration will do something to time and to the amount of doingness an action is simply motion through space having certain speed especially volitional or intended motion it has bad name in some quarters eg in literature or psychology in civil defense during crises any individual in action during an atomic attack would be put out of action local authority who is supposed to act is not being the idea is there must be action intended motion the prevention of motion is fairly prevalent in mental healing the psychiatrist thinks that someone is cured when he becomes inactive person who has label and who is active must be restrained in mysticism the wise or enlightened person is supposed to be totally motionless people would like to believe this if they are scared of ots the mystical mystic is case type he is reasonable but he wont act so the idea of time and whether incidents or action should occur gets messed up action has become dirty word you get an insane generality here the attitude that incidents should take place or lots of incidents should take place below this you get its all going on and theres nothing i can do about it its all happening to it has nothing to do with this is the sign of civilization on the decline even the person who says it has nothing to do with has to admit that it does have something to do with him when he is driven to it if you approach him closely enough with action and you will get cornered rat effect then you get an uncontrolled response like barroom brawl action gets bad connotation because it can produce destruction and pain when people cannot confront pain they are also refusing to confront action and when this happens they cease to confront incident and they wont advance cycle of action and their sense of time goes out by telling sick people to stay quiet doctors are prolonging the time for them telling them to have activity of some sort would make time pass more quickly this has remarkable effect on healing where more action is demanded of person than he can confront pugnacity sets in so you get destructive action which is more action than anyone can confront as with hitler who created too much action this gives people the false idea that the cycle of action always ends in decay and death because this is what it looks like in the physical universe it is here that we depart from the cycle of action depicted in the hymn of the dawn child we are taught this on every hand you have so many examples of cycles of action that end in death and disaster that you get reluctant to complete cycle of action this leads to such foolish ideas as i mustnt complete cycle of action on the pc because it will injure him this is the worry of an auditor who never completes auditing cycles that is what keeps people from arriving they are afraid to get to the final point or there could be something wrong with the persons considerations of cycle or action confrontation of incident may be low for instance some auditors cant confront too rapidly changing pc or too slowly changing pc this could lead to overrun if one cant confront changing the process or underrun if one thinks that completing cycles of action means killing pcs any of these difficulties with the cycle of action means trouble with the auditing cycle one way or another if an auditors comm cycle is out after he is up the line bit then this is why it is not the complexity of the process the auditor has to have his auditing cycle in for sure by the time he is auditing r6 there are 1 considerations of cycles 2 considerations of action 3 considerations of cycles of actions in scientology cycle of action is simply from the beginning to the end of an intended action ie the start of the cycle of action would be the first appearance of the intention to do something or of the intention to begin doing it now you can also have an otherdetermined definition of cycle of action from the moment mother looks at to where she whips the selfdetermined cycle of action is from the beginning to the end of an intentional action the way to take care of trouble with the cycle of action is itsa on its elements
