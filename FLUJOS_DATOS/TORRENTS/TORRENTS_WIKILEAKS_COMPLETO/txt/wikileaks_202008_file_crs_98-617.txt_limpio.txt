august 1997 technology trade and security issues have become more prominent and perhaps more contentious several of the specific issues discussed such as the trade imbalance between the united states and china and the composition of that trade chinas membership in the world trade organization wto and most favored nation mfn status with the united states and human rights issues as form of international diplomacy and relations are still important concerns between the two nations in beijing discussions with chinese officials us business representatives and us department of state staff

week trip to the peoples republic of china prc august 12 to august 20 19971 this trip was sponsored by the usasia institute and was the 37th such trip undertaken as part of that organizations efforts to expand the knowledge and understanding between the united states and china the us group was comprised of seven staff members from the house of representatives the us senate and the congressional research service the delegation met with chinese industry and business leaders in beijing xian shanghai and hong kong2 the group also met with several us state department officials and representatives of us industry doing business in china to obtain their perspectives the views and opinions expressed by members of the us delegation reflected either their own perspectives or the perspectives of the members of congress they represented and did not necessarily reflect official us government policy the meetings focused on many policy issues however three themes emerged during the two weeks of discussions technology trade and security issues between the two countries since august 1997 technology trade and security issues have become more prominent and some more contentious several of the specific issues discussed included the trade imbalance between the united states and china and the composition of that trade chinas membership in the world trade organization wto and most favored nation mfn status with the united states and linking human rights issues to trade policy other issues touched on during the two weeks of meetings last summer have since emerged as critical in sinoamerican relations these include technology transfer and us export control policies the financial health and economic growth of china and hong kong and the delicate issue of foreign influence on domestic politics and policies on several of these issues concerns raised on both sides during the two weeks of meetings were addressed as result greater understanding of national policies was achieved on both sides in other areas concerns remained and issues were left unresolved 1 in this report china and prc are used interchangeably 2 the chapters in this report are organized chronologically by itinerary for complete listing of people the delegation met see references crs2 despite differences that may exist between the two nations the meetings also reflected the deep desire for american congressional staff and chinese policymakers to learn more about each other to exchange ideas and to find common ground the chinese hosts at every meeting in every city extended gracious hospitality the chinese sponsors of this trip also ensured that the delegation had the chance to enjoy the great cultural heritage that china has and in this way provided context of chinas history politics and economic growth members of the group were impressed by the broad size and scope of the chinese nation from the great wall outside of beijing to the dynamism in hong kong and from the rural expanses of the shaanxi province to the growth of development in shanghai beijing august 12th 16th most of the meetings that took place in beijing concerned broad trade and political issues between the united states and china the congressional staff delegation met with senior chinese government officials former members of the government both civilian and military officials in the us embassy and with representatives from the boeing corporation an overview of technology trade and security issues it became apparent during two weeks of discussions that chinas national technology policy is viewed by many policymakers business leaders academics and others as the engine for chinas future economic growth and development3 invigorating scientific research and access to technology innovation are at the core of chinas economic plan for the 21st century part of this strategy is domestic policy targeted at strengthening internal science and technology st resources this strategy is also global china seeks to obtain wide range of scientific and technological resources to hasten its development its relationship with the united states both in cooperation and competition is viewed by many as critical to nurturing and improving its technological capacity chinese national technology policy is complex mix of centralized industrialization staterun technology parks and economic development zones while there is coordinated national policy from beijing pockets of local entrepreneurial high technology have sprouted all over the country there also continues to be reluctance to openly exchange many forms of scientific research and technology innovation with foreign entities yet china appears eager to embrace the best and the brightest that foreign research and development sources have to offer this ambivalence was not surprising it is country that at once appears to be coming into 21st century as an advanced developed nation while parts of the country 3 discussions

and technology commission beijing 13 august 1997 crs3 struggle to move beyond largely agrarian past therefore chinas national policies at once embrace foreign sources of technology while at the same time reflect some suspicion of the outside world4 like many other newly industrializing economies chinas policies are heavily focused on applied research and technology commercialization several areas of scientific research and technology development stood out as priorities for china telecommunications information technology aerospace biotechnology agricultural and energy in all of these areas the chinese consistently expressed strong desire to improve scientific cooperation and technology transfer between the two nations trade issues usprc trade issues were consistently discussed during the two weeks the delegation was in china however during the time in beijing when most of the discussions were with chinese political and policy leaders trade issues dominated the four major usprc trade issues were the worsening us trade deficit with china in 1987 the united states had 28 billion merchandise trade deficit with china by 1996 the merchandise trade deficit surged to 395 billion and in 1997 it was 497 billion5 from 1991 to 1996 us exports to china increased by 905 while us imports from china increased by 17146 the composition of goods and services traded between the two countries and why this composition is important to us policymakers according to the us department of commerce in 1997 small and mediumsized electrical machinery toys and sports equipment and footwear accounted for almost all of the imports from china to the united states in terms of us exports to china largescale machinery aircraft and spacecraft technologies electrical machinery and fertilizers constituted the majority of merchandise exported in 1997 talks between chinese officials and the us delegation revolved around whether this trade composition is reflection of real market demand or whether tariff and nontariff barriers are causing distortions in trade composition chinas most favored nation mfn trading status with the united states is not permanent but conditional us policy has been that certain issues need to be addressed by the chinese before mfn status becomes permanent chinese officials contended that this is serious issue for the chinese people some in the us delegation contended that trade security and human rights issues must be addressed in china before mfn can be approved 4 discussions with cheng zhendeng senior engineer the state science and technology commission beijing

atlas 28 may 1998 6 congressional research service chinaus trade issues by wayne m morrison ib9112 updated regularly p 1 crs4 chinas acceptance as member of the world trade organization wto the chinese consider wto membership as an important step which would indicate recognition of chinas importance in the global economy some us policymakers have economic and noneconomic concerns regarding chinas wto membership among the issues discussed were those linking wto membership to ensuring us access to chinese markets greater democratization in china improvement in prc human rights issues greater access to information through the internet and telecommunications technologies and improving us export control policies to china7 major points of contention between several members of the us delegation and chinese officials during meetings in beijing were the size of the trade deficit which is large the direction the deficit is taking growing larger each year and the composition of the trade small manufactured goods from china advanced technologies and valueadded services from the united states several members of the us group expressed the opinion that it was likely that any improvement in the usprc relationship would have to start with change in the trading relationship between the two nations chinese position in response to us concerns about the size structure and composition of the trade deficit chinese policymakers emphasized their view that the current merchandise trade deficit with the united states and particularly significant reduction in us exports to china is temporary aberration and will be brought to equilibrium by free market forces while the trade imbalance with the united states may create tensions the chinese policymakers contend that it is the result of market forces at work and not central government planning the us government has not accurately taken into account hong kong trade as part of the prc trade equation with the united states nor accurately accounted for us firms manufacturing goods in china for sale in the united states the united states harms itself by maintaining complicated and unwise export control policies particularly for dualuse technologies and atomic energy these technology exports to china could greatly improve relations between the two countries as well as helping redress the trade imbalance issue us delegation position on each of these points several members of the us group sought to clarify the us position as well as address chinese concerns the us groups views while not always unanimous are summarized in the following points 7 while these were issues raised by the us group during this trip it should be noted that the us trade representative does not link specific trade issues with nontrade issues in discussions with chinese officials crs5 the trade deficit trend line between the united states and china can be traced over several years and is neither one year aberration nor short term development while honest disagreements can exist regarding trade policies between nations much more can be done to eliminate chinese tariff and nontariff barriers on us imports while there may be some accounting discrepancies between the two nations us officials do not view this as major contributing factor to the trade deficit between the united states and china us export control policies are of concern to many us policymakers yet reflect balance between national security and economic opportunities for us firms linking trade to other issues two very contentious policy issuesmfn status and membership in the wto led to broader policy question often discussed between the us delegation and their chinese hosts as well as debated within the us delegation should the united states link trade and nontrade political issuessuch as human rightswhen dealing with china mfn status mfn treatment is conferred when one country extends to another any trade concessions privileges and immunities which that country has granted or will grant to any trading partner in other words trade between the two nations is conducted with tariffs that are set at the rate lowest among common trading partners rather than at higher full rates the united states has extended mfn status to all but few nations but never extended permanent mfn status to china it had suspended mfn status with china between 1951 and 1980 but then revoked the suspension when diplomatic relations between the two nations were restored from 1980 through 1989 annual renewal of chinas mfn status was generally uncontroversial with some congressional disapproval8 the incident in tiananmen square in june 1989 caused strong congressional reaction in 1990 congress undertook series of legislative initiatives tying chinas mfn status with progress in the prcs human rights conditions several bills passed the 102nd and 103rd congress making renewal of chinas mfn status conditional on progress in human rights yet president bush was opposed to linking mfn to human rights issues and vetoed the legislation legislation withdrawing or imposing further conditions on chinas mfn status has passed congress during the clinton administration9 8 congressional research service mostfavorednation status and china history and alternative approaches to current law by wayne m morrison crs report 96992 10 december 1996 p 13 9 ibid p 3 president clinton announced in 1993 that the us would provide conditions on renewing chinas mfn status however in 1994 the president announced support for its mfn status without conditions linked to human rights issues crs6 several chinese policymakers expressed frustration that the united states has considered linking mfn status to chinas domestic issues they contended that china has made great progress since 1989 in providing democratic initiatives to the chinese populace they also contended that the conditional mfn policy stick is longer effective in trying to make china comply with us ideals not renewing chinas mfn status would seriously impair the current trade relations with the united states as well as cause significant trade disruptions10 there was range of opinion on this issue within the us group some members flatly rejected policy linking human rights and other democratic ideals to trade relations with china they contended that to link human rights issues to trade policy unfairly imposes an american viewpoint on the current chinese political system america must view china through prism that reflects chinas culture history and political developmentnot us ideals and aspirations for the prc others in the us delegation represented the view that mfn for china should be opposed based on the continuing structural trade deficit with the united states from this point of view the deficit is not shortterm phenomenon but longerterm problem before permanent mfn status is bestowed on china the structural imbalance of the trade deficit must be addressed this viewpoint articulated the concern that once chinas mfn status becomes permanent there will be incentive for china to redress the longterm trade deficit with the united states yet others in the delegation supported mfn status but believe it should be linked to progress on human rights issues this viewpoint contended that it is perfectly within the political and philosophical framework of the united states to insist that basic conditions of freedom and democracy are in place before permanent business and trading relationship is ratified by congress in particular there was concern that chinese dissidents continue to be imprisoned without fair trials and that free speech and other forms of expression are routinely suppressed advocates of this position in the us group called for the united states and china to exchange information on political prisoners and hold leadership summits in beijing and washington to discuss both nations humanitarian concerns membership in the wto chinese membership in the wto also was discussed at great length by americans and chinese on this trip in 1995 the wto succeeded the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt as the major forum for discussion of global trade issues since the inception of the wto china has sought membership in part to have forum to voice its trade policy and in part as sign of its growing importance and stature in the global community however many wto countries contend that chinas trade policies are incompatible with the wto system of what are accepted as standard and fair trading practices critics cite chinas 10 discussions with ambassador jiang chengzong chinese peoples institute of foreign affairs beijing 12 august 1997 mme zhang yuejiao director

ministercounsellor economic affairs department of state beijing 16 august 1997 crs7 continued centralized trade practices lack of movement towards complete privatization of enterprises inadequate protection of intellectual property rights ipr and evidence of continued nontariff barriers as some of the issues still unreconciled for chinese membership in the wto11 in response several chinese officials contended that it is critical for the global community to include major nation like china in the multilateral trading system china is the eleventh largest trading nation in the world and by some measures the third largest economy in the world12 chinese officials contended that wto membership will further open its economy to technology imports creating greater market for high technology firms seeking to do business abroad chinese officials also stated that other nations without open economies or completely free market trade policies such as india malaysia and thailand are members of the wto they asked is there double standard for china13 mfn status with the united states and chinas wto membership are important issues for both china and the united states the chinese position consistently emphasized the importance of resolving both issues in satisfactory manner members of the us delegation stressed that the us government understands the importance of both issues to the prc and that stable trading position with the united states and other global partners is desired outcome technology and security during discussions on trade issues concerns were raised about technology transfer between the two nations chinese officials uniformly stated that one way to significantly alter the trade imbalance between the two nations was to change us export control policy and allow more high technology components to be sold to china in particular chinese officials stressed the importance of us high technologies and advanced research and development to the chinese economy several chinese government and business leaders called for greater us exports of telecommunications and computer technologies aircraft and aerospace industry components capital equipment and manufacturing technologies and advanced materials and composites they argued that these technologies would continue to spur economic growth and lead to greater domestic stability in china the region and globally14

department of state beijing and robert ludan ministercounsellor of economic affairs department of state 16 august 1997 crs8 discussions between members of the us delegation and chinese policymakers during this trip explored whether there may be increased opportunities for technology transfer between the two nations common ground was found in those areas where us technological expertise can directly contribute to improving the quality of life for the chinese people eg telephone and telecommunications infrastructure it was also recognized that there continues to be tension between chinas desire for us commercial technology transfers and us concerns regarding chinese use of dualuse technology for military applications as well as proliferation of such technologies to other countries these tensions appear to have increased since august 1997 technology transfer and economic growth the importance of technology transfer to the prc was raised often by chinese officials technology was cited as the catalyst by which china would fully develop as nation some american observers of china believe longterm relationship is more important to the chinese than the relationship with the united states because of the need for us technologies leading to chinas advancement these observers view china as poised to make an historic political economic and social transformation shedding many antiquated aspects of an older system as new society emerges15 chinese officials emphasized the importance of technology transfer as part of chinas selfimage among other developed nations in this respect us policies that deny technologies to china were described as an affront to the chinese people some officials often expressed frustration with us views which they believe demonize or chastise chinese attempts to obtain advanced commercial technologies chinese officials contended that any developing country would seek out the most advanced and appropriate technology for economic growth several officials were of the opinion that there is double standard in us policy towards technology transfer to developing countries in which other developing nations receive appropriate technology denied to the chinese some officials appeared perplexed and angered by us technology transfer policies16 export controls chinese officials consistently raised two concerns with us technology transfer policy the first was over us export control laws and regulations the chinese position seemed to reflect confusion and irritation over the direction and intent of us export control policies they expressed concern that certain technologies such as basic memory semiconductor chips can be exported to china while more advanced semiconductor chip technologies can be blocked under us military control lists similarly while us policies restrict certain types of supercomputer technologies for sale to china chinese officials stated that they can obtain identical technologies from other countries eg france or japan or the chinese can buy off the shelf workstations and other commercial technologies 15 william c mccahill deputy chief of mission department of state beijing and robert ludan ministercounsellor of economic affairs department of state 16 august 1997 16 discussions with general xu xin president china institute for international strategic studies beijing 13 august 1997

us vendors and bundle these technologies for advanced highperformance computing17 many us policymakers and some business leaders also have questioned us export controls believing they are antiquated and at crosspurposes basic export control policies were established during the cold war when us national security interests were clearer and welldefined some now argue that current export restrictions toward china may be attempts by some to create national security threat for the united states where none may now exist18 however numerous members of congress and several private analysts have recently suggested that the post cold war deregulation of exports and particularly the liberalization of export controls by the clinton administration may be contributing to the strategic capabilities of potential adversaries in particular congress is currently examining the implications of us exports to china of dualuse commodities licensed by the department of commerce another issue is the transfer of several items from the us munitions list where they were licensed for export by the department of state to commerce departments commodity list the effect of these transfers on export control decisions and the national security nonproliferation and foreign policy implications critics in the united states and china also point to conflicting licensing policies and jurisdictions among the departments of commerce state and defense according to the general accounting office gao the department of commerce can justify the license of commercial technology for export using economic and trade interests and it controls items to achieve specific national security and foreign policy objectives the department of state has broader authority to deny export and must take national security interests into account before providing export licenses the department of defense advises both departments of commerce and state on their license cases and emphasizes military applications of technology transfer the gao contends that differing statutory authority among these three agencies has caused jurisdictional and procedural uncertainty for us export control policies19 however the gao upon examining specific technology transfer policies and actions between the united states and china also has determined that the chinese governments roleparticularly the militaryin technology transfer has complicated this issue the gao found that in the transfer of both telecommunications and machine tool equipment to china the chinese militarys role in obtaining and 17 this perspective is

for two sensitive dualuse items gaonsiad0724 january 1997 p 34 crs10 diverting technology from the united states has raised additional questions about the purpose and objective of chinas technology transfer from the united states20 most members of the us delegation acknowledged that more can be done to streamline us export licensing procedures clarifying jurisdictional problems between us agencies and making procedural decisions more transparent however most believed that serious technology transfer problems between the united states and china still exist some members expressed doubt that the united states would change its export control policies towards china unless the prc first made very transparent its policies of obtaining and using certain foreign technologies this was underscored by the position that until these issues are discussed more openly and frankly between both countries changes in us export control policies which might benefit the prc are unlikely proliferation several chinese officials protested that the united states has unfairly and incorrectly portrayed china as an agent of proliferation of military weapons and nuclear technologies to rogue nations during every discussion with chinese officials this portrayal was denied chinese officials consistently spoke of us government report which purportedly cleared china of this portrayal21 as well as the absence of proof from the international community at large that china was supplying iraq iran pakistan or any other country with military weapons or nuclear technology22 this claim was countered by official us representatives in beijing they stated that there has been evidence of chinas proliferation activities for several years however us officials indicated that china appeared to be curtailing some of its proliferation activities to other nations according to the us view in beijing in 1997 chinese officials recognized that proliferation was serious impediment to uschinese relations us officials also commented that when the united states raises proliferation concerns with chinese officials china raises concerns about weapon sales to taiwan23 20 general accounting office

beijing and robert ludan ministercounsellor of economic affairs department of state 16 august 1997 crs11 proliferation of specific technologies and their uses also was raised during discussions during one such meeting the chinese position stressed the importance of the nascent national space program and how china and the united states could cooperate in this field24 members of the us group asked chinese officials about chinas national policies for containment of launch vehicle and related satellite technologies and the use of these technologies within national boundaries the us delegation was assured that chinas long march satellite launch program was purely commercial in nature and that there was intent to pass along vital launch and satellite technologies to other nations that could be used for launching missiles the delegation found this chinese position to be highly suspect25 national interests according to one source onethird to onehalf of all economic growth comes from technology progress and that it is the principal driving force for longterm economic growth and increased standards of living for modern industrial societies26 therefore it is understandable why chinas national policy for obtaining and utilizing the best foreign technologies is vital to its goals of economic growth however chinas national interest in obtaining technologies may not be consistent with those nations that are the source of technology those nations often restrict or control technologies that they view as inimical to their national economic security the importance of technology transfer to national economic security policies was the focus of an animated discussion during luncheon at the boeing corporations beijing offices officials from boeing described what it is like to do business in china and cited two key elements for undertaking business in the prc the first is that it is never just business in china but that personal and political relations are key for any foreign firm trying to do business boeing officials acknowledged that meeting certain host country concessions such as technology transfer required balancing of business interests and objectives if certain technology transfer concessions would have to be made to capture chinese market share boeing likely would consider this as good longterm tradeoff27 the second key was to balance boeings corporate global perspective with us national economic and security interests for boeing officials us export control policies can hinder the company as it competes against companies from countries 24

phd director of public affairs boeing commercial airplane group beijing 14 august 1997 crs12 with less restrictive policies the boeing officials cautioned members of the delegation that as staff for us policymakers they should recognize that export control policies do not just affect the united states domestically but have wider impact outside of us borders which may significantly affect us business interests28 but several members of the us delegation countered that what may be best for us multinational corporations may not always be best for us national interests while recognizing the challenges of doing business in country like china they contended that every country has export controls that would extend to important commercial technologies and dualuse commodities nor some in the delegation argued should the united states encourage technology transfer while serious trade employment and security issues between the two nations have not been resolved xian august 15th 17th the congressional group spent several days in the city of xian in the shaanxi province this part of the trip provided members of the group the opportunity to visit high technology center engage in discussions on current agricultural standards issues and visit many cultural and historical sites in the region high technology center the us group made brief visit to the xian hightechnology center the high technology center formed in 1991 is complex of buildings that serves many purposes office and research space are rented out to entrepreneurs who are seeking to develop new innovative ideas or to commercialize scientific inventions it is also site for joint ventures and direct foreign investment since 1991 nearly 300 high technology joint ventures have begun at the xian high technology center29 upon completion of the entire high technology center early in the next century supporters of the center expect 2000 high technology enterprises to be housed in over dozen buildings30 the high technology center is also part of larger high technology development plan to establish high technology zone in the shaanxi province according to the managers of this high technology center china now has 52 statelevel high technology zones the xian high technology zone is intended to become the chinese high technology version of silicon valley or research triangle in north carolina to that end the provincial government has established strong ties with local universities and colleges to draw upon students with backgrounds in science 28 ibid 29 discussions with zhang dongfan vice executive director the administrative committee on xian hightech industries zone xian 15 august 1997 30 ibid while construction of the high technology center began shortly after its creation in 1991 only approximately onethird of its facilities were completed by august 1997 crs13 engineering and related technical education the provincial government also provides preferential treatment for newly formed firms at the center31 the xian high technology center appears to have potential in region where there has been little high technology development and economic growth the center and zone are both intended to attract companies in telecommunications electronics advanced materials and other high growth fields however it was unclear whether any new products or commercial innovations had come out of the xian high technology center by august 1997 it is also unclear whether this type of state directed high technology program will provide the type of innovative and entrepreneurial technology development and commercialization its leaders have set as the regions goal agriculture exports and sanitary standards the issue of agriculture trade between the united states and china was discussed several times during this trip because the shaanxi province is farming region sinoamerican discussions on this part of the trip often addressed both opportunities and problems of agricultural trade between the two countries32 according to the foreign agricultural service fas of the us department of agriculture chinas large and growing population is driving greater need for wheat coarse grain corn and other agricultural goods domestic production of agricultural products while expanding rapidly cannot meet the needs of population now at 12 billion for example for corn production is being used to meet increased domestic consumption and is not exported33 china is an important market for us agricultural exports in 1996 the united states exported 2092 billion in agricultural goods to china in the same year the united states imported 597 million in agricultural goods from china through 1997 the united states had surplus in agricultural trade with china for nine of ten years the most important agricultural exports to china are wheat and cotton which in 1996 together accounted for 56 of us agricultural exports to china however these export levels for specific commodities can

included terms to standardize importexport policies and to reduce tariff and nontariff barriers part of the mou included an agreement that china would use more rigorous scientific measurements for evaluating the sanitary and phytosanitary standards of imported agricultural commodities however the us trade representative has concluded that chinas phytosanitary standards are often overly strict unevenly applied and not backed by modern laboratory techniques35 chinas use of sanitary and phytosanitary standards36 to restrict us imports particularly that of wheat was discussed some chinese and americans expressed belief that china and the united states can find common ground in their bilateral agricultural policy some members of the us delegation especially those from rural states stressed the importance of increasing us agricultural exports to china as way of improving relations between the two nations china continues to indicate that it is receptive to increasing its agricultural trade with the united states but has linked that action with obtaining mfn status with the united states and eventual membership into the wto37 political and cultural history the visit to xian included several visits to museums ancient burial grounds temples and other historical sites it provided members of the delegation an opportunity to better understand the political and cultural history of china and to better comprehend the enormous size scope and diversity of the nation one of the most important cultural and historical lessons learned during this part of the trip was that chinas long history has been marked by periods of unity and disunity in which imperialism and autocracy brought together disparate groups interspersed by periods of separatism and provincial discord for some chinese policymakers and foreign sinologists this history provides cautionary note that political cultural and ethnic ties which appear to unite china today may be more tenuous than viewed from the outside38 35 office of the us trade representative 1998 national trade estimates report p 50 36 sanitary human and animal health and phytosanitary plant health measures are laws decrees

first unified imperial dynasty in china at xian and ordered the creation of 6000 lifesized terra cotta soldiers xian served as chinas capital over 11 dynasties from the qin dynasty and its successor the han dynasty 206 bcad 220 to the tang dynasty 61890740 the region around xian also become the crossroads for the development of several religious and philosophical tenets during the era of the hundred schools of thought approximately 400200 bc among the first of the philosophies developed was confucianism philosophy adapted by scholars who sought to create social and political ideal unifying the chinese people this system prescribed series of orderly relationships within society let the ruler be ruler and the subject subject based on ethical relationships and moral good41 chinese legalism also known as the school of law was diametrically opposed to confucian thought and vied for followers during this period it was philosophy based on authoritarian control of government not ethical or moral persuasion legalists exalted the state and sought prosperity and marital prowess above the welfare of the common people during the han dynasty the tenets of confucianism and legalism were combined to create working imperial form of government the tension inherent in these two philosophies of the rule of man versus the rule of law approach to government is still evident in modern china42 shanghai august 18th 21st shanghai is one of the most rapidly growing cities in china with 1997 population of 147 million the fifth largest in the world43 it was the first chinese city opened to western trade 1842 and at the beginning of the 20th century became chinas largest industrial center although closed off from western interaction after 1949 it retained its lead as chinas center for industrial scientific and technological development for nearly fifty years since normalization of relations with most of the west since the late 1970s issues involving shanghais development are technology and capital formation the role of stateownedenterprises soes and multinational enterprises mnes and telecommunications and internet development44 39 library of congress federal research

central shanghai which consists of the oldest part of the city the large agricultural areas of the rural hinterlands forming the edge of the metropolitan area and the transitional zones in between the two the pudong district is one such transitional zone and is home to science and technology park as well as several public and private research and development centers the shanghai zj hitech park was created in 1992 as the first step of larger technopolis encompassing most of the pudang district of shanghai as with its counterpart in xian the shanghai zj hitech park when completed will be impressive in size and scope it will cover 17 square kilometers and employ over 10000 scientists engineers and researchers45 the main purpose of the park is to encourage foreign investment and joint ventures in research and development rd preferential tax policy for foreign firms locating in this park was outlined by officials at the park this includes tax moratoria and holidays for longterm rd investment by foreign firms46 while the official emphasis at shanghai zj hitech park is to encourage domestic and foreign private sector investment it was clear that american and chinese interpretations of how to implement this policy differed chinese officials at the park were asked by members of the us delegation what could be done to further encourage us high technology firms to consider shanghai zj hitech park for rd joint ventures the chinese officials responded that the us government should lead companies to shanghai and it should be us public policy to interest us firms in relocating to the park even when members of the delegation explained that this is not an appropriate role for government in the american context the chinese position remained unchanged47 the issue of attracting foreign investment for technology development also was central to discussions with representatives of the us insurance firm american international groupamerican international assurance co ltd aigaia representatives from this company stated how difficult it is to sell insurance and other forms of financial instruments in shanghai and the rest of china they contended that many chinese still have strong suspicion of foreign financial companies and that life and property insurance are new concepts for most chinese for many chinese the riskreward for investment resides only with savings accounts in chinese banks that pay very low interest rates representatives from aigaia indicated that further industrialization and technology development and commercialization may be hindered if chinese capital is not invested more constructively48 45 investment guide shanghai jz hitech park english version 1997 19 pages 46 discussions with honglian hu vice president zj hitech park and shirley zhao sales and marketing zj hitech park development shanghai 19 august 1997 47 ibid 48 of course their view of more constructive capital investments would be through their continued crs17 one source of investment capital for technology development and commercialization may be the shanghai stock exchange created in 1990 with just eight companies publicly traded the shanghai stock exchange had 628 members by august 1997 with over half of those firms issuing two forms of stock49 however it was unclear from discussions how much of the investment in the shanghai exchange was used for capital investment in shanghai as opposed to being secondary market transactions among buyers and sellers when asked about this chinese officials contended that while there will always be some speculative money most of the investment was sound as proof they indicated that as of august 1997 neither the shanghai exchange nor china as whole was affected by the economic downturn which had begun in indonesia korea and japan50 soes and mnes stateownedenterprises soes are those companies started managed and supported by the chinese government multinational enterprises mnes are mostly foreign

committed to longterm business growth in the prc the biggest problem facing this us company is protection of intellectual property rights against piracy and what they described as the prcs bureaucratic and often corrupt distribution system for their goods52 in shanghai as elsewhere on this trip there were indications that china is going through difficult era of privatization as it tries to reduce or eliminate its soes however if the chinese government removes all support for these firms most will not be able to compete the potential for large scale unemployment if workers from chinese soes cannot find work elsewhere is major concern for china as of august 1997 there already was some indication of worker displacement and massive shifts of population as china tries to address issues of privatization and free enterprise53 telecommunications and the internet shanghai also was representative of the great growth in telecommunications infrastructure applications and services in china there was evidence in central shanghai and pudong of long lines of fiber optic cable new satellite dishes on buildings and construction of terrestrial communications relay towers the shanghai stock exchange had just recently been completely rewired for global trading in the rest of china there has been an explosion of telecommunications technologies and applications this has been most evident in the growth of the internet in china in 1993 only about 20000 chinese had access to the internet by the time of the delegations trip that figure was about 250000 in 1998 it is over 600000 chinese officials forecast that the number of internet users in china will be two million by 2000 and seven million by 200154 one of the impacts of this growth in internet use is its effect on the global economy from discussions with us business representatives in shanghai education and training of chinese students in computer science and related fields represents one of the most popular areas of academic study55 these students are just beginning to enter the workforce one expert describes many of the new information technology and service workers as virtual aliens instead of making

reportedly have personal computers57 most chinese citizens are unlikely to have access to computers and global communications networks well into the next century even telephones while becoming more common reach about 6 of the population58 it also is unclear whether chinas official policies toward internet use and communications will permit this growth or have to change because of it in 1996 law was passed requiring all chinese who use the internet to register with beijing chinas official policy on the internet continues to restrict its access and use by ordinary citizens hong kong august 22nd and 23rd the last part of the trip consisted of one full day of meetings in hong kong discussions focused mainly on the impact of the turnover of hong kong from british to chinese rule other points of discussion included political freedom and territorial sovereignty hong kong after july 1 1997 at midnight june 30 1997 hong kong reverted to chinese sovereignty after 150 years of british rule the transfer of power was the result of 1984 sinobritish joint declaration which established one country two systems principle of transfer the prc has pledged to leave in place hong kongs open capitalist system for at least fifty more years on the surface little seemed to have changed in hong kong in the nearly sixty days between the transfer and the delegations visit hong kong has population of 55 million with population density per square mile of 1515859 it gave the appearance of continuing to be thriving mercantile center and there was civil disruption or interference with

freedom61 many leaders in hong kong acknowledged that very important question will be answered over the next several years can the hong kong which they have known survive as part of china while economic conditions are somewhat guaranteed can the same be said for political freedom and protection of individual rights62 interestingly for many longtime residents of hong kong democratic ideals of political freedom and protection of individual rights have come somewhat late in hong kongs history many natives of hong kong were disenfranchised during most of the british rule and chinese resentment over foreign rule was strong even at the time of the turnover still some would argue that real power in hong kong resides in the marketplace and not in legislative bodies63 as of august 1997 most hong kong observers with whom we met said that they expected smooth transition as the provisional legislative council legco appointed on july 1 1997 by beijing is replaced by one elected more directly elections were scheduled for may 28 1998 elections for legco only began to be held in 1985 with the first whollyelected legco not occurring until 1995 these elections were based on 203010 formula of geographic representation direct elections functional representation with elected slots determined by occupation and position in society and by an appointed election committee64 60 one interesting note occurred during talk with the head of hong kongs futures commodities exchange he was asked what he thought of the possible speculative nature of global financial markets and with forty years of experience in finance and investing what would be his advice to us stock investors his reply get out of the us stock market now discussion with ivers riley chief executive officer hong

but the chinese government dissolved the 1995 legco shortly after the turnover and crafted new electoral rules for elections to be held in 1998 however the new rules still allow for the 203010 formula see congressional research service hong kongs provisional legislature controversy by kerry dumbaugh crs report 97557 10 pages crs21 several hong kong legal experts contended that among the many implications of this change in electoral representation hong kongs rule of law will influence or supplant the rule of man tradition in china they stated that despite british occupancyor perhaps because of ithong kong has enjoyed very clear and concrete legal system therefore china with its history of autocratic rule in beijing and interests of provincial party officials has had history of rule of man in which the mandate of an individual or the party may supersede legalisms65 the answer of which system will emerge as hong kong is assimilated into china is still unknown us officials generally viewed the developments postjuly 1 1997 with optimism tinged with realism some hong kong officials contended that difficult issues such as protection of foreign intellectual property rights patents copyrights and trademarks abused in both hong kong and china may be resolved under unified rule of law yet some in hong kong stated that conversely freedom of the press and free speech may be curtailed if beijing rule of man is extended to hong kong chinese and american observers commented that even third scenario which involves compromise of both the rule of law and rule of man may create peaceful if uneasy coexistence between hong kong and the rest of china66 territorial sovereignty67 many residents and observers in hong kong which the delegation met with expressed great confidence although mixed with some concern that hong kong will essentially retain its unique character in several meetings the issue was not whether china will influence and therefore change hong kong but how much hong kongs unique mix of economic trade political and democratic characteristics may change china the future of hong kong also involves larger issues of chinese territorial sovereignty in the asia pacific region hong kong has served as gateway for much of china and therefore can be seen as an aperture through which technology trade and security issues flow as part of an experiment in one country two systems the chinese appear anxious to demonstrate that it can successfully and peacefully complete hong kongs transition still it was also very clear that many chinese now view hong kong as domestic issue and longer subject to outside interference for many chinese officials if hong kong can be successfully adopted into chinas national political and economic system then the next goal would be to look 65 discussions with daniel r fung solicitor general department of justice hong kong 22 august 1997 see also bruce einhorn hong kong now the rule of law is in jeopardy businessweek 20

during the two weeks the delegation was in china crs22 towards taiwan and apply the one country two systems policy there as well to some taiwans absorption into china is inevitable and would have already occurred without an american presence us technology trade and security policies toward taiwan are an irritant to the chinese they contend that us support of taiwan interferes with chinas domestic policy of reunification the us delegation generally pressed for greater dialogue and change in usprc technology trade and security policies many chinese officials in turn addressed us policy towards taiwan as the major obstacle for improving relations68 epilogue developments since august 1997 uschinese relations since august 1997 appear to follow the old chinese proverb both blessing and curse may you live in interesting times variety of technology trade and security as well as other economic and political issues remain at the forefront of the usprc relationship the following developments are among the highlights of this changing relationship in september 1997 the chinese peoples congress met to elect party officials and to set national policies for the next year president jiang zemin was expected by some to emerge from the congress much weaker in power and with his economic reform policies greatly diluted however according to some observers jiang was able to handle internal party factions and avoided open confrontation from both hard line conservatives and liberal reformers69 during the fall of 1997 the asian contagion of falling currency valuations in indonesia and thailand spread to korea and affected other nations like japan and china as well in china the economic downturn came at time when official chinese policy encouraged the privatization or dismantling of many soes considered to be inefficient or inoperative the impact on unemployment was fairly severe causing disruptions in the workforce as currencies in several nations were devalued many us multinational corporations reported that their earnings some based in large part on overseas sales would be adversely affected70 in october president jiang zemin visited the united states to meet with president clinton president jiang signed an order for the chinese government to buy fifty boeing aircraft for 3 billion presidents jiang and clinton also agreed that in exchange for chinas promise to limit nuclear trade with rogue states the united states would lift us ban of nonmilitary nuclear technology president clinton described it as win win win situation for us technology trade and security 68 another territorial issue was tibet which came up infrequently during discussions most chinese officials we met consider tibet to be purely internal matter the us delegation did not raise it often and when the issue of hegemony over tibet was raised most chinese had very little to say about the situation 69 out of the shadow of deng the economist 20 september 1997 3940 70 will

greenhouse gasses that are thought to be warming global climate the kyoto protocol was considered controversial because it failed to set commitments for developing countries including china to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that other signatories would have to meet these commitments had been requested by president clinton and by the us senate in sres 98 approved 950 on july 25 199772 also in december elections were held in hong kong china reported that the voting was direct and open resulting in the election of 36 deputies to sit in the national peoples congress however others contended that most of the elected deputies were beijing party faithful selected by small core of 424 qualified delegates in hong kong73 elsewhere chinese territorial policies continued to raise western concerns tensions between china and taiwan were heightened after taiwan reaffirmed its independent status in the far western province of xinjiang over million troops were dispatched to quell separatist movement for the first quarter of 1998 the department of commerce reported that the us trade deficit with china was about 115 billion this represents an increase of 19 over the first quarter of 1997 at this rate the us 1998 trade deficit with china would exceed 1997 and could possibly pass the trade deficit the united states currently has with japan however the united states continues to run surplus in agricultural trade with china with preliminary figures indicating that most agricultural trade with china is ahead of 1997 trade74 in 1998 proliferation in the asian region became global concern in may india conducted five nuclear tests and pakistan responded by detonating nuclear devices of its own the nuclear tests increased tensions between two nations that have

105th congress began series of hearings on us export control policies and possible chinese violations of us national security laws in obtaining satellite machine tool and supercomputer technologies76 against this backdrop president clinton visited china in late june 1998 the president visited xian beijing shanghai and hong kong during his two week visit addressing issues of political freedom and freedom of speech he condemned the tiananmen square incident of 1989 and called for more democratic reforms in china he also vowed to improve trade and other economic ties between the united states and china president clinton expressed support of chinas one nation two systems approach while in hong kong and stated that the united states would not support taiwans independence in turn the chinese
