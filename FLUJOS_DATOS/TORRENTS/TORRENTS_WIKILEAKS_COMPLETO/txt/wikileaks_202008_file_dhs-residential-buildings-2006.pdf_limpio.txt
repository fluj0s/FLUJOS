building there are more than 19 million housing units in residential structures with 5 or more units of these more than 4 million units are in buildings with 50 or more units potential indicators of terrorist activity terrorists have wide variety of weapons and tactics available to achieve their objec tives specific threats of most concern to large residential buildings include improvised explosive devices or vehicles arson chemicalbiologicalradiological cbr agents small arms attack or suicide bombers terrorist activity indicators are observable anomalies or incidents that may precede terro rist attack indicators of an imminent attack requiring immediate action may include the following persons employees guests contractors vendors tenants in building wearing unusually bulky clothing that might conceal suicide explosives or weapons eg gun automatic rifle unattended vehicles parked illegally or at the parking area or near the building entrance for apparent reasonable explanation unattended packages eg backpacks briefcases boxes that might contain explosives unauthorized access to restri cted areas especially the heating ventilation and airconditioning hvac system indications of unusual substances near air intakes or exhaust indicators of potential surveillance by terrorists include persons discovered with building photos or diagrams with the detailed layout highlighted persons parking standing or loitering in the same area for many days with apparent reasonable explanation persons using or carrying videocameraobservation equipment over an extended period residential building employees or occupants being questioned off site about security practices that pertain to the building or the location of surveillance equipment building employees changing their working behavior or working more irregular hours persons noticed or reported to be observing building security hvac system livery or storage areas noted pattern or series of false alarms requiring response by law enforcemen t or emergency services unfamiliar employees eg cleaning crews or other contract workers unusual or unannounced repair or maintenance activities near the building sudden losses or thefts of building surveillance equipment common vulnerabilities the following are key common vulnerabilities of large residential buildings inadequate control of access to the building by nontenants and their vehicles at exterior doors doors to adjacent public transit stations utility tunnels loading docks parking garages the design of building and materials used to construct it which might enhance the probability that it would be damaged in an attack inadequate protection of the hvac system inadequate protection of the utility services electricity natural gas water communications inadequate emergency response preparations inadequate control of acc ess to sensitive building information for official use only protective measures protective measures include equipment personnel and procedures designed to protect residential building against threats and to mitigate the ffects of an attack protective measures for large residential buildings include planning and preparedness develop comprehensive security plan and emergency response plan for tenants employees guests contractors to prepare for and respond to emergency situations including malicious or terrorist actions conduct regular exercises of the plans maintain constant awaren ess of the current threat condition and available intelligence information develop policies and procedures for dealing with hoaxes and false alarms personnel conduct background checks on building employees management service mainte nance security guards incorporate security aw areness and appropriate response procedures for emergency situations in training programs for building tenants and employees access control deny access to any nontenant who displays suspicious behavior identify and control access by employees tenants guests vendors delivery personnel and contractors remove any vehicles that have been parked for an unusual length of time at or near the building barriers provide adequate locks doors and other barriers for designated areas elevators hvac system storage delivery and utility areas mechanical rooms roof to the extent practical minimize the number of places in public areas where an intruder could remain unseen or that could be used to hide weapons provide adequate exterior lighting including emergency lighting where appropriate to help in detecting suspicious or unusual activity communications and notification install maintain and regularly test the building security and emergency communications system communicate information on the threat level to tenants employees and security force encourage tenants and employees to report any threat or suspicious situation take any threatening or malicious telephone call fax or bomb threat seriously monitoring surveillance inspection install closedcircuit television cctv systems entrance metal detectors if practical intruder detection systems and lights to cover key areas entrances exits parking lots hallways roof hvac utility system delivery mail and storage areas monitor contractors and delivery personnel while they are on the premises restri ct the type of personal items that employees contractors vendors and guests can bring to nonpublic areas of the building train security personnel to watch for suspicious persons and unattended vehicles in or near the building abandoned parcels suitcases backpacks and packages and unusual activities and to monitor all deliveries to the building regularly inspect and monito r restricted areas trash bins utility and storage areas parking lots the roof mechanical rooms and hvac systems infrastructure interdependencies provide adequate security and backup for critical utility services eg electricity natural gas water sewer communications cyber security implement and review if applicable computerbased operational systems eliminate any information that might be useful to adversaries from the building web site incident response maintain an uptodate em ergency response plan alert appropriate law enforcement and public health authorities to any evidence of tampering with the hvac system or water or gas supply or of other malicious criminal or terrorist activities more
