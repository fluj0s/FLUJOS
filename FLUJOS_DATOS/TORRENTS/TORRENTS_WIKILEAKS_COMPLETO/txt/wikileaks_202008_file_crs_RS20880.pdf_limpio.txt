bias in sports frequently asked questions background the history of professional amateur and outh sports in the united states is replete with legal battles congressional investigations and regulatory and legislative actions the perception that sports are public tr ust and must be pr otected has resulted in congresss implementing public policy with the underlying objective of guaranteeing the public fair access to sports congressional and other governmental action over the last three decades has had severa l public policy objectives it has promoted parity in competition attempted to reduce racial nd gender discriminati on facilitated spectator access through television and dimin ished athlete exploitation in general it could be said that congress prior to 1960 assumed the role of sports facilitator rather than the more modern role of sports regula tor and was often content to let amateur and professional sports regulatory bodies monitor and correct problems within their sportshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20880crs2 after 1960 dramatic sports i ndustry growth both in finances and in popularity and conflicts within the industry served to draw congressional attenti on often at the request of the sports industry itself the advent of televised broadcasting of sports events and the ever greater economic returns on sports activities combined to make sports and its problems such as player stri kes and team relocations mo re visible to the public and government officials the ability or willingness of major sports organizations to regulate and manage their own affairs properly wa s also coming into question the public perception of sports as recreation and diversi on was giving way to one of sports as big business the house select committee on professi onal sports established in 1976 was charged with conducting an investigation into all aspects of profe ssional sports for the express purpose of determining whether gislation or other forms of government intervention might be required to reduce the detrimental impact of money on the intrinsic value of athletic competition during this same period amateur at hletics also came under increased scrutiny president gerald r ford with executive order 11868 of june 19 1975 created the presidents commission on ol ympic sports and contributed to the development of the amateur sports act of 1978 now the ted stevens olympic and amateur sports act 36 usc 220501 et seq this act restructured the united states olympic committee to lessen the ongoing conflict among various us amateur sports organizations an investigation was consider ed necessary because the conflict within the amateur sports industry was detrimental to american olympic effo rts congress had passed title ix of the education amendmen ts of 1972 to prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender in educationa l programs or activities receivi ng federal funding although title ix was not aimed specifi cally at sports it became instrumental in promoting sports equality for female athletes at high school s and colleges around the nation it continues to be controversial and highly debated law the executive branch has also been active in making sports policy the federal communications commission the national labor relations board the department of labor the immigration and naturalization service the justice department the department of educati on and other federal agencies have all played key roles in amateur and professional sports issues over the last 30 years the intervention of congress the executive branch or the courts in the problems of amateur and professional sports has been prima rily to protect the public interest in small way the tremendous growth in the mone tary value of professi onal sports teams to owners and local communities rising player salaries and more effective player unions escalating television and cable revenues and increasing competition for limited sports programing demands for gender and racial quity and taxpayer investments in stadiums and usheld olympic games have raised the level of and potential for conflict in the sports world congress and other government institutions now find themselves playing the roles of regulators arbite rs facilitators sports reformer s and guardians of the public trust because of the ongoing popularity of sporting events the potential for great monetary rewards and conflict and tension among the many competing actors in the sports industry congressional interest oversight and interv ention in matters concerning this industry seem unlikely to diminish sportsrelated legislation introduced during the 107th congress will be identified and tracked in the following pageshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20880crs3 sports legislation in the
