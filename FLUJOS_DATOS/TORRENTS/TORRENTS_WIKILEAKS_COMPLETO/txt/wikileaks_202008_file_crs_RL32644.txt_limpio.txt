mark merlis contractor to the congressional research service domestic social policy division congressional research service the library of congress medicaid reimbursement policy summary under medicaid law states have considerable freedom to develop their own methods and standards for reimbursement of medicaid services congress has periodically intervened to modify the broad guidelines within which states operate and the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms has used its regulatory authority to restrict certain state practices actual payment methodologies however are still left largely to the discretion of the states medicaid reimbursement policies play central role in determining whether beneficiaries have access to services of adequate quality as well as the nature of the services they receive because some providers such as safetynet hospitals and clinics and nursing facilities are heavily dependent on medicaid funding payment levels can have broad effects on the delivery system and community access to care in addition because medicaid is major component of state and federal spending decisions about reimbursement policies can have significant budgetary effects for both hospitals and nursing homes medicaid payment rates in many states are below the actual costs facilities incur in providing care to medicaid patients payment rates for other kinds of providers such as physicians or dentists cannot be directly compared to costs however medicaid is often paying less for comparable services than medicare or private insurers medicaid payment shortfalls have variety of possible consequences providers may engage in costshifting raising charges to private payers to make up their losses in addition the need to subsidize medicaid patients may reduce their ability to fund care for people with coverage at all some providers may adopt costcutting measures that potentially affect quality others may refuse to accept medicaid patients or limit the number they will treat since medicaid law has requirement prohibiting providers from doing so this report provides snapshot captured primarily through state plan amendments approved through november 2002 of the methods states use to establish payment rates for most major types of providers serving medicaid clients it also explores some of the critical issues affecting medicaid payments rate setting where available medicaid rates are compared to other payers such as medicare and private insurance this report will not be updated to assist congress to review policy alternatives and understand the current status of medicaid programs the congressional research service crs is producing series of reports on various aspects of medicaid this report is one in that series this series will address medicaid programs and policies comprehensively by covering background subjects including eligibility policy benefits and delivery systems and demonstration projects as well as analytic reports such as

introduction under medicaid law states have considerable freedom to develop their own methods and standards for reimbursement of medicaid services congress has periodically intervened to modify the broad guidelines within which states operate and the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms has used its regulatory authority to restrict certain state practices actual payment methodologies however are still left largely to the discretion of the states medicaid reimbursement policies play central role in determining whether beneficiaries have access to services of adequate quality as well as the nature of the services they receive in addition because some providers such as safetynet hospitals and clinics and nursing facilities are heavily dependent on medicaid funding payment levels can have broader effects on the delivery system and community access to care finally because medicaid is major component of state and federal spending decisions about reimbursement policies can have significant budgetary effects organization of this report this report1 begins with summary of basic federal requirements applicable to payments for all services and an overview of major developments in federal medicaid reimbursement policy over the last 20 years this overview provides historical context for current policies and highlights some issues that have been perennial concerns for federal and state policymakers the next four sections of the report provide detailed discussion of medicaid reimbursement for four basic categories of services or providers acute care including hospital inpatient and outpatient services services of physicians and dentists and services of certain federally defined categories of health centers and clinics longterm care including care in nursing facilities intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded icfsmr and home and communitybased care 1 the crs project liaison for this report is jean hearne specialist in social legislation in the domestic social policy division she can be reached at extension 77362 crs2 managed care organizations mcos which accept financial responsibility for range of covered services in return for fixed monthly payment per medicaid enrollee and prescription drugs for each service type these sections summarize states payment methodologies review current or recent policy issues and to the extent data are available compare medicaid payments to providers costs or to payments by other third parties the final section of the report describes special federal payment rules for some specific classes of providers and explains how medicaid payments coordinate with medicare for individuals eligible for benefits under both programs use of state plan documents most of the statebystate comparisons of payment methodologies in this report are based on medicaid state plans and state plan amendments spas the state plan for medical assistance is the basic document each state initially submitted in order to obtain approval of its medicaid program major policy changes are reflected in spas that must also be approved by cms spas can be approved retroactively meaning that state can implement policy before cms has acted on its submission at the risk of denial of federal funding if the spa is ultimately disapproved cms maintains database of state plans and spa documents on its web site2 full state plans were captured in late 2000 with subsequent plan amendments added to the database as approved spas reviewed for this document include all those approved through november 7 2002 what this report provides then is snapshot of payment methodologies under each state plan as approved on that date these will not necessarily be the methodologies actually in use in november 2002 because approval of amendments can be retroactive some state plan documents relating to reimbursement methods are lengthy and complex and some states have filed numerous spas that repeatedly modify the same sections of the plan while every effort has been made to track the changes and identify the most current approved policy there are undoubtedly errors or omissions in very few cases it was impossible to ascertain states policy for particular service from the state plan and state regulations or other documents were consulted in these cases which are identified in notes to the tables the policy described may be the one in effect at the time the state documents were obtained rather than in november 2002 2 the database can be accessed at httpwwwcmshhsgovmedicaidstateplans crs3 overview basic federal rules three basic federal statutory requirements apply to payment for all types of services methods and procedures for making payments must be such as to assure that payments are consistent with efficiency economy and quality of care cms relies on this provision as general authority to regulate state reimbursement methodologies in particular this provision is the basis for the upper payment limit upl regulations which require that medicaid payments for class of institutional providers not exceed in the aggregate the amount that would have been paid for comparable services under medicare principles recent revisions in the upl rules have had major effect on state finances this issue is discussed further below payments must be sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are available under the plan at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general population in the geographic area this provision explicitly connects the level of medicaid payment rates with the willingness of providers to serve medicaid beneficiaries while payment levels are not the only factor affecting provider participation there has been tension between cost containment and access to care throughout the history of medicaid providers must accept medicaid reimbursement as payment in full except for any beneficiary costsharing amounts provided for by the state plan or any amount due from medically needy beneficiary with spenddown liability3 this means that provider cannot bill beneficiary when medicaids allowed payment is less than the providers charge for service in contrast medicare allows limited balance billing by physicians and some other providers private insurance rules vary plans with networks commonly restrict balance billing by network providers and permit it for outofnetwork services there is an additional set of basic rules for payment of institutional services including hospitals nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded icfsmr rates must be determined through public process states must publish proposed and final rates including justifications and underlying 3 medicaid applicant who is in state providing optional coverage of the medically needy population and whose income or resources exceed the limits established by the state may spend down to eligibility by using the excess funds to pay medical bills crs4 methodologies and providers beneficiaries and the public must be given an opportunity to comment beyond these general rules actual payment requirements or methodologies are prescribed by law for only few types of providers such as disproportionate share hospitals dshs those serving high proportion of lowincome patients federally qualified health centers fqhcs which are public health service grantees and similar entities and hospices there are also specific rules relating to payment for prescription drugs all of these rules are described in later sections of this report major policy developments 19802003 over time federal medicaid reimbursement policy has focused on different and sometimes conflicting policy goals such as cost containment state flexibility and access to care congress has set specific minimum or maximum levels of reimbursement for some types of services while providing only general guidelines for others it has sought to foreclose some payment schemes that have the effect of shifting financial burdens from states to the federal government it has acted to protect some specific classes of providers while enhancing states ability to bargain with others this section provides brief overview of major developments in medicaid reimbursement policy over the last two decades it is not meant to be legislative history but merely to highlight key issues and some of the shifts in congressional priorities and concerns the boren amendment until 1980 state medicaid programs were required to follow medicare reimbursement principles in paying institutional providers hospitals and nursing facilities under the medicare rules in effect at that time this meant that states were required to use retrospective reasonable cost system states continued to have to assure that rates provided access to care payment amounts were determined after services were rendered and were based on the actual costs incurred by the provider in furnishing those services in what is known as the boren amendment the omnibus reconciliation act of 1980 pl 96499 repealed this requirement for nursing facility services freeing states to establish new methodologies of their own the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1981 obra 81 pl 9735 applied the amendment to inpatient hospital services the new rules provided simply that payment rates for hospitals and nursing facilities had to be reasonable and adequate to meet the costs of efficiently and economically operated facilities for hospitals the law also required payment adjustments for disproportionate share hospitals dshs nearly all states responded to the new flexibility by shifting from retrospective to prospective payment systems for both hospital and nursing facility services under prospective payment systems rates may be set in advance and may not be related to the actual costs providers incur in furnishing services or the state may set ceilings and pay the lesser of actual costs or the ceiling amount states interest in these systems stemmed from concerns that crs5 providers paid on full cost basis had incentive to perform efficiently and might furnish unnecessary services while the boren amendment gave states the flexibility to develop new payment systems it also established benchmark against which those systems were to be measured the state was required to find and to provide assurances satisfactory to the secretary that its medicaid rates were reasonable and adequate in 1990 the supreme court affirmed that facilities had right to seek judicial review of the reasonableness and adequacy of medicaid rates wilder v virginia hospital association 496 us 498 1990 the wilder decision merely settled the question of whether the boren amendment conferred rights on providers that could be enforced in court even before this decision hospitals in some states had obtained court judgments that medicaid payments were inadequate following wilder numerous states faced suits by hospitals and nursing homes congress ultimately responded by repealing the reasonable and adequate test in the balanced budget act of 1997 bba pl 10534 some hospitals have continued to file suits relying on the requirement still in the statute that payments for all types of providers be sufficient to assure access to care obra 81 waivers obra 81 authorized the secretary to waive specified requirements of medicaid law so that states could operate innovative service programs two types of waivers were originally permitted section 1915b freedomofchoice waivers under which states could require beneficiaries to obtain services through primary care case manager or managed care plan or from limited set of contracting providers and section 1915c home and communitybased services waivers under which states could provide special services generally nonmedical personal care and supportive services to limited populations of beneficiaries who would otherwise need institutional care4 both types of waivers require periodic cms approval and are subject to costeffectiveness tests congress has since authorized several other waiver options number of states have used section 1915b freedomofchoice waivers to operate selective contracting systems under which beneficiaries needing specified service are restricted to limited set of providers whose payment rates are established by bidding or negotiation table 1 lists the selective contracting programs in effect as of september 2003 4 the waivers are commonly referred to by the sections of the social security act that set rules for them crs6 table 1 selective contracting waivers 2003 state service arkansas nonemergency transportation california inpatient hospital florida

disabilities andor persons with mental retardation or developmental disabilities payment for waiver services is discussed later in this report prescription drug rebates medicaid programs are major purchasers of prescription drugs chiefly because of their role in providing drug coverage to lowincome aged and disabled people other largevolume purchasers such as private insurers pharmaceutical benefit managers pbms and hospital buying groups often get substantial discounts or rebates from drug manufacturers to assure that medicaid programs received similar benefits the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 obra 90 pl 101508 required manufacturers to give rebates to states for drugs paid for by medicaid the rebate formulas are designed to assure that states pay the lowest price offered by the manufacturer to any other highvolume purchaser in return the state must generally cover all the drugs marketed by the manufacturer there is ongoing debate over how the rebates are calculated and whether medicaid programs really are getting the best price rebates reduced medicaid drug spending by 20 in 20015 still spending for drugs is one of the fastest growing components of medicaid budgets restricting drug spending has been major focus of recent state cost containment efforts see the last part of this section 5 see table 37 crs7 disproportionate share hospital dsh payments provider donations and provider taxes in response to the 1981 requirement that hospital payment systems take account of the situation of dshs some states developed plans to make supplemental payments to these hospitals these plans potentially conflicted with the secretarys regulation capping aggregate medicaid reimbursement at medicare levels the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1985 cobra pl 99272 prohibited the secretary from limiting states payment adjustments to dshs until 1987 states were free to establish their own criteria for classifying facilities as dshs and to develop their own reimbursement methods for these hospitals the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1987 obra 87 pl 100203 defined certain facilities that states had to designate as dshs and set minimum payment requirements for them these requirements which have since been amended several times are described in the discussion of inpatient hospital reimbursement below the cobra provision that prohibited the secretary from limiting dsh payments meant that these were the only medicaid payments not subject to any form of upper limit beginning in the late 1980s states began to exploit this loophole by developing various financing schemes intended to draw extra federal matching funds state might make an extra payment to hospital claim federal matching and then recapture part or all of the payment by taxing the hospital alternatively the hospital might agree to donate part of the extra payment to the state or in the case of hospital operated by state or local government the money could be recovered through an intergovernmental transfer transfer of funds from another state agency to the medicaid program or from local government to the state table 2 illustrates how typical provider tax or donation program might work in state whose federal matching percentage was 60 the state pays the hospital 100 the state reports the payment to cms and receives 60 in federal matching funds the hospital gives back 80 either as donation or because the state imposes providerspecific tax on its payments the hospital is still ahead by 20 and the state has gained 40 to spend on other medicaid services or simply absorb into its general fund state could potentially operate its entire medicaid program with actual state expenditures table 2 effect of typical provider donation or tax

tax paid to state 80 80 net gainloss sum of transactions one to three 40 20 60 source congressional research service crs8 while these schemes could be used with any kind of provider payment the use of the dsh loophole was attractive because the state could pay and then recover any amount at all dsh payments rose from an estimated 569 million in 1989 to projected 8 billion or 12 of total medicaid spending by 1992 the medicaid voluntary contribution and providerspecific tax amendments of 1991 pl 102234 prohibited the use of most provider donations and phased out the use of provider taxes that were not broadbased that is taxes that were levied against providers medicaid receipts and not receipts from other sources the act did not restrict the use of intergovernmental transfers on the grounds that the federal government had authority to regulate these arrangements but instead sought to limit potential federal exposure by capping the total amount of dsh payments beginning in 1992 national aggregate dsh payment adjustments during each fiscal year were limited to 12 of total medicaid spending for that year high dsh states those whose payments were already above the 12 limit were allowed to increase their payments by more than the projected growth in their overall medicaid spending other states were allowed larger increases with each state receiving an allocation calculated to assure that aggregate national payments did not exceed the national cap the bba replaced this system of calculating dsh limits with fixed annual limits for each state these limits and subsequent amendments are described in the discussion of inpatient hospital reimbursement below the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 obra 93 pl 10366 further limited dsh payments by capping payments to any single facility the sum of regular and dsh payments to hospital could not exceed the sum of the hospitals costs for treating medicaid beneficiaries and uninsured patients growth in managed care states have been contracting with health maintenance organizations hmos or similar prepaid capitated plans to enroll medicaid beneficiaries since the late 1960s6 obra 81 made it easier for states to enter into these contracts and also authorized different form of managed care primary care case management pccm under these programs beneficiaries services were still paid on feeforservice basis but were coordinated by primary care physician using freedomofchoice waiver states could require beneficiaries to participate in pccm or to choose between pccm and prepaid plan enrollment in managed care arrangements grew steadily through the 1980s and early 1990s by 1996 40 of beneficiaries received at least some services through some form of managed care7 the bba gave states greater flexibility to contract with 6 capitated plans receive fixed per capita payment usually monthly in exchange for which they accept financial risk for providing defined scope of services to each enrolled beneficiary 7 cms managed care trends 19911996 at httpwwwcmshhsgovmedicaid continued crs9 health maintenance organizations hmos or similar managed care organizations mcos and to require beneficiaries to enroll in

preventive acute and longterm care services to mcolike organizations that furnish services to frail elderly people upper payment limits upls since the 1970s federal regulations have required that total medicaid payments for service type such as hospital or nursing facility services could not exceed the amount that would have been spent for the same services under medicare reimbursement principles the upls originally applied in the aggregate state could for example pay one hospital more than medicare would have paid and another hospital less so long as total payments did not exceed the limit 7 continued managedcaretrends1asp as of sept 2003 crs10 after the use of provider taxes and donations was limited in 1991 states could still recover medicaid payments made to governmental providers through intergovernmental transfers states ability to use these mechanisms was limited by the cap on total dsh payments and on dsh payments to any one facility however states found that they could draw extra federal matching funds by exploiting the fact that upl limits were aggregate rather than facilityspecific table 4 illustrates how what came to be known as enhanced payment programs worked private hospitals have actual costs of 80 million while countyowned hospitals have costs of 20 million the state pays private hospitals 80 of their costs or 64 million meaning that it can pay the county hospitals 36 million and still be within the aggregate upl of 100 million the shortfall in payments to the private hospitals might be made up through dsh payments which do not count toward the upl the state claims 60 million in federal reimbursement and the county hospitals return the excess payment to the state while the state has nominally spent 40 million on hospital services it has actually spent only 24 million while the county hospitals have been paid their full costs the federal government has spent 60 million to the states 24 million in effect the federal share of hospital spending is 71 instead of 60 table 4 typical enhanced payment program state with 60 federal matching rate millions of dollars cost under nominal medicare medicaid federal state intergovernmental net

programs operating under state plan or state plan amendment approved or in effect before october 1 1992 in january 2001 the clinton administration published final rule that limited payments to 100 of the upls for state and private facilities and 150 for nonstate governmental facilities to lessen the fiscal shock to states that had become dependent on the extra federal matching states making payments above the 150 limit were allowed transition period to phase down to the limit the length of the phasedown depended on when the state had adopted its plan table 5 reflects modifications in the

further measures for fy2004 table 7 shows the types of cost containment measures implemented in fy2002 and fy2003 and planned for fy2004 nearly every state has reduced or frozen payment rates for some types of providers most have also acted to control prescription drug spending as will be discussed in the section on drug payment below these measures have not always involved changes in payment

commission on medicaid and the uninsured 2003 table 8 shows the major service types for which states plan rate changes for fy2004 states are more likely to freeze or decrease payments to hospitals and physicians and more likely to increase payments for nursing homes and mcos in the case of nursing home rates the survey authors note that some states have statutory requirements for annual inflation increases another possible factor is that nursing homes and mcos with medicaid contracts may rely much more heavily on medicaid than other providers and may be unable to costshift to other purchasers

fiscal pressure state medicaid spending growth and cost containment in fiscal years 2003 and 2004 kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured washington 2003 it should be emphasized that the information in this report generally reflects payment methods and payment levels in effect before most states faced budget shortfalls many states that improved their provider payments during periods of economic growth may now have cut back general payment methodologies how states decide the relative amounts paid to different providers for different services may or may not have been affected however states that have not changed methodologies may achieve savings by imposing uniform cuts or simply by granting rate increases below the rate of inflation in the cost of goods and services providers must buy therefore the discussions in this report of the adequacy of medicaid payment to assure access or quality may not reflect current conditions acute care hospital services medicaid payments for hospital services take three forms payments for services to individual inpatients and outpatients lumpsum disproportionate share hospital dsh payment adjustments and in states with upl plans additional lump sum distributions in fy2001 dsh payments made up close to onethird of all direct payments to general or community hospitals including inpatient and outpatient payments and half of payments to inpatient psychiatric facilities see table 13 comparable figures for upl plans are not available however the hhs office of the inspector general estimated that total upl payments to hospitals for inpatient and outpatient services were about 45 billion in fy2000 this would have been 14 of total inpatient nondsh and outpatient spending in that year this section describes states basic methodologies for establishing payments for individual inpatients and outpatients it then summarizes current rules relating to dsh and upl payments and provides data on the size and distribution of these crs16 payments finally it reviews available evidence on the extent to which medicaid payments meet hospitals costs for medicaid beneficiaries as well as whether dsh or upl supplements help hospitals that treat uninsured patients inpatient payment methods all states now use some form of prospective system as their basic method for setting inpatient hospital payments that is payment amounts per day or per case are fixed at the start of year and are generally not subject to retrospective adjustment on the basis of actual costs incurred states may establish different rate for each participating hospital may use one rate for all hospitals in defined peer group or may have one statewide rate twothirds of the states have adopted some form of case mix adjustment under which reimbursement varies according to the intensity of services required or the expected resources used by each individual patient these adjustments discussed further below can be applied regardless of the states method for setting basic rates some states systems allow additional reimbursement for outliers patients whose costs or length of inpatient stay are significantly higher than the average for comparable patients medicaid law requires states with prospective systems effectively all states now to make outlier adjustments for highcost or longstaying infants under one year old in any hospital and for children under six in dsh hospital11 table 9 based on an analysis of state medicaid plans shows the method in use and approved by cms as of november 2002 the table classes states according to whether hospitals receive hospitalspecific rates receive rates set for whole group of hospitals or for all hospitals in the state or are paid under some other method for states using some form of case mix adjustment the table indicates the method finally where applicable it identifies the facility characteristics states use in establishing peer groups of hospitals several general points about the table and the accompanying discussion should be noted the systems described in the table and in the following discussion are those used for most acute general hospitals in the state states may use different modes of payment for particular classes of facilities for example states may use prospective payment for acute general hospitals and reasonable cost system for psychiatric rehabilitation or other specialized hospitals some general hospitals for example those that are stateowned or small hospitals in rural areas may receive special treatment in addition states that negotiate rates with preferred providers under selective contracting system may have separate payment 11 the provision in section 1902s of the social security act also prohibits imposition for such cases of any day limit or for infants any dollar limit in the state plan crs17 methodology for emergency or other services obtained outside that system many states that use peergroup or statewide payment systems provide hospitalspecific addons for certain categories of costs such as capital costs interest depreciation and other costs related to owning physical facility and graduate medical education costs costs directly or indirectly related to training residents in two states arizona and tennessee nearly all beneficiaries are enrolled in mcos and some other states have very high rates of mco enrollment the methods shown are for cases in which the state pays hospital directly for example because beneficiary is in an aid category exempt from mco enrollment not the methods used by mcos in paying their

arizona drg diagnosisrelated groups drgs represent system of classifying any inpatient stay into groups for purposes of payment drg systems relate the type of patients hospital treats to the costs incurred by the hospital according to this classification system patients who have similar diagnoses and undergo similar procedures are placed together in the same diagnosisrelated group drg definitions may also take into account other patient characteristics such as common sex age and discharge status http1677127236hdtermsdefhtml crs22 hospitalspecific rates in 24 states fixed per diem or per case payment rates are established for each hospital using historic data on that hospitals medicaid costs and some form of fixed update factor for inflation hospital whose costs rise faster than the update will therefore lose money some states use an objective inflation index such as cmsreleased estimates of price changes for market basket of goods and services commonly purchased by hospitals often however annual updates are set by legislation and regulation and may be higher or lower than actual inflation oregon uses update factors that vary inversely with each hospitals operating margin or profit the effect is to grant lower increases to hospitals earning profit on their medicaid patients of the states using hospitalspecific rates five use peer group ceilings the hospitals rate is based on the lesser of its own costs or some percentile of costs for similar hospitals hospital characteristics used to establish peer groups include size location presence of teaching program specialized services for example pediatric hospitals and volume of medicaid services six states use statewide ceiling for all general hospitals based on percentile of all hospitals costs or in the case of arkansas legislatively fixed per diem limit 675 for 2002 finally three states use blend of hospitalspecific and peer group or statewide experience to set payment ceilings for example the operating cost component of iowa rates is based on 50 of the hospitals cost and 50 of the statewide average one effect of systems using ceilings is that while hospital with costs above the ceiling will lose money hospital with costs below the ceiling will receive rate derived from its baseyear costs it can earn profit only if it can reduce its costs still further it is not rewarded for being more efficient than its competitors wyoming provides incentive payments to hospitals with costs below the statewide ceiling two states georgia and idaho limit the losses that can be incurred by hospitals peer group or statewide rates in 21 states fixed rate is set for an entire class of hospitals or for all hospitals in the state in most of these states part or all of the fixed rate is adjusted as in medicares inpatient prospective payment system or pps for higher or lower labor costs in the hospitals market area in fixed rate systems unlike ceiling systems hospital with costs below the rate can realize profit three states massachusetts michigan and vermont provide additional bonuses to lowercost hospitals use of case mix nearly twothirds of the states have adopted some form of case mix adjustment under which reimbursement varies according to some measure of the intensity of services required or the resources used by each individual patient most of these use the diagnosisrelated groups drgs developed for medicare hospital reimbursement patients are assigned to one of 540 drgs on the basis of admitting diagnosis procedures performed presence of complications or other characteristics12 each drg has an assigned weight for example 08889 for an uncomplicated appendectomy or 97823 for liver transplantwhich is then multiplied by the fixed rate established for the hospital so if hospitals standard 12 not all of the 540 codes are actually in use crs23 rate were 5000 it would be paid 4445 for the appendectomy and 48912 for the liver transplant because medicaid patients may be different from medicare patients the weighting factors established for drgs under medicare may not be appropriate for medicaid reimbursement most states using drgs have developed their own weights on the basis of medicaidspecific data some states use alternative drg classification systems such as the drgs developed for the civilian health and medical program of the uniformed services champus or new yorks all patient drgs these groupings add additional categories for types of patients such as maternity cases or newborns rarely treated under medicare minnesota has collapsed the drgs into smaller number of diagnostic categories some states that have not adopted drg classifications nevertheless modify reimbursement according to the type of patient served some of these use admission types for example medicalsurgical maternity psychiatric while others assign cases to limited number of levelofcare groupings nevada additionally adjusts its per case rates using lengthofstay ranges other methods four states have used 1915b freedomofchoice waivers to develop hospital contracting systems while two states have systems under which medicaid and other payers use common reimbursement methods selective contracting under section 1915b state may receive waiver of medicaid requirements including the requirement that beneficiaries be allowed free choice of medical providers in order to allow the development of innovative delivery or reimbursement systems one of the available options for states is to limit program participation except for emergency services to providers who meet reimbursement quality and utilization standards approved by the state certain payment rules cannot be waived under this option including requirements for additional payment to disproportionate share hospitals see below and requirements for prompt payment to providers alabama california texas and washington have used this authority to restrict the inpatient hospitals from which beneficiaries may obtain services illinois operated similar system until 1991 alabamas program is statewide in the other states the waiver applies only in selected counties or areas however large share of beneficiaries live in the covered area except in emergencies or other exceptional cases these beneficiaries may use only hospitals selected for participation through system of competitive negotiation in california and texas reimbursement rates for the participating hospitals are established in the course of the negotiation in washington what is negotiated is the hospitals conversion factor fixed dollar amount that is multiplied by the weighting factor for drg to produce final payment amount for each case under alabamas partnership hospital program groups of hospitals in geographic area form prepaid inpatient health plan that is reimbursed on capitated fixed per beneficiary per month basis the plan in turn makes payments to its participating hospitals all medicaid beneficiaries are automatically enrolled except crs24 those who are also medicare beneficiaries and certain pregnant women participating in separate maternity care program13 multipayer systems beginning in the 1970s several states established allpayer hospital ratesetting systems in these systems all insurers or other payers in the state including medicare and medicaid agreed to pay uniform rates or use standard reimbursement methodology for inpatient services only one state maryland still has an allpayer system in which medicare participates14 state ratesetting commission sets each hospitals allowable prices for specific service units such as day of routine care or particular laboratory test the prices are set at levels expected to result in target average charge per case for each facility key feature of the system is that every payer contributes to hospitals costs for treating uninsured patients in rhode island the state and blue cross jointly negotiate with the state hospital association an annual statewide ceiling the maxicap on reimbursable expenses for the 12 voluntary hospitals in the state within this ceiling an operating budget is developed for each hospital and rates paid by medicaid and blue cross are set to meet these budgets administrative daysswing beds under medicare small rural hospitals may enter into swing bed agreements with cms under which beds may be used either for inpatient hospital care or for care equivalent in intensity to that furnished by nursing facility costs are allocated and reimbursement adjusted to reflect the level of care furnished to each patient medicaid program may also allow for swing beds but only in hospitals that have entered into medicare swing bed arrangement the state may develop specific payment methodology for swing bed days of care at the nursing facility level or may pay at rate based on average payments for comparable services in freestanding nursing facilities the swing bed program assists hospitals that are underused and also helps to meet local shortages of nursing facility beds sometimes hospital which is not swing bed facility will provide care to patient at the nursing facility level of intensity because place cannot be found for the patient in an appropriate facility and the patient cannot be discharged the days of inpatient care received by patients in this situation are known as administrative days prior to 1997 medicaid payment for an administrative day was limited to the statewide average medicaid payment rate for day of care in skilled nursing facility most states have continued this practice despite the repeal of the provision in the bba 13 note that because the plans provide inpatient services only they are not subject to the section 1903m2 requirements for medicaid managed care organizations 14 to retain the medicare waiver system must hold cumulative growth in cost per medicare admission from 1981 to the present at or below national average growth crs25 outpatient payment methods because hospitals furnish wide variety of services on an outpatient basis from emergency room visits to surgery to diagnostic tests many states use several different payment methodologies for example state might pay flat pervisit fee for clinic visit use fee schedule for surgery and pay on cost basis for some specialized services because states vary in their service definitions there is ready way of comparing methods for particular services across states table 10 attempts to identify the principal payment approach in each state with notes on variants in some states without depicting the full complexity of state systems about half of the states still base outpatient reimbursement largely on hospitalspecific costs of these 15 pay actual costs or prospective rates based on historic costs with limit on annual increases one state florida uses peer group ceiling comparable to those common in inpatient hospital and nursing facility payment another 11 states pay fixed percentage of actual costs that is their systems explicitly pay each facility less than its costs one goal of such systems may be to discourage use of hospitals for services that could be rendered in noninstitutional setting sixteen states use fee schedules varying payment by the surgical or other procedures performed for at least some services several states pay the same rates regardless of whether the service is performed in hospital or in physicians office again the aim is to avoid incentives for use of the more costly setting only four states have adopted systems comparable to medicares new prospective system for outpatient hospital services under this system services are classified into one of 383 ambulatory patient classifications apcs groups of services expected to require comparable resources as in the inpatient drg system payment for each apc is at fixed rate times weight that reflects resource use for the apc relative to that of other apcs one state has adopted medicares system directly others use their own classification system or prices of the remaining states maryland uses the same allpayer system and rhode island the same multipayer negotiation as for inpatient care hawaii also negotiates some rates utah pays percentage of charges rather than costs while arkansas uses blue cross customary charge screens finally delaware pays

federal medicaid law requires that states make additional payments to hospitals that serve disproportionate share of medicaid and other lowincome patients the statute defines which hospitals must receive dsh payments and which hospitals may never receive dsh payments states can decide on their own whether to make payments to hospitals that are in neither category similarly the law sets minimum payment amounts that must be made for certain hospitals and maximum payment amounts for individual hospitals and for all hospitals in the state again states are free to set their payments at any level between the minimum required and the maximum permitted individual state plan specifications for dsh payments are often extremely complex defining numerous classes of facilities and varying payment amounts some states amend this section of their plan every year accordingly this section will not offer comparison of the way different states have designed their dsh programs but will merely summarize the current requirements hospitals that must receive dsh payments hospital must be deemed dsh hospital if either of the following is true its medicaid utilization rate is more than one standard deviation above the average medicaid utilization rate for all medicaidparticipating hospitals in the state16 the medicaid utilization rate is defined as the number of days of care furnished to medicaid beneficiaries during given period divided by the total number of days of care provided during the period its lowincome utilization rate is at least 25 the lowincome utilization rate is the sum of two fractions medicaid payments plus state and local subsidies divided by total patient care revenues and inpatient charges attributable to charity care other than charity care subsidized by state or local government divided by total inpatient charges 15 for additional information on dsh payments see crs report 97483 medicaid disproportionate share payments by jean hearne 16 the standard deviation used in the first criterion is statistical measure of the dispersion of hospitals utilization rates around the average the use of this measure identifies hospitals whose medicaid utilization is unusually high crs29 in computing either of these measures states are now required to include medicaid patients whose stays were paid for by an mco rather than directly by the state hospitals that may not receive dsh payments state may not make dsh payments to hospital whose medicaid utilization rate is less than 1 in addition hospital may not be deemed dsh hospital unless it has on staff at least two obstetricians who are prepared to accept medicaid patients this requirement does not apply to childrens hospitals or to those that do not furnish nonemergency obstetrical care rural hospitals may use other attending physicians for obstetrical care minimum dsh payment in computing the amount of the supplementary payment the state must use one of three methods it may use the formula for comparable payments under medicare with special adjustments for childrens hospitals b provide for fixed payment increase or percentage increase for dshs plus an additional increase for hospitals whose medicaid utilization is more than one standard deviation above the statewide mean or c develop its own methodology which may vary payments to different types of hospitals so long as all hospitals of each type are treated equally and payments are reasonably related to hospitals medicaid or lowincome volume the payments are required even if they result in medicaid payments to hospital in excess of the hospitals usual charges to the public for similar services maximum payment to an individual hospital the dsh payment cannot exceed the sum of the hospitals costs for medicaid patients that are not already met through nondsh medicaid hospital payments and b the hospitals costs for patients without health insurance or other thirdparty coverage17 thirdparty payment does not include state and local subsidies for indigent care california has permanent waiver to pay certain high disproportionate share public hospitals up to 175 of this limit bipa granted similar exemption to all states but only for the two state fiscal years beginning on or after september 30 2002 maximum dsh payments to mental hospitals the bba limited total dsh payments to mental hospitals during year to the lesser of the dollar amount of such payments in fy1995 or percentage of the states dsh allotment see below for the year this percentage was initially based on the percentage of the states fy1995 payments that went to mental hospitals then was phased down to 50 for fy2001 40 for fy2002 and 33 for fy2003 and later years dsh allotments the medicaid voluntary contribution and providerspecific tax amendments of 1991 pl 102234 limited national aggregate spending for dsh payments to 12 of total medicaid program spending roughly the level projected for fy1992 high dsh states those with dsh payments already exceeding 12 of their medicaid spending could not increase the percentage of 17 note that nondsh medicaid payments include enhanced payments under upl arrangements centers for medicare and medicaid services state medicaid director letter 02013 aug 16 2003 crs30 spending devoted to dsh payments that is those payments could not increase faster than the rate of growth in the states overall medicaid spending other states were allowed to raise their dsh payments subject to an allocation system that would keep aggregate national payments within the cap the bba of 1997 replaced this formulaic allocation with table of specified allotments for each of the years fy1998 through fy2002 these allotments effectively froze states with very low dsh payments at their 1995 payment levels and required higherspending states to gradually reduce their payments after 2002 each states annual allotment would increase at the rate of the medical care component of the cpiu bipa froze the allotments for fy2001 and fy2002 at the fy2000 levels meaning highdsh states would not have to reduce their spending so rapidly for fy2003 however the dsh allotment returned to the level prescribed by the bba that is the original published fy2002 allotment plus inflation table 11 shows the allotments for fy1998 through fy2003 the reversion to the bba rules for fy2003 meant that total allotments dropped about 11 in single year and some states allotments dropped by as much as 25 table 11 federal dsh allotments for 19982003 millions of dollars 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003

years some states have filed reports that do not fully categorize all hospitals by type or ownership these omissions have been corrected when there were only few instances in state and the information was readily available from other sources states vary widely in the degree to which they have targeted payments at public hospitals and mental hospitals in some states nearly all the payments went to private general hospitals in others nearly all payments went to public mental hospitals these are states for which only older reports are available so that the figures do not reflect the bbarequired

with lowincome and uninsured patients and which are probably recovering the funds through transfers or using them to pay for nonmedicaid residents of psychiatric facilities states vary for example in the share of general hospitals operated by government units and those with few public general hospitals such as maryland are likely to make more payments to private providers than states where public hospitals are more common adequacy of hospital reimbursement since the shift away from costbased reimbursement that began in the 1980s aggregate medicaid payments to hospitals including regular inpatient and outpatient payments and dsh payments have consistently been less than the total costs hospitals incur in treating medicaid beneficiaries however the gap narrowed dramatically during the 1990s the only comprehensive source of data on medicaid hospital costs and payments is an annual survey of community hospitals conducted by the american hospital association aha the survey includes questions about gross medicaid charges and actual medicaid payments received by each hospital hospitals charges are generally in excess of their actual costs aha estimates actual costs for medicaid patients at each hospital by using that hospitals overall costtocharge ratio the estimate may be inaccurate if the ratio is actually different for medicaid and nonmedicaid patients it should also be noted that 35 of hospitals especially public and forprofit hospitals did not participate in the most recent survey values for these hospitals have been imputed table 15 shows payments by medicaid and other major payers as percentage of costs in 1991 through 2001 nationally aggregate medicaid payments were 816 of estimated costs for medicaid beneficiaries in 1991 the ratio rose steadily through the decade by 2001 aggregate medicaid payments including regular and dsh payments equaled 98 of costs20 while this is significant improvement hospitals overall are still losing money on medicaid patients aha estimates that 73 of hospitals had negative inpatient margins in 200021 one likely factor in medicaid losses is that states have been granting annual increases lower than the rate of inflation study for oregons hospital association by lewin associates contends that over 10year period medicaid payment rates increased 13 while inflation was 33 in addition the study notes that rates for each hospital continued to be based on data from 1987 this means that rates do not account for changes in case mix or other factors that might cause one hospitals costs to rise faster than anothers examination of state plan documents indicates that number of other states allow long intervals to pass without rebasing their hospital cost data 20 the medicaid payment figures are net revenues that is they do not include any amounts that might have been returned to the state through intergovernmental transfers or other mechanisms 21 aha cracks in the foundation averting crisis in americas

note paymenttocost ratios indicate the relative degree to which payments from each payer cover the costs of treating its patients operating subsidies from state and local governments are considered payments for uncompensated care up to the level of each hospitals uncompensated care costs data are for community hospitals and reflect all types of patient care services imputed values are used for missing data about 35 of observationswhich corrects for underrepresentation of proprietary and public hospitals relative to voluntary institutions most medicare and medicaid managed care patients are included in the private payers category the costs allocated to medicare and medicaid include cmss allowed and nonallowed costs this note by medpac means that its method for estimating hospitals costs for medicare and medicaid patients does not take account of federal rules for determining whether specific costs are reimbursable hospital losses are not due solely to reimbursement methods coverage limitations also play role for example under marylands allpayer system medicaid pays the same daily rates as medicare and private insurers however the state has imposed limit on the number of covered inpatient days the result is loss for uncovered days that is passed on to all payers in the form of higher rates22 hospitals and private insurers have always contended that medicaid losses must be made up through higher charges to other payers phenomenon known as costshifting private insurers pay more than the costs of treatment for their enrollees while both medicaid and medicare pay less than cost what is striking is how much costshifting has diminished as table 15 shows charges to private payers were nearly 30 above costs in 1991 largely to compensate for medicare and medicaid losses by 2001 private payers paid 13 above costs some of the change 22 maryland health cuts to mean higher insurance rates baltimore sun aug 3 2003 p 1d crs45 is probably attributable to pressure for lower prices from major managed care plans and other insurers but hospitals might have been more willing to accept lower prices from private payers because their losses from the public programs had dropped so much one final point to be made about the figures in table 15 is that the proportion of uncompensated care costs made up through state or local subsidies has gone from 196 in 1991 to 122 in 2001 drop of more than onethird yet losses from uncompensated care have not risen proportionately as percent of total hospital costs the losses were 48 in 1991 and 53 in 2000 one possible explanation is that nonmedicaid subsidies were partially replaced by dsh payments to safety net hospitals the possible role of medicaid in offsetting some hospitals losses from bad debts or charity care appears to vary by state table 16 is based on the 2000 annual member survey of the national association of public hospitals and health systems naph this organization chiefly represents large state and local hospitals few members are operated by private nonprofit corporations but function as safety net providers treating substantial numbers of medicaid and uninsured patients the table thus illustrates the experience of few major safety net providers in each state listed and may not be representative of all hospitals or even comparable safety net hospitals in each state23 the table first compares estimated costs for medicaid patients and medicaid revenues including dsh payments of the 20 states listed 10 were paying the reporting hospitals less than their medicaid costs in the other 10 states medicaid revenues exceeded costs sometimes substantially the table then compares costs and revenues for patients classed as self payother this group is made up of all patients without private insurance medicaid or medicare including the uninsured and people with coverage through champus workers compensation and other sources offsetting revenues for this group include various forms of nonmedicaid public funding such as local subsidies or state indigent care pools and other funding sources for the selfpayother population in nearly all the states the reporting hospitals incurred sizeable losses for this population exceptions may be artifacts of the method of estimating costs from gross charges 23 the survey like the aha survey ascertains medicaid and selfpayother gross charges but not costs as in the aha data the estimates in the table assume that the medicaid and selfpayother costcharge ratios are the same as the overall costcharge ratio reported by the hospital

hospitals received about onethird of louisianas dsh funding in 1998 the excess nearly exactly offsets the hospitals bad debt and charity care costs hospitals in several other states such as colorado indiana and new mexico received considerably more in medicaid payments than their medicaid costs in these states however the medicaid payments and other public subsidies were insufficient to offset costs for uncompensated care the two states with the most responding hospitals california and new york paid these hospitals amounts roughly equal to their estimated medicaid costs the 15 california

spending but these payments were just sufficient to bring medicaid payments close to medicaid costs with excess available to subsidize other patients physician and dental care medicaid payment levels for physician and dental care and their effects on provider participation and beneficiary access have been issues since the earliest years of the program states have commonly paid independent practitioners using fixed fee schedules often at rates well below those paid by medicare or private insurers many physicians refused to accept medicaid patients or limited their medicaid caseloads leaving beneficiaries to rely on more costly hospital outpatient departments and emergency rooms as primary source of care medicaid payments to physicians and other providers are subject to the general requirement that payments be sufficient to attract enough providers to ensure that covered services will be as available to medicaid beneficiaries as they are to the general population obra 89 codified this requirement previously established only by regulation and established specific reporting requirements with respect to payment rates for obstetric and pediatric services to allow the secretary to determine the adequacy of state payments for these services these special reporting requirements were repealed by the bba but the requirement that payments be sufficient to assure access remains in the statute it has been the basis for numerous lawsuits by groups of physicians dentists and other providers24 this section provides data on payment levels for physician and dental services and summarizes some recent literature on how these payment levels affect access to care 24 for reviews of recent litigation see national health law program docket of medicaid cases to improve provider participation feb 23 2003 at httpwwwnlsorg conf2003providerdockethtm and summaries by the american dental association at httpwwwadaorgprofgovtdentistryworksmedlitigatehtml as of sept 2003 crs48 physician payment every state except hawaii now pays physicians the lesser of actual charges or fixed fee schedule amount for each visit or procedure whether performed in offices hospitals or other settings25 states set these fee schedules in various ways some were originally based on physicians actual charges for services while others are set arbitrarily by the state or negotiated with provider groups others use systems comparable to medicares under which each procedure is assigned weight on resourcebased relative value scale rbrvs the weightings reflect relative physician work practice expenses and malpractice costs associated with different procedures brief physician office visit might have value of three an appendectomy value of 150 the state then multiplies the different values by single standard dollar amount if unit is valued at 5 the state will pay 15 for the brief office visit and 450 for the appendectomy some states have adopted medicares scales while others use different weighting systems the effect is the same as under fee schedule except that the medicaid agency has an external reference for its pricing decisions however the schedule is established basic rates andor inflation increases are fixed by the state and may bear relation to what physicians ordinarily charge or what they are paid by medicare or private insurers table 17 compares each states

that have systems similar to medicares rbrvs but use different dollar multiplier to establish medicaid rates the ratio of medicaid to medicare rates will be roughly constant in other states that have assigned their own values to different procedures rates may be far below medicares for some services and higher for others the payment gap tends to be larger for preventive office visits and for cardiac catheterization than for the other listed services the gap between medicaid physician payment rates and rates paid by private insurers is likely to be even greater studies done for the medicare payment advisory commission medpac estimate that medicare physician rates were about 83 of average private rates in 200128 the relationship between medicaid feeforservice payment rates and physicians willingness to accept medicaid patients was extensively studied in the 1970s and 1980s but has received less attention recently perhaps because policy focus has shifted to access by enrollees in managed care arrangements while these earlier studies did show positive relationship between payment levels and participation changes in the health care marketplace and other factors might mean that the results would be different now 27 aaps own published comparison uses the national rate before application of the gpcis as local medicare rates for the five listed procedures varied by as much as 44 in 2001 use of local rates seemed preferable 28 the difference is much smaller than in 1994 when medicare paid 66 of average private rates medpac attributes the change to shifts from

studying health system change found that the proportion of physicians accepting medicaid patients dropped from 871 in 1997 to 854 in 2001 the share accepting new medicaid patients increased slightly from 194 to 209 however there was consistent relationship between these measures and relative physician payment levels the author suggests that capacity constraints the prevalence of medicaid managed care administrative rules and other market factors might play role29 similarly multivariate analysis of factors affecting access and use by adult beneficiaries in 13 states in 1996 found that those in states with aboveaverage medicaid physician payments were more likely than others to have usual source of care or to have had doctors visit in the last year30 one recent survey of pediatricians summarized in table 19 found that while nearly 90 had some medicaid patients only 61 accepted all medicaid patients seeking care part of the difference may be related to capacity nearly quarter of the respondents were not accepting all privately insured patients either while physicians clearly felt that payments were inadequate over half reported that medicaid payments were insufficient even to cover their overhead leaving aside any compensation for the physicians time fewer than onethird said that they would see more medicaid patients if payments were raised on average pediatricians said that medicaid rates would have to exceed 82 of their customary charge before they would accept additional medicaid patients as table 18 showed the medicaid rate for well child visit was at or above 82 of the medicare rate in only four states in 2001 although low reimbursement was the most commonly cited reason for limited medicaid participation there were other issues including paperwork

eastern district of north carolina case 400cv173h4 at httpwwwdhhsstatencusdmamccreesettlementdentalsettlementagreepdf crs59 as with physician payment there is wide variation among states however there appears to be somewhat more consistency across different procedures within single state that is some of the states are low payers and others high payers across the board it should be emphasized that the comparison here is not between what medicaid pays and what some insurer or thirdparty payer pays for the same service but between medicaid rates and providers charges private dental insurance plans also commonly use fixed fee schedules and these too may often be well below providers charges the difference is that while patients with private insurance may have to pay the balance dentists who treat medicaid patients must accept the medicaid rate as payment in full low fees probably play role in limited use of dental services by medicaid beneficiaries especially children some state plans offer little or dental coverage for adults one recent study found that fewer than one in five children with medicaid received dental visit over the course of year32 whether increasing fees would improve access is not certain responding to gao survey of 40 states that increased rates between 1997 and 2000 14 reported increases in participation or utilization 15 reported increase and 11 indicated that not enough time had elapsed or the state did not have reliable data in states reporting changes the improvement was often marginal gao concluded that the size of rate increases was less important in explaining access improvements than the absolute amount of the fees after the increase 2002 study by the national conference of state legislatures identified number of factors in dentist participation unrelated to medicaid reimbursement including stigmatization of medicaid beneficiaries and perception that they fail to keep appointments in addition the study noted that many practices are already at capacity with privatepay patients and have need to accept medicaid beneficiaries33 federally qualified health centers and rural health clinics under obra 89 states were required to cover services in federally qualified health centers fqhcs and to pay full reasonable cost for these services fqhcs include community health centers migrant health centers and health care for the

were also required under 1977 amendment to pay reasonable costs for services of rural health clinics rhc which provide services of nurse practitioners and physician assistants in medically underserved

visit rate for 2001 based on its own average reasonable costs for 1999 and 2000 for later years this rate is updated by the medicare economic index mei used to update medicare physician payments for primary care the rate may be modified to reflect change in the scope of services provided by the facility the state and the center may agree to an alternative payment methodology but only if aggregate payments under the alternative method are at least equal to those that would have been made under the standard method bipa continued the requirement that states make supplemental payments to fqhcs and rhcs who are paid less than the minimum by medicaid mco finally gao was required to report on whether rates should be periodically rebased or refined and on how to do so the gao report is not due until the end of 2004 but gao has already concluded that the new system is likely to pay many facilities less than their costs for several reasons first the initial 2001 rates were based on costs for the two preceding years with allowance for inflation34 second the mei index used to update the rates rises less rapidly than other measures of inflation and centers may have difficulty holding increases to these limits especially if they began with low pervisit rate gao suggests that it will be difficult to develop system that assures the continued viability of fqhcs and rhcs while maintaining incentives for efficiency35 34 in addition some states were already paying less than full actual costs because some costs were disallowed as not reasonable under various tests 35 us general accounting office health centers and rural clinics payments likely to be constrained under medicaids new system gao01577 june 2001 crs61 longterm care nursing facilities payments to nursing facilities nfs are the single largest component of medicaid expenditures accounting for 19 of spending in 2002 at the same time medicaid is the key funding source for nfs in 2002 67 of nf residents relied on medicaid as their principal payer36 thus ability to control growth in nf spending has an important effect on state budgets while the adequacy of medicaid reimbursement can determine whether facility can offer highquality care the tension between the competing goals of cost containment and quality assurance has been present almost since the beginning of the medicaid program payment methods since the 1980 boren amendment allowed states to move away from medicares retrospective costbased reimbursement rules states have evolved very complex nf payment systems these systems commonly distinguish among direct patient care costs costs for various operating support and administrative functions and capital costs such as interest rent and depreciation state may treat each component differently for example payment to particular facility might be the sum of casemix adjusted fixed amount for direct care facilityspecific costbased payment subject to peer group ceiling for other operating costs and fair rental value payment for capital costs the following discussion of payment methods cannot capture the full complexity of states systems instead it focuses chiefly on how states pay for the direct care component the actual delivery of services to individual residents by nursing staff obviously the totality of the state payment relative to costs can affect quality or access still payment system that has incentives to hold down administrative costs or that limits the rate of return on capital investment has different implications from system that squeezes direct care spending payment for direct or nursing care table 21 shows each states basic payment method for the direct care component or in states classifying costs differently its nearest equivalent37 the

facilities in its peer group case mix adjustment is intended both to treat nfs fairly and to reduce incentives to refuse heavy care patients at least some observers contend that the adjustments may create perverse incentives of its own for example an nf might be penalized for promoting resident independence because payment is greater for residents requiring more assistance39 labor cost adjustments there are concerns that the supply of nurses aides and other direct care workers in nursing homes as well as inhome and personal care programs is not keeping pace with demand providers

approaching 10040 state constraints on growth in the direct care component of nf payment have limited providers ability to improve compensation or benefits an individual facility that does so on its own may risk exceeding classbased cost ceiling some states have sought to address this problem through wage passthrough programs which directly compensate providers that increase wages for directcare workers some other states have periodically made general rate adjustments to reflect increases in federal or state minimum wage requirements table 22 summarizes the passthrough programs in 28 states most programs target nfs though some also reach home care andor personal care programs some are voluntary the provider receives enhanced reimbursement if it shows that it has raised wages while others require participation by all providers in the targeted group information on the effectiveness of the programs is limited some states have reported modest improvements in turnover rates while others

pace with inflation and other changes affecting costs some facilities may still lose money nearly all state systems pay the lesser of actual costs or fixed ceiling in order to create pressure for greater efficiency in the most costly providers if state pays nearly all facilities their full costs and underpays small number of facilities the average payment to cost ratio will inevitably be less

whose current principal source of payment was medicaid charges would ordinarily be at or above actual costs although some facilities might have reported what they actually expected medicaid to pay it then shows the actual medicaid payment rates reported by facilities42 median rates are about 95 of median charges but the gap widens at the upper end of the distribution table 25 medicaid daily

reported while average medicaid payment rates are weighted by the number of facilities reporting given rate while it would have been preferable to use the same method for both numbers the design of the nnhs precludes this in practice some states that calculate medians to set ceilings use the median facility while others use the median resident crs75 in some states peer group or statewide ceilings or flat rates based on group experience may be at least as important as limited annual increases in explaining current payment shortfalls whether these ceilings are set at appropriate levels is difficult policy question the answer to which depends in part on how sensitive the states system is to differences in facility and resident characteristics if state uses single statewide ceiling with case mix adjustment then very efficient facility might be penalized because it is in highcost urban area or has residents with complex needs some observers have suggested that state use of complex ceiling systems for nf cost containment in preference to simple rate cuts or freezes was driven in part by concerns about litigation during the period when the boren amendment was still in effect it was easier for states to show that their payments were adequate to meet the costs of efficiently and economically operated facilities if only minority of nfs were affected by payment constraints43 with the repeal of the boren requirements acrosstheboard limitations may have greater appeal for states as table 24 showed many states limited general 19992000 rate increases to levels below average cost growth more may do so in response to current budgetary problems intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded until the 1980s most medicaid services for people with mental

the major change in the use of facilities to provide care for this population is that many residents are now in smaller facilities or in facilities operated by local government or private organizations the share of icfmr residents in nonstate facilities went from 125 in 1977 to 597 in 2002 only 16 of residents were in facilities with 15 or fewer beds in 1977 compared to 378 in 2002 43

limits copayments and reimbursement methodologies at httpwwwkfforgcontent200320031027 as of nov 2003 note payment methods indicated in this table are defined by the authors as follows fee for service means the state has established maximum payment amount for particular service or uses the maximum applicable to the medicare program for the service and pays the lesser of the providers charge or this amount often the payment is capped by an estimate of cost cost based payment means there is yearend settlement process or some documentation of actual cost is required to justify payment while prospective payment means there is not such process although the payment rates are generally based on historical cost some states make payment using percentage of charge to reflect cost typically using some documentation of providers historical cost to charge ratio some states negotiate payment rates crs85 home and communitybased services waivers the hcbs waiver programs offer wide variety of services one study found that services offered in at least some states included adult day care adult day habilitation adult day health services assistive technology adaptive equipment case management personal care attendants habilitation services homemaker services home health aide nursing care service personal care services respite care training for the family day treatment or other partial hospitalization and vocational services45 there has been little study of how states pay for particular home and community services while reimbursement methodologies for regular medicaid services are described in state plans methodologies for waiver services are not instead they are described in individual waiver applications and waiver amendments which are maintained by cms regional offices and are not readily accessible occasional surveys of state waiver programs have not addressed reimbursement in part because service coverage and service definitions vary so widely that crossstate comparisons are impossible46 even within state there may be multiple waiver programs each with its own service definitions and payment rules finally agencies providers and researchers in this field often tend to think of medicaid as funding stream merged with other sources of funding for clients and do not focus on individual medicaid payment transactions given the complexity of waiver programs and the limits of available information on reimbursement full review of payment rules is beyond the scope of this report instead the following discussion provides illustrations of how different states pay for two key services personal care and case management these may serve to highlight some of the policy considerations states must address in paying for waiver services the section concludes with brief review of state systems that use bundled payments for overall care of an hcbs waiver participant most of the information has been drawn from set of case studies performed for cms by the lewin group the urban institute and the university of minnesota research and training center on community living the studies completed in 2001 reviewed programs for the aged and disabled ad in seven states alabama indiana kentucky maryland michigan washington and wisconsin and programs for the mentally retarded and developmentally disabled mrdd in six states indiana kansas louisiana new jersey vermont and wyoming47 personal care personal care services both waiver and nonwaiver are furnished by home health agencies personal care agencies and local government agencies such as area agencies on aging aaas in addition many states directly pay individual personal care attendants 19981999 survey found that states paid an average of 13 an hour for agency services compared to 89 an hour for 45 s lutzky

personal communication with brian burwell 47 the complete set of studies is available at httpwwwhcbsorgresourcesfivehtm crs86 independent workers while agency rates were 27 to 39 higher than those for independent providers the attendants employed by the agencies earned only little more than the minimum wage48 some states vary payment not according to whether services are performed by an agency or an individual provider but according to some measure of intensity for example louisiana pays slightly higher rate per hour of care for high need participants 1136 versus 1005 per hour of regular care marylands nonwaiver personal care program uses three daily rates for personal care based on the complexity of the beneficiarys needs and informal support system 10 per day for minimal assistance furnished in one visit 20 for extensive help provided in one or two daily visits and 50 for constant supervision and assistance throughout the day there are concerns that daily as opposed to hourly rates give providers incentives to minimize the hours of care they provide however rates are set case studies found that states often failed to increase them over time even to account for inflation one conclusion was that given the choice between increasing enrollment and raising rates states preferred to cover more beneficiaries as is the case for direct care workers in nursing homes low payment or wage rates for personal care workers have led to problems in recruiting and high turnover the problems are made worse if waiver limits on covered hours per individual mean that the workers cannot even work fulltime49 in the 19981999 survey 61 of states reported recruiting problems the authors suggest that supply problems may in turn lead to poor quality lack of access and ultimately premature institutional placement for participants high turnover may also mean limited training and lack of skills needed to provide necessary support services as well as difficulty in establishing workerclient relationships few states have made additional payments to agencies that agree to pay higher wages however as table 23 showed of 28 states with wage passthrough programs only six had extended these programs to personal care services some states such as washington have also acted to improve direct payment to independent workers but only by 1 per hour leaving rates well below those paid to agencies at least one state new jersey considered more sweeping action 2003 legislative proposal would have shifted all personal care attendants now employed by 100 different agencies to stateadministered regional home care councils minimum wages would be 10 an hour50 48 leblanc m tonner and c harrington state medicaid programs offering personal care services health care financing

httpwwwkaisernetworkorgdaily_report rep_indexcfmhint3dr_id18480 crs87 case management case management includes assessing the beneficiarys needs developing the plan of care arranging for the delivery of services monitoring the beneficiary and conducting periodic reassessments of the beneficiarys needs and modifying the plan of care as needed51 while most waiver programs provide case management states differ in how it is structured and paid for some states use their own employees whether in the medicaid unit or in another unit such as the agency responsible for mrdd services some contract with agencies or individuals specifically to provide case management while others pay public or nonprofit agencies bundled rate that includes case management and service provision however case management is paid for recurring issue is whether the funding is adequate to hire sufficient qualified personnel gao has reported that in 20 of 51 waiver programs reviewed by cms regional offices or state audits case managers were not providing ongoing assessment and monitoring of waiver beneficiaries or followup of changes in beneficiaries care needs was inadequate this may be due in part to the fact that managers in some states carry larger caseload than in others the variation may in turn be function of reimbursement levels the state of washington pays area agencies on aging aaas to manage participants in both the ad and mrdd waivers the state treats case management as part of the aaas administrative budget rather than as service and thus allows fixed amount set at the start of the year the amount does not change even if caseloads rise in addition the annual budgets assume an average caseload per manager this has gone from 100 in the late 1990s to proposed 75 in fy2001fy2003 but some advocates say this is still too high for adequate contact and quality monitoring in new jerseys mrdd program budgets for countylevel community services offices assume three different levels of managers with different caseloads and visit frequency primary direct supervision of an individual living alone with caseload of 3545 and monthly visits program management of people in residential settings where other workers attend the person with caseload of 90100 and quarterly visits and resource for persons living with the family providing only annual contact with up to 250 cases indianas mrdd program instead of setting levels of care has fixed fee schedule for different management services from 800 per quarter hour of ongoing case management to 355 for an initial diagnostic and evaluation service wyoming allows participants in its mrdd program to choose their own service coordinator from listing of qualified individuals the state has reportedly made substantial investment in case management and has one of the lowest caseloads in the us 25 to 30 participants per manager the state pays managers monthly flat fee of 200 per child and 150 per adult meaning that managers can make an adequate living even with the limited caseload indianas ad program also allows 51 us general accounting office longterm care federal oversight of growing medicaid home and communitybased waivers should be strengthened gao03576 washington june 2003 crs88 participants to choose between private case manager and one supplied by the local aaa most choose the aaa budgeted or bundled payments some states instead of paying for individual services under their waiver programs make fixed payments to agencies for complete services to individual clients or to entire populations the kansas mrdd program originally had system that paid fixed daily rates to providers for inhome support residential services or day services rates varied depending on the clients assignment to one of five tiers reflecting assessed need in 2000 kansas shifted to system that pays bundled rates again by acuity tier for familyindividual supports to an agency selected by the family while some choose community service providers others enroll with community organization that will receive the payments and pool them for participating families each family hires its own helpers and is reimbursed by the organization some groups of families have formed participant alliances which receive the bundled payments and directly hire and oversee helpers in vermonts mrdd program single nonprofit agency is designated to serve most waiver participants in each of 10 geographic regions the agencies receive capped annual budgets based on the previous years allocation with inflation or other adjustments and are expected to provide all services for their current caseload within this budget the allocation is increased when an agency takes on new participant the budgeted amount for new entrants is generally at one of 10 flat rates from 7191 to 71376 per year in 2000 based on the clients assessed service needs within the overall budget the agency develops and manages individual budgets in consultation with families or guardians michigans ad program makes fixed daily payments to one of 23 regional waiver agents chiefly aaas or nonprofit organizations the payment in 2000 included 32 per day for services and 9 or 10 for administration the agency is at risk if average service costs for all clients exceed the allowance there are concerns that some agencies might treat the 32 figure as an individual ceiling rather than an aggregate one to limit potential losses for clients with complex needs there is an exceptions process under which an agency can obtain additional funding for clients whose services cost more than 96 per day crs89 managed care over 15 million beneficiaries or 38 of the medicaid population were enrolled in managed care organizations mcos or other fullrisk capitated arrangements as of june 200252 contracting organizations agree to provide or accept financial liability for broad range of medicaidcovered acute care services in return for fixed monthly payment for each enrollee capitation for longterm care is used in arizonas altcs program and in small number of programs of allinclusive care for the elderly or pace programs programs under which medicare and medicaid make integrated capitation payments for preventive acute and longterm care services to mcolike organizations many states require some classes of medicaid beneficiaries such as families eligible on the basis of meeting old welfare program rules povertyrelated groups of pregnant women and children or higherincome families enrolled through medicaid expansion waivers to enroll in mcos either statewide or in selected areas in other states enrollment is voluntary beneficiaries may choose between an mco and feeforservice with or without primary care case management feature some states have mandatory enrollment in some geographic areas and voluntary enrollment in others federal medicaid law requires simply that prepaid payments to the entity be made on an actuarially sound basis until recently federal regulations provided that state payments for enrollees in mcos could not exceed the feeforservice equivalent the estimated amount the state would have spent for comparable population not enrolled in the mco and continuing to receive services on feeforservice basis this limit was similar to the adjusted average per capita cost aapcc formerly used in setting medicare hmo payments the use of the feeforservice equivalent as an upper limit was dropped in 2001 partly because some states had enrolled so many beneficiaries in mcos that they longer had reliable data on feeforservice experience instead the regulations now provide detailed specifications of what would constitute actuarially sound payment rates under the new rules qualified actuary must certify that the states capitation rates have been developed in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles and practices rates must be based only on services covered under the states medicaid plan that is the state may not pay extra for services available under the mco contract but not provided to other beneficiaries finally the state must provide cms with documentation of the basis for the rates and with an explanation of any incentive arrangements or stoploss reinsurance or other risksharing methodologies these contractual options are explained below 52 prepaid plans providing only specific medicaid services such as behavioral health dental care or nonemergency transportation had 95 million enrollees some of these were also enrolled in mcos crs90 ratesetting methods this section provides information on how states establish payment rates for mcos it relies on two national surveys 2001 survey by the urban institute that collected information from 36 of the 39 states with fullrisk mco contracts53 and 2003 survey of 41 states by the national academy for state health policy this survey included the 39 states with fullrisk contracts and two additional states alabama and south dakota that have prepaid contracts for limited services basic approach capitation rates can be established in three basic ways the state can simply set them administratively it can negotiate with plans or it can use process of competitive bidding table 30 shows the basic method in use in states in 2001 as the urban institute report points out states may actually use mix of methods state that sets rates may also engage in negotiation while one that relies on competitive bids might have some limits on what bids will be deemed acceptable the urban institute report suggests that some states have moved away from competitive bidding because it is administratively burdensome and the results are often subject to disputes states with larger numbers of enrollees are somewhat more likely to use administered ratesetting as are states with higher proportion of enrollees in commercial mcos table 30 principal approach to mco ratesetting 2001 percent of mco mco enrollees in competitive

as of june 2001 note enrollment is total in commercial mcos medicaid mcos and in california only health insuring organizations hios crs92 however rates are established states commonly pay different amounts for different enrollees depending on enrollee characteristics most states use age sex and eligibility category to set rates somewhat fewer use geography possibly because some states have contracts that only cover one geographic area only few states consider whether an enrollee is in an institution or is dually eligible for medicare and medicaid this is presumably because many states do not enroll beneficiaries who are aged or disabled in mcos finally 18 states consider health status in plan payment of these 11 states adjust rates for few specific conditions eg hiv and nine have comprehensive system of risk adjustment new jersey and utah use both types of adjustment risk adjustment systems are considered further below table 31 factors in capitation payment 2002 number of

programs 41 100 source unpublished data collected by the national academy for state health policy for the congressional research service in 2003 in addition to using more or fewer factors states vary widely in the number of different rate cells they establish that is how many categories within each grouping they use the urban institute report found that states had as few as two rate cells for example under age 19 and 19 or over or as many as 126 in state with only few rate cells plans may have an incentive to seek out lowercost populations within each cell in state with very many cells data used to set rates for each cell might be statistically unreliable and values could fluctuate widely from year to year54 federal regulations currently require that states make adjustments for eligibility category age sex and geography but allow state to explain why an element is not applicable inadequate sample size would be one acceptable explanation states are encouraged but not required to use adjustments based on health status or diagnosis reinsurance risk sharing and incentive payments while mcos agree to accept financial liability for the services required by their enrollees there are number of reasons why it may be necessary to limit their potential losses on individual cases or in the aggregate first some plans have very small numbers of enrollees and could be overwhelmed by few highcost cases in 2002 52 fullrisk 54 this was the case under medicares former hmo payment system which recalculated rates annually for every county in the us crs93 contractors had fewer than 5000 medicaid enrollees second medicaidonly mcos especially recently established ones may have little capital and limited ability to sustain losses third large proportion of spending for mco enrollees who are disproportionately women and children is related to pregnancy and to problems of newborns these unpredictable events cannot be corrected for in prospective ratesetting and plan that gets fewer or more than its share of pregnancies in particular year might be considerably over or underpaid table 32 summarizes the ways in which states limit losses for risk contractors table 32 reinsurance and

the national academy for state health policy for the congressional research service in 2003 new york reported both voluntary and mandatory state reinsurance programs one way in which mcos whether or not contracting with medicaid commonly limit losses is by purchasing reinsurance sometimes known as stoploss coverage from commercial reinsurer the reinsurer assumes some or all of the liability when costs for an individual enrollee exceed deductible amount such as 100000 or 250000 less commonly the entity might obtain aggregate reinsurance which limits its overall losses for the year for example the reinsurer might begin paying claims when the entitys costs exceed 110 of revenues in 2002 19 states reported that their risk contractors obtained commercial reinsurance six of these states required contractors to do so other states act as reinsurers themselves for example an mco contract might provide that the contractor will be liable for the first 25000 in costs for medicaid enrollee after which the state would assume liability of 13 states with these arrangements reinsurance was voluntary in six and mandatory in six one state reported both voluntary and mandatory coverage seven states provide what amounts to reinsurance by limiting contractors liability for enrollees with specific conditions such as hiv crs94 five states had contracts with risk corridors these work somewhat like aggregate reinsurance the contractor is liable for all costs up to some fixed percentage of its capitation revenue costs above the limit are shared by the contractor and the state or may be assumed entirely by the state55 four states had risk pools in which multiple contractors make payments usually per capita assessment into combined fund that is used to help pay for highcost cases finally there are four states that base their prospective capitation rates for year on projected feeforservice expenditures for comparable population and recalculate those rates retrospectively if feeforservice costs are greater than expected nashp treats this as risksharing arrangement however it is different from the others in that it does not relate to the contractors actual spending finally state may provide supplemental incentive payments to an mco for meeting specified performance targets for example providing more child health screenings under the early and periodic screening diagnostic and treatment program epsdt or the state may share savings with the mco that is it may split the difference between the mcos capitation rates and the estimated amount that would have been spent for the enrollees in the feeforservice program federal rules require that these arrangements cannot provide payments greater than 105 of approved capitation rates must be offered equally to public and private contractors and may not be linked to intergovernmental transfers risk adjustment rate cells based only on age sex eligibility category or location can capture differences in average spending for entire population groups but cannot predict the level of risk represented by individual enrollees within each population defined by rate cell there can be significant variation in health status and likely costs this has two consequences first in states in which mco enrollment is voluntary the group choosing to enroll may have better or worse health status than the group choosing to remain in the feeforservice system if capitation rates are based on feeforservice experience overall payments to mcos might not reflect the level of risk they are assuming second when multiple mcos are competing any one entity might be over or underpaid depending on the health status of the beneficiaries it enrolled this creates incentives to market to healthier beneficiaries andor promote disenrollment by sicker ones56 as mentioned earlier nashp reports that nine states have attempted to deal with this problem by adding risk adjustment to their ratesetting methods57 risk adjustment systems assign enrollees to some form of health status or diagnostic category capitation rates are increased or decreased to reflect higher or lower 55 federal regulations provide that total payments to the mco under risk corridor arrangement may not exceed what would have been paid under medicaid feeforservice for the services received by enrollees plus an administrative allowance note that this rule relates to services actually furnished to enrollees while the repealed feeforservice equivalent rule compared capitation rates to average expenditures for comparable non enrolled population 56 while there are rules prohibiting these practices they may be difficult to detect and there is long history of such abuses under both medicaid and medicare 57 see page 93 crs95 expected costs for enrollees in each category nashp does not provide further details on what systems states are using or what groups of enrollees the system applies to table 33 has been pieced together from the 2001

information from past inpatient and ambulatory claims or encounter reports along with age and sex to assign each enrollee to risk category there are several acg models using different numbers of groupings the remaining states use the disability payment system dps or the more recent refinement the chronic illness and disability payment system cdps these systems developed by researchers at the university of california san diego also use data from past claims to classify enrollees by diagnoses and complications kronick et report that the cdps method performs better than acgs in predicting costs for the disabled neither system was very good at predicting costs for families eligible on the basis of meeting former welfare program rules section 1931 eligibles one key problem in risk adjustment for medicaid is that many beneficiaries are enrolled only for limited period this means that it may not be possible to collect sufficient data to classify shortterm enrollees under given crs96 system and the data are likely to be less reliable than data collected for longerterm enrollees58 most states that have not adopted broader risk adjustment have made special provisions for costs related to pregnancies and newborns of the 36 states responding to the urban institute survey 28 had some provision of these 21 made lumpsum payments to mcos for each pregnancy twelve had established separate rates for women qualifying for medicaid on the basis of pregnancy one of these also paid higher rate for section 1931eligible pregnant woman finally eight states paid higher rates for newborns or infants under one year old payment levels table 34 shows 1998 and 2001 medicaid managed care rates for section 1931 and povertyrelated populations in selected states the rates are adjusted for some differences in population and in services covered under contracts in both years the highestpaying state north dakota paid nearly twice as much as the lowestpaying state oklahoma rates increased an average of 18 over three years but some states were cutting rates while others were increasing substantially differences were not found to correlate with differences in medicare aapccs for the areas served suggesting that general geographic variation in health spending does not explain the wide variation in rates the authors note that there is considerable variation in states medicaid feeforservice spending as well depending in part on state cost containment efforts this variation carries over into mco rates in states that base rates on feeforservice experience or consider that experience in negotiating or evaluating bids rates may also be affected by biased selection differences in health risk of mco and nonmco beneficiaries not corrected for through risk adjustment and by whether state enrolls beneficiaries statewide or only in highcost urban areas table 34 change in medicaid managed care payment rates section 1931 and povertyrelated groups selected states

holahan and shinobu suzuki medicaid managed care payment methods and capitation rates in 2001 health affairs vol 22 1 janfeb 2003 pp 204218 rates are adjusted for some differences in population and in services covered under contracts whether medicaid managed care rates are adequate is difficult to assess as table 35 shows the number of mcos participating in medicaid has dropped with the number of commercial plans dropping especially sharply some of this change may reflect plan mergers rather than withdrawal from medicaid at the same time medicaid mco enrollment has been growing so that more enrollees are served by fewer plans this suggests that small plans or plans with small number of crs98 medicaid enrollees might have been more likely to drop out one reason might be that medicaid imposes special administrative requirements plans with few medicaid enrollees cannot justify the costs or they may fail to develop the care systems needed to effectively manage medicaid beneficiaries59 the commercial mco share of enrollment peaked in 1999 and has since been dropping this trend is not necessarily related to payment rates this was period when many mcos were losing money and reevaluating their overall business strategies at one time it would have been assumed that declining commercial participation raised concerns about access and quality until passage of the bba most mco plans participating in medicaid were required to have commercial enrollees as well on the theory that employers and private enrollees were in better position to press for highquality care than medicaid beneficiaries if this was ever true since the passage of the bba states have arguably been at least as active in monitoring quality as private purchasers however even if increasing reliance on medicaidonly plans does not necessarily mean quality problems it is not clear how these plans will be affected by the current financial pressures on states as was shown in table 8 above about half of states with mco programs plan to freeze or reduce their capitation rates for fy2004 medicaidonly plans cannot shift losses to other purchasers and would need to reduce their provider

1125 crs99 prescription drugs medicaid payment for prescription drug furnished to beneficiary on an outpatient basis has two components an amount to cover the cost of the ingredients the acquisition or ingredient cost and an amount to cover the pharmacys costs to fill the prescription the dispensing fee medicaid regulations establish upper limits on payment for acquisition costs but do not limit dispensing fees these must merely be reasonable two separate limits on acquisition costs are used one for certain multiple source drugs those for which therapeutic equivalents or generic versions are available from three or more suppliers and one for all other drugs the limits are designed to encourage the substitution of lower cost generic equivalents for more costly brand name drugs61 since 1991 pharmaceutical manufacturers have been required to give rebates to states for drugs paid for by medicaid the rebate formulas are designed to assure that states pay the lowest price offered by the manufacturer to any other highvolume purchaser in return the state must generally cover all the drugs marketed by the manufacturer this section reviews the regulatory limits on reimbursement and summarizes state policies on acquisition costs and dispensing fees it then provides an overview of recent state initiatives in prescription drug purchasing pharmacy reimbursement methods upper payment limits multiple source drugs for purposes of the upper payment limits multiple source drug is one that meets the following two requirements the drug is made available by at least three different suppliers and b the food and drug administration fda has determined that at least three approved formulations of the drug are therapeutically equivalent that is contain identical doses of the active ingredient and have the same biological effects for each multiple source drug cms establishes price limit known as the maximum allowable cost or mac equal to 150 of the estimated wholesale cost of the least expensive therapeutic equivalent states payments for such drugs during given period may not exceed what would have been spent if the state had paid the price limit plus reasonable dispensing fee note that the federal mac limits apply to aggregate spending for the listed drugs many states have established their own mac systems which may have higher price limits for some drugs and lower limits for others the effect of the mac limits is that when lowercost generic equivalent exists for brandname drug pharmacy will be paid the generic price even if the 61 for additional information on medicaids payment for and coverage of prescription drugs see crs report rl30726 prescription drug coverage under medicaid by jean hearne crs100 brandname drug is actually furnished the pharmacy therefore has financial incentive to substitute the generic equivalent for the brandname drug if the prescribing physician specifies that generic substitution is unacceptable for example by writing dispense as written or substitution on the prescription the cms price limits do not apply the pharmacy must supply the brandname drug and may be paid the full brandname cost other drugs for all other drugs including multiple source drugs for which the prescribing physician has requested substitution statewide payments may not exceed the lesser of the pharmacies usual and customary charge to the general public and b the estimated acquisition cost eac plus dispensing fee the eac or ingredient cost is the states best estimate of what pharmacies are generally paying for drug dispensing fees and ingredient costs table 36 shows the dispensing fee established by each state as well as the states method of computing the ingredient cost or eac dispensing fees most states pay fixed dispensing fees ranging from about 3 to 6 per prescription some states pay different fees for brandname and generic drugs for drugs dispensed in nursing facilities or for drugs provided in the unit dose systems often used in nfs or for drugs compounded by the pharmacist from multiple ingredients few states pay different fees to different pharmacies depending on area the pharmacys historic costs or volume of medicaid or other statepaid prescriptions new jersey pays extra for pharmacies providing 24hour emergency service wisconsin pays higher fees to pharmacists providing pharmaceutical care added services

respectively and study by the national association of chain drug stores finding average 2001 costs of 72662 ingredient cost most states base the eac for particular drug on the average wholesale price

have expressed concerns about the use of the awp in prescription drug payment because it is an arbitrary number that does not reflect what pharmacies actually pay wholesalers all states that use awp take fixed percentage reduction but there have been allegations that some manufacturers report highly inflated awps as result even though the state pays less than the full awp it may pay the pharmacy much more than the pharmacy actually paid for the drug the oig has recomputed awps for some commonly prescribed drugs using actual wholesale transaction data 30 states had used some of these revised awps as of 200163 the oig has also suggested that states take larger fixed percentage discounts on the basis of sample pharmacy pricing information it found that actual 1999 acquisition costs were 2184 less than awp for brand name drugs and 6593 less than awp for generics64 drug rebate requirements obra 90 required that drug manufacturers as condition of medicaid coverage of their prescription drug products enter into agreements with the secretary of hhs under which they pay state medicaid programs rebates for medicaidreimbursed drugs65 in return states are required to cover under medicaid all of the drugs marketed by that manufacturer with certain exceptions states may require prior authorization to dispense certain drugs or can establish formulary listing of preferred drugs and require authorization for all drugs not on the list there are also certain categories of drugs which can be excluded from coverage entirely66 rebate requirements do not apply to products dispensed as part of service provided in hospital physicians or dentists office or similar setting or to drugs provided by mcos when payment is included in the capitation rate however they do apply to drugs dispensed in nursing facilities if the cost of the drugs is not included in the nfs medicaid per diem payment and is instead reimbursed by medicaid to the dispensing pharmacy for this reason as of 1998 only three states still included prescription drugs in nf payments rebate requirements may also apply to nonprescription item such as aspirin if it is covered in states medicaid plan 63 us

states each quarter on the basis of price information supplied by manufacturers to cms and utilization information furnished to the manufacturers by state medicaid agencies the federal share is recovered through an adjustment in federal matching payments to states in setting the amount of required rebates the law distinguishes between two classes of drugs the first includes single source drugs generally those still under patent and innovator multiple source drugs drugs originally marketed under patent but for which generic competition now exists the second class includes all other noninnovator multiple source drugs generics single source and innovator multiple source drugs for these drugs manufacturers are required to pay state medicaid programs basic rebate for each covered drug along with an additional rebate if drug product prices increase faster than inflation as measured by the consumer price index for all urban consumers cpiu basic rebate amounts are determined by comparing the average manufacturer price amp for drug the average price paid by wholesalers to the best price the lowest price offered by the manufacturer in the same period to any wholesaler retailer provider hmo nonprofit entity or governmental entity in the us prices offered to federal agencies state pharmaceutical assistance programs and certain other entities are not considered in determining the best price under the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 prices negotiated from manufacturers for discount card drugs and prices negotiated by private plans providing the new medicare prescription drug benefit will also be excluded from the calculation the basic rebate is the greater of 151 of the amp or the difference between the amp and the best price the additional rebates are required for any drug whose price increases faster than the cpiu in determining the rebate prices in effect on october 1 1990 or the date of introduction if later are used as base these are then compared with prices as of the month before the start of the period for which the rebate is to be issued noninnovator multiple source drugs for multiple source drugs basic

drug spending for nonmco services b includes rebates under state supplemental agreements the rebate formula has been criticized on several grounds first there may be inconsistencies in the way different manufacturers compute the amp or the best price second because the rebates are based on amp while most states use the awp to determine pharmacy reimbursement there is relationship between the rebate amount and the amount the state actually spent on the drug67 the presidents fy2003 budget proposal would have changed the formula for computing rebates for single source and innovator multiple source drugs instead of comparing the manufacturers best price to the amp it would compare the best price to the awp the bush administration estimated fiveyear savings of 55 billion the fy2004 budget proposal did not repeat this specific proposal but included unspecified reforms of the rebate system intended to produce 132 billion in savings over10 years68 67 dhhs office of the inspector general 2002 red book the costsaver handbook 68 dhhs budget in brief fy2003 and budget in brief fy2004 crs107 recent state initiatives supplemental rebates some states have negotiated supplemental rebates from manufacturers in return for which the state might agree to include all the manufacturers products on its formulary or waive prior authorization as of fy2001 only california showed significant savings from these agreements with supplemental rebates equal to 7 of gross drug spending at least three states florida michigan and maine automatically require prior authorization unless the manufacturer agrees to pay supplemental rebate florida requires 10 rebate while michigan requires rebate equal to the difference between the drugs price and the lowest price for any drug in the same therapeutic class group of drugs with similar formulas effects or clinical use69 cms has notified states of its willingness to approve similar systems70 federal courts have rejected suits by manufacturers and patient advocates seeking to block the florida and maine programs maines program mainerx is not intended to produce savings for medicaid but to help residents without prescription drug coverage the state plans to negotiate supplemental rebates with manufacturers in return for an exemption from prior authorization requirements instead of retaining the rebate the state would pass it on to pharmacies which would in turn give discounts to uninsured consumers the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers association phrma obtained an injunction blocking implementation of the program partly on the ground that medicaid law prohibited maine from limiting access to services by medicaid beneficiaries to benefit other citizens the supreme court lifted the injunction in may 2003 but did not actually rule that the program was legal it could still be subject to scrutiny by cms or lower courts71 pharmacy plus cms is sponsoring demonstration program under which states may extend pharmacy benefits to medicare beneficiaries and disabled people with incomes below 200 of poverty who do not already receive medicaid drug coverage72 as of september 2003 programs have been approved in florida illinois south carolina and wisconsin the programs must be budgetneutral that is the state must achieve some savings elsewhere in the medicaid program that will offset the costs of the coverage73 because the benefits are treated as medicaid coverage 69 two drug companies pfizer and bristolmyers squibb were exempted in return for offering special programs to improve care for medicaid beneficiaries d gencarelli medicaid prescription drug coverage state efforts to control costs national health policy forum nhpf issue brief 790 may 2003 70 cms state medicaid directors letter 02014

the secretary to waive provisions of medicaid law to conduct demonstrations 73 some of the states with approved plans have met this requirement by arguing that the continued crs108 the programs will automatically get medicaidlevel rebates without the side agreements planned for the mainerx program at this writing it is unknown how these demonstrations will be affected by the enactment of the medicare prescription drug benefit which provides lowincome subsidies to people with incomes below 150 of poverty purchasing pools in february 2003 michigan and vermont announced the formation of joint purchasing pool that would operate in essentially the same way as michigans existing supplemental rebate program74 manufacturers would bid for inclusion on preferred drug list to be used by both states south carolina has since joined the initiative and about 10 other states are reportedly discussing participation75 number of other states have been considering similar coalitions georgia and texas have been exploring different approach under which the state medicaid agency and other agencies within the same state possibly including the state employees health benefit plan would engage in joint purchasing76 cost containment because growth in prescription drug costs has been major factor in medicaid spending increases most states have taken measures to control spending growth table 38 shows changes implemented in fy2003 or planned for fy2004 relatively few states have directly reduced awpbased payments but more are seeking supplemental rebates as the preceding discussion would suggest some of the measures designed to steer beneficiaries toward preferred drugs may also be intended to give manufacturers incentives to negotiate rebates states ability to command larger discounts for medicaid beneficiaries or leverage their buying power on behalf of other state residents may have been diminished by passage of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 dual eligibles beneficiaries eligible for both medicare and full medicaid benefits will receive covered drugs through the new medicare benefit beginning in 2006 this will significantly reduce the volume of drugs medicaid programs pay for directly77 spending for beneficiaries aged 65 and older accounted for 32 of medicaid drug spending in 1999 and this figure does not

account for the vast majority of medicaid spending state programs cover many other mandatory or optional services the following discussion is limited to services for which special payment rules are established by federal law home and communitybased care option in addition to the hcbs waiver medicaid law permits states to offer home and communitybased care for functionally disabled elderly persons as an optional medicaid service while waiver programs have limits on the numbers of participants state offering the hcbs optional service must cover everyone meeting eligibility standards established by the state perhaps for this reason only indiana and texas reported payments for this service in fy2001 payment rates for the care must be reasonable and adequate to meet the costs of providing the care efficiently economically and in conformity with laws and quality and safety requirements however the federal statute provides that payments over the course of quarter for persons receiving the services may not exceed 50 of what would have been paid by medicare to treat the same average number of patients in nursing facility in the state hospice services if the state elects to cover hospice services it must follow medicare reimbursement rules for hospices with minor differences under medicare rules payment for each day of care furnished by the hospice is at fixed rates according to the nature of the care received by the patient day may be classed as routine home care continuous home care inpatient respite care or general inpatient care average payments per patient are subject to an annual cap amount updated crs110 annually by the secretary and applied on an aggregate basis the hospice cap amount for the year ending october 31 2003 was 1866129 the aggregate number of inpatient care days provided by the hospice in any 12 month period may not exceed 20 of the total number of days of hospice care provided medicaid programs may or may not use the annual cap

for patients who receive hospice services while residing in nursing facility or icfmr this is not true under medicare indian health service the indian health service ihs within the department of health and human services dhhs provides or purchases health services for certain groups of native americans and alaska natives the ihs provides care in two different ways directly through ihs

to users of ihs services be exhausted before ihs will accept financial responsibility native americans may qualify for medicaid in the same way as any other population by meeting categorical and financial standards in the case of services provided in ihs facilities to medicaid beneficiaries ihs or the facility bills medicaid directly at fixed rates established annually by dhhs78 federal matching funds for services in ihs facilities are available at 100 rather than at the states usual matching rate when services are furnished by contract provider the provider is expected to collect from any alternative resource available to the patient including medicaid medicare or other health insurance before seeking reimbursement from ihs if medicaid is the responsible payer federal funding is available at the states usual matching rate the state is liable for the remainder as with any other medicaid service laboratory services payment for laboratory test performed by physician independent laboratory or hospital except tests for the hospitals own inpatients may not exceed the amount that would be paid under medicare rules for the same test medicare payment is based on regional fee schedules established by the secretary for each type of test programs of allinclusive care for the elderly pace the bba authorized the pace program under which medicare and state medicaid programs make integrated capitation payments for preventative acute and longterm care to mcolike organizations that furnish services to frail elderly people as of january 2003 10 states had approved

billing by tribes tribal organizations or alaska native health organizations that are operating ihs owned or leased facilities crs111 and such other factors as the secretary determines to be appropriate the secretary has not so far specified any additional factors volume purchasing states may arrange for volume purchasing of laboratory services other than those provided by hospitals or rural health clinics or medical devices such as durable medical equipment or eyeglasses one or more providers of the specified service may be selected by the state through competitive bidding or other means as the sole source of the items covered in an area or statewide some states will permit other providers to furnish the item or service but only if they are prepared to meet the price of the approved source the state must ensure that services remain accessible to beneficiaries if the arrangement is for laboratory services the laboratory must be statelicensed andor meet other requirements established by the secretary and more than 75 of the laboratorys charges may be for medicare and medicaid beneficiaries coordination with medicare while coverage under medicare part hospital insurance is automatic for persons meeting eligibility standards coverage under part b supplemental medical insurance requires payment of monthly premium by the beneficiary some persons not automatically eligible for part coverage may also obtain that coverage by paying premium in addition medicare beneficiaries are liable for costsharing deductible and coinsurance payments imposed for most medicarecovered services state medicaid programs are required to help defined populations of lowincome medicare beneficiaries with medicarerequired premiums and sometimes costsharing as table 39 shows there are five groups of medicare beneficiaries eligible for medicaid assistance the amount of help they receive generally decreases with rising income in addition to meeting income tests beneficiaries must meet resource tests for dual eligibles assets are limited to the ssi standard 2000 for an individual and 3000 for couple for the other groups the limits are twice these amounts79 79

longterm care coverage states pay medicare premiums and costsharing for these beneficiaries and cover services included in the state plan and not covered by medicare most notably longterm nursing facility care and outpatient prescription drugs80 note that when the new medicare prescription drug benefit takes effect in 2006 state medicaid programs will longer be permitted to cover drugs that are included in the medicare benefit instead dual eligibles will receive the lowincome subsidies provided for under the medicare law81 qualified medicare beneficiaries qmbs do not qualify for full

and required medicare costsharing for qmbs specified lowincome medicare beneficiaries slmbs have 80 technically state could choose not to pay premiums buy in for dual eligibles whose incomes exceed 120 of poverty chiefly persons in institutions who are spending down however states are given financial incentive to obtain part b coverage for all medicaid beneficiaries who could qualify for it if the state fails to buy in for beneficiary and then makes medicaid payments for services that could have been covered by medicare it may not claim federal matching for the resulting expenditures there is an exception for services furnished prior to the date of the beneficiarys medicaid application and covered as result of retroactive grant of medicaid eligibility 81 states will make maintenance of effort payments to the federal government these will begin in 2006 at 90 of states estimated per capita drug spending less dispensing fees and rebates for dual eligibles and will phase down to 75 in

135 of the fpg states pay the part b premium for these individuals with 100 federal funding subject to fixeddollar annual cap for each state this can mean that not all eligible applicants will receive assistance the provision for qis expires november 20 2004 finally states are required to pay the part premium but not the part b premium or costsharing for qualified disabled and working individuals these are certain persons whose social security disability insurance benefits cease after they return to work but who are permitted to continue to receive medicare by paying the part premium when states pay medicare deductibles and coinsurance for dual eligibles and qmbs they have two options for computing the medicaid payment amount they may choose to pay the full costsharing amounts determined by medicare or they may pay the difference if any between what medicare paid and what the state would have paid under its usual medicaid rules for the same service for example suppose the medicare allowed fee for given physician service is 100 and the states medicaid fee schedule allows 75 for the same service medicare pays 80 or 80 leaving 20 to be paid as coinsurance the state may
