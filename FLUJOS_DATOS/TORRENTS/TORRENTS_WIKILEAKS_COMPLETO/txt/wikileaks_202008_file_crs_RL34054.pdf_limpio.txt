the safety of the public the fcc has used this authority to design governance structure that would allow public safety broadband licensee psbl to share spectrum rights with commercial enterprise and to collaborate in the construction and management of shared network as currently proposed by the fcc publicprivate partnership would build shared network on spectrum capacity assigned to two separate licenseholders in the fcc plan the psbl would hold national license of 10mhz in the 700 mhz band and commercial partner would hold an adjacent license for 10 mhz nationwide designated as the d block the two licensees and the network would operate according to requirements set out by the fcc as part of its rulemaking for the auction of frequencies within the 700 mhz band these frequencies are

this discussion of governance for publicprivate partne rship is based on preparations undertaken by the fede ral communications commission fcc to auction 62 mhz1 of radio frequencies in the 700 mhz band of radio spectrum in conformance with requirements in the deficit reduction act2 the fcc issued rules in second report and order 3 concerning the allocation of this spectrum the auction the final disposition of spectrum ssigned for public safety use and the creation of publicprivate partnership to build and operate network for public safety users with agreements for sharin g spectrum responding to requirement in the balanced budget act of 1997 the f cc had previously set aside 24 mhz in the same bandwidth for public safety users4 i n t h second report and order it proposed to set aside 10 mhz from the public safety frequency ba nds to be paired with 10 mhz of auctionable spectrum to create shared network of 20 mhz for nationwide broadband network the decision to create shared netw ork was centered on two conclusions endorsed by the fcc and the majority of stakeholders 1 that network with national coverage would meet public safety needs for robust communications capabilities information and interoperability and 2 that sharing spectrum and network facilities with commercial users would benef it public safety by providing new sources of funding5 economies of

spectrum licenseholders would collaborate so that their combined spectru m capacity would be adequate to support broadband network in antic ipation of obtaining co mmercial partner the fcc assigned national license for 10 mhz to notforprofit corporation formed to represent public safety interests this public safety license was created from the 24 mhz originally assigned to public safety through regional state and local negotiations for spectrum assignments it is administered by public safety broadband licensee psbl chosen by the fcc from the frequencies intended for commercial use the fcc designated 10 mhz to be paired with public safetys 10 mhz to create shared network this license was to be sold to commercial enterprise as part of the auction of licenses at 700 mhz auction 73 the commercial license known as the d block ttracted only one bidder at the auction which concluded march 18 2008 qualcomm inc placed an opening bid of 472 million but there were other bidders c onsequently the reserve price of 13 billion set by the fcc was not met in an order adopted and released on march 20 2008 the fcc directed the wireless telecommunications bureau not to pro ceed with the reauction of the d block because it is i n the public interest to provide additional time to consider all options 6 the fcc therefore initiated review of its rules regarding licensing structuring partnership setting service requirements and other rules and obligations established prior to the commencement of auction 73 it prepared further notice of proposed rulemaking that sought co mments on identified options that might be pursued in disposing of the d block7 from these comments the fcc prepared third further notice of proposed rulemaking that lays out new auction rules for the d block8

implications for the 110th congress by linda k moore 12 oral and written testimony given at the hearing september 16 2008either national license or in sm aller licenses covering 58 regions9 number of public safety associations and officials have asked that the psbl allow local public safety networks to operate on and manage access to the public safety spectrum the national licensee would assure common standards and interoperability across all systems while allowing local networks to negotiate sharing arrangements and services that met their specific needs10 congressional policy and the publicprivate partnership from the perspective of congressional po licy one of the key issues that has emerged from the discussions of the auc tion is how best to combine public and private spectrum license ownership with the important goal of national capability for public safety communications support the fcc and the office of emergency communications at the department of homeland security dhs are pursuing separate paths for developing this communications response11 according to testimony neither agency has undertaken to incorporate each others goals in their specific planning12 another major policy consideration for c ongress is the identification of funding solutions for various parts of the progra m as discussed below the fcc has proposed to resolve these needs throug h levies on the commercial partner or requirements for performance public sector funding is another possibility that may receive renewed interest in the current economic situation an economic stimulus program that includes funding for improve ments to critical infrastructure could include component for public safety netw orks by temporarily assuming the role of the commercial partner the federal govern ment could preserve the principle of the shared network assure the construction of the network and sell the ongoing business to the private sector publicprivate partnership key assumptions it was noted above that there is gene ral agreement that sharing spectrum and network facilities with commercial users would benefit public safety by providing new sources of funding economies of scal in building the needed network and access to additional spectrum in times of large scale emergencies these benefits arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34054crs4 13 the fccs office of inspector general issued report that covered some of the reasons cited for nonparticipation d block investigati on april 25 2008 at httphraunfossfccgovedocs_publicattachmatchdoc281791a1pdf viewed april 28 2008generally accepted as concrete and desirable and although there is much discussion about how to achieve the goal of sharin g resources between the public and private sectors the consensus remains that this is the goal for the purpose of analysis this report further assumes three needs that must be met for an effective solution these are sufficient spectrum for broadband network the amount of spectrum needed to operate nationwide broadba nd network with the coverage required by public safety is at least 20 mhz according to most experts source of funds source of funds needs to be identified to meet unavoidable costs to public safety ssociated with the creation of single national public safety license these costs include the costs of rebanding as part of the new allocation plan for 700 mhz set forth by the fcc and the costs of spectrum license administration and frequency coordination tasks usually managed through state or local agencies management structure the key elements for publicprivate partnership as set forth by th fcc are 1 public safety broadband licensee 2 publicpri vate partnership and 3 network sharing agreement require d in order to build and manage network shared by commercia l users and emergency personnel there is also frequently mentioned assumption that is not associated with particular solution commercial partners will use the shared network for consumer services and therefore incentives are required to build out network that meets the higher standard s required for public safety this assumption ignores the projections for significant demand from the business sector for mobile access to data and the requirements of many businesses for security and reliability equal to or greater than those of public safety publicprivate partnershi p the debate and options since the conclusion of the auction th ere has been vigorous public debate about why the d block license was not ccessfully auctioned and what steps might be taken going forward to assign the license13 some of the reasons why the d block failed to attract winning bid have been circulated through the media and presentedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34054crs5 14 hearing on the outcome of the auction with emphasis on the d block was held by the house committee on energy and commerce subcommittee on telecommunications and the internet on april 15 2008 oversight of the federal communications commission the 700 mhz auction hearings and comments by members of congress before the auction occurred also raised concerns bout possible problems with auction rules 15 fcc second further notice of proposed rulemaking released may 14 2008 ps docket 06229 at httphraunfossfccgovedocs_publicattachmatchfcc08128a1pdf at congressional hearings14 discussion of possible flaw s in the structure of the auction and how some rules may have discouraged potentia l bidders is only part of the debate the debate also encompasses other solutions to meet the goal of proving an interoperable public safety broa dband network principle points under consideration can be categorized as modify the auction rules to eliminate fcc requirements that might have discouraged potential bidders and keep the structure of the publicprivate partnership intact this course assumes that the business case for the publicprivate partnership is sound and changing auction rules without changing the structure of the partnership will be sufficient to attract bidder eliminate the network sharing requirement while empoweringpublic safety to negotiate independently for publicprivate partnerships or other sharing ag reements and auction the d block license without the public safety requirements this course assumes that there is both structure and adequate spectrum capacity to enable different entities to collabor ate successfully in constructing nationwide capability for public safety interoperability use federal funds to build public safety network this course is usually predicated on using proceeds from the auction of 700 mhz frequencies and assumes that th ere are sufficient funds and management structure to achieve the goal this course notably requires congressional action to authorize expenditures choose different organizational structure for managing public safety network that shares re sources and infrastructure with commercial and other spect rumlicense holders this course requires congressional action to authorize expenditures and may further require legislation to pr ovide the organizational structure these solutions are not mutually exclusive and several proposals combine different elements in its second further notice of proposed rulemaking 15 the fcc seeks comments on wide range of options and solutions that it has identified most of these would fall within one of the categories summarized below modify the auction rules at hearing on april 15 2008 all five fcc commissioners affirmed thei r support for reauctioning the d block under rules that

auction could be modifi cations of requirements for the dblock winning bidder such as lowering the reserve price or eliminating the financial penalty for failure to negotiate completed network sharing agreement or they could include for example changes in the network sharing agreement or the terms applicable to the public safe ty broadband licensee psbl alter or eliminate the network sharing agreement another course of action that has been proposed is to rea uction the d block without encumbrances these encumbrances include provisions that require paying up to 10 million to cover rebanding costs in the 700 mhz band expensive buildout requirements and the network sharing agreement some proposals would liminate the network sharing agreement entirely offering the d block as commercial license under terms similar to the other blocks of licenses assigned through auction 7317 it has been suggested by some that the network sharing agreement will be reworked to accommodate the strongest potential bidders18 use federal funds to build public safety network in conjunction with recommendations to re auction the d block without encumbrances many are suggesting that surplus funds from aucti on 73 and possibly other auctions be used to build public safety network in oral testimony fcc chairman kevin j martin referred to the public sa fety interoperability im plementation

network22 recommendations for using spectrum proceed s to fund nationwide interoperable network have generally not provided details about how the funds would be distributed to build such network choose different organizational structure some solutions envision different structure for managing sh ared network that would reduce but not eliminate the role of the public safety broadband licensee cooperative organization multiple public safety partners the obligation of the publicprivate pa rtnership would be to build an interoperable backbone at 700 mhz that regional state and local networks could connect to in times of largescale emergencies this would require smaller financial commitment from the commercial partner and greater level of participation by state and local agencies that would build out and control access to their parts of the network23 network builders and operators would collaborate on solutions to provide interoperability appropriated funds for public safety might be distributed through existing grant programs24 the commercial network might be the dominant pa rtner working with hundreds of public safety collaborators and w ould therefore probably take the lead in investment and technology decisions cooperative organization multiple commercial partners instead of single d block partner with national license licenses could be assigned to hundred or more comme rcial partners with licenses for local markets and rural coverage in this case the public safety partner would take the lead in designing the network and choosing the technology and standards to which the commercial partners would be required to build conceivably the fcc could fill the role of network designer setting standards through rulemaking federal agency the network sharing agreement would place greater emphasis on the competitive position of the commercial partner federal funds administered prima rily through existing programs within the department of homeland security could be used to

possible sources of funding for cap ital expenditures and for operating costs30 existing programs that might fund operating costs as possible sources of funds to cover operating costs of the public

with the passage of th telecommunications act of 1996 sec 707 to provide capital through loans i nvestments or other means to small businesses in the telecommunications industr its primary source of capital is the interest accrued on deposits held by the fcc as part of spectrum auction procedures33 the publicprivate partnership fcc efforts this section provides an overview of st eps taken by the fcc preceding auction 73 establishing the key provisions that the fcc is reviewing and may change since it initiated auctions in 1994 the f cc has consistently provided auction rules that allow it to establish financial requirements for potential bidders to set aside licenses for specific classes of bidders to provide economic incentives and to use other tools for managing the auction process34 in addition to setting up rules for the auctions it conducts the fcc also establishes and enforces service rules fo r the use of licenses among the provisionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34054crs10 35 as

commercial licensee would be obligated to build network to satisfy public safety needs as well as those of its commercial customers regulatory governance through service rules the fcc followed past procedures in the creation of service rules to establish the structure for publicprivate partnership as part of its preparation for the auction of licenses in the 700 mhz band in its review of background and discussion of its decisions in the second report and order the fcc tried to anticipate the problems that might arise in building and operating shared network and to preclude difficulties by providing regulatory framework that sets and enforces rules and requirements the regulatory framework for publicprivate partnership comprises sets of binding requirements for organiza

duration of the agreement fees the fcc ruled that all service fees must be specified in the nsa these fees would include fees for normal network service and for priority access to commercial spectrum capacity in times of emergency the fcc opined that the two licensees should be left to negotiate r easonable rates in g ood faith and provided examples of what it considered to be r easonable these included expectations that the fee structure would have financial incentives for the commercial licensee based on the number of subscribers from the public safety sector and that priority access fees would be structured to protect pub lic safety participants from unforeseen or unbudgeted payment obligations93 other guidelines for reasonable pricing structure would include affordable rates that are priced in line with comparable commercial services but at lower rates for public safety94 the fccs stated expectation was that the d block licensee when negotiating fees with its public safety partner would provide terms that best serve the public safety goals established in the second report and order the fcc reiterated some of the tools available to it to ensure that nsa disputes would be resolved which it can apply to assure that the fees charged meet its expectations of what is reasonable95 duration of agreement the nsa would be in effect for term not to exceed ten years beginning

met by terminating the commercial traffic and yielding to the public safety user this privilege of secondary access would be accord ed to the d block licensee as part of the interlocking agreements that c onstitute the publicpri vate partnership99 for example the public safety broadband licen see would be require d to lease spectrum to the d block licensee and the d bloc k licensee would be required to build network for public safety use100 the fcc has required spectrum manager leasing arrangement for the full term of the tenyear license this form of lease would place the responsibility for compliance fully on the lessee the d block license holder101 as part of its spectrum management ob ligations the d block licensee would be required to assure that public safety users would not ex perience harmful interference interruption or degradation of service due to commercial operations in the public safety spectrum band one prerequisite fo r this level of assurance would be requirement by the fcc that the network be designed to assign priority to first responders automatically w ith immediate preemption or exclusion from access to the network by commercial users102 in return for allowing commercial usage of its bandwidth public safety would have the right to real time access on an emergency basis of the spectrum licensed to the d block103 the obligation to provide this
