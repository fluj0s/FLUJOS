divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31911innocent landowners and prospective purchasers in the superfund act summary the superfund act contains several mechanisms that eliminate or contain liability or reduce liabilityrela ted transaction costs nor mally incurred under the act by persons that acquire contaminated land this report covers three of them two mechanisms use innocent landowner status innocent referring to landowners lack of actual or constructive knowledge on the date of site acquisition as to the presence of hazardous contamination there the third is based on the bona fide prospective purchaser concept and is intended to courage redevelopment of sites known at the time of acquis ition to be contaminated the first innocent landowner mechanism uses that status to invoke the superfund acts thirdpart defense to liability one prer equisite is that the release of hazardous substances must have been caused solely by third party lacking contractual relationship with the defendant landowner is defined to lack contractual relationship with predecessors in the chain of title if the disposal of the hazardous substances on the site preceded acquisition by the owner and at the time of acquisition heshe did not know and had reason to know that the hazardous substance had been disposed of there reason to know in turn means that before the date of acquis ition heshe made ll appropriate inqui ry into conditions at the site and the history of site uses in 2002 congress enacted an important clarification of the meaning of all appropr iate inquiry the other prerequisite is that the landowner continued after acquisition to exercise due care took precautions against foreseeable acts of the third party etc the second innocent landowner mech anism makes current landowner identified by epa as potentially liable eligible for minimis settlement with the agency minimis settlement enables landowner to settle early with epa and thereby avoid protracted expensive negotiations with the agency and myriad of other liable parties over the allocation of liability at the site eligibility requires among other things that ll appropriate inquiry was done by the owner prior to acquisition this mechanism has not been used often the third mechanism aims not to exempt landowner from liability but to limit that liability prior to purchase its origin lies in the belief that superfund liability may chill investment in real property that is known or feared to be contaminated brownfields in 1989 epa offered in very limited circumstances to enter into prospective purchaser agreements negotiated settlements with wouldbe purchasers of land by which epa covenanted not to sue congressional desire for less resourceintensive met hod of encouraging redevel opment of brownfields led to its creation in 2002 of new exem ption from liability for the bona fide prospective purchaser eligibility requires that the person not impede the site cleanup made all appr opriate inquiry etc some have urged that buyers of contaminated land pursue both prospective purchaser agreements with epa and bona fide prospective purchaser status but epa guidance states that the availability of the former is limited nowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31911contents i innocent landowner status as defense to liability 2 ii innocent landowner status as enabling minimis settlement 5 iii

costs2 at the same time certain owners of facilities that were already contaminated when acquired can take advantage of mechanisms in the act that eliminate or contain this liability or reduce

prospective purchaser concept and is intended to encourage the purchase and rede velopment of sites that are known at the time of acquisition to be contaminated part iii the stimulus for this report is the january 11 2002 enactment of the small business liability relief and brownfields revitalization act sba4 the sba amended cercla to clarify who is eligible for innocent landowner status as defense to liability and to codify from epa guidance bona fide prospective purchaser defense to liability another landowner status newl codified from epa guidance by the sba the contiguous property owner is not covered by this reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31911crs2 5 pub law 96510 enacted dec 11 1980 6 cercla 107b3 42 usc 9607b3 7 id 8 pub law 99499 enacted oct 17 1986i innocent landowner status as defense to liability put most simply the innocent ndowner defense allows owners of contaminated property to escape cercla liability if the cont amination was placed on the property before acquisition and th landowner did not know or have reason to know at the time of acquisition of the contaminations presence as discussed below the landowner also has veral continuing obligations after the land is bought and contamination is discove red if he or she is to hold on to innocent landowner status the defense evolved over three enactme nts it began with the original superfund act in 19805 there congress created the acts basic liability scheme unchanged to this day as mentioned that scheme subjects the present owner of the facility to strict joint and several liability for cleanup and other costs one of the few defenses to this stringent liability scheme is the thirdparty defense available when the defendant can show by preponde rance of the evidence that the release or threat of release was caused solely by an act or omission of third party other than one whose act or omission occurs in c onnection with contractual relationship existing directly or indir ectly with the defendant 6 the thirdparty defense requires further that the defe ndant establish that hes he exercised due care as to the hazardous substance concerned and b took precautions agai nst foreseeable acts or omissions of the third party7 to the congress of 1980 the contractua l relationship exception to the third party defense must have ma perfect sense why should site owner escape cercla liability under the defense when the third party who caused the contamination was an entity with whom th owner had contractual dealings the potential for manipulation seemed obvious others pointed out however that the contractualrelationship excepti on might have an untoward result if the instruments of conveyance between seller and buyer of land were viewed as placing them in contractual relationship buyer whose pr operty had been contaminated solely by predecessor in the chain of title was in bind despite innocence the buyer could not invoke the thirdparty defense he or she remained liable under cercla as an owner of the property in 1986 amendments to cercla8 congress resolved the instruments of conveyance conundrum contr actual relationship the act now says does indeed include such instruments but with big exception in effect an exception to an exception the exception is for the landow ner who acquired the property after the hazardous substance was disposed of or placed there and httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31911crs3 9 cercla 10135 42 usc 960135 10 cercla 10135b 42 usc 960135 b as that provision read before amendment by the sba emphasis added 11 sba 223 amending cercla 10135b 12 epa is using negotiated rulemaking approach to developing the regulations under negotiated rulemaking approach persons and organizations with expertise or interest in an issue help to develop the proposed rule rather than the customary approach under which such entities merely submit comments on an epadrafted proposed rule at the time the landowner acqui red the facility heshe did not know and had reason to know that any hazardous substance which is the subject of the release or threatened release was disposed of on in or at the facility9 the 1986 amendments went on to explain to establish that defendant had reason to know heshe must have undertaken at the time of acquisition all appropriate inquiry into the previous ownership and uses of the property 10 the 1986 amendments thus answered one questi on when does contractual relationship include land contracts but they created another what does ll appropriate inquiry involve congress did include brief defi nition of all appropria inquiry in the 1986 amendments but just few years late r efforts began in congress to provide more detailed guidance these clarifying efforts culminated in 2002 in the sba the sba instructs epa to establish by regulation standards and practices that satisfy the all appropriate inquiry requirement the regulations required by january 11 2004 must include inquiry by an envir onmental professional interviews with past and presen t owners operators and occupants of the facility reviews of historical sources such as chain of title documents andaerial photographs and land use records searches for recorded environmental cleanup liens review of government records waste disposal records and hazardous waste records visual inspection of the facility specialized knowledge or experience on the part of the land acquirer the relationship of the purchase pri ce to the value of the property if uncontaminated reasonably ascertainable inform ation about the property and the obviousness of the property c ontaminati on and the ability to detect the contamination by appropriate investigation11 plainly these regulations when issued will be quantum leap beyond the existing cercla in the degree of guidance available to land purchasers12httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31911crs4 13 sba 223 amending cercla 10135b 14 this reasonable steps requirement raises some issues first it seems to overlap with already existing elements of the thirdparty defense namely the requirements that the defendant exercise due care as to the haza rdous substance and take precautions against foreseeable acts or omissions of the third party see page 2 second the reasonable steps appear as not ed in the text to be actions taken after the property is acquired since it is hard to imagine stopping release etc before one acquires the property but as the sba states it the reasonable steps must be taken to establish that the defendant had reason to know of the matter described in subparagraph ai which speaks to the defendants k nowledge at the time the defendant acquired the facility this is seeming contradictionnot all property owners will be subject to the new all ppropriate inquiry regulations the sba grandfathers pr operty purchased before may 31 1997 it need only comply with cerclas standards for all appropriate inquiry prior to the sba these less specific standards are specialized knowledge or experience on the part of the land acquirer the relationship of the purchase pri ce to the value of the property if uncontaminated reasonably ascertainable info rmation about the property the obviousness of the prope rty contamination and the ability to detect the contamination by appropriate inspection13 property purchased on or after may 31 1997 but before the new regulations are promulgated must satisfy american societ for testing and materials procedures including its document entitled standard practice for environmental site assessment phase 1 environmental s ite assessment process finally nongovernmental or noncommerc ial entities that buy property for residential or similar use need only do facility inspection and title search if they reveal basis for further investigation the sba adds further prerequisites fo r invoking the innocentlandowner defense relating to the fendants conduct after land purchase heshe must cooperate with those conducting the response action comply with any land use restrictions linked to the response action and not impede institutiona l controls further heshe must take reasonable steps to stop any continuing rel ease prevent any threat ened future release and prevent or limit human environmental or natural resource exposure to any previously released hazardous substance14 in sum the innocentlandowner defense to cercla liability is available on two multipart conditions both must be satisfied first the release must have been caused solely by third party lacking contractua l relationship direct or indirect with the defendant landowner lacks contractual relationship with predecessors in the chain of title if the disposal of the hazardous s ubstances on the site preceded acquisition and at time of land acquisition he she did not know and had reason to know that the hazardous substance had been disposed of th ere reason to know in turn means that before the date of ac quisition heshe made all appropriate inquiry as defined above second the landowner must have exerci sed due care and taken precautionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31911crs5 15 cercla 122g 42 usc 9622g 16 cercla 122g1 42 usc

controls further heshe must take r easonable steps to stop any continuing release prevent any threatened future release etc ii innocent landowner status as enabling minimis settlement at large contaminated sites the number of parties swept into the cercla liability net can be daunting occasionally in the hundreds to address this cercla requires epa when appropriate to enter into minimis settlements with certain liable parties whose blameworthine ss was deemed by congress to be minor15 minimis settlement enables party identified by epa as potentially liable to settle early with epa and thereby avoid protracted expensive negotiations with the agency and myriad of other liable parties over the allocation of liability at the site at the same time it allows the government to focus its resources on negotiations or litigation with the major parties one type of liable party eligible for minimis settlement is the innocent landowner when practicable and in the pub lic interest the agency is directed by cercla to settle promptly w ith landowner if the settle ment involves only minor portion of the response costs and the ndowner in the judgment of epa owns the land where the facility is located did not conduct or permit the ge neration transportation storage treatment or disposal of any zardous substance at the facility did not contribute to the release or the threat of release of hazardous substance through action or omission and did not buy the real property with actual or constructive knowledge that the property was used for th generation transportation storage treatment or disposal of any hazardous substance16 note the several terms eg in the j udgment of epa that give epa wide discretion as to whether to offer minimis settlements note also the absence of all appropriate inquiry and certain other prer equisites for innocentlandowner status as thirdparty defense notwithstanding epa guidance demands ll appropriate inquiry for minimis settlement eligibility as well17 the guidance document makes two step argument first it asserts that cerclas minimis settlement prerequisite that the landowner lack constructive knowledge is similar to the had reason to know language in cerclas innocentlandowne rasdefense provision second since had reason to know requires all appropriate inquiry the lackofconstructivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31911crs6 18 even if one accepts the epas argument query whether the recent enactment of the sba by expanding the components of all appropriate inquiry undermines the agencys view 19 cercla 122g2 42 usc 9622g2 20 cercla 122g4 42 usc 9622g4 model language for such judicial consent decrees or administrative orders on consent is provided in the aforementioned epa guidance as attachments i and ii 21 cercla 122g5 42 usc 9622g5 22 as amended by the sba cercla define s brownfields as real property the expansion redevelopment or reuse of wh ich may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of hazardous substance pollutant or contaminant cercla 10139 42 usc 960139knowledge prerequisite fo r settlement must be read to do the same18 indeed as general matter epas willingness to enter into minimis settlements with landowners is based on the likelihood the ndowner can successfully assert innocent landowner status as part of thirdparty defense other cercla provisions empower epa to include covenants not to sue in minimis settlements19 as cercla authorizes for other cercla settlements direct that such settlements be ente red as consent decrees or embodied in an administrative order presumably for more effective enforcement20 and immunize minimis settlors from contribution suits brought by other liable parties claiming that the minimis settlors got off too easy and should have to pay more21 historically epa has entered into fe w minimis settlement s with landowners iii prospective purchasers the prospect of cercla liability has long been thought to chill investment in real property that is known or feared to be contaminated the reason is plain enough purchaser of land as has been menti oned becomes potentially liable under cercla as an owner of the site for any response costs that may be necessary and when buyer of land knows or has reason to know of its contaminated condition at the time of purchase he or she does not qualify fo r use of either innocent landowner device parts i and ii in the current policy debate such know n or possibly contaminated sites are dubbed brownfields22 they often consist of aba ndoned i ndustrial sites in urban areas and encouraging private investme nt in them cleaning them up for redevelopment is goal with which fe w would argue but how to get around the cercla liability disincentive early on epa saw way if buyer could know the amount of hisher liability in advance of purchase an informed business decision c ould be made as to whether the purchase was attractive even with liability so epa in 1989 established policyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31911crs7 23 54 fed reg at 3424134243 24 guidance on settlements with purchasers of contaminated property may 24 1995 60 fed reg 34792 1995 also available at

contaminated its policy on the issuance of epa comfortstatus letters nov 12 1996 62 fed reg 4624 1997 explained the use of such letters to inform the prospective purchaser of the likelihood of epas comme ncing cercla enforcement action at the site based on known information about the cont amination there as with ppas purpose of comfort letters is to facilitate the cleanup and redevelopment of brownfield properties in contrast with ppas such letters are fo r informational purposes only they do not bind epa or provide release from cercla liability 25 cercla 107r1 42 usc 9607r1 26 bona fide

purchaser s of contaminated property23 offering in very limited circumstances to enter into prospective purchaser agreement ppa effectively settlement with the wouldbe purchaser by which epa covenants not to sue based on existing contamination at the site as authority epa cited its inherent enforcement discretion its criteria for ppas include d that 1 epa enforcement action was anticipated at the facility and 2 the purchaser agreed to make substantial monetary contribution to or conduct of the respons action where epas response costs would not otherwise be recoverable prospective purchasers of contaminated pr operty were slow to take advantage of the new ppa device so in 1995 epa issu ed superseding guidance to add flexibility to the agencys criteria for entering into ppas24 still only about 160170 were entered into from the 1989 guidance to 2002 for congress seeking to encourage redevelopment of brow nfields this number was too low as result the sba in 2002 inserted definition of bona fide prospective purchaser bfpp into cercla and gave them not merely eligibility for liability settlement but an outright exemption from liability 25 except for the potential windfall lie n noted below and in contrast with ppas which require the actuality or likelihood of epa forcement at the site and negotiated settlement with the buyer the new provisions are selfexecuting epa need not do anything once the parcel is bought the buyer becomes bfpp automatically as long as the statutory criteria are satisfied as epa put it the bfpp provisions represent significant change in cercla for the first time party may purchase prope rty with knowledge of contamination and not acquire liability under cercla as long as that party meets the bfpp criteria26 more specifically the sba exempts bfpps and their tenants from cercla owner or operator liability but not transporter or generator liability if the person does not impede the response action or natural resource restoration the exemption applies to any contaminated site not just those meeting the sba definition of brownfields bfpp is person w ho acquires ownership after sba enactment january 11 2002 and who shows among other things

and access to persons authorized to conduct response actions or natural resource restorations the person complies with pertinent land use restrictions and does not impede institutional controls and the person is not potentially liable fo r response costs at the facility or affiliated with anyone that is27 finally the sba gives the united states windfall lien on the property or the us may by agreement with the owner obtain other assurance of payment if the united states has unrecovered response costs and the response action increased the market value of the property28 issues remain however what constitutes reasonable steps third bullet above29 as for the amount of the windfa ll lien how does one compute the portion of the propertys value attributable to the response action these and other ambiguities in the bfpp criteria have prompted some in the regulated community to point out that lacking ppa the buyer of known or possi bly contaminated land takes chance that should epa ever contem plate enforcement at the site the agency may not agree with the owners assessment that he or she is titled to bfpp status for this reason these voices have urged that buyers of ch land consider making use of both ppa and the new bfpp exemption such twoprong strategy may have limited prospects unde r epas view as to the effect of the sbas bfpp provisions howev er recent agency memorandum states epa believes that in most cases the sba makes ppas from the federal government unnecessary30 to be sure the memo randum does indicate that even after sba enactment epa is willing to consider ppas or some other agreement prior to land acquisition if the public interest is served but it repeatedly characterizes thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31911crs9 31 id 32 bromm memorandum supra note 29 attachment b 33 id attachment cqualifying circumstances as limited or unusual thus in given case buyer of possibly contaminated land may have only bfpp status as realistic option as recited in the epa memorandum31 the circumstances when ppa or some other preacquisition agreement still may be considered by the agency are first where there is likely to be significant windfall lien and the purchaser needs to resolve the lien prior to purchasing the propert eg to secure financing in this circumstance the agreement with the buyer might only settle the lien claim nothing more so far epa has entered into two of these agreements such an agreement would not be ppa since it would not cont ain covenant by epa not to sue practical obstacle to use of lienresolution agreements of course is the difficulty of knowing the precise amount of the unrecovere d government cleanup costs at site in advance of cleanup completion in contrast to lienresolution agreem ents ppas are contemplated by the memorandum when necessary to ensure that the transaction will be completed and the project will provide substantia l public benefits to for example the environment local community because of jobs created or re vitalization of long blighted underutilized property or promotion of nvironmental justice such circumstances might arise when significant environmental benef its will be derived from the project and there is significant need for ppa to accomplish the projects goals b the facility is currently involved in cercla litigation such that the party who buys the facility might be sued by third party and c there are unique sitespecific circumstances not otherwise addresse d above when significant public interest would be served by the transaction to reiterate howev er the memorandum frequently characterizes these categories as narrow to be sure while prospects for twopr ong strategy by contaminatedland buyers may be uncertain the need for pursuing ppa even when one appears to be bfpp may have lessened recently recall that one reason for seeking the certainty of ppa was the ambiguity of the sba phrase reasonable steps epa guidance issued march 6 2003 may have reduced somewhat the evident confusion over the meaning of reasonable steps32 in addition buyer uncertainty ma be alleviated further by epas issuance of nonbinding comfort letter in cases where epa has enough information about the site to make suggestions as to what reasonable steps might be33 on the other hand the same epa guidance repeated ly and necessarily insists that the determination of reasonable st eps be sitespecific f actbased inquiry thus buyer of land even with the guidance simply cannot have total cer tainty that epa will see things as the buyer does should the agen cy eventually initiate enforcement action
