oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa has surveyed the coastline of the continental united states alaska and hawaii several times the current figures for the coastline are the results of the measurements done originally in 1915 and updated several times thereafter these figures reflect the general outline of the seacoast the figures for alaska reflect 1961 remeasurement it is important to note that boundary and coastline distances can differ significantly based on the scale used on the maps or charts the canadian and mexican international borders are less problematic than the coastline measures because there are long stretches that are straight such as the nearly 900mile section of the uscanadian border along the 49th parallel coastline measurements are more difficult because of the effects of tides and the necessarily arbitrary decisions that must be made about measuring bays coves islands and inlets leading to streams and rivers the general coastline data in this report are based on large scale nautical charts resulting in coastline measure for the 50 states totaling12383 miles another measure using smaller scale nautical charts more than doubles this measurement to 29093 miles while the figures used by the noaa in administering the coastal zone management program 16 usc 1451 come to 88612 miles not including the great lakes table 3 provides figures for the areas
