legislative officers established by the us constitution the other two are the speaker of the house of representatives and the vice president of the united states who also serves as president of the senate the constitution designates the president pro tempore to serve in the vice presidents absence the president pro tempore is often popularly known as the president pro tem the role of the president pro tempore has evolved since john langdon of new hampshire first took the chair on april 6 1789 in the absence of vice president john adams1 once only temporary standins for the vice president contemporary presidents pro tempore now effectively serve as long as their party holds majority in the senate by virtue of the succession act of 1792 the president pro tempore stood second in the line of presidential succession after the vice president for nearly century the succession act of 1886 removed the president pro tempore as successor with the passage of the presidential succession act of 1947 the president pro tempore was restored to the line of succession this time following the vice president and the speaker of the house at one time presidents pro tempore appointed committee members and wielded considerable power within the senate but are now more limited in their independent authority perhaps the greatest change in the office came in 1890 when the senate decided that presidents pro tempore would hold the office continuously until the election of successor regardless of whether the vice president was present or absent since that time the office has been customarily occupied by the most senior senator of the majority party although the offices practical authority has diminished it remains powerfully symbolic of the dignity of the united states senate as one noted historian of the senate has written election of senator to the office of the president pro tempore has always been considered one of the highest honors offered to senator by the senate as body2 1 john langdon was first elected president pro tempore on april 6 1789 for the purpose of counting the electoral vote ballots for president and vice president technically he did not

3 of the united states constitution declares that the senate shall choose their other officers and also president pro tempore in the absence of the vice president or when he shall exercise the office of president of the united states aside from the vice presidents designation as president of the senate the president pro tempore is the only position in the senate explicitly established by the constitution after sufficient number of senators arrived to constitute quorum for the first congress on april 6 1789 the credentials of those present were approved and ordered filed next the chamber selected president of the senate for the sole purpose of opening and counting the votes for president of the united states8 john langdon of new hampshire was elected and performed this task after the election of john adams as vice president the senate immediately proceeded by ballot to the choice of president of their body pro tempore because adams had not yet arrived to assume his duties as president of the senate9 again langdon was chosen this time to preside over the senate and he continued to do so until vice president adams appeared in the chamber on april 21 1789 when vice president adams took the chair langdons service as president pro tempore came to an end langdon was reelected to the office on august 7 1789 when adams was again absent10 tenure for more than century the senate acted upon the theory that president pro tempore could be chosen only in the absence of the vice president and that the tenure of president pro tempore expired when the vice president resumed his

president pro tempore each time the vice president was absent at the beginning of daily session between april 1789 and march 1890 the senate elected presidents pro tempore on fewer than 166 occasions record 10 such elections were held during the 42nd congress during the period from april 1789 to march 1890 presidents pro tempore usually served more than few consecutive days before the vice president returned to displace them few men however did enjoy relatively long uninterrupted tenures because of the death extended illness or chronic absenteeism of some vice presidents or because of vice presidential vacancy following the death of president between 1811 and 1825 for example john gaillard of south carolina and to lesser degree james barbour of virginia served as presidents pro tempore for considerable periods due to the deaths of two vice presidents and the absenteeism of third two different senators were president pro tempore for nearly four years after vice president john tyler assumed the presidency in march 1841 following william henry harrisons death one month after his inauguration as chief executive samuel l southard of new jersey occupied the chair for the remainder of 1841 and the first five months of 1842 when willie p mangum of north carolina was chosen president pro tempore mangum served until the inauguration of the next vice president george m dallas on march 3 1845 similarly william r king of alabama served extensively in the chair during the late 1830s and early 1840s by virtue of his election as president pro tempore on nine consecutive occasions between july 1836 and march 1841 king also held the position continuously from mid1850 through late 1852 after vice president millard fillmore succeeded to the presidency upon president zachary taylors death senator benjamin f wade of ohio also enjoyed long term as president pro tempore after andrew johnson became president following president abraham lincolns assassination as did senator john sherman of ohio and subsequently john j ingalls of kansas following vice president thomas hendricks death in 188512 by the late 19th century the senates workload had grown dramatically and the political parties had increasingly assumed responsibility for organizing the work of the chamber and controlling debate on the floor13 the role of the presiding officer was consequently diminished moreover questions had arisen over the years about the election of the president pro tempore for example is the president pro tempore of the senate an officer of the senate and does the death of the vice president after the election of president pro tempore have the effect of vacating the office of the president pro tempore and requiring new election these questions were raised in 11 continued washington gpo 1893 p 176 12 until the 20th century there was seniority system in the senate of the senators elected president pro tempore between 1870 and 1900 only two ranked first in their party senators instead tended to elect men who were distinguished popular and familiar with parliamentary law gamm and smith last among equals p 4 13 ibid p 15 crs5 concrete form following the death in november 1875 of vice president henry wilson who was considered highly efficient and acceptable presiding officer14 in january 1876 report by the committee on privileges and elections responded to these and other questions involving the character and tenureof the president pro tempore15 after debate on the committees report the senate adopted several clarifying resolutions first it determined that the tenure of president pro tempore elected at one session would continue without interruption through recess and into the next session until the vice president appeared second it decided that the death of vice president did not automatically vacate the office of the president pro tempore if one had been properly chosen third the senate affirmed its authority to replace president pro tempore whenever it pleased16 these questions were of more than internal senate interest throughout this period since the president pro tempore followed the vice president in the order of succession to the presidency the succession act of 1792 provided that if both the president and vice president were to die or otherwise become unable to exercise the powers of the presidency at time when the senate was officially absent from the nations capital and if that body had not chosen president pro tempore to hold the office during the recess then the speaker of the house under the law would act as president of the united states 17 considering the transportation available in those days it might take weeks before enough senators could reassemble and choose new president pro tempore prudence therefore required that the senate should elect someone to hold that office during the recesses between sessions of congress because the senate at the time acted upon the theory that it could not choose president pro tempore while the vice president was present it quickly became the custom after 1792 for the latter to withdraw from the chamber shortly before the end of session so that senators might legally elect one of their own to the position18 further historian george h haynes notes 14 george henry haynes henry wilson in dictionary of american biography 10 vols new york

states if the necessity should arise precedent set by john adams and scrupulously followed by jefferson and burr was established whereby the vicepresident would absent himself out of courtesy not necessity as senator evarts insisted day or so before the end of the session to afford the senate an opportunity to elect president pro tempore who should hold office during the recess19 such withdrawals as noted were matters of courtesy rather than law and while most vice presidents adhered to the custom few inevitably did not usually because of critical political circumstances20 when both the president pro tempore and the speaker of the house were removed from the line of succession by the succession act of january 19 1886 the necessity for such maneuvers was eliminated21 four years later the senate resolved the question of the president pro tempores tenure when it adopted resolution originally introduced by senator william m evarts of new york as adopted by the senate on march 12 1890 the resolution read resolved that it is competent for the senate to elect president pro tempore who shall hold the office during the pleasure of the senate and until another is elected and shall execute the duties thereof during all future absences of the vicepresident until the senate otherwise order22 that resolution is still in effect under its terms president pro tempore once elected holds the post continuously whether or not the vice president is absent although of course he may not preside over the senate unless the vice president steps down from the chair the tenure of the president pro tempore ends upon the expiration of the term for which he was elected senator precedent dating back to at least 1841 he may of course resign or the senate may elect another in his stead at its pleasure 19 haynes the senate of the united states vol 1 p 256 20 for example vice president elbridge gerry refused to vacate the chair in 1813 when president james madison was seriously ill and the administrations adversaries controlled the senate similarly vice president george m dallas refused to retire at the end of the special session of 1845 furber precedents relating to the privileges of the senate p 179 in mar 1881 the casting vote of the vicepresident was necessary to secure for the republicans the organization of the senate under those circumstances their ability to elect president pro tempore was so uncertain that vicepresident chester arthur like vice president gerry in 1813 sat the session out and congress adjourned may 20 with one beyond the vice president in the line of succession four years later vicepresident thomas hendricks continued to occupy the chair till the end of the short session apr 2 thus preventing the republicans then in majority from

presidential succession act of 1947 restored the president pro tempore to the line of succession placing him after the vice president and speaker of the house and ahead of the cabinet23 but neither the 1947 act nor the 25th amendment to the constitution which further clarifies the rule of presidential succession has any impact on the tenure of the president pro tempore in his relationship to the senate as the chambers presiding officer election to the office the usual practice of the senate has been to elect as its president pro tempore candidate of the majority party almost invariably by party line vote most often that person has continued to serve in the post so long as his party remains in the majority on few occasions the majority party has experienced difficulty in electing its candidate late in 1881 for example democrats in the senate refused to permit administration of the oath of office to several republicans waiting to be sworn in as senators as result of this the democrats maintained narrow majority of the votes in the chamber and proceeded to elect one of their own delawares thomas f bayard as president pro tempore even after the missing republicans had been installed the senate remained equally divided between the two major parties an arrangement was eventually agreed upon and an independent senator david davis of illinois was elected to replace bayard as president pro tempore24 when the 62nd congress convened in 1911 republicans held nominal majority of seats in the senate faction of seven progressive republicans however refused to vote for the regular republican candidate for president pro tempore and their defection prevented election of presiding officer while neither the constitution nor the rules of the senate explicitly exclude election of president pro tempore by plurality the practice of the senate has been to assume that majority vote is required one observer noted after fifteen ballots distributed through five days compromise became necessary to enable business to go forward upon motion of republican leader democrat was unanimously elected president pro tempore for single day and thereafter for the rest of the session ending august 26 1912 presidents pro tempore were elected for brief designated periods senator augustus bacon democrat alternating with four republicans some of whom served for but single day in the short session which ended that sixtysecond congress this alternating arrangement was continued augustus bacon democrat and jacob gallinger republican each serving fortnight at time25 23 61 stat

13 presidents pro tempore who have served since 1945 only one has not been the most senior senator in his party senator arthur vandenberg of michigan was the second ranking republican in the senate at the time of his election in 194726 prior to 1945 while the parties had for the most part tended to put forward men with long senatorial service as candidates for president pro tempore there were some notable exceptions senator george h moses of new hampshire ranked only 15th among senate republicans when he was elected president pro tempore in 1925 and senator albert b cummins of iowa ranked 12th when he was first chosen in 1919 in 1846 senator david r atchison of missouri was elected president pro tempore before he had completed half his first term as senator and senator willard saulsbury of delaware was also still in his first term when the senate elevated him to the post on december 14 1916 even during the 19th century the senate sometimes elected presidents pro tempore from among the longest serving members of the senate men like senators william p frye of maine john j ingalls of kansas allen g thurman of ohio and henry b anthony of rhode island held significant seniority when elected president pro tempore that tradition continued and evolved in the 20th century with the exceptions noted above by the middle of the 20th century the senate routinely elected as its president pro tempore the most senior senator of the majority party senator strom thurmond of south carolina is one of two senators in the post war era to serve at least three nonconsecutive terms as president pro tem he first served from 1981 to 1987 and then was elected again at the beginning of the104th congress in 1995 following the interim election of senator robert c byrd of west virginia the most senior democrat to serve at the start of the 107th congress from january 3 2001 to january 20 2001 senator thurmond was again elected as president pro tempore to serve beginning at noon on january 20 2001 the president pro tempore during the 108th and 109th congresses was senator ted stevens of alaska he succeeded senator thurmond who retired from the senate at the end of the 107th congress senator stevens serves as president pro tem emeritus in the 110th congress senator robert c byrd the only senator in the modern era to serve four non consecutive terms was first elected president pro tempore in 1989 and served until 1995 he again served from january 3 2001 to january 20 2001 senator byrd was again elected president pro tempore in the 107th congress on june 6 2001 after 26 arthur capper of kansas was the senior republican senator in 1947 arthur vandenberg however had been his partys choice for president pro tempore for several congresses before the republicans ascended to the majority in 1947 he was considered by party leaders more in the partys mainstream than capper and capper himself was in poor health interview with donald ritchie associate historian senate historical

fourth nonconsecutive term when he was elected president pro tem by his colleagues on january 4 2007 at the beginning 110th congress salary in 1816 congress for the first time accorded the president pro tempore larger salary than that allotted to other senators but only when the office of vice president was vacant27 in 1818 the law was amended so that the president pro tempore would receive additional compensation for each day he presided over the senate whether the office of vice president was vacant or the vice president was absent28 in 1845 and again in 1854 when the office of the vice president was vacant the senate in each case adopted resolution authorizing compensation for the president pro tempore that was equal to that established by law for the vice president29 the practice of compensating presidents pro tempore at the same rate as the vice president when the vice presidency is vacant was confirmed in law on august 16 185630 in 1969 the salary of the president pro tempore was fixed at the same level as that of the majority and minority leaders of both houses31 when vacancy exists in the office of the vice president the president pro tempore receives the salary provided the vice president32 power authority and responsibilities of the president pro tempore the president pro tempore lacks the formal institutional and political powers of the speaker of the house the congressional officer to whom he is often compared nor does he have the stature and authority of the major party leaders in the senate especially the majority and minority floor leaders nevertheless the constitution public law the chambers rules and precedents and senate customs provide the president pro tempore significant role to play in the life of the senate power and authority as presiding officer for about 10 years from late 1823 to late 1833 presidents pro tempore enjoyed the privilege of appointing the membership of the senates standing committees at 27 3 stat 257 28 3

senators to committees in 1838 1843 and 186335 as presiding officer the powers and prerogatives of the president pro tempore historically have differed little from those of the vice president one notable exception involves the privilege of appointing substitute to perform the duties of the chair from 1820 until 1883 the senate operated under rule stating in part that the presiding officer shall have the right to name senator to perform the duties of the chair but such substitution shall not extend beyond an adjournment36 that rule was subsequently amended to restrict the privilege solely to the president pro tempore37 moreover the senate had many times previously honored the request of president pro tempore that another senator take his place for day or longer while denying the same privilege to the vice president38 in 1902 the rules were further amended to empower the president pro tempore to designate senator to perform the duties of the chair for an unspecified time during vacancy in the office of vice president39 usually the president pro tempore designates members of his own party to replace him in the chair but not always in 33 furber precedents relating to

the vice president may cast vote in the senate only when the body is equally divided41 the question of whether president pro tempore retained his vote while he was performing the duties of his office was clarified by senate resolution adopted on april 19 1792 which declared that he retained his right to vote upon all questions42 in the modern senate with the exception of his authority to appoint other senators to preside the president pro tempores powers as presiding officer differ little from those of the vicepresident or any other senator who presides over the senate these powers include the authority to recognize senators desiring to speak introduce bills or offer amendments and motions to bills being debated the presiding officers power of recognition is much more limited than that of the house speaker or whomever presides in the house in the senate the presiding officer is required by rule xix to recognize the first senator on his feet and seeking recognition43 by tradition

was not included in the order of succession which at first extended only as far as the vice president the succession act of 1792 designated after the vice president the president pro tempore and the speaker of the house in that order45 later statute the succession act of 1886 transferred succession after the vice president from the president pro tempore and the speaker to the cabinet officers in the chronological order in which their departments had been created46 with the passage of the succession act of 1947 the president pro tempore was restored as successor to the presidency after the vice president and speaker of the house47 although ratification of the 25th amendment in 1967 did not supplant the order of succession established by the presidential succession act of 1947 it empowered the president to nominate vice president whenever that office is vacant and rendered it unlikely that the president pro tempore would become president except in the event of an unprecedented national catastrophe48 other duties and responsibilities over the years other powers have also accrued to the president pro tempore many of these are formal or ministerial decisions are first made by

held the patronage book as it was called and had considerable influence in the distribution of patronage for positions that today are filled by professional staff carl hayden of arizona who served as president pro tempore from 1957 to 1969 was the last president pro tempore to exercise this authority61 finally in his history of the senate senator robert c byrd of west virginia who has served as president pro tempore four times since 1989 notes that because the president pro tempore stands in the line of presidential succession he is given directaccess telephone to the white house and would receive special evacuation assistance from washington in the case of national emergency62 political influence of the office senator arthur vandenberg who held the position from 1947 to 1949 was seen as one of the few presidents pro tempore up to that time who exerted significant political influence floyd m riddick scholar of congressional procedure who later became senate parliamentarian wrote in 1949 that vandenberg who chaired the senate foreign relations committee while serving as president pro tempore took quite an important part in the legislative program and doubt exerted as much 58 50

vandenberg riddick emphasized was firm in his rulings of which all but one or two stood as the decision of the senate even though several appeals were taken he participated in discussions of the pending legislation from the chair perhaps to an unprecedented extent during any congress of recent years 64 more recently senator richard russell of georgia despite being hospitalized for much of his term as president pro tempore 19691971 was seen as wielding power potentially equal to that of vandenberg through his chairmanships of the appropriations committee and its defense appropriations subcommittee65 today the degree of political influence exerted by the president pro tempore depends more on other factors in conjunction with senators position as president pro tempore than solely on election to that office the most important of these are senators position as senior member of his party and as committee chairman as the most senior senator of the majority party his chairmanship is likely to be significant for example during the years he was president pro tempore for the first time 19891995 senator byrd was also chairman of the appropriations committee when the senate switched from republican to democratic control on june 6 2001 senator byrd was elected president pro tempore and returned to chair the appropriations committee as president pro tempore senator thurmond chaired the judiciary committee from 1981 to 1987 and from 1995 to 1999 the armed services committee66 during his tenure as president pro tem during the 108th and 109th congresses senator ted stevens chaired the committee on appropriations and the committee on commerce science and transportation respectively as senator byrd has remarked because of his position as senior member of the party and often the chairman of key committee the leadership regularly consults the president pro tempore as to his views on policies and actions of the party67 republicans as well as democrats consider the president pro tempore an ex officio member of the party leadership including the respective caucus and conference policy committees and steering committees in these capacities the president pro tempore may work closely with the party floor leader 63 floyd m riddick the united states congress organization and procedure washington national capitol publishing co 1949 p 67 64 ibid 65 congressional quarterlys

subsequently in series of resolutions introduced by mansfield beginning in june 1963 senator lee w metcalf of montana was named acting president pro tempore76 before his designation metcalf was one of regular group of senators serving in rotation as presiding officer mansfield chose metcalf for several reasons metcalf was relatively young and vigorous he lived in an apartment across the street from the senate and could be called quickly to preside over late night sessions as mansfields junior colleague from montana he was trustworthy and unlikely to rule against the majority floor leader77 on
