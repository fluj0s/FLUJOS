6312c10 shspec328 scientology 0 it works out this way having completed scientology research all the way to the top lrh has had to undercut it all to find new series of processes and new processing theory on which to build the edifice that is quite trick knowing the upper strata only makes it harder to build the lower strata because you see it so clearly that it is hard to see how someone else lacking your knowledge could miss it you can know exactly what is wrong with somebody but if he knows differently you cant get him to see your solution or your view of the problem lrh finally has scientology 0 to undercut scientology i it was description of the environment and what is wrong with it it has nothing to do with the persons mind at all scientology i is the isness of things and it takes care of the mind as well but scientology 0 takes care of the environment it is summable up as the dangerous environment that sums up 1 what you are talking about 2 the frame of mind of the person talking with you look around and find something that isnt threatening you or pushing ptp on you or trying to exteriorize you this will help to pull your attention out of the threatening environment it allows differentiation to come about instead of identification many people are professional dangerous environment makers the chaos merchants push dangerous environments on people in sensationalized form this includes politicians newspapermen policemen etc they spread confusion and upset and breed fear of the environment this is the same thing that blackmailer or an extortionist does they make the environment seem more dangerous than it is they sell the dangerous environment 100 the avidity of their sell can be used by the scientologist by means of sort of thetajudo practiced on them understanding scientology 0 includes understanding how to use the enemies of scientology the chaos merchants toynbee working out of libraries came to tremendous understanding of life he says that the reason that the mexican for example does not succeed is that he has insufficient challenge in his environment toynbee has obviously never talked to any mexicans it is myth that primitive peoples get apathetic because of insufficient challenge in the environment the challenge of the environment is actually overwhelming to downtrodden peoples primitive peoples etc the environment is too dangerous for fellow to have ambition this is actually true of anyone who lives on earth the individual on this planet if he has not been able to achieve his destiny is in an environment that he finds overwhelming his methods of dealing with it are inadequate and his existence is as apathetic or as unhappy as his environment seems to him to be overwhelming get those principles down and you will have scientology 0 lot of people spend their time worrying the people around them to death they spread confusion and upset while wondering why their victims dont get ahead these are smallscale chaos merchants compared with newspapers but they are more intimate doctors get paid not by the number of people who are well but by the number who are sick the police would go broke if the prisons didnt make more and better criminals police chiefs would be unimportant if they had few police under them newspaper reporters dream of big story meaning good disaster the environment is never as dangerous as it is made to appear solution to the threat of nuclear war could undoubtedly be found especially if there were profit in it but anything that tends to make calmer environment meets and makes ridge with anything that has vested interested in the fact and idea of threatening environment the expansion of scientology will lessen the amount of fear it will lower the stress perceived by people as emanating from the environment scientology would make for calmer environment it would not be less interesting environment but calmer one one that is in less turmoil this could permit resurgence of the individual because he would be less enturbulated you would get beneficial spiral where the threat of the environment would be dying out the chaos merchant doesnt like calming influences they threaten his livelihood and survival on an individual level domestic chaos merchant gets upset when his or her victim gets calmer with exposure to scientology it is very disconcerting to chaos merchant to be met with humor instead of seriousness the true story of scientology is simple phd develops philosophy people find it interesting people find that it works people pass it along to others it grows that is what the newspapers are trying to make story out of from their viewpoint there is story because there is conflict you can amplify the story and get some statistics but anything else is distortion and lies added on to make the story disturbing and sensational but all disturbance folds up in the face of truth in universe kept going and continually disturbed by lies all the basic facts have been covered up particularly those relating to life and death many contrary data have existed fundamental questions belong in philosophy but philosophy has become so decadent that it is longer source of truth it is at best limited truth and in going for truth you have to go all the way see 6211c01 shspec207 the road to truth pp 325329 above the clean blade of truth cannot be stopped but if you talk truth you had better have your hands on it socrates talked truth but didnt have good enough grip on it when you start to introduce scientology to anyone the first target would be the environment not the persons mind you could dream up processes based on the assumption that the person believes that the environment is too dangerous for him any relatively sane person will agree with you on that we know that it is being made to seem more dangerous than it is this is key point of scientology 0 so the person could be brought to perceive that this is so by his own perception it is also key point that the persons 1 health 2 sanity 3 activity level and 4 ambition are monitored by his concept of the dangerousness of the environment from these factors we can draw up an improvement program for any person we can therefore improve these things in the individual without reference to his mind we have dealt with this before under the heading of controlling environmental restimulation we know that to handle his problems terminatedly we will have to handle the mind nevertheless we can get very marked and noticeable gains and improvements by handling his environment since we know that most of the threat that he is worried about is imaginary the therapy could be as simple as dont read the newspaper for two weeks and see if you dont feel better at the end of two weeks have him read the newspapers for week get him to see whether he then feels better or worse so that he can decide if he gets too upset or confused tell him to look around the environment and find something that isnt threat to him good havingness process at scientology 0 is finding out what is threat to person and running it as negative havingness process this is actually very sophisticated it could be used at upper levels run against some particular fear it is an improved version of take walk and look at things this is positive education the reason take walk look it over works is that the individual sees that the environment isnt threatening him to the degree that he thought it was when he has inspected it so you could use process like look around you and find something that isnt going to fall on you at scientology 0 you are trying to get the individual to inspect the environment and find some greater security in it the general auditing approach would be look around you and find out if the environment is as threatening as it appears to be but each person would have to be handled individually you could get person to look at the papers on his desk that are threatening him and find something in them that isnt threat that is taking walk while he is sitting at his desk for person who feels that everyone is hostile to him you could use find something that people say or do around here that isnt hostile to you or find one person in the organization that isnt actively hostile to you or was there anything said today that wasnt immediately and directly hostile to you this could also be played in the direction of exaggeration but then it goes up to higher level in mental direction get the idea of chinese in every corner shooting at you with cong hatchets you could use look around here and find something that isnt trying to exteriorize you etc all this runs on the single auditing command look there is effort to get any itsa about it almost any inspection of the environment is helpful except negative one if the pc has secondary if he has lost an individual in an environment where he has been with the person lot eg in love affair you can use look around here and find something that isnt reminding you of the exlover the mechanism here is that the person has identified everything in the environment with his unrest everything in the environment has become identified with the threatening things in the environment the persons charge on the environment can be destimulated by indicating things that are not so threatening thus getting person to differentiate when identification becomes differentiation intelligence and judgment can return an interesting commentary on the character of man lies in the fact that if you really want to interest people at lecture or pe course you should give them something that they can use to help others rather than something that will help themselves man is basically good and this is proof therefore your supplementary advice should always go on the basis of who are you trying to help to discover that the environment is less dangerous than it seems you had better understand the data well enough so that you can give it to him well enough so that he can use it and see result and then use it on himself if you do this right you will often get the cycle 1 the person finds out something to help pete 2 it works on pete 3 he decides to try to use it to help himself take walk and look at things is about the mildest advice you could give someone it would be quite effective if he actually did it lrh did this and found that by putting tension on the beam with which he was looking at things he could pull himself forward without having to walk this got intriguing he went skimming his heels on the pavement until he noticed cop looking at him the master question is what part of the environment isnt threatening this question gets the person to differentiate you can also get him to arrange his life little if you can get person to just plan life in which everything is calmer and less threatening the life he is living becomes calmer and less threatening when you move this up into scientology i and introduce communication factors and show the person how to communicate with people he will find that he can produce an effect on people and that people are less threatening if you keep havingness in mind as you go up the levels you never lose the benefit of having the environment being less threatening which you started at scientology 0 all people are trying to 1 get out of the environment or 2 master the environment if they cant escape any thetan has these intentions and has had them all the way up the universe these are the only totally common ptps of an environment the individual would also like to find something to help his friends what you need is level of help that requires practically education at all this would become real to the individual just the concept that he considers the environment dangerous and would like to find the source of threat is an enormous piece of wisdom to him since before you identified it for him he was being it if you provide therapy by telling him to stay away from the things and people etc that upset him and find and associate with the things that arent threat he will make amazing progress this pushes whole new philosophy under the structure of scientology
