groups in southeast asia particul arly those in the philippines indonesia malaysia thailand nd singapore that are known to have ties to the qaeda terrorist network southeast asia is base for past current and possibly future qaeda operations for nearly fifteen years qaeda has penetrated the region by establishing local cells training southeast asians in its camps in afghanistan and by financing and cooperatin g with indigenous radical islamist groups indonesia and the southern philippines have been part icularly vulnerable to penetration by antiamerican islamic terrorist groups members of one indigenous network jemaah islamiyah ji with extensive ties to qaeda are known to have helped two of the september 11 2001 hijackers and have confessed to plotting and carrying out attacks against western targets these include the deadliest terrorist attack since september 2001 the october 12 2002 bombing in bali indonesia that killed approximately 200 people mostly westerners on september 9 2004 suicide bombing attack thought to be the work of ji struck the australian embassy in jakarta k illing 10 and wounding around 200 in october 2005 three suicide bombers exploded bombs w ithin minutes of one another in bali killing more than 20 people these attacks suggest that ji remains capable of carrying out relatively largescale plots against western targets despite the arrest or death of hundreds of ji members including most of its known leadership to combat the threat the bush adminis tration has pressed countries in the region to arrest suspected terrorist individuals and organizations deployed over 1000 troops to the southern philippines to advi the philippine military in their fight against the violent abu sayyaf group launched regional maritime security initiative

generally have varied with the intensity of their concerns about the threat to their own stability and domestic politics in general singapore malaysia and the philippines were quick to crack down on militant groups and share intelligence with the united states and australia whereas i ndonesia began to do so only after attacks or arrests revealed the severity of the threat to their citizens that said many governments view increased american pressure and military presence in their region with ambivalence because of the politi cal sensitivity of the issue with both mainstream islamic and s

official floated the idea of taking military action against terrorist targets in southeast asia as surprise alternative to attacking afghanistan the 911 commission report final report of the national

daljit singhthe terrorist threat in southeast asia regional outlook 20032004overview since the september 11 2001 terrorist att acks the united states has considered southeast asia to be second front in its global campaign against islamist terrorism4 us attention in the region has been focused on radical islamist groups in southeast asia particularly the jemaah islamiyah terrorist network that are known or alleged to ve ties to the qaeda networ k as detailed in the narrative section of the final report of the na tional commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states known as the 911 co mmission among other sources many of these groups threaten the status quo of th region by seeking to create independent islamic states in majoritymuslim areas overthrow existing secular governments andor establish new s upranational islamic stat encompassing indonesia malaysia singapore the southern philippines and southern thailand5 in pursuit of these objectives they have planned and carried out violent attacks against civilian and nonciv ilian targets including american and other western institutions additionally qaeda has used its southeast asia cells to help organize and finance its global activities including the september 11 attacks and to provide safe harbor to qaeda operatives such as the convicted organizer of the 1993 bombing of the world trade center ramzi yousef combating antiamerican terrorism in southeast asia presents the bush administration and congress with delicat foreign policy problem most regional governments also feel threatened by homegrown or importe d islamic militant groups and therefore have ample incentive to coope rate with the us antiterrorist campaign despite mutual interests in combating terrorism southeast asian governments have to balance these security concerns with domestic political considerations although proponents of violent radical islam remain very small minority in southeast asia many governments view increased american pressure and military presence in their region with ambivalence because of the political sens itivity of the issue with both mainstream islamic and s ecular nationalist groups the rise in antiamerican sentiment propelled by both the usled invasion and occupation of iraq and many southeast asian muslims perceptions of am ericas stance on the israelipalestinian conflict as blatantly proisrael6 makes it even more difficult for most governments to countenance an overt us role in their in ternal security the challenge is to find way to confront the terrorist elements without turning them into heroes or martyrs in the broader southeast as ian islamic community furthermore the continued activities of qaeda and jemaah islamiyah will require coordinated international response in region where multinational institutions and cooperation are weakhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31672crs3 on december 17 2004 congressional legisla tion that seeks to address the war against terrorism in ways that would affect its prosecution in southeast asia became public law 108458 the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 108458 addresses number of issues identified by the 911 commission report including the need to identify and eliminate terrorist sanctuaries to increase engagement between america and muslim peoples to support public education in muslim states to foster scholastic exchange with muslim states to promote economic policies to encourage development of open societies to engage foreign governments in developing comprehensive multilateral strategy to fight terrorism and to track terrorist fina ncing among other provisions background the rise of islamic militancy and terrorism in southeast asia southeast asia has been the home of indigenous islamic militant groups for decades traditionally the linkages among these groups were relatively weak and most operated only in their own country or islands focusing on domestic issues such as promoting the adoption of islamic law sharia and seeking independence from central government control the philippines has had violent muslim separatist movement for more than century the moros of mindanao and the sulu archipelago including the island of jo fought stubborn bloody and ultimately futile insurgency against the american occupation of the southern philippines following the spanish american war 1898 until recently however the activities of several muslim extr emist groups in the philippines had been confined mainly to the relatively isolated muslimmajority regions in the south in indonesia various schools of islamic thought have competed for followers and public attention but most have not called for an islamic state the more radical groups which had their roots in antidutch guerilla activities ffectively were kept in check by strong leadership from pr esidents sukarno 19501965 and especially suharto 19671998 moderate islamic groups formed the main legal opposition to the suharto regime which ended in ma 1998 since suhartos fall religious consciousness has been on the rise among indonesian muslims giving greater political space for radical groups and their violent fringe to operate at times openly in malaysia the late 1990s saw potentia lly significant electoral swing toward radical islamist party parti islam sem alaysia pas however pas suffered major setbacks in parliamentary elections in early 2004 the results appear to indicate that mainstream islam in malaysia has reasserted its moderate character prime minister abdullah badawi who is himself respected islamic scholar has demonstrated malaysias moderate islamic approach since replacing former prime minister maha thir mohammad the emergence of radical islamic moveme nts in southeast asia in the 1990s can be traced to the conjunction of several phenomena among these were reaction to globalization which has been particularly associated with the united states in the minds of regional elites frustration with repression by secularist governments the desire to create panislamic southeast asia reaction to the israeli occupation in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31672crs4 7 for more on qaeda see crs report

and the arrival of terrorist veterans of years of fighting in afghanistan the forging of connecti ons between qaeda and domestic radical islamic groups in southeast asia is part of this trend the rise of qaeda in southeast asia7 beginning in the earlytomid 1990s the qaeda terrorist network made significant inroads into the southeast as ia region qaedas southeast asian operatives who have been primarily of middle eastern origin appear to have performed three primary tasks first they set up local cells predominantly headed by arab members of qaeda that served as regional offices supporting the networks global operati ons these cells have explo ited the regions generally lax border controls to hold meetings in south east asia to plan attacks against western targets host operatives

to blow up 11 airliners in two day period what was known as the bojinka plan crash hijacked airliner into the central intelligence agencys headquarters and assassinate the pope during his visit to the philippines in early 1995 yousef was assisted in man ila for time by his uncle khalid sheikh mohammed the alleged mastermind of the september 11 2001 attacks8 in the late 1990s the locus of qaedas southeast asia activity appear s to have moved to malaysia singapore and most recen tly indonesia in 1999 and 2000 kuala lumpur and bangkok were the sites for impor tant strategy meetings among some

december 2001 over 250 suspected and admitted ji mbers including number of key leaders have been arrested many of thes arrests have been due to more extensive intelligence sharing among national

repressed tensions between muslims and christians began to erupt in 1999 and 2000 the outbreak of sectarian violence in ambon in the mal ukus and poso on sulawesi provided ji with critical opportunities to recruit trai n and fund local mujahadeen fighters to participate in the sectarian c onflict in which hundreds died16 after the violence ebbed many of these jihadis became activ

between jemaah islamiyah and qaeda although many an alysts at first assumed that ji is qaedas southeast asian affiliate reporting including leaks from interrogations of captured ji and qaeda operatives have shown that the two groups are discrete organizations with differing though often overlapping agendas17 whereas qaedas focus is global and definitively targets westerners and western institutions jemaah islamiyah is focused on radicalizing muslim southeast asia starting with indonesia and some ji leader s are said to feel that attacking western targets as osama bin laden has urged will undermine this goal that said the two networ ks have developed high ly symbiotic relationship there is some overlap in membership they have shared training camps in pakistan afghanistan and mindanao qaeda has pr ovided ji with cons iderable financial support18 they shared personnel such as when ji sent an opera tive with scientific expertise to afghanistan to try to develop an anthrax

terrorist acts jemaah islamiyahs size and structure the total number of core jemaah islamiyah members has been estimated to range from 500 to several thousand23 its influence transcends these numbers however many more men have been educated at jirun pesantrens religious boarding schools where the baasyir and s ungkars radical interpretation of islam is taught ji also has avidly sought out alliances which at times have been ad hoc with loose network of likeminded organizations and jirun training camps have upgraded the military skills and ideological fervor of smaller localized groups in 1999 ji leaders reportedly established the rabitatul mujihidin rm of regional jihadi groups including representatives from aceh thailand burma and bangladesh with the goal of bringing new organizations into the ji family and to coordinate jihad activities such as carrying out attacks procuring arms sharing training resources and pooling finances the rm is thought to have held three meetings all in malaysia between 1999 and late 2000 interrogations of jemaah islamiyah members have revealed highly formalized command structure at least during the early part of the decade at its peak organizational strength in 2000 and 2001 ji was led by fivemember regional advisory council chaired by hambali an im portant coordinator of ji and qaeda activities baasyir and sungkar served as

including fundraising religious indoc trination military training and weapons procurement see figure 1 each mantiqi in turn was subdivided into at least three additional layers battalions platoons and squads24 however in practice ji appears to function in much less centralized fashion than this structure might imply the ne tworks goal of developing indigenous jihadis meant that ji members often have worked with andor created local groups outside its control it often is difficult to sort out the overlap among ji and other radical groups additionally regional leaders appear to have had fair

what one report by the international crisis gr oup has described as tensions between two factions over the best strategy for waging jihad minority group led by hambali is interested in focusing on broader antiwestern agenda similar to qaeda and in effecting change in the near term for instance in the ongoing sectarian strife on the island of sulawesi many of these ji members have formed and aided militia called mujahidin kompak that has set up training camps and has sought to get recruits into military battle as quickly as possible pposing this faction is majority group within ji depicted as the bureaucrats that sees these tactics as undermining its preferred longerterm strategy of building up military capacity and using religious proselytization to create mass base fficient to support an islamic revolution29 the implication is that ji may not be as monolithic as commonly assumed though it is important to point out that the two camps goals are not necessarily mutually exclusive hambali for instance is believe d to have overseen jis involvement in the communal conflicts in the malukus in 1999 likewise there appears to be divisions among ji members about geographic objectiv with some seeking to establish islamic state in southeast asia and others focused solely on establishing an islamic state in indonesia30 major plots and attacks jemaah islamiyah first came to

groups traditionally have been concer ned primarily with domestic issues such as promoting the adoption of islamic law sharia in the 1999 national elections only small minority of the muslim parties

australia canada the united states and other countries cooperating with the usled war in iraq142 options and implications for us policy strategies for combating rrorism in southeast asia the 911 commission recommends conceptualizing the battle against islamist terrorism as twopronged campaign on the one hand aimed at disrupting the leadership of qaeda jemaah islamiy ah and likeminded terrorist networks and on the other hand competing against the rise of radical ideologies within the islamic world that inspire terrorism143 to date us policy in southeast asia has emphasized the first goal which is more immediate and requires an emphasis on the policy tools necessary to kill and capture specific individuals locate and destroy terrorist training facilities and identify terrorist financing networks the second goal is perhaps less urge nt in the immediate term but more important in the longer term it also is more complex for essentially it aims at reducing the appeal of violent islamism by strengthening national governments ability to provide their muslim citizens with an attractive alternative although southeast asian societies and governments in general are more tolerant representative and responsive than those in the middle east and south asia islamist terrorist groups have been able to exploit the sense of alienation produced in part by the corruption and breakdown of instituti onal authority in indonesia and by the marginalization of minority muslim groups in the southern philippines and southern thailand additionally to date the us approach to fighting terrorism in southeast asia primarily has been bilateral rather than multilateral in nature and generally has been limited to the law enforcement rather than the military realm in the near term barring another major terrorist attack it is difficult to foresee these features of us strategy changing since they are ba sed upon features of in ternational relations in southeast asia relatively weak mu ltilateral institutions the poor history of multilateral coopera tion and the wariness on the part of most regional governments of being perceived as working too closely with the united states addressing these deficiencies could be elements of the longterm goal of competing against terrorist ideologies httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31672crs37 144 rohan guanaratna alqaedas

911 commission report p 559 note 75 douglas feith war plan that cast wide net washington post august 7 2004decapitation thus far the strategy of arresting jemaah islamiyahs leadership is thought to have crippled jis capabilities significantly if the international crisis groups obs ervation of factions within ji is correct it may mean that continued push to arrest the networ ks leadership could dramatically reduce jis ability to threaten western targets directly the arrests likely would disproportionately target jis more radical leaders perhaps giving more prominence to the bureaucrats who have longer time horizon and reportedly believe that violence against westerners undermines the ultimate objective of establishing sharia in the region additionally it appears that middle and lowerlevel ji functionaries level of commitment may not be as fanatical as commonl thought some plotters reportedly have had second t houghts about participating in particular operations indicating that close intelligence sharing could help governments identify members who could be induced to desert144 military options yet the apparent ability of ji to remain potent despite the elimination of most of its leadership indicates that decapitation strategy alone is insufficient there are reports that some us military officials have expressed desire to conduct surveillance andor act upon surgical stri ke plans including covert actions targeting terrorist trai ning camps in southeast asia145 attacking camps operated by ji andor the milf in minda nao may be particularly attractive as mindanao may be performing crucial role as regrouping and training area for ji operatives however policy makers would face the question of balancing any gains from eliminating ji camps with the likely long erterm risks the two countries with suspected ji camps indonesia and the philippi nes are particularly sensitive to the presence of us troops operating in their territory as evidenced by jakartas reluctance to allow us pilots to conduc t aerial training exercises in indonesian airspace while us aircraft carriers perfo rm relief and reconstruction work in aceh following the december 2004 tsunami thus if covert military ac tions were carried out by us soldiers and were discovere d the revelations would likely inflame anti american opinion regardless of whethe r they were sanctioned by the host government the likely backlash would then make it much more difficult for southeast asian national and local leader s to support these and other us anti terrorism actions furthermore even if camps are successfully eliminated it is likely that they could be rebuilt andor relocated in relatively short order in weighing military options us policymakers would face the question of balancing

particularly by being colored by us politics in the middle east they may indicate disconnect between the united states approach to the war on terror and its regional friends and allies such division has the potential to limit the degree to which regional states will coopera with the united states in the war on terror to counter these sentiments the united states could expand its public diplomacy

largely unjustified though us policy toward iraq and israel are the two key issues contributin g to the declining popularity of the united states in indonesia though more recent bom bings have demonstrated that terrorists are still operating in indonesia indonesian police efforts including widespread arrests of suspected ji members have set back the radical islamic agenda in indonesia and helped moderate islamic groups improve their position one of the key reasons for indonesias more aggressive st ance against ji is the growing postbali perception that the network is threat not just to western interests in indonesia but to the indonesian government and society as well the potential for nationalist backlash against working too closely with the united states continues to exist perhap

philippine army elements of which favor restarting military actions against the milf undoubtedly would use recently supplied us military equipment against these groups the philippine government might
