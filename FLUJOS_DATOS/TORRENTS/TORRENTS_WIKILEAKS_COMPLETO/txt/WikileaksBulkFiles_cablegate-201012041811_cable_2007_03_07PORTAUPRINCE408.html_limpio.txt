response to inrb requirements on president preval ref state 5107 classified by classified by ambassador janet sanderson for reasons 14b and d 1 c introduction reftel asks for comprehensive assessment of president prevals decisionmaking process and leadership style as noted in reftel post has reported on many of the specific topics inquired about over the course of prevals reelection campaign and the first year of his second term we welcome the opportunity to reiterate key judgments that we believe will become increasingly important as the preval administration approaches completion of its first year in office in sum we believe prevals commitment to building democratic institutions promoting political stability and developing the economy corresponds with our own interests however prevals weaknesses as an executive his reflexive nationalism and his disinterest in managing bilateral relations in broad diplomatic sense will lead to periodic frictions as we move forward our bilateral agenda case in point we believe that in terms of foreign policy preval is most interested in gaining increased assistance from any available resource he is likely to be tempted to frame his relationship with venezuela and chavezallies in the hemisphere in way that he hopes will create competitive atmosphere as far as who can provide the most to haiti additionally preval has displayed tendency to fixate on particular issue at the exclusion of all others and then to move on to other issues without leaving much to show for his efforts since taking office in may 2006 preval has been the education president the roads president and now the antinarcotics president all of these issues are worthy of his time and attention but require coherent approach to policy implementation in addition to rhetoric end introduction 2 u the answers below are keyed to the questions in reftel question 3 c how does preval make policy decisions what sources of information does preval draw from when making decisions and how does he process that information eg is he receptive new information does he seek advice or rely on his own intuition does preval tend to see policy issues in black and white or in shades of grey 4 c we judge that preval largely relies on his own intuition and experience in formulating policy we see that experiences from his first presidential term are nearly always touchstone on key bilateral issues even when circumstances have significantly changed or the conclusion he is drawing is not directly applicable to the issue at hand prevals recent insistence that the us does not do enough to combat narcotics traffic through haiti is clear example of an attitude carried over from his first term likewise prevals current resistance to making placating gesture to china after the goh voiced support for taiwan at the is based in part on prevals belief that china behaved unreasonably when renewing mission mandates during his first term 5 c on balance we see that issues where preval has fixed view for example relations with china he is remarkably resistant to policy advice on other issues where preval is not so engaged either because of lack of personal interest or lack of experience preval seems readily open to new information and flexible in his approach this seems most apparent in issues relating to economic policy rather than separating prevals thinking into black and white or shades of gray we believe it is more useful to bear in mind that preval often appears not to fully think through the implications or consequences of particular issue he neglects to carry out the kind of study or put in place the administrative structure required to turn an idea into workable policy this was most obvious in his approach to negotiations with gang leaders his focus throughout the port au pr 00000408 002 of 007 summer of 2006 due to lack of results however he abandoned the effort prevals entire policy seemed to be encapsulated in the formulation disarm or die he never appears to have coherently addressed the issue central to the negotiations the future of the most violent gangleaders question b 6 c does preval seek advice from wide array of sources or only look to certain people if so whom and on what issues does he trust any of his advisers or ministers to make key decisions in his stead how does he deal with dissension or criticism from his advisors what tone does he set when he meets with his advisers eg does he encourage them to work collegially competitively or within the formal bureaucratic structure has bob manuels influence with preval diminished and if so why does manuel continue to informally oversee the security portfolio if not who does is there another adviser poised to succeed manuel as prevals righthand man 7 c preval seems open to wide array of sources he reportedly reads and pays attention to the media on wide variety of subjects and maintains broad circle of friends but appears to limit the number of people from whom he actively seeks advice some most notably robert manuel have complained that the number is growing smaller and that his fiancee elizabeth delatour is the only advisor with whom he has meaningful discussions fritz longchamp secretary general of the presidency appears to have gained sipdis access and influence to preval regarding the dispute with china as former foreign minister longchamp may also be advising on broader foreign policy issues gabriel verret remains prevals closest advisor on economic issues lionel delatour elizabeth delatours brotherinlaw maintains somewhat regular access due to his family ties and his direct involvement with the effort to promote hope legislation however delatour himself has complained that preval often ignores his advice with few exceptions preval appears not to trust his advisers or ministers to make key decisions or even to implement key decisions the most recent account of the council of ministers meetings provided by gabriel verret to the ambassador describes preval going through the action items of each ministry and demanding status reports 8 c with the embassy and usg representatives ministers as group are deferential and mostly subdued in prevals presence there is little air of giveandtake or willingness among ministers to extemporize in meetings with usg officials preval has abruptly cut off prime minister alexis on two occasions disagreeing with his views on another occasion he cut off minister of public works frantz varella who had offered an observation regarding security telling him that security was not his responsibility we hear of very little if any substantive criticism or dissension among the cabinet in private the most visible intracabinet dissension so far has been between the judiciary and security officials most recently rift between the justice minister and chief prosecutor claudy gassant preval has pointedly refused to intervene many among haitis chattering classes attribute this to strategy on prevals part to keep members of his government divided and weak we judge rather that his attitude is more in line with his overall passivity as an executive 9 c having observed the prevalmanuel relationship over the past two years since manuels return to haiti to join the preval campaign we judge that manuels role is most accurately described as best friend manuel remains prevals closest confidante and preval still uses him as his personal emissary but the influence of manuels own views on any given subject appear limited for example against manuels advice and own wishes preval involved manuel in his first negotiations with gang leaders in the summer of 2006 with manuels displeasure with this policy unabated preval simply cut him out of the process manuel appears still to be charged with the management of prevals personal security port au pr 00000408 003 of 007 overseeing the presidential protection unit uspn in the palace but preval himself appears to have taken complete charge of security policy manuel along with the justice minister is charged with preparing president preval for the upcoming drug trafficking summit in the dominican republic on march 16 but our contacts with manuel on narcotics issues so far indicate that he does more than to restate prevals own views often with more passion manuel confided to the ambassador that he is frustrated with prevals unwillingness to listen to him and heed advice and that he wants to leave haiti preferably as ambassador to mexico but that preval has been noncommittal about the timing of his appointment whatever the state of their relationship on policy issues preval clearly values manuels friendship and may be reluctant to let him go question c 10 c what is the nature of prevals relationship with director general of the haitian national police mario andresol foreign minister jean reynald clerisme secretary of state for public security luc eucher joseph secretary general of the presidency fritz longchamp and economic advisor gabriel verret 11 c prevals relationship with andresol does not appear to extend beyond their formal association as president and the chief of police preval and andresol had personal connection to speak of before preval inherited and then reappointed andresol director general of the hnp for his part andresol has on several occasions expressed frustration that he has not been able to gain more trust from preval likewise prevals relationship with eucher seems limited to their formal roles eucher is not otherwise close of advisor from whom preval seeks counsel preval and clerisme have large number of mutual acquaintances from the ruralpopulist movements however they do not have close personal bond preval has reportedly taken personal charge of all important foreign policy issues leaving clerisme with little influence longchamp is both trusted advisor and personal friend with preval limiting pm alexis direction of the cabinet and not having named chief of staff the importance of longchamps position has steadily increased finally gabriel verret perhaps even more than either robert manuel or longchamp is the other advisor in the palace who can claim to be both trusted confidante and influential policy advisor as preval remains open to advice on economic matters in the same way elizabeth delatour who is also formally charged with providing economic advice might be the single most important influence on preval question d 12 c what are alexis and foreign minister clerismes perceptions of former president jeanbertrand aristide 13 c based on alexis longstanding personal association with preval from his previous administration through his active role in the most recent presidential campaign we surmise that alexis views on aristide hew closely to prevals own ie that aristide betrayed the haitian people if alexis believes otherwise he gives hint of disagreement with preval we are less familiar with clerisme but note that clerismes political engagement began with his involvement as liberation theology priest working in the rural peasant movement in haitis northeast most of this movements leaders became disillusioned with aristide during the mid1990s whatever clerismes views as with alexis to the extent they do not correspond to prevals he keeps them to himself question 14 c is preval influenced by ideology and if so what are the major influences what motivated him to return to politics what role do catholicism voodoo and port au pr 00000408 004 of 007 liberationtheology play in his worldview what is his full educational history and experience working in private industry 15 c preval seems profoundly uninfluenced and uninterested in ideology at this stage in his life despite his involvement in radicalcommunist circles as student in belgium and his entrance into haitian politics through populist movement deeply influenced by liberation theology prevals public and private discourse is practically devoid of any notions reflecting that background in the context of the developing world we would most accurately describe him as neoliberal particularly in that he has embraced free markets and foreign investment 16 c at the same time prevals discourse regarding haitian politics remains framed in the context of his past he still refers broadly to the people and the bourgeois in referring to haitian society his leftist views reportedly caused deep rift between himself and his family particularly his father who although opposed to duvalier held traditional haitian upperclass views this is as close to an insight as we may venture into his motivation to return to politics which is something of puzzle while canny politician and an effective campaigner preval evinces little of the ambition or overt drive typical of most politicians it may be simply that he rightly recognized that he was the only leader in haiti who legitimately represented the broadbased popular movement that toppled duvalier and first brought aristide to power 17 c like most haitians preval was raised catholic with an exposure to voodoo practices he is nonobservant catholic but maintains cordial and respectful relationship with haitis catholic hierarchy he is particularly close to haitis archbishop who was lifelong friend of his parents likewise he maintains respectful and cordial relationship with voodoo leaders there are unconfirmed reports that robert manuel who is bornagain christian influences prevals religious views and that the two regularly pray together however preval has been jocular and once dismissive of manuels praying in conversations with ambassadors 18 c prevals educational and professional experiences listed in open sources are mostly accurate he studied agronomy at the university of louvain in belgium but did not receive degree reportedly because he spent too much time participating in political activities though he obtained position with the national institute for mineral resources apparently as part of jeanclaude duvaliers conciliatory gestures to his fathers opponents embassy sources do not believe he actually worked at his job he went into the bakery business with several friends in the mid1970 including michele pierre louis renowned patron of haitian arts and through her met aristide prevals bakery was successful but destroyed by associates of the military after the 1991 coup detat among the many incidents of conflict between the rightwing and aristide supporters preval apparently holds special grudge against those who destroyed his business question f 19 c what is prevals relationship to geri benoit does his sister marieclaude calvin play an influential role in his administration does elizabeth delatour yield influence over prevals political decisionmaking what is the status of their impending nuptials one of prevals daughters lives with him in portauprince where is the other and what does she do 20 c though preval and his second wife geri benoit appeared together at times during the campaign they have apparently lived entirely separate lives since his inauguration mrs calvin and preval are very close she was among the family members on the payroll at his agricultural foundation in marmalade which was funded by port au pr 00000408 005 of 007 taiwan calvin acts as his scheduler keeps an office in the palace and one ambassador reports that calvin kept him at bay for several days when he had an urgent request to see preval calvin and her husband also accompanied preval on his second trip to cuba for medical attention mrs calvin does not appear to play any role in influencing government policy 21 c it is difficult to assess elizabeth delatours influence on policy she is extremely private and reserved and does not generally engage foreign officials in substantive conversation she politely resisted the ambassadors attempts to establish more social relationship numerous people close to preval complain that preval has neglected both his work and limited the input of other advisors in favor of delatour during the critical juncture over the dispute with china regarding the renewal of minustahs mandate delatour appeared to play central role srsg mulet chose delatour as his contact when he argued that the goh must provide china some kind of written apology preval ultimately grudgingly signed letter delatour called the ambassador in washington when she was in the department for consultations asking for an update on the chinese delegations position in new york prevals wedding plans remain perhaps the best kept secret in haiti we have confirmed from multiple reliable sources that they are formally engaged but further reliable news regarding wedding plans has emerged factors that might be complicating their plans include prevals health and living arrangements for delatours 11year old 22 c prevals older daughter dominique lives with her mother in portauprince and runs stationery store above her mothers book store she is close to both her parents prevals younger daughter patricia is currently in sri lanka studying asian art question g 23 c how much importance does preval place on maintaining close bilateral relations with the united states are there aspects of the relationship he values more than others does he view it as mutually beneficial relationship does he see haiti as having obligations or responsibilities to the us how does he view the us previous involvement in haiti what is prevals relationship with the haitian diaspora 24 c preval recognizes that the us is haitis most important bilateral partner and that haitis closest societal links internationally are with the us his priority on the bilateral agenda is to leverage and extract the most assistance for haiti on his own terms and to tap into the wealth and resources of the haitianamerican community in the us as the president of small poor nation in the shadow of the american behemoth he clearly believes that the us has far greater obligations to haiti than the other way around if in fact haiti has any obligations at all preval numbers few close friends in the diaspora of whom we know he established friendship with dumarsais simeus during the presidential campaign and they stay in contact by email for the most part however preval does not seem closely connected to or interested in haitian communities abroad he has indicated on number of occasions that he fears that proaristide extremists exert excessive influence in diaspora communities question h 25 c are cabinet officials involved in any illicit activities how does preval handle corruption within his administration 26 c there has been little indication that cabinet members have been involved in illicit activities so far at the time of the cabinets formation observers noted that the ministers had been mostly free of suspicion over the course port au pr 00000408 006 of 007 of their careers indications regarding prevals own attitude toward corruption are mixed during his first term preval either tolerated or was forced to accept gross abuses on the part of close associates of aristide in either case preval has exhibited nonconfrontational approach with passivity toward difficult issues as the hallmark of his political career preval maintains reputation for personal honesty question i 27 c how has preval handled domestic criticism thus far does he have public communications or publicity strategy or manager how does he perform under significant stress how does he respond to confrontation either personally or indirectly eg mass unrest 28 c preval has been remarkably impervious and unresponsive to domestic criticism thus far which mostly centers on his approach to security and the gang activity during the fall of 2006 when kidnapping and crime spiked upward there have been significant incidents of mass unrest since his inauguration on which to judge his reaction based on his intense involvement in the daily review of security policy we surmise that he pays close attention to public opinion even if remaining uncommunicative himself he has palace spokesman in name assad volce but hardly uses him nor does he use the minister for communication who is traditionally the governments chief spokesperson regarding his public relations strategy he has said on several occasions that he wants to change the tradition of haitis presidents being the center of attention who make promises that they are unable to deliver i will talk when i have some accomplishments to talk about question j 29 c what is the status of prevals lespwa coalition is it cohesive coalition or is it fractured do its members regard preval as their leader what is prevals relationship to fanmi lavalas fl 30 c preval has removed himself from involvement in lespwa and undertakes little visible role in managing relations with the parliament lespwa is directionless as party though in the general lespwas drift does not particularly stand out in the incohesive atmosphere of haitis parliament senate president joseph lambert has emerged as leader among lespwa parliamentarians but devotes more of his energy to cultivating his image as parliaments chief rather than simply party leader other lespwa parliamentarian has demonstrated capacity to take direction of the party lespwa parliamentarians longer regard preval as their party leader but recognizing he remains the countrys most popular politician and still associated with lespwa in the publics mind they do not generally criticize him in public or in private preval has virtually contact with any of the various fl factions question k 31 c how long are prevals workdays how many breaks does he take during his workday what does he do during them and how long do they last under what circumstances 32 c preval appears to be keeping an increasingly busy schedule working longer hours and seeing more visitors the ambassador has taken phone calls from him as early as 630 am and has had meetings as late as 630 pm preval told the ambassador recently that he has for many years taken full inpajamas 23 hour nap every afternoon allowing him to maintain his energy question l port au pr 00000408 007 of 007 33 snf what family history of alcohol or substance use does preval have what alcohol or drugs has he been observed using how much and under what circumstances any related problems has preval ever been observed to be high or drunk disoriented trembling or physically jittery or had memory lapses how many drinks can preval consume before he shows signs of inebriation does preval take any medications 34 snf prevals parents both lived well into their eighties his father in particular reportedly enjoyed robust health one in his immediate family has or had reputation for alcohol abuse preval drinks whiskey and smokes in public including at embassy functions but we have not observed him inebriated nor seen him take more than one or two drinks rumors abound about his deteriorating physical condition intense physical pain high dosages of medication however we have credible firsthand reports to confirm this in our meetings preval has always been completely lucid and has never appeared to be in any great pain special intelligence indicates that he began taking medication after the most recent round of medical examinations in cuba that indicated possibility of the return of prostate cancer tighe
