of interest to the 109th congress3 dhs border and transportation security responsibilities dhs is the primary agency responsible for the security of the borders the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 transferred the relevant funding and most of the personnel of 22 agencies and ffices to the newly created department of homeland security dhs was organized into four main directorates border and transportation security bts emer gency preparedness and response epr science and technology st and info rmation analysis and infrastructure protection iaip border security functional responsibilities are at their mo st vivid at the point at which goods or people are expected to cross borders4 the border and transportation security responsibilities of dhs are primar ily located within the bts directorate the coast guard is stand alone agency within dhs but has significant border security responsibilities within the bts directorate custom s and border protection cbp has responsibility for security at and between portsofentry along the border these responsibilities include inspecting people nd goods to determine if they are authorized to enter and maintaining bor der crossing stations to process persons seeking entry to the us the inspection and borderrelate d functions of the customs service the inspection functions of the former immigration and naturalization service the border patrol and the insp ection functions of the animal and plant health inspection service aphis program are consolidated under the cbp within cbp the united states border patrol usb p is the agency responsible for the enforcement of federal immigration laws between ports of entry as currently comprised the usbps primary mission is to detect and prevent the entry of terrorists weapons of mass struction and unauthorized liens into the country and to interdict drug smugglers and other criminals also within bts the bureau of immigration and customs enforcement ice focuses on enforcement of immigration and customs laws within the united states as well as investigations into such activ ities as fraud forced labor trade agreement noncompliance smuggling and illegal tr ansshipment of people and goods and vehicle and cargo theft in addition this bureau oversees the building security activities of the federal protective service formerly of the general serviceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32705crs3 5 authorities to except or to waive visa requireme nts are specified in law such as the broad parole authority of the attorney gene ral under 212d5 of the immigration and nationality act ina and the specific authority of the visa waiver program in 217 of the continuedadministration the operations of the air nd marine operations unit and the federal air marshals service fams transfe rred to ice from transportation security administration tsa in august of 2003 the bureau combined the investigations and intelligence functions of the us customs service and the former ins the air and marine interdiction functions of those agencies and the immigration detention and removal programs as well as the opera tions of the federal protective service ice conducts investigations to develop intelligence to reduce illegal entry into the united states and is responsible for locating and removing illegal aliens by inspecting places of employment for undocumen ted workers ice is responsible for identifying and finding persons who have ove rstayed their visas and the bureau also develops intelligence to combat terrorist financing and mone laundering and to enforce export laws against smuggling and fraud the tsa created by the aviation and transportation security act atsa pl 10771 was established to increase the pr otection of people and commerce as they traveled into and throughout the united stat tsas primary focus in the aftermath of the 911 attacks has been aviation s ecurity which includes protecting the air transportation system against terrorist th reats sabotage and other acts of violence through the deployment of passenger and baggage screen ers detection systems for explosives weapons and other contraband and other security technologies tsa also has responsibilities for marine and land modes of transportation including assessing the risk of terrorist attacks to all nonaviation transpor tation modes issuing regulations to improve the security of the modes and enforcing these regulations to ensure the protection of the transportati on system tsa is further charged with serving as the primary liaison for transportation security to the law enforcement and intelligence communities and with conducting research and development activities to improve security technologies the coast guard is the lead federal agency for the maritime component of homeland security as such it is respons ible for border and tr ansportation security as it applies to us ports coastal and inland waterways and territorial waters the coast guard also performs other missions including some such as fisheries enforcement and marine rescue operations that are not re lated to homeland security the law that established dhs pl 107 296 directed that the coast guard be maintained as distinct entity within dhs and that the commandant of the coast guard report directly to the secretary of dhs accordingly the coast guard exists as its own agency within dhs and is not part of dhss borde r and transportation security directorate the coast guard does however work closely with the bts directorate the department of state dos and the department of justice doj also have role to play in border security foreign nationals not already legally residing in the united states who wish to come to the united states generally must obtain visa to be admitted5 under current law three depa rtments dos dhs doj play keyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32705crs4 5 continued ina 6 other departments notably the department of labor dol nd the department of agriculture usda play roles in the approv process depending on the category or type of visa sought and the department of health and human services dhhs sets policy on the healthrelated grounds for inadmissibilityroles in administering the law and policies on the admission of aliens6 doss bureau of consular affairs is responsible for issuing visas dhss citizenship and immigration services bureau uscis is charged with approving immigrant petitions in addition dojs executive ffice for immigration review eoir plays significant policy role through its adjudicatory decisions on specific immigration cases with this as background the report now turns to discussion of selected concepts that frequently appear in bts debates selected concepts this section of the paper discusses several btsrelated concepts that will likely be featured during the relevant legislative debates of the 109th congress border management in broad terms good borde r management seeks to balance the competing but not necessarily conflicting goals of 1 facilitating and even expediting access for people and goods that we both need and desire with 2 in terdicting and stopping bad people and bad things from entering the country the key to success in this endeavor is the ability to accurately and fficiently identify highrisk passengers and cargo target them for inspection and pr event the entry of dangerous goods and people without impeding the flow of legitimate crossborder traffic the task for the policy maker is to identify and promote t hose policies that will enhance the efficacy of the filters employed for these tasks more specifically the border enforcement agent or inspector is ultimately engaged in an identification and verification process it is an effort to determine the identity of the people or cargo seeking entry and to verify the legitimacy of the request for entry there are many debate s about how best to do this the current entry processing procedures for both pe ople and cargo are complex and involve numerous steps each of which presents bot h an opportunity for interference or for interception httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32705crs5 breadth depth coverage and jurisdiction several of the issues that will likely confront policymakers in the 109th congress essentially revolve around num ber of themes relating to breadth depth coverage and jurisdiction as noted above both the border and transporta tion security realms involve numerous actors both public nd private and tremendous volume of movements across the nations borders or along the countrys transportation infrastructure the environment created by numerous actors and high volumes of traffic may lead to potential goal conflict between security and efficiency in the case where increased security measures impede the flow of people and goods across the border and throughout the country of course this need not necessarily occur and in fact policy choices can be made that both provide more security and speed the flow of legitimate traffic in the 109th congress breadth what and who should be inspected depth what should the intensity of the inspection be coverage how often should things and people be inspected and for what pur pose and jurisdiction who should be responsible for the inspection are likely to be key items of debate for example many of these debates coul d center around the securing of goods and people that are entering the county and being transporte d throughout the country and the level of inspection that should be applied to them there are several avenues of approach to inspections some argue that targeting procedures trustedtr aveler and trusted shipper or knownshipper programs are insu fficient at identifying socalled high risk people and cargo and that 100 inspec tion procedures should be applied others argue that because of limited resources technology people time space and the potential impact on commerce targeted approach should be applied if 100 inspection is not desirable or unattainab what should the ppropriate level be what are the appropriate targeting mechan isms and who should apply them if layered approach is applie d how often should goods or individuals be inspected or screened before they enter the country or as they are transported across the country and what entities ar or will be res ponsible for these inspections these are just some of the overarching questions that can be applied to many of the issues that are discussed in greater detail n ear the end of this report inspection and screening the term inspection can play prominent role in discussions of border security conf usion over the use of the term invariably arises in conflicting estima tes of what proportion of goods containers trucks railcars have been inspected depending upon the context an inspection could entail anything and everything from revi ew of the documentation attached to the entry of particular shipment to mo re detailed document check looking at the outside of container walking k9 unit around the container taking an xray or gammaray image of the contents of the c ontainer passing the container through radiation portal monitor or physically unloading and examining the cargo one often reported statistic is that only x of cargo containers is inspected at the nations ports does this mean that only x wa s physically removed from the container and examined by inspectors or does this mean that x was xrayed or sent to what is sometimes referred to as secondary inspection these questions apply to the entry of pe ople as well in popular discussions it is not always clear whether an inspection means documentary review biometrichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32705crs6 7 current immigration policy requires that primary inspection consists of brief interview with an immigration inspector cursory check of the travelers documents and query of the interagency border inspection system ibisverification of identity an interview pass through metal detector search of applicable databases ndor personal search7 as in the cargo realm an often reported statistic is that x of people were inspected at the nations borders or airports etc does this mean that x were interviewed or we re sent to secondary inspection further there can be differe nces in inspections depending upon the port of entry for example people arriving in the united states at an airport arguably undergo more comprehensive examination th an those arriving by car at land ports of entry the concepts of primary and secondary inspection can further complicate the discussion primary inspection typically consists of some set of standard examination protocols that ar applied to every person or shipment of cargo seeking entry into the country it follows then th at the secondary inspection is further set of protocols applied to thos shipments or people whic h for variety of possible reasons were unable to be satisfactorily processed during the primary inspection thus when encountering reported statistic s or debating policie s and procedures it is important to understand the context in which the term inspection is being used and the subset of cargo and people it applies to there are related issues with the use of the term screening what does it mean to screen cargo or people as they ente r the country often this term is used interchangeably with the term inspection and the same questions as highlighted above apply as well the term screening is often used to describe the querying of databases to verify the id entity of the person or good seeking entry and the legitimacy of that claim if this is the case then against what were the individuals or cargo screened terrorist watchlists criminal history databases andor others systems integration and interoperability the 911 commission recommended the integration of the us bor der security system by expanding the network of screening points to include th nations transportation system and access to vital facilities the ad ministration responded to this recommendation by issuing homeland security presidential directive 11 hspd11 which in large part builds upon hspd6 and related measur to improve terrorist sc reening many of these measures hinge on effective information sh aring and hence on systems integration and interoperability in secure environment systems integration i nvolves establishing standardized communication protocols and interface specifications for systems hardware and software that are usually part of larger information technology enterprise architecture inte grated systems are highly interoperable in that they are capable of effectively and efficiently sharing information through complementary operational systems networ ks and databases on the other hand interoperable systems that are not fully inte grated usually involve information sharing across systems on smaller scale based on standardized data formats and elements indeed such systems may not be fully integrated for reasons of security and economy of scalehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32705crs7 8 the usa patriot act pl 10756 and the nhanced border security and visa entry reform act of 2002 pl 107173potential issues for the 109th congress this section of the report highlights some of the btsrelated issues that may be of concern to the 109th congress it should be noted that this list contains selected issues and should not be considered comprehensive borderrelated i mmigration control usvisitentryexit screening the usvisit program may be the subject of congressional oversight as the administration continues to fully implement the program at the various ports of entry under current practice certain foreign nationals are exempt from the requirements of the usvisit program ie mexican nationals who possess laser visa and many canadian na tionals however the 108th congress passed legislati on that requires biometri cally secured document of everyone who presents themselves for entr at us port of entry though this does not necessarily mean that everyone required to present biometrically secured document will be included in usvisit this may continue to be of concern to the next congress the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act irtpa contains several provisions relating to the entryexit system one of the 911 commission recommendations would find completing the biometric entryexit system to be an essential investment nd require the secretar of dhs to develop plan to accelerate the full implementation of the system and to submit report to congress later than 180 days after enactment on the plan visa policy visa waiver and prescreening since the mid1990s immigration control has been shifting away from us border inspections and apprehensions to overseas screening aimed at keeping inadmissible aliens from arriving in the united states since foreig n nationals not already legally residing in the united states who wish to come to the united states generally must obtain visa to be admitted with some notable exceptions discussed below strengthening visa issuance procedures has been key element of border security the 109th congress will continue to oversee the implementation of several important provisions pertaining to visa policy enacted in recent years these provisions mandated data sharing so that consular officers have access to relevant electronic information required the development of an interoperable electronic da ta system to be used to share information relevant to alien admissibility and required that all visas issued after october 2004 have biometric identifiers8 action most recently to keep inadmissible aliens abroad the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 expanded the overseas preinspecti on of travelers destined for the united states requested the deployment of technol ogies eg biometrics to detect potential terrorist indicators on travel documents established within the department of state dos an office of visa and passport secu rity and required that consular officers have greater training in the det ection of terrorist travel patterns many visitors enter the united states without visas through the visa waiver program vwp provision of law that llows the visa requirements to be waivedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32705crs8 9 us

act pl 10756 and 303 of the enhanced border security and visa reform act pl 107173 require that visas and other travel documents contain biometric identifier and are tamperresistantfor aliens coming as visitors from 27 count ries that meet certain standards eg australia france germany italy japa n new zealand and sw itzerland notable among these requirements is that vwp par ticipating countries must issue passports with biometric identifiers however this requirement has yet to be met by any of the participating countries the 108th congress extended the deadline to incorporate biometric identifiers until october 26 2005 the 109th congress may choose to re examine the biometric passpor t deadline as there are indi cations that some countries will be unable to meet the new deadline under law there is mechanism other than congressional action to extend the d eadline another potential issue may be dhss management of the vwp recent report by dhss office of inspections detailed several security concerns related to the program including lack of adequate funding and trained personnel to administer the vwp reliability issues with the data on lost and stolen passports and the fa ilure to conduct timely country reviews9 biometrics and documentary requirements for over decade there has been consensus that immigration documents should include biometric identifiers congress imposed statutor requirement for th biometric border crossing card known as laser visas in 1996 and added requirements for biometric visas in 2001 and 200210 for the past several year s doss bureau of consular affairs has been issuing machinereadable visas consular officers use the consular consolidated database ccd to store data on visa app licants since february 2001 the ccd stores photographs of all visa applicants in electronic form and more recently the ccd has begun storing finger prints of the right and left index fingers the ccd is the nexus for screening aliens for admissibility notably screening on terrorist security and criminal grounds the laser visa which also includes photograph and prints for both index fingers as biometric identifiers is issued to citizens of mexico to gain shortterm entr up to six months for business or tourism into the united states the mexican laser visa has traditionally been called border crossing card bcc since 1998 the card issued to legal permanent residents lprs commonly called green card has included digital photographs and fingerprints holograms microprintin g and an optical memory stripe in addition to the vwp there are excep tions to documentary requirements for visa that have been established by law treaty or regulation most notably with respect to citizens of canada the law also authorizes the attorney general and the secretary of state acting jointly to waive the documentary requirements on the basishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32705crs9 11 ina 212d4a the homeland security act pl 107296 transferred most

documentary requirements had previously been waived federal register vol 68 21 jan 31 2003 pp 51905194 13 testimony of interim assistant director of investigations bureau of immigration and continuedof unforeseen emergency in individual cases11 in 2003 the administration scaled back the circumstances in which the vi sa and passport requi rements are waived12 the 109th congress may consider limits to the presidents ability to waive general statutory requirements requiring us citizens traveling abroad or attempting to enter the united states to bear valid us passport some would restrict such waiver only to us citizens traveling to or from foreign contiguous territories who are bearing identification documents that would be designated by dhs as reliable proof of us citizenship and would require that the documentation not be of type issued to an unlawfully present alien within the united states some would also amend the present waiver authority cerning document requirements for arriving nationals from foreign contiguous countries or adjacent islands so that such waivers may only be granted in nonemergency situ ations through jo int determination by the secretaries of dhs and dos on the basi s of reciprocity and then only if the arriving foreign national is in possession of identification documents deemed secure by the secretary of dhs smuggling and trafficking alien smuggling and human trafficking share common elements and attributes but are di fferent offenses in some respects human trafficking is an aggravated form of lien smuggling since during both offenses aliens are smuggled brought illegally into the country those who are smuggled are free when they reach their final destina tion while those who are trafficked find themselves in servitude arrangement that does not end after they are smuggled to their final destination ice as the lead agency collaborates with the department of state and the federal bureau of investiga tion fbi as well as other federal and local law enforcement agencies on investigations into alien smuggling and trafficking which include an overseas investigative component some cont end that targeting major smuggling and trafficking organiza tions for investigation and prosecution reduces illegal entries into the united states moreover some are concerned that terrorists may use human smuggling networks to clandestinely enter the united states in the intelligence reform and terro rism prevention act of 2004 congress established the interagency human smuggling and trafficking center for the purposes of combating terrorist travel migra nt smuggling and trafficking in persons at issue may be the need for other tools to combat smuggling such as increasing the criminal penalties for alien sm uggling

implementing the united nations convention against torture and other crue l inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment hereafter referre d to as the torture convention prohibit the return of any person to country where there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of being tortured an immigration officer however can summarily exclude through process known as expedited removal an alien arriving without proper documentation or an alien present in the united states for less than two years unless the alien ex presses fear of persecution although the united states citizensh ip and immigration services bureau uscis and the department of justices executive office for immigration review eoir are clearly the lead agencies in as ylum policy the first contacts many asylum seekers have with the us government are with border and transportation security bts officials some have expressed concern that the cbp inspectors us border patrol officers and immigration and customs enforcement ice agents are not adequately trained in asylum policy and other humanitarian forms of immigration relief others point out that the cbp inspect ors us border patrol officers and ice agents follow the policy and procedural guide lines to ensure that aliens who express fear of returning home are given the opport unity to have their fears considered by an asylum officer andor an immigration judge although there are many who would revise us asylum law and policy those advocating change have diverg ent perspectives some express concern that potential terrorists could use asylum as an avenue for entry into the united states especially aliens from trouble spots in the mideast northern africa and south asia others maintain that current law does not offe r adequate protecti ons for people fleeing human rights violations some state that given the religious ethnic and political violence in various countries around the world it is becoming more difficult to

terrorism conferees on the intelligence reform law enacted by the 108th congress dropped housepassed provisions to re vise asylum and expedited removal and these options are expected to be considered early in the 109th congress some proponents of these revisions would expand the class of alie ns subject to expedited removal without further hearing or review by increasing the prior continuous us physical presence required for exemption from such removal fro m two years to five years some also would restrict access to an interview with an asylum officers by those aliens in expedited removal

combines digital photograph two flat fingerprints and biographical data into tw databases which can be used to track repeat entrants and better identify criminal aliens the fbis iafis is an automated 10 rolled fingerprint matching system linked to database that holds over 40 million records including wanted persons stolen vehicles ported felons gang members and terrorists integration of the two syst ems is widely regarded as vital component of tightening border security as it woul d allow frontline cbp inspectors and usbp agents to access the fbis criminal data base in order to establish whether apprehended aliens have outstanding warrants or criminal histories however integration has proved difficult for various technical and organizational reasons the conference report to the fy2005 dhs appr opriations act pl 108334 hrept 108774 adopts reporting require ments requiring dhs to fund the full cost of achieving real time interoperability between the two systems using the usvisit appropriation directing the under secretary of bts to report within 90 days of enactment on the status of the integration effort including steps that will be taken to integrate iafis into ident needed f unding and timetable for full integration cargo and transportationrelated border control cargo and container security cargo and container security remain issues of concern cbp is advancing its cargo security strategy primarily through two initiatives the customstrade partnership against terrorism ctpat and the container security initiative csi ctp at is publicprivate partnership aimed at securing the supply chain from point of or igin through entry into the us csi is cbp program stationing cbp officers in foreign sea ports to target and inspect marine containers before they are load ed onto usbound vessels the government accountability office gao published re port concerning both the csi and c tpat programs gao credited cbp for qui ckly rolling out the two programs but noted that cbp

two programs15 the house report hrept 108541 attached to the housepassed version of the dhs appropriations bill requested report from cbp detailing the implementation plan for csi and encourages cbp to develop an integrated network including all relevant route inspection shipment and intrusion data the conference report hrept 108774 to the dhs appropriations act directs the under secretary of bts to submit comprehensive report by february 8 2005 which should include among other items the steps dhs has taken to enhance container security and which bts entity has primary responsib ility for implementing cargo container security measures what steps this entity will take to implement future cargo security standards policies procedures or regula tions and the security of inbond shipments16 questions for congress in clude how the csi and ctpat programs can be integrated into wider screening network and how to maintain the security of shipments once they enter th country and are transported from the ports of entry to their final destination within the country also csi focuses on containers and there are other forms of marine cargo including liquid or dry bulk break bulk and vehicles congress may wish to consid er if there should be some type of csi type preinspection of these cargoes as well targeting and risk assessment cbp uses risk assessment tool the automated targeting systemats to focus inspections on highrisk shipments ats automatically sorts shipments according to risk based on specific weighted rule sets and assigns each shipment risk score the higher the score the more attention shipment requires and the greater the chan ce it will be targeted for inspection while many observers note the importance of developing sophisticated targeting mechanisms others have ra ised concerns including gao which recently noted that while cbps targeting strategy incorporated some elements of risk management it lacked comprehensive set of criticality vulnerability and risk assessments and does not follow certain recognized modeling practices17 potential questions for congress concerning risk assessments in general include the efficacy of the

press release aug 26 2004screening domestically shipped cargo nd how it might be paired with random inspections to identify potential gaps cargo inspection technology cbp uses variety of inspection technologies to assist inspect ors in detecting and identifyi ng suspicious cargo these technologies are referred to generally as nonintrusive inspection nii technology and include both gammaray such as the vehicle and cargo inspection system vacis and xray systems among others cbp also uses radiation detection devices both personal prds and largescale radiati on portal monitors rpms potential questions for congress regarding these technologies include how they could possibly be integrated with broader ne twork of screening capabilities not just at ports of entry but possibly used to impr ove the screening of domestically shipped cargoes and how information gleaned from security risks identified during the screening of goods might be incorporated in to larger screening network how these technologies might be inserted into the flow of cargo through ts and transportation nodes to screen more goods nd how best to systematica lly develop and deploy the next generation of cargo inspection technology privatized airport screening program of possible issue to congress is the number of airports that may request to optout of the federal screener program after november 18 2004 the conference report hrept 108774 to the fy2005 dhs appropriations act requires tsa to re port on cost savings resulting from opt out the number and location of each airport applying for participation under the opt out program the decision by the administrator on the application if an application by an airport is not accepted the reasons why the application was not approved and the results of the competitive acquisition for contract screening services at those airports whose applicati ons have been approved computer assisted passenger prescreening system capps and secure flight currently air carriers are responsible for implementing the capps system at airports tsa had been developing more advanced passenger prescreening system called cappsii however due to mounting privacy concerns and operational problems tsa announced it was scrapping plans to implement cappsii in august 200418 instead tsa administrator david m stone testified that cappsii is being reshaped and repackaged to address the privacy issues19 tsa recently announced the replacement prog ram entitled secure flight which will differ from capps ii because it focuses on identifying terrorists rather than on serving other law enforcement purposes20 one of the 911 commission report recommendations suggested that tsa take over the existing capps system from the airlines until whatever program that repl aces it becomes operational this would probably add to tsa screener workload and may result in an increased need for funds within tsa possible issues for congress include whether currenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32705crs14 appropriations levels are ad equate for the reshaping of cappsii into the recently announced secure flight program and wh ether more funds s hould be appropriated for tsa if in fact the agency takes over the implementation of the existing capps system from air carriers the conferees to the fy2005 dhs appr opriations act pl 108334 agreed to provide 35 million for secure flight and noted that an additional 10 million is provided under separate tsa account for crew vetting the conferees note their concern that 90 days may not be sufficient to plan test and analyze the system before its full implementation therefore the c onferees encourage the tsa to focus first on getting watchlists operational and exp ect tsa to cooperate with gao in its review of secure flight the conferees further note that dhs is proposing to check all passengers using the new secure flig ht system as recommended by the 911 commission subtitle b of title iv of the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 108458 essentially implements the 911 commission recommendations to improve passenger prescreening for both domestic and international

equity of costsharing for inline eds integration air cargo security air cargo security remains an issue of significant concern to congress most recently this issue was addressed in the 911 commission recommendations the fy2005 dhs appropriations act and the intelligence reform legislation pl 1 08334 required among other things that tsa research develop and procure certified systems to inspect and screen air cargo on passenger aircraft at the earliest date possible to enhance the known shipper program and to triple the percentage of cargo inspected on passenger aircraft tsa shall require cargo screened on passenger aircraft to meet the tripling threshold as measured by the average percentage of cargo inspected per day per airline per airport additionally the conferees in hrept 108774 direct tsa to work more aggressively to strengthen air cargo secu rity by strengthening the known shipper program to include regular checks working with indirect carriers to ensure their compliance with security directives nd validating indirect carriers security measures where the carriers consolidate freight and transport it to passenger and all cargo aircraft subtitle c of title iv of the

nonaviation trans portation security in the immediate aftermath of the 911 attacks much focus understandably has been placed on aviation security issues however after the march 2004 train bombing s in

deadlines for addressing secur ity needs and forwardlooking strategic plan setting forth the roles and responsibilities of federa l state regional local authorities as well as private entities the initial strategy is to be delivered to congress later than april 15 2005 pote ntial issues for congress could include the division of responsibilities for tran sportation security how the national transportation security plan will be inte grated with existing plans and security initiatives such as the air cargo strategic plan administered by tsa the maritime security plans required by the maritime transportation security act administered by the coast guard and the forthcoming national cargo security strategy currently being developed by dhs coast guard deepwater program the deepwater program is planned 22year multibilliondollar project to repl ace or modernize 93 aging coast guard ships and 207 aging coast guard aircraft the deepwater program presents several potential issues for congress one potentia l issue concerns the mission requirements to be met by the program which were tablished in the late 1990s and reflect pre911 understanding of the coast guar ds future mission requirements 2004 rand corporation report on the deepwate r program states that the baseline deepwater program will not provide the uscg with adequate assets and capabilities to fulfill demands for traditiona l missions and emerging responsibilities to satisfy these demands the uscg will need the capabilities of twice the number of cutters and 50 more air vehicles than it has been planning to acquire over the next two decades the coast guard is reassessing the programs mission requirements to take post9 11 mission demands into account coast guard officials have stated that existing deepwatercapable assets are wearing out more quickly than anticipated suggesting that new assets might need to be procured sooner than planned coast guard legacy and replacement assets both the senate and house committee reports to the fy2005 dhs appropriations bill voiced concernhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32705crs16 over the condition of coast guard legacy assets the senate cited gao report which noted that coast guard assets are being used 40 more intensively than originally anticipated when the deepwater program was conceived resulting in an accelerated deterioration the senate repor t noted that the coast guard is expending more deepwater funding on maintainin g legacy assets and less on acquiring replacement assets the house committee c onversely is concerned that the coast guard is having problems maintaining its legacy assets due to perceived need to expend all available funding on deepwa ter procurement the house committee requires the coast guard to report within 30 days of enactment of the appropriations act its plans for maintenance of all legacy vessels and aircraft including the entity responsible for the maintenance and the timated costs further the coast guard is directed to submit quarterly reports on its legacy maintenance plan beginning with the submission of the presidents fy2006 budg et the conferees adopted this house committee report language coast guard automatic identification system potential issue for congress concerns the automatic identification system ais vesseltracking system that the coast guard wants to implement as key part of its strategy for achieving maritime domain awareness mda at each major port ais is system that will identify the ship its size and its cargo before it enters an american seaport questions include the availability of radio frequency needed for ais and whether the system as currently planned will adequately cover all categories of ships that might pose threat to us homeland s ecurity the fy2005 dhs appropriation act pl 108334 provides 24 million for ais nonhomeland security missions of the coast guard key potential issue is whether the coast guards resour ces are sufficient to adequately perform both its homeland and nonhomeland secur ity missions fisheries enforcement marine environmental protec tion and search and rescue for example the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 increased coast guard requirements for homelandsecurity missions without dir ectly reducing requi rements for other missions after september 11 2001 the coast guard significantly increased homeland security operations while reducing operations in other missions gao in reports and testimony on this topic have noted the reduced number of coast guard operating hours devoted to nonhomeland s ecurity missions nd have expressed concerns regarding the coast guards ability to link application of resources to performance levels achieve d for various missions staffing staffing of primary border agenci may continue to be of concern to congress the conference report hrept 108774 to the fy2005 dhs appropriations act requires cbp to submit comprehensive staffing plan immediately and to submit an updated plan later than 90 days after enactment the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act irtpa contains provisions authorizing subject to the availability of appropriations less than 2000 fulltime border patrol agents and 800 fulltime immigration and customs enforcement inspectors in fiscal years 20062010 with regard to the authorized increase in border patrol agents the irtpa further s
