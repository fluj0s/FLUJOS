congress summary the us government has implemented ries of programs to protect the nation against terrorist nuclear attack some of these programs predate september 11 2001 while others were established since then most programs are within the nuclear regulatory commission the departments of defense energy and state and agencies that becam part of the department of homeland security dhs upon its creation and they are focused on detecting the illicit acquisition and shipment of nuclear and radiological ma terials and protecting and securing nuclear weapons these disparate programs have historically been viewed as lacking coordination and centralized oversight in 2005 the domestic nuclear detecti on office dndo was established within the department of homeland security to centralize coordination of the federal response to an unconventional nuclear th reat the office was codified in 2006 through the passage of the safe port ac t pl 109347 and given specific statutory responsibilities to protect the united states against radiological and nuclear attack including the responsibility to develop global nuclear detection architecture determining the range of existing federal efforts protecting against nuclear attack coordinating the outcomes of these efforts identifying overlaps and gaps between them and integrating the results into single architecture are likely to be evolving ongoing tasks the global nuclear detection architecture is multilayered system of detection technologies programs and guidelines signed to enhance the nations ability to detect and prevent radiological or nuc lear attack among its components are existing programs in nuclear detection ope rated by other federal agencies and new programs put into place by dndo the global nuclear detection architecture is developed by dndo in coordination with other federal agencies implementing nuclear detection efforts and this coordi nation is essential to the success of the architecture this architecture is complicated system of systems measuring the success of the architecture relative to its indivi dual components and th effectiveness of additional investments are challenges the dndo is developing risk and cost methodologies to be applied to the architecture in orde r to understand and prioritize the various nuclear detection programs and activities in multiple federal agencies congress in its oversight capacity has shown interest in the development and implementation of the globa l nuclear detection architecture and in the decision making process attendant to

snm is longstanding concern of the us government1 since the development of nuclear weapons federal ag encies have been involved in securing us nuclear assets against diversion thef t and attack similarly concerns that terrorists or nonstate actors might acqui re nuclear weapon or the materials necessary to construct one have led to federal efforts to track detect and secure such materials both domestically and abroad preventing terrorist or nonstate nucl ear attack within the united states involves more than detection of the nuc lear weapon detection of nuclear and radiological material is one part of larg er system of deterren ce counterproliferation and response activities intelligence inform ation regarding the intent and capability of terrorist and nonstate groups and law enforcement activities disrupting the formation and action of these groups play key roles in preventing initial acquisition of nuclear and radiological materials subsequent to the detection of nuclear or radiological materials successful interdiction of these materials is another crucial step nevertheless this report addresses only the global nuclear detection architecture not programs focusing on even ts prior or subsequent to the detection opportunity the federal government has implemented series of programs focused on detecting the illicit shipment of nuclear and radiological materials and protecting and securing nuclear weapons and material following the events of september 11 2001 these programs were augmented by new programs focusing on preventing radiological and nuclear terro rism within the united states some of these new and existing efforts had overlapping goals but they generally used different approaches to improve the detection and security of nuclear materials these programs largely reside within the departments of defense energy and state agencies that became part of the department of homeland security dhs upon its creation in 2002 and the nuclear regulatory commission many of these agencies have both national and international roles in nuclear defense protecting domestic nuclear assets while aiding in securing or detecting the tran

others recommended that the federal government make greater more organized effort to protect the united states against the nuclear terrorism threat7 domestic nuclear detection office the domestic

endeavor because federa l efforts to protect against nuclear attack are spread among multiple agencies determining the full range of existing efforts coordinating the outcomes of these efforts identifying any overlaps and gaps between them and developing an architectur integrating current and future efforts are likely to be evolving ongoing tasks what is the global nuclear detection architecture although the safe port act requires th at dndo establish an enhanced global nuclear detection architecture it does not define this term variety of interpretations are possible for example an architecture could be collection of federal and nonfederal programs groupi ng of sensors or other technologies designed to detect nuclear and radiological material mechanism for collecting and distributing information about nuclear and radiological materi framework for investment and prioritization of detection assets or various combinations of the above and more the dndo describes the global nuclear tection architectur as comprising several key elements multilayered stru cture of radiologi calnuclear radnuc detection systems deployed both domes tically and overseas welldefined and carefully coordinated network of interrelationships am ong them and set of systems engineeringbased principles and guidelines governing the architectures design and evolution over time10 in implementing this definition dndo solicited information about existing programs from agencies involved in nuclear detection the dndo then performed net assessment of federal nuclear detection capabilities this assessment determined that 72 programs c ontributed in whole or in part to the existing global nuclear detection architectur with total funding of more than 22 billion in fy200611

organized by dndo into global nuclear detection arch itecture framework the combined system of systems relies heavily on its technolog ical component with the deployment of radiation detectors at

developed or procured by dndo the global nuclear detection architecture encompasses more than just these sensors other elements include the use of sensor data to inform decisionmakers effective reaction to detection event and interdiction of the detected nuclear or ra diological material according to the government accountability office combating nuclear smuggling requires an integrated approach that incl udes equipment proper training of border security personnel in the use of radia tion detection equipment and intelligence gathering on potential nucl ear smuggling operations16 other experts have concluded that the deployment of radiation detectors needs to be highly integrated with other federal efforts prioritized on identified threats configured for flexibility and efficiency and part of global approach including international institutions17 the dndo has attempted to align existin g federal programs so that their capabilities can be compared and integrated into an organizing framework that can help identify gaps and duplication this framework consists of three partially overlapping layers with nine sublayers see figure 1 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34574crs6

layers may make analysis of priorities between and within the layers more difficult the sublayers correspond mainly to conceptual steps in the transportation of threat object to target the global nuclear detection architectur has broad inte rnational scope so implementing it is difficult multiple agency initiatives and programs must be relied on to achieve the architectures goals nd its effectiveness is dependent on many factors outside of dndos dir ect authority and control by categorizing existing programs in this architecture dndo can analyze federal nuclear detection capabilities

p dndo acq7technology and implementing research nd development programs that develop solutions to such gaps layered defense layered defenseindepth approach to global nuclear detection architecture was recommended by the defense science board when considering how to protect dod assets against unconven tional nuclear threats18 successful application of layered defense provides mu ltiple opportunities to detect and interdict threats according to dndo it is recognized that single layer of protection can ever be one hundred percent successful and layered defense strategy acknowledges this difficulty19 if one sublayer fails to detect threat the next may succeed this increase in the likelihood of detecti on occurs in two different ways in one case threat may avoid the tector in an outer layer but then encounter detector in an inner layer in this case having more detection rings makes it more likely that detector is encountered an example of this approach could be the use of random truck screening at weigh stations on in terstate highways the dndo has explicitly attempted to incorporate such redundanc into its global nuclear detection architecture identifying numerous areas where detection capabilities might be integrated into existing operations examples include but are not limited t fixed and mobile detection systems integrated into commercial vehicle insp ection activities detection enabled law enforcement and screening conducted fo r special events capabilities that may require additional operational costs incl ude mobile teams sweeping of areas of concern chokepoint screening at br idges and tunnels roadway monitoring concepts and options for reducing the risk posed by the small maritime craft pathway20 alternatively threat may encounter tector in an outer layer that fails to detect it but then may encount er different type of detect or in an inner layer that is more successful in this case it is the use of different det ection technologies or procedures that provides the increased likelihood of success examples might include the screening of manifest information for shipments entering the united states followed by the use of radiation tection equipment the use of both radiation detectors and nonintrusive imagi ng technologies or the phy sical search of vehicle triggered by suspicious behavior even thoug h radiation detector did not detect any emitted radioactivity prior experience has shown that nuclear smuggling detectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34574crs8 21 see government accountability office combating nuclear smuggli ng

pathways between designated ports of entry domestic nuclear detection office department of homeland security congressional justification fy2009 p dndo rdo8 occurs not only through the raising of arms by radiation detection equipment at borders but also by intelligence information and through police investigations21 an additional advantage to layered system is that its multiple detection and interdiction opportunities may increase the number of steps that terrorist group must take to evade detec tion because of these add itional steps the group may be more likely to be detected by other mean s unrelated to the global nuclear detection architecture for example if it is necessary to disassemble nuclear device to avoid detection the reassembly of the device within the united states might be prevented by unrelated law enforcement activities even better the increased complexity of evading detection might deter an attacker from even attempting particular type of attack the ability to correlate information from different layers may also enhance the detection capability of the global nuclear detection architecture fusion of data from the different layers may rev eal patterns or information not apparent in any single layer it is the intent of the global nuclear detection architecture to integrate detection and notification systems at the federal state and local level22 but accomplishing that goal may take significant time and effort as procedures technology and data formats may need to be harmonized to allow easy information exchange methodology and metrics for evaluation significant advantage to establishing global nuclear detection architecture is that it provides framework for analysis of the overall effectiveness of federal nuclear detection efforts thus the performance of programs in each layer of the architecture can be measured and judged within the context of the overall structure rather than in isolation in this way effectiveness and effici ency can be maximized for the architecture overall rather than for each program individually decisionmakers attempting to analyze the architecture effectiveness and efficiency will likely require methodolog and establishing metrics qualitative or quantitative for each layer or sublayer the dndo uses the global nuclear detection architecture framework to identify gaps in existing detection capabilities23 methodology to map existing and future cap abilities onto an analytical construct that is sensitive to changes in the architectur would provide more robust tool for prioritization and

ndependent peer review24 in 2004 the dhs st directorate request ed studies for the development of such an analytic framework and the identification of appropriate metrics25 this work was transferred to dndo upon its creation in 200526 since then additional studies of general aviation and maritime pathways have expanded the analytic basis for assessment of investments in the gl obal nuclear detection architecture27 the degree to which existing programs can be related to these analytic frameworks likely determines their utility and applicability notional analytic framework one in which some elements of the framework may not reflect the actual systems in place or some parameters are estimated or extrapolated rather than based on empirical data may not be adequate for deciding which pr ograms to invest in alter or otherwise optimize for maximum effect within the fra mework on the other hand framework derived only from existing programs may overvalue the existing assets while undervaluing the potential cont ributions of new programs further concern with respect to analytic methodology is its ab ility to reflect the effects of both large and small changes the global nuclear detection architecture is multibillion dollar enterprise composed of dozens of programs methodology that encompasses all these programs but omits significant detail may not be sensitive enough to reflect the impact of incremental changes for example some experts have advocated deployment of radiation detection sensor s at specific sites based on identified smuggling routes and at ports of entry where nuclear and radiological materials are not adequately secure28 ideally an analytic methodology would provide the means to compare that strategy to other strategies such as an increase in border detectors methodology that addre sses all programs in sufficient detail may be cumbersome to use and may not reflect the value of intangible concepts such ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34574crs10 29 an example of misdirection might be the depl oyment of decoy radiation detectors while decoys would have radiation detection ca pability opponents would not know this they might choose more risky approach because of their inaccurate understanding of actual detector deployment 30 false positive occurs when the system indica tes threat even though threat is present 31 for the purposes of this report vu lnerabilities refer to when current capab ilities are at least partly insufficient to meet current ne eds gaps refer to when current capability exists to meet current need 32 the dndo re fers to both the absence of detection capability and limitations in existing continueddeterrence or misdirection29 an approach involving anal ysis of selected components of the global nuclear detection architecture rather than the architecture as whole may make the analytical methodology more tractable however this may lead to inaccuracy when considering areas that fall between the individual component analyses or when considering the overall context of the architecture optimizing the efficiency and effectiveness of each individual component may not optimize the overall architecture even if it does such an approach may not be cost effective the dndo has stated that it takes systems engineering approach to developing and refining the global nuclear detection architecture such an approach attempts to optimize the overall performance of the architecture rather than optimizing any particular program within it treating the global nuclear detection architecture as system of systems may efficiently develop an effective architecture but such treatment requires clear metrics around which the system is to be engineered the dndo may find identifying the ppropriate metrics for evaluation challenging outcomeoriented metrics such as the number of false positives resolved30 the number of threats found or the number of vehicles cleared may not be suitable for judging the effectiveness of the architecture though these metrics may help determine the efficiency or completeness of the planned architecture on the other hand more desirable measures such as the degree of risk reduction may require more complete unde rstanding of global risk than is currently available metrics based on analysis of the existin g global nuclear detection architecture may have similar difficulties if the existing architecture has insufficient detection capability or coverage incremental improvement to that architecture may lead to new architecture that still has insufficient detection ability or c overage conversely if the performance of the architecture is acceptable incremental improvements may not yield substantial benefit when compared with the incremental cost vulnerability or gap analysis could be used to prioritize and assess architecture effectiveness31 challenge for this approach is the difficulty of determining an acceptable level of detection and geographic coverage the dndo has identified gaps in the globa l nuclear detection architecture and is attempting to develop options and strategies for reducing these gaps32

determination of vulnerability may rely on an assessment of whether the detection capabilities of the existing system are sufficient this assessment of suffici ent or acceptable detection capability unlikely to be 100 may be open to debate33 finally the nature of the terrorist nuclear threat potentially changing threat based on an intelligent dversary implies that an metrics and methodology developed to assess the global nuclear detection architectures effectiveness will need to evolve as the threat does when advances in technology new intelligence information and other factors are consider ed the effectiveness of the global nuclear detection architecture may need to be judged on active testing or red teaming of the architecture34 the results of such active testing may be misleading if the testing does not conform to the threat for which the architecture is designed for example if the architecture is designed to detect only large amounts of nuclear material testing it with small amount of nuclear material may highlight current limitations but not address the effectiveness of the architecture at the tasks for which it is designed35 moreover robust architectur containing sublayers with varying detection success rates may still provide sufficient protection against particular threat even if single sublayer is insufficiently protective in order to validate the results of red teaming exercises dndo plans to conduct and qu antify assessment results in various directions including scenariobased bottomup assessments capabilitiesbased topdown assessments and

risk reduction direct and indir ect costs operational feasibility and other relevant decision factors37 in other cases the available nearterm solution is an incremental improvement over existing appr

solution or do both c hoosing between these options requires an understanding of the risk posed by the exis ting vulnerabilities the benefits available through the near and longterm op tions and their relative costs decisionmakers are faced with difficult choices when tting prior ities for implementing the global nuclear detection architecture in the case of existing programs incremental increases in the performance of system may be challenged on the basis of their per ceived costs and benefits38 in the case of new programs questions may arise about whether the ffort expended on new program would have been better used elsewhere finally gi ven that improvement of the global nuclear detection architecture is multiyear project one must determine which portion of the architecture to focus on at any given time likely benefit of casting federal efforts at nuclear detection into the framework of global architecture is the ability to prioritize in quantitative or qualitative fashion across programs39 even absent rigorous methodology to discriminate finely between the results of different investments the globa l nuclear detection architecture may be able to provide rank ordering of vulnerabilities and gaps and thus rank ordering of investment priorities40 thus it may provide an interagency tool to analyze current technology opti ons and rd investments relative to the federal

implementation of development plans for the architecture and th identification of solutions to gaps and vulnerabilities and the continued maintenance of the global nuclear detection architecture all are issues that congress may choose to address priority setting and appropriateness of funding levels within the global nuclear detection architecture the annual federal investment in the global nuclear detection architecture is spread across multiple agencies and across the layers and sublayers of the global nuclear detection architectur the appropriate balan ce of funds in each of the different layers and sublayers as well as between the different programs and agencies is likely an issue of policy interest when congress established the cooperative threat reduction program in 1991 it focused on securing nuclear materials at their source and preventing these materials from being transferred into nonstate hands54 these continuing programs represent significant investment in

spectroscopic port asp and cargo advanced automated radiography system caars technologies to improve the ability to detect nuclear and radiological mate rials at the borders55 and congress has ma ndated the improved screening of cargo containers shipped to the united states56 investment in the interior layer of the architecture has arisen mainly through historical programs designed to protect and safeguard national nuclear facilities and laboratories congress might expand or reduce agency f unding levels to more closely match the levels determined by dndo to meet th needs of the global nuclear detection architecture increase overall funding for ll aspects of the global nuclear detection architecture to increase redundancy or d ecrease funding if it believes other funding priorities are more important shifting funding between layers of the architecture has complex ramifications it may imperil international agreements lead to perceptions of weakness or strength in the various pr ograms or cause interagency disagreements additionally unless robust evaluative syst em has been established for the global nuclear detection architecture with clear metrics tying architecture performance to program funding changes in investment in the different layers of the global nuclear detection architecture may not yield optimal risk reduction it is difficult to assess without careful evaluation whether shiftin g funds from one program to another will have positive or negative net impact the relative size of the two programs is not necessarily the relevant criterion for assessing its impact on the global nuclear detection architecture moreover dndo is not statutorily empowered to direct changes in the funding of other agencies only through higherlevel budgetary policyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34574crs17 57 the director of the national security agency has similar type of authority for national security telecommunications and information systems security

may result in mismatch between the optimal investment levels for the global nuclear detection architecture and the actual investments made congress might choose to provide the dndo director with the authority to re view and assess the budgets of other departments and agencies involved in the global nuclear detection architecture and to comment or recommend alternative budget allocation to the interagency coordinating council or dir ectly to the office of management and budget57 another possible approach would be for c ongress to require that agencies create single global nuclear detection archit ecture budget to provide congress with more transparent correlation between agency funding and the global nuclear detection architecture for example an annual budget supplement is issued for the national nanotechnology initiative another multiagen cy federal endeavor with large budget such budget supplement for nucl ear detection might be coordinated by dndo through the interagency coordinatin g council homeland security council national security council or national science and tec hnology council or through one of the agencies participating in the global nuclear detection architecture alternately congress might vest budgetar coordinating role within the office of science and technology polic rather than within dndo congress established an office of th united states coordinator for the prevention of weapons of ma ss destruction proliferation and terrorism within the white house the head of this office is to advise the president formulate national strategy and policy lead interagency coordination nd implementation and oversee development of comprehensive coordina ted budget for weapon of mass destruction proliferation and terrorism prevention58 while the scope of the coordinators responsibilities is broader than nuclear and radiological issues the comprehensive coordinated budget so deve loped might be one mechanism for clarification of priorities for nuclear detection investment as of the writing of this report the position of coordinator has not been filled the affected agencies may not be suppor tive of the establishment of unified budget or additional review of agency budget decisions reportedly agencies resisted similar options that were consid ered during the creation of dndo leading to major limits on both its scope and its power59 agencies may perceive bottom up process to be more effective in meeting agency and national needs than top down process congress has mandated an annual intera gency review of the global nuclear

nuclear detection architecture the review is to include evaluation of tection technologies identification of deficiencies and assessment of agency capacity for implementation of its responsibilities within the global nuclear detection architecture60 this interagency review process may cause the agencies invol ved to clarify their priorities and funding requirements and thereby cause further evolution of the global nuclear detection architecture balance between incremental and transformational changes to the global nuclear detection architecture the dndo aims to improve the probability of detection by integrating and deploying current technologies continua lly improving these technologies through both nearterm enhancements and transfor mational research nd development and expanding detection capabilities at the federal state and local levels61 i n expanding and improving the global nuclear detection architecture dndo and other participating agencies are faced with temporal choice vulnerabilities and gaps identified through the global nuclear det ection architecture could be reduced by applying immediately available technologie s that provide partial solution or by investing in research and development to develop technologies that will provide more complete solution in the longterm in the first case the abilities of the global nuclear detection architecture would be in crementally improved as technologies that marginally increase the detection capabilitie s of the existing architecture are adopted and then serially replaced such strategy might be costly as multiple generations of equipment each with some advantag over the previous version are purchased and deployed although each generation would be an improvement it would not provide fully acceptable leve l of detection and security in the other case known vulnerabilities might not immediately be addressed at all allowing the possibility that attackers could exploit them while res earch and developmen t program attempted to develop single system that would remove the vulnerability thus an appreciable risk would remain even though it could be partly reduced in the near term until the results of the research and velopment program came to fruition in practice expansion and improveme nt of the global nuclear detection architecture requires balance of these tw approaches using incremental advances and transformational research in coordination to develop robust architecture key concern is how this balance is achieved and identified the dndo is addressing this complex problem by developing timephased plans to address the most important gaps in the existing global nuclear detection architecture62 these plans will allow for the integration of current and neart erm

even if they serve only as partial solutions rather than leaving gap unaddre ssed in spiral development technologies are refined as they are implemented ba sed on information generated during their deployment thus though the technology may serve only as partial solution when first implemented the goal is for it to become more complete solution over time finally dndo has adopted multifacet ed approach to architecture development funding multiple types of detect or tec hnology64 successes in developing and deploying these detector ty pes may lead to significant advances in dndos ability to detect and prevent radiolog ical or nuclear attack in addition to developing and procuring such technolog ies dndo also must weigh the relative advantages to integrating these new systems into the existing architecture versus replacing existing systems with these new systems among key issues facing congress are determining the optimal process for creating robust global nucl ear detection architecture understanding the capabilities of near and longterm technology and th eir potential effect on the global nuclear detection architecture and assessing the adequacy of the metrics used to measure the risk reduction benefits congress bestowed upon dndo the responsibility for developing and implementing global nuclear detection archit ecture as part of efforts to safeguard the united states the succe ss of dndos activities in establishing this architecture will likely require ongoing evaluation and oversight into the future longterm maintenance of the global nuclear detection architecture although the use of detailees ipas and liaisons from other agencies has helped dndo to maintain contact with other stak eholders its reliance on these temporary personnel may make longterm efforts difficult to sustai n as temporary personnel return to their home agency institutional memory may be lost as of april 2007 79 of dndos employees were either detailees liaisons or contractors rather than permanent staff65 efforts that rely on continue d improvement and adjustment over time as the global nuclear detection architecture does will likely depend on dndos ability to clearly nunciate and document the rationale and approaches that it developed and considered when they were established otherwise these efforts may be delayed as new personnel have to reevaluate the ong oing process similarlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34574crs20 66 oral testimony of mark mullen assistant director for architecture domestic nuclear detection office before the senate home land security and governmental affairs committee on july 16 2008coordination between agencies through the interagency coor dinating council may suffer if consensus decisions are not well understood by the successors of the council participants the dndo may be able to offset this potential loss of institutional memory in number of ways one possibility is mentoring process in which outgoing personnel actively mentor their replacements during an overlap period in order to provide continuity of information nd expertise another would involve comprehensive documentation of decisions both positive and negative so that future staff have written record to refer to wh trying to understand why particular approach was taken and why competing pproach was set aside finally expanding dndos permanent staff might provide long term stability and more retention of core knowledge the dndo does appear to be increasing its permanent federal staff as seen in table 1 the number of detailees has decreased and
