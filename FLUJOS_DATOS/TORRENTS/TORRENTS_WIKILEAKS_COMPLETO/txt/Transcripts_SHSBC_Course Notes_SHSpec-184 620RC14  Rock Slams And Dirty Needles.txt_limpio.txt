620rc14 shspec184 rock slams and dirty needles once upon time there was thetan and he couldnt go forwards or backwards he had to stay there and he mustnt stay there the result was that he was overwhelmed he got further orders to evacuate then to advance then to stay there then he caught the barrage his own artillery shelled him he decided then to evacuate but couldnt carry out the orders he is there now in highly charged agitation rockslamming rock slam is cant go cant stay cant come cant leave mustnt be it is highly charged agitation originally while addressing goals on the twentieth acc this was such strong phenomenon that ron used it in assessing to go down the chain to find the rock hence the name dirty needle is tiny persistent rock slam lrh has been spending the past week or so studying rock slams in depth he happened to get criminal on the meter one with known overts against him he saw rock slam turn on and off on this one fact this was very interesting of course the criminal was trapped too in this case however it wasnt goals phenomenon lrh found that you can clean rock slam off missed withhold on someone and end up with dirty needle this is because the pcs attention is on the large overt the rock slam not on the auditor it takes superb tr1 to get past the noread that results from the pcs elsewhereness this was the first evidence that rock slam and dirty needle are signs of overts until the overt is handled the needle wont register the mechanics of failed to reveal is the still point following confusion you should audit the confusion you could only get stuck picture to move by asking what about that picture could you take responsibility for this works because responsibility takes care of the overt stills do not exist without prior confusions except in the case of goals postulates for this reason you can also unstick stuck picture by spotting the prior confusion and the overt the person did the person usually settled the confusion with an overt culture will get stuck and fixed following good confusion too pc will get chronic somatic following an overt or more likely series of overts that involve motion these overts were way of settling confusion politics is an aberration caused by the collective overts of the citizenry you can forecast the next governmental form by looking at the overts the citizens are committing because the government will try to bake those overts legal thus lessening the overt for instance criminal has come to the conclusion that property belongs to nobody he has to come to this conclusion before the 1917 russian revolution the crime rate was very high so the russian government legalized the idea that property belongs to nobody weekness or omitted participation would be the prior overt in socialized state because in such state weakness is legal and rewarded in politics there is only opinion and aberration wisdom in research what usually happens is that lrh falls over something for awhile he bumps into it until way to use it occurs auditors have learned to go to failed to reveal when dirty needle shows up failed to reveal is subsequent to an overt there is little to gain by asking for overts though it is too strong but the failed to reveal skims the top tiger drill p 295a is effective until you run into persistent rock slam or dirty needle ow has been put in to remedy this it works as long as you get your question answered when it doesnt work it is because the pc is doing something else with the answers if he is technically answering but not giving overts keep clearing the commands the pc may be trying to solve problem with the auditing question lrh found that he could turn on rock slam at will in anyone on goals chain 3ga as it exists is totally workable and will do the job the only problem is doing it faster we have already cleared firstgoal clear who had wild rock slam goals got picked off the top of the gpm to the point where the rock slam showed up this guy has gotten caught in the front lines with bunch of overts and he is sitting in ridge that has enough confusion and enough overts behind it to make him unable to move anyplace so there he is it would be faster to find the first goal if you could just bypass the first three goals of the gpm and only have four or five to deal with that is the proposed speedup we have run people to an fn on goal and found that they had rock slam underlying the fn if you overlist for fifteen or twenty minutes beyond the fn you get rock slam as the pc goes on down the goals chain the track is laid out in cycles made up of series of lives or types of lives associated and allied highly variable in their time element it is prime postulate new goal that starts cycle this is not solution but new game the pc goes along with this eventually the steam goes out of it and the thetan finds himself with interest and ability to get into trouble he goes out the bottom then perks up bit and goes off with new basic postulate any further postulate is solution to problems caused by the first one that is cycle those are pieces of gpm with an interrelationship if you can get the earliest you can find cleaned up the later ones blow easily since the thetan had less power to make them for this reason it is worthwhile to get as early goal as you can find that still reads and has some reality for the pc and which he can still run if goal will rocket read you can list it after you have tiger drilled it clean if it rocket reads you can list it through to fn then find another etc etc as you go further back it would be easy to find later goals but useful to find earlier ones thetan never gets so messed up that he fails to leave flag out on his points of aberration in early work it was noticed that the key engram of the pcs current life leaves out tag the tag is an innocentseeming and seemingly meaningless picture that the pc is frequently aware of for instance it may be picture of grandfathers rocking chair when you explore this you find the key engram similarly the key goal has rock slam left on it one way of finding out what subject it is on is by nulling several hundred goals culling the rock slams writing them down and seeing what the subject matter is test overts on and see the rock slam turn on the rock slam may wear out on some of these subjects those are the locks the real goal will have rock slam that wont weer out the charge manifested by the rock slam can be imparted to associated subjects that wont hold up and that will confuse you any branch of the tree looks like the trunk eventually you will find the trunk you can use the rock slam to find the goals channel by assessing the eight dynamics to find one that has rock slam or dirty needle if there is dirty needle at first you can cause one by having the pc think of overts against each dynamic and picking out the dirtiest needle you have to be clever to ask these questions without causing missed withholds get the pc to tell you few overts on the dynamic that reads dirtiest ask him what would represent that dynamic and get list of items assess by elimination looking for rock slam or the hottest item it is ok if at this point you dont get rock slam take that item and get the pc to list what goal might you have that would be an overt against eg the government write down any pain or sensation on the list keep listing as long as there is needle action when the needle smooths out the pcs goal is on the list if you are lucky if you are unlucky you will get nothing but pain sensation and stuck needle if so start with new dynamic assessment if you are getting cognitions that is good sign on some pcs this could be the only way to run goals on most it would be shortcut
