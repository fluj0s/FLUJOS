detachment 2 605th test squadron melbourne fl introduction background international terrorists including members of qaida have carried out attacks on united states diplomatic and military personnel and facilities abroad and on citizens and property within the united states on scale that has created state of armed conflict that requires the use of the united states armed forces individuals acting alone and in concert involved in international terrorism possess both the capability and the intention to undertake further terrorist attacks against the united states that if not detected and prevented will cause mass deaths mass injuries and massive destruction of property and may place at risk the continuity of the operations of the united states government the ability of the united states to protect the united states and its citizens and to help its allies and other cooperating nations protect their nations and their citizens from such further terrorist attacks depends in significant part upon using the united states armed forces to identify terrorists and those who support them to disrupt their activities and to eliminate their ability to conduct or support such attacks to protect the united states and its citizens and for the effective conduct of military operations and prevention of terrorist attacks it is necessary for individuals to be detained presidents military order of november 13 2001 policy it is the policy of the united states to treat all detainees humanely those detainees entitled to protected status under the laws and customs of war eg the geneva conventions of 1949 will be afforded such protections those detainees determined not to be entitled to protected status under the laws and customs of war will to the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity be treated in manner consistent with the principles of the geneva conventions purpose the intent of this publication is to support planners and warfighters by providing consolidated current information on planning for handling transferring transporting and releasing detainees recent lessons learned from operations in afghanistan cuba and iraq has identified areas dealing with detainees that lack current information this mttp serves as planning coordination and reference guide for the services and will provide framework for the warfighters dealing with detainees that is consistent with joint doctrine multiservice instructions and applicable law this publication provides combatant commanders jtfs services and components with single consolidated source of tactics techniques and procedures ttp for the handling and processing of unprivileged enemy combatants ttp for the handling and processing of enemy prisoners of war civilian internees

information requirements that the us forces will collect the tdrc will receive these requirements from the ndrc in the absence of theater detainee reporting center the tdrc responsibilities fall to the combatant commander task force commander or joint task force commander or their designee capture and combat operations initial detainment the events of september 11th changed the nature of warfare the war on terrorism has produced new form of threat and changed how us forces encounter and defeat that threat with respect to detainee operations the initial capturing and transferring of individuals who may pose threat to us and coalition forces is the first step in lengthy process in any given joint area of operations jao any of the services may be involved in mission in whom persons of interest unknown status may be captured or placed under the control of coalition forces such missions or operations filtered down through higher chain of command must emphasize the humane treatment and proper care of those individuals as they are moved to an either temporary or permanent structures iaw united states policy andor regulations regarding such treatment the tactical commanderleader on the ground ensures the following steps are taken when handling individuals of interest to us and coalition forces processing detainees the initial point of capture ipoc can take place in combat on an objective during raid operation cordon search mission temporary checkpoint tcp at border crossing points on base camps and even with local nationals attempting to gain information on usalliedor coalition forces see figure 21 for flow diagram of the processes whenever possible trained human intelligence humint personnel are an integral part of operations of this nature they can assist in screening and categorizing detainees that are detained during operations these battlefield interrogations can produce actionable intelligence products for future use by friendly forces the humint teams also make recommendations to the senior ground commander regarding the continued detention or release on site when the tactical situation permits processing begins when usalliedor coalition forces capture or detain an individual the processing is accomplished in the combat zone for security control initial information collection and the welfare of detainees through the appropriate channels this is referred to as field tactical processing the capturing unit begins field tactical processing by using the five ss and t procedure search segregate silence speed safeguard and tag subsequently the capturing unit will apply the stress principles search tag report evacuate segregate safeguard note the stress principles will be discussed in detail throughout the remainder of this chapter figure 21 detainee flow process the capturing unit must consider the following when determining an initial status of an individual acted hostile to uscoalition forces during the operation is there physical differenceappearance between the individuals captured for example some might have shoes some might not do some have teeth in better condition than others how are they clothed differently is there language difference amongst those in the group did they have weapons on their persons when they were captured did they drop the weapons and attempt to escape did the individual shoot at the capturing unit at any time during the operation these might be some indicators that either the person was in the wrong place at the wrong time or might be someone of intelligence value requiring further questioning by intelligence personnel at holding facility the capturing unit could categorize these individuals determined to be either detained for future interrogation or immediate release these categories include highlevel detainees high value target or hvt personalities whose broad or specific knowledge makes it necessary for them to be questioned without delay by specifically qualified interrogators or debriefers these detainees will require multiple interrogations andor debriefings in the event the detaining unit has qualified interrogation personnel cat detainees should be transferred immediately to holding facility if that is not possible mobile interrogation team mit composed of specifically qualified interrogators andor debriefers with security element should be dispatched to the location of the cat detainees or the fcp b nonhigh level detainees who have enough enemy information on any subject of itnelligence value including information of immediate tactical value to warrant second interrogation or debriefing at holding facility c detainees who have only information of immediate tactical value and do not warrant further questioning at holding facility d other detainees who have information of intelligence value note the fact or determination that detainee has information of intelligence value has nothing to do with their detention status and should not be linked to determination of transfer and release the ongoing war on terrorism will also require us personnel to screen and categorize detainees for priority transport using the above guidelines regardless of status all personnel should be restrained until an initial determination is made on who should be transported and who should be released the capturing unit is responsible for safeguarding and accounting for the detainee at each stage of his removal from the point of capture the processing procedure begins upon capture and continues until the detainee reaches collection point or holding facility the process of identifying and tagging detainee aids usalliedand coalition forces control and account for him as he is moved from the point of capture note all detainees should be restrained using flexcuffs until determination is made of their status units should have flex cuffs capture cards and some form of materialequipment to transport items found on the detainees to the facility units should also consider that combat camera or public affairs personnel may accompany them on mission commanders and leaders must ensure that theater regulationspolicies are followed as it relates to photography of detainees or public release of information capturing unit the five ss and t principles are implemented by the capturing unit the basic principles are search segregate silence speed safeguard and tag see table 21 table 21 five ss and t procedure procedurdescription search search detainees for weapons and ammunition items of intelligence value and other inappropriate items the search should include all clothing on the individual to include shoes nothing should be excluded to ensure the safety and security of the capturing forces note conduct samegender searches when possible if mixedgender searches are necessary for speed or security conduct them in respectful manner and avoid any action that could be interpreted as sexual molestation or assault to prevent allegations of sexual misconduct the onsite supervisor carefully controls soldiers who perform mixedgender searches segregatsegregate detainees based on perceived status of authority or position during initial screening leaders may be identified and thus must be segregated from the remainder of the population silence do not allow detainees to speak or allow anyone to speak to them speak to detainees only to give orders speed remove detainees from the point of capture as quickly as possible safeguarsafeguard detainees according to the geneva conventions and d the us policy provide medical care as needed tag tag detainees with dd form 2745capture tag or fieldexpedient capture tag that includes the following information date of capture location of capture grid coordinates capturing unit special circumstances of capture how the person was captured if he resisted if he gave up and so forth did the persons have weapons on them during their capture note the capturing unit must complete capture tag because failure to do so hinders further processing and disposition the stress search tag report evacuate segregate and safeguard principles are also applied to detainee operations following these principles along with the five ss and t procedure will make for smooth and successful transition of detainees from initial capture to forward collection point or holding facility search search and inspect each detainee and his possessions to include all clothing shoes headgear conduct samegender searches when possible if mixedgender searches are necessary for speed or security conduct them in respectful manner and avoid any action that could be interpreted as sexual molestation or assault to prevent allegations of sexual misconduct the onsite commanderleader carefully controls soldiers who perform mixed gender searches some items are impounded and eventually returned and certain items are confiscated and never returned even if the detainee is released or repatriated determination of what items may be returned is made at the holding facility personal protective equipment once all items have been searched and deemed safe to usallied and coalition forces may be returned to the captured person these items include helmet protective clothing and equipment nbc suits helmets and protective masks for use during evacuation from the cz confiscated items all items minus the above protective equipment is confiscated and accompanies the capturing unit to the holding facility where it is turned over to appropriate officials for determining final disposition the capturing unit coordinates with accompanying interrogationintelligence teams if available to determine which confiscated items have intelligence value personal items diaries letters from home and family pictures can be taken by interrogationintelligence teams for review note for an indepth discussion on impounded and confiscated property see multiservice regulation ar 1908 and dfasin 371 property accountability when seizing property from detainee bundle it or place it in bag to keep it intact and separate from other detainees possessions such carrying items could include ziplock bags sandbags duck tape 5x50 cord socks duct tape prepare for the turnover of those items to the holding facilities tag tag each detainee with dd form 2745 the following information is required date and time of capture capturing unit place of capture circumstances of the capture did the individual have weapon on them during capture the remaining information on the tag is included as it becomes available the dd form 2745 is perforated threepart form that is individually serialnumbered it is constructed of durable waterproof tearresistant material with reinforced eyeholes on parts and c part is attached to the detainee with wire or string part b is maintained by the capturing unit for their records and part c is attached to confiscated property so that the owner can be identified later the dd form 2745 is placed on each detainee prior to the arrival at the holding facility the holding facility may direct the capturing unit to complete capture tag before accepting the detainee instruct the detainee not to remove or alter the tag annotate the tags serial number and the detainees name on locally developed manifest note see soldier training publication stp 2124smct for more information on dd form 2745 report report the number of detainees at each point of capture through appropriate command channels this aids in determining transportation and security requirements evacuate evacuate detainees from the point of capture through appropriate channels as humanely and quickly as possible when moving detainees give them clear brief instructions in their own language when possible military necessity may require delay in movement when this occurs ensure that there is an adequate supply of food potable water appropriate clothing shelter and medical attention available when time and mission priorities allow the capturing unit ensures the proper paperwork da form 4137 evidenceproperty custody document dd form 515 roster of prisoners and dd form 2708receipt for inmate or detained person is complete before detainees are evacuated if necessary dd form 2708 annotated with the number of prisoners and manifest will suffice do not expose detainees to unnecessary danger and protect them while they are awaiting evacuation for seriously wounded or sick detainees medical personnel must determine if prompt evacuation is more dangerous than retaining them in the cz segregate the commanderleader is responsible for the custody of detainees he designates segregation procedures and levels to ensure their security health and welfare segregate detainees as required to ensure safety to uscoalition forces detainee is protected under the rules of the geneva conventions and the us policy until competent authorities can determine forma status see multiservice regulation ar 1908 for further information do not use coercion to obtain information from detainees coercion or inhumane treatment of detainees is prohibited and is not justified by the stress of combat or deep provocation inhumane treatment is serious violation of international law and the ucmj do not speak to detainees except to give orders or directions do not let detainees talk to or signal each other use gag only for as long as needed to ensure that it does not harm the captive this prevents them from plotting ways to counter security and plan escapes safeguard to safeguard detainees according to the geneva conventions and the us policy provide first aid and medical treatment for wounded and sick detainees evacuate them through medical channels using the assets available to evacuate us and coalition forces provide food and water these supplies must be commensurate to those for us and coalition forces see fm 2710 and stanag 2044 provide firm but humane treatment allow detainees to use protective equipment in case of hostile fire or nbc threat protect detainees from abuse by other detainees and local civilians report acts and allegations of inhumane treatment through appropriate command channels see ar 19040 do not locate detainees near obvious targets ammunition sites fuel facilities and communications equipment evacuating detainees general information applies to both sick and wounded detainees and able bodied detainees and the following issues need to be addressed dependent on metttc see appendix definitions for explaination of mett t and metttc the detainees may be evacuated to either forward collection point fcp or to the detainee detention facility the fcp if in operation will allow for more detailed intelligence screening thus those individuals captured may be filtered out from having to be transferred to the detention facility having an fcp in operation and the conduct of more detailed screening process will allow for more consolidated and finelytuned intelligence collection effort at the actual detention facility if the fcp is not available then the detainees are moved from the point of capture directly to the detention facility current doctrine stipulates that units move forward to collection point to pickup and transport in this case detainees from collection point however depending on mett tc this may not be feasible at either the ipoc or the fcp the decision to retain the detainees for subsequent movement to detention facility or immediate release is made the decision point is made by the senior ground commander based on his knowledge of the mission and any input from humint questioning andor circumstances that warrant detention if humint teams are available the commander makes the best decision based on guidance from higher headquarters and categories ad identified earlier in this chapter geographic considerations also apply with respect to the distances from the ipoc to either the fcp or the detention facility for example the detainees may be in ship offshore sick and wounded detainees medical personnel combat lifesavers or other medically trained personnel if attached must decide which detainees must be medically transferred earlier however if not attached the capturing unit must adhere to the following guidelines litter transfers are moved through the appropriate channels seriously wounded or ill detainees are stabilized and evacuated through existing channels to medical facility as quickly as possible if the detainee requires medical evacuation report the detainees medical condition through command channels to the next higher echelon request disposition instructions from the higher command authority the command authority coordinates transportation and identifies the treatment facility where wounded and sick detainees are taken the capturing unit determines if there is security risk during medical evacuation of wounded and sick detainees ordinarily detainees who require medical evacuation are less likely to be security risk however detainees well enough to be security risk are treated and returned to control ablebodied detainees the capturing unit guards ablebodied detainees during movement to prevent escape liberation by the enemy or injury general planning consideration when determining the number of guards necessary is one for every five to ten detainees note during extended transport inor out of theater the ratio is 11 guard to detainee unit tasked to escort detainees considers the following information when determining the number of guards needed the mission enemy terrain troops time available and civilian considerations metttc the number of detainees being moved the condition and morale of the detainees the type of transportation and its scheduled arrival the type of terrain along the evacuation route routes where dense vegetation is close to the road often require more guards then open clear terrain the threat level along the route as the threat level increases so does the need to increase security consider the anticipated presence of suspected sympathizers and hostile local nationals along the route the location of uscoalition units along the route the location and number of rest stops this is based on the transportation the distance and the terrain detainee personal identification data pid collection process in afghanistan by cpt richard j hughbank 519th mp bn ft polk and maj jennifer l curry total force integrator ft leonard wood mo when the us army began operation enduring freedom and their campaign in afghanistan the afghan military forces amf were already holding up to 4500 detainees throughout the coalition joint operational area cjoa afghanistan us forces were directed to collect personal identification data pid on all potential taliban and alqaeda members in an effort to identify americas newest enemies the purpose of collecting pid is to create better database for identifying potential enemy threats and to screen these individuals to determine if they meet the criteria to be treated as detainees if an individual meets the specified criteria they are taken into custody in detainee status and secured for further processing host nation forces would encounter pockets of resistance throughout the area of operation ao and secure them for us forces to conduct pid collection operations these operations were conducted in conjunction with multiple battlefield operating systems bos in combined arms effort to properly conduct the collection of pid pid collection packets consisting of names fingerprints dna and digital photos has become key tool in americas war on terrorism prior to the arrival of the pid team special operations forces sof liaison with leaders of the local indigenous population ensuring candidates for detainee status actually exist at prescribed location and that the area is prepared for military forces to enter and conduct pid collection operations pid collection operation consists of eight different teams refer to schematic command and control c2 team the c2 team consists of key leaders and support soldiers key members of this team include the battalion s3 or similar type capability battle captain communications soldier drivergunner and staff judge advocate sja officer this team is located inside the security perimeter in position that allows for observation of the entire operation members of the team maneuver throughout the pid area ensuring smooth transition between the various stations and positive control over the detainees until they reach the holding area the s3 is responsible for overall mission accomplishment proper detainee handling and guidance in any case not covered during the mission brief the battle captain ensures mission success by conducting liaison operations with the sof on the ground and ensuring the pid collection site is established and operational the communications specialist carries fm capability for communicating with air support and other friendly forces in the ao and as secondary communications system for internal communications with the security forces on the perimeter for

discussed during mission rehearsals the drivergunner remains vigilant of the surroundings throughout the pid collection operation the sja representative provides legal assistanceguidance as needed throughout the entire operation perimeter security team the perimeter security team is comprised of two military police mp squads and platoon leader security element size is based on metttc organic mp teams are placed to ensure 360degree outward coverage of the perimeter the perimeter size is determined by metttc the number of detainees dictates the size of the holding and staging areas and the number of personnel at the mobile interrogation team mit stations the mit stations determine the distance necessary to ensure privacy with each detainee during the screening process the pid and medical teams need minimal space to conduct operations within the security perimeter staging area security team the staging area is preliminary location from which to isolate and establish control over those individuals selected for processing the staging area security team consists of two soldiers with either an m416 or m249 in tactical overwatch positions all detainees are bound at the feet and hands and have hoods covering their heads for disorientation two guards are positioned with their backs to the center of the perimeter to prevent potential fratricide if weapons fire becomes necessary personal identification data collection team pid mp and criminal investigations division personnel are ideal for pid collection operations based on their organic functions of detaining personnel and conducting investigative operations the pid team is the second stage in all pid collection operations team consists of three soldiers with multiple teams operating simultaneously if enough security teams are available the purpose of pid gathering is to build or add to an existing database through the collection of dexorybo nucleic acid dna samples by swabbing the mouth and collecting hair follicles fingerprints and digital photos of the upper torso area all individuals being detained must be put through this process for data collection upon collecting the data and storing it in the proper containers all information will be processed through the appropriate database mobile interrogation team mit the mit consists of interrogators and interpreters the purpose of an mit is to determine if detainee fits the screening criteria given by higher headquarters the screening process takes approximately 1015 minutes per individual if person does not fit the criteria they are turned back over to the leader of the indigenous population or in this case the amf if they do meet the criteria they are taken into us forces custody and escorted to the medical station medical team the medical team consists of unit medic at minimum but physicians assistant is preferable the purpose of the medical team is to conduct cursory medical examination of the detainee for any previous injuries sustained before coming under control of us forces any injuries identified are noted accordingly and if necessary tended to at that time the medical team also allows for prior notification at the theater collection point if more advanced medical attention is necessary upon arrival holding area team the holding area is established in order to maintain control over those individuals who have been identified as meeting the criteria by the mit and who will remain in us forces custody for transport out of the ao to the theater collection point the staging area security team consists of two soldiers with either an m416 or m249 in tactical overwatch positions all detainees are bound at the feet and hands and have hoods covering their heads for disorientation two guards are positioned with their backs to the center of the perimeter to prevent potential fratricide if weapons fire becomes necessary detainee security team once the detainees are brought into the pid operations security perimeter the detainee security team will take charge of all movement and detainee control until they are either released back to the amf or transported back to the theater collection point each security team consists of two soldiers that secure the detainee throughout the process once the detainee enters the holding area the detainee falls under the control of the holding area security team and the detainee security team returns to the staging area to conduct another pid escort this process continues until all detainees have been processed through the pid and screening areas the perimeter security teams will only assist if absolutely necessary to help maintain positive control overall security of the detainees while in flight is also the responsibility of the detainee security team to date pid operations have been conducted in over five different areas throughout afghanistan collecting data on over 3500 potential members of terrorist organizations the military police corps is playing critical role in the pid collection process from the collection of data to the security of detainees during the operations and subsequent aerial escort missions back

editors note both cpt hughbank and maj curry are mps who served on call caat team initial internment and screening facility definition and overview the initial internment and screening facility is the theater level internment site within combatant commanders area of responsibility aor in which detainees with an undetermined status are secured while their status is pending or where detainee who has been determined to be an uec is interrogated and exploited for actionable intelligence for use by the combatant commander this facility should exist as permanent or semi permanent facility within the general regional area of combat operations each situation or operation will dictate the type or level of interment and screening that is available and it is possible that detainees will bypass an initial facility and be transferred directly to longterm internment facility it is the policy of the united states to treat all detainees humanely those detainees entitled to protected status under the laws and customs of war eg the geneva conventions of 1949 will be afforded such protections those detainees determined not to be entitled to protected status under the laws and customs of war will to the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity be treated in manner consistent with the principles of the geneva conventions accordingly commanders shall ensure that detainees are treated humanely without any adverse distinction based on race color religion gender wealth or similar criteria afforded adequate food drinking water shelter clothing and medical treatment allowed the free exercise of religion consistent with the requirements of such detention and detained in accordance with other such conditions as the secretary of defense may prescribe internment length is determined according to the mission and intelligence requirements and logistical conditions that exist during the operation in general interment at this level should last only until it is administratively logistically feasible to process determine status and transfer detainees as appropriate length of internment will be influenced heavily by recommendation or requests of the commanders intelligence community and assets transfers or releases of detainees is the responsibility of the combatant commander positions roles and responsibility the personnel required to run this type of facility will vary and is dependent on mission requirements and current operational situation as rule and for planning purposes use 1 internment company per 300 captives ideally this unit will be comprised of military police security police corrections personnel combatant commander overall responsibility receives guidance from secdef be responsible for all facets of the operation of internment

tiger team analysts will complete the analyst support package asp for each detainee immediately after inprocessing military policesecurity forces detainee escort teams will escort the detainees to the prearranged interrogation booths to meet with the assigned tiger team in those instances where the number of detainees out number the tiger teams the highest ranking intelligence value detainees will be scheduled the first day and the lesser assessed intelligence value detainees will be scheduled on the subsequent days following arrival in all cases all arriving detainees will be initially interrogated within four 4 days of arrival to the long term facility all detainees will have an iir completed on them regardless of intelligence value if nothing else to say the iir needs to state this detainee has intelligence value after initial interrogation and further assessment and reports the detainees will be assigned to specialized team within the interrogation element special projects team may also be utilized to handle high visibilityvery high intelligence value detainees clearing team will be required to assess potential continued threat to the us and it forces after all the intelligence requirements have been satisfied to determine if the detainee will be transferred and released or continued to be held or if they are candidates for legal action typical strategic interrogation element will consist of regional interrogation teams with team chief an officer familiar with interrogation either warrant or other officer or senior nco in the interrogation mos or afsc reports officer section will act as the liaison between the interrogation element and the collection management section the reports office will task the interrogation teams with current collection requirements and sdrs received from the collection management section the reports office will receive the initial iirs and review them prior to the iirs going to collection management the interrogation element also requires an operations section the ops section very critical part of the interrogation element as this section schedules the time and location of the interrogations act as the lno with detention operations group for the escort teams ensures the linguists are scheduled for the interrogations finally an administration section is required for training handling personnel requirements and needs all interrogation teams interrogators analysts etc will work closely with the detention operation personnel to develop rapport with the detaining personnel to inform the detaining personnel of what to look for and what to report in order to enhance the intelligence collection efforts the interrogation element will also use behavior scientist teams bsct made up of psychologistspsychiatrists and behavior science techs when available collection management and fusion sections collection management section will review all pertinent collection requirements sdrs iirs all collection requirements will be kept current and the requirements that have expired will be taken off the list the updated collection requirements will be forwarded to the interrogation element

while their disposition is pending or where detainee who has been determined to be detainee is interrogated and exploited for actionable intelligence this facility should exist as permanent or semipermanent facility each situation or operation will dictate the type or level of interment and screening that is available and it is possible that detainees will bypass an initial facility and be transferred directly to longterm internment facility it is the policy of the united states to treat all detainees humanely those detainees entitled to protected status under the laws and customs of war eg the geneva conventions of 1949 will be afforded such protections those detainees determined not to be entitled to protected status under the laws and customs of war will to the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity be treated in manner consistent with the principles of the geneva conventions accordingly commanders shall ensure that detainees are treated humanely without any adverse distinction based on race color religion gender wealth or similar criteria afforded adequate food drinking water shelter clothing and medical treatment allowed the free exercise of religion consistent with the requirements of such detention and detained in accordance with other such conditions as the secretary of defense may prescribe internment length is determined according to the mission and intelligence requirements and logistical conditions that exist during the operation length of internment will be influenced heavily by recommendation or requests of the commanders intelligence community and assets transfers or releases of detainees is the responsibility of the combatant commander positions roles and responsibility the man power intensive close quarters nature of the long term internment requires the specialized training knowledge and skills of correction specialists and corrections support personnel the personnel required to run this type of facility will vary and is dependent on mission requirements and current operational situation facility commander overall responsibility complies with guidance from secdef be responsible for all facets of the operation of internment facilities and all facilityrelated administrative matters ensure detention operations meet with the principals of the geneva convention and the intent of the president of the

the interrogation team chiefs will review all initial information and make an initial assessment as to the intelligence value of the arriving detainees the assessments are used to rank the arriving detainees the interrogation oic will make team assignments based on the assessments and will notify medical and detention operations inprocessing of the arriving detainee rankings medical will to the best of their ability and barring medical emergency perform the detainee inprocessing per the ranking order when prior information is not available the oic will use the information gathered during the

detainees will be scheduled the first day and the lesser assessed intelligence value detainees will be scheduled on the subsequent days following arrival in all cases all arriving detainees will be initially interrogated within four 4 days of arrival to the long term facility all detainees will have an iir completed on them regardless of intelligence value if nothing else to say this detainee has intelligence value after initial interrogation and further assessment and reports the detainees will be assigned to specialized team within the interrogation element special projects team may also be utilized to handle high visibilityvery high intelligence value detainees clearing team will be required to assess potential continued threat to the us and it forces after all the intelligence requirements have been satisfied to determine if the detainee will be transferred and released or continued to be held or if they are candidates for legal action typical strategic interrogation element will consist of regional interrogation teams with team chief an officer familiar with interrogation either warrant or other officer or senior nco in the interrogation mos or afsc reports officer section will act as the liaison between the interrogation element and the collection management section the reports office will task the interrogation teams with current collection requirements and sdrs received from the collection management section the reports office will receive the initial iirs and review them prior to the iirs going to collection management the interrogation element also requires an operations section the ops section very critical part of the interrogation element as this section schedules the time and location of the interrogations act as the lno with detention operations group for the escort teams ensures the linguists are scheduled for the interrogations finally an administration section is required for training handling personnel requirements and needs all interrogation teams interrogators analysts etc will work closely with the detention operation personnel to develop rapport with the detaining personnel to inform the detaining personnel of what to look for and what to report in order to enhance the intelligence collection efforts the interrogation element will also use behavior scientist teams bsct made up of

interrogation procedures for inprocessing into long term facility intelligence analystsinterrogators should have received information on all incoming detainees through electronic means prior to their arrival at the long term facility this information should include basic biographical information name dob nationality capture information and any intelligence assessments that are available pictures are also helpful prior to arrival also if any were completed knowledgeability briefs kb intelligence spot reports source directed requirements sdr intelligence information reports iir intelligenceinterrogation personnel are set up as tiger teams for arriving detainees as follows one jtf interrogator one jtf analyst one linguist and one outside agency law enforcement person eg fbi citf the interrogation team chiefs will review all electronic material received from the initial internment facility and make an initial assessment as to the intelligence value of the arriving detainees the assessments are used to rank the arriving detainees the interrogation oic will make team assignments based on the assessments and will notify medical and detention operations inprocessing of the arriving detainee rankings medical will to the best of their ability and barring medical emergency perform the detainee inprocessing per the ranking order tiger teams will review all available information concerning their detainee and will complete kb unless kb was completed at the initial internment facility and basic source data bsd card required for entry into the defense source registry the tiger team analysts will complete the analyst support package asp for each detainee immediately after inprocessing military policesecurity forces detainee escort teams will escort the detainees to the prearranged interrogation booths to meet with the assigned tiger team in those instances where the number of detainees out number the tiger teams the highest ranking intelligence value detainees will be scheduled the first day and the lesser assessed intelligence value detainees will be scheduled on the subsequent days following arrival in all cases all arriving detainees will be initially interrogated within four 4 days of arrival to the long term facility all detainees will have an iir completed on them regardless of intelligence value if nothing else to say this detainee has intelligence value after initial interrogation and further assessment and reports the detainees will be assigned to regional interrogation teams within the interrogation element these teams are set up geographically for example detainees arriving from the middle east aor north africaeurope saudi arabia gulf states central asia special projects team may also be utilized to handle high visibilityvery high intelligence value detainees clearing team will be required to assess potential continued threat to the us and it forces after all the intelligence requirements have been satisfied to determine if the detainee will be transferred and released or continued to be held or if they are candidates for legal action typical strategic interrogation element will consist of regional interrogation teams with team chief an officer familiar with interrogation either warrant or other officer or senior nco in the interrogation mos or afsc reports officer section will act as the liaison between the interrogation element and the collection management section the reports office will task the interrogation teams with current collection requirements and sdrs received from the collection management section the reports office will receive the initial iirs and review them prior to the iirs going to collection management the interrogation element also requires an operations section the ops section very critical part of the interrogation element as this section schedules the time and location of the interrogations act as the lno with detention operations group for the escort teams ensures the linguists are scheduled for the interrogations finally an administration section is required for training handling personnel requirements and needs all interrogation teams interrogators analysts etc will work closely with the detention operation personnel to develop rapport with the detaining personnel to inform the detaining personnel of what to look for and what to report in order to enhance the intelligence collection efforts the interrogation element will also have at minimum two behavior scientist teams bsct made up of psychologistspsychiatrists and behavior science techs collection management and fusion sections collection management section will review all pertinent collection requirements sdrs iirs all collection requirements will be kept current and the requirements that have expired will be taken off the list the updated collection requirements will be forwarded to the interrogation element and the fusion cell sdrs will be monitored for currency and the interrogation element will be notified as to overdo late sdrs and those sdrs that have expired iirs will be reviewed for completeness and proper syntax and then sent out from the collection management section by electron to the intelligence community ic the analyst fusion cell will handle all analytical requirements that are not directly related to the interrogation of detainees this will entail reports projects from dod combatant commanders outside agencies and commander jtf 4 detainee reporting system introduction this annex is designed to provide an overview of the detainee reporting system drs software the drs software is written to automate the processing data entry tracking and reporting of detainee information from beginning of detention to termination of detention this includes the automated issuance of internment serial number collection of processing data to include digital photo generation of automated forms standardized and query reports tracking of data changes generation of transfer ordersreceipts and release or repatriation documents and the generation of transfer data uploads change only uploads or complete uploads to meet the requirements established by the executive agent for epwci and detainee operations background the secretary of defense per department of defense directive 23101 directs the secretary of the army to be the department of defenses dods executive agent for all epwci and detainee operations within the army the office of the deputy chief of staff g3 security force protection and law enforcement division damoodl has responsibility for the staffing of national prisoner of war information center npwic and national detainee reporting center ndrc as policy oversight to the epwci and detainee program the detainee reporting system drs is established as the sole automated software authorized for all epwci and detainee data collection management and reporting for the army and all of the us armed forces combatant commanders task force commanders joint task force commanders and epwcidetainee facility commanders current information and support for the drs and other epwci and detainee links can be found at the npwicndrc website at the following address httpwwwhqda aocarmypentagonmilaoc_orgodlndrcndrchtm drs software the drs software was written to provide an automated system to relieve the paperwork burden on processing units as well as to standardize the data collection and reporting requirements into one user friendly system the users manual for the system is located at the following website httpwwwhqda aocarmypentagonmilaoc_orgodlndrcdetainee20reporting20systemhtm the users manual was written for individual self instruction and provides the how to for use of the system it is organized in conjunction with the four main modules within the software processing query standard reports and system administration the basic purpose of each module is as follows accounting this provides three functions which allow the user to perform administration functions as well as internee admissions releases transfers escapes and deaths query this provides two functions which enable the user to generate various selected queries standard reports this provides four functions which enable the user to generate standard reports system admin this provides five functions that allow the user to perform various database maintenance functions as well as username and password access database management the drs creates sizeable database as all databases the management and maintenance can require special education or knowledge with the drs those database management and maintenance requirements have been minimized to improve user friendliness of the program and can be accessed through the drs software system administration menu the primary administrative functions are backing up data and compacting and repairing the database these functions are routine operations that will ensure the integrity of the database and should be performed periodically the system administrator also assigns permissions to approved users to access specific areas of the database drs integration with military police doctrine the detainee reporting system was developed to assist receiving and processing centers of intermentresettlement ir facilities and to automate the manual system of military forms and files used to maintain records according to multiservice regulation ar 1908 the military police field manual 31940 chapter 6 outlines the structure of receiving and processing centers for ir facilities although there is set standard for the setup of the processing stations understanding this manual will enable the user to employ metttc to operate the drs in networked configuration and enable maximum productivity see figure 31 b for an example of processing center integrated within an internment facility 5 field expedient restraints purpose to identify tactics for use of field expedient restraints on detainees to ensure unit security and provide temporary custody and control guidance in tactical situations the use of field expedient restraints include flexicuffs duct tape parachute cord and other assets are necessary to temporarily restrain detainees for force protection custody and control and movement the following considerations are provided field expedient restraints on detainees shall be employed in manner that is safe secure humane and professional combat commanders shall plan for and train personnel in field expedient restraint measures us personnel are expected to employ restraints in manner consistent with training provided by the service us personnel handling detainees shall make an assessment of the detainees risks to the unit mission this assessment will include at minimum the detainees behavior and physical condition for purposes of restraint positioning ie front or rear us personnel should also take into consideration the nature of the mission such as type of detainee length of travel destination and current situation regardless of whether restraints are used or the level of restraints detainee shall be transported without first being searched for weapons or contraband except when circumstances pose safety hazard or danger to the mission in the latter case search will be conducted as soon as practicable pat down search shall be the minimum search conducted confiscated items shall be bagged and tagged as soon as practical the use of zip lock bags is suggested to secure identity documents and small personal items an inventory sheet of all items confiscated should be placed in the zip lock bag and affixed to the detainee to prevent loss duct tape may be used to secure zip lock bag to the detainee during transport large trash bags may be used to secure larger items caution should be exercised in cases where detainees are gagged andor hooded as such field expedient measures when required may impair restrict prevent or stop detainees ability to breathe sand bags as hoods restrict airflow and should be used as last resort in some areas of the world the detainees own headgear can be used as an ideal hood device ie turbans andor burqas detainees who have demonstrated violent behavior or strong likelihood of escape shall be restrained behind the back while being transported as well as at any other time in custody when held in an area that is not secure including vehicles or buildings compliant detainees are restrained in the front to facilitate movement during transport there may be advantages in restraining detainees to fixed objects or in multiples in emergent circumstances for example detainees can and should be linked together during transport removal adjustment or application of restraints during transportation or escort shall be at the discretion of the mission leader the level and types of restraints used shall be reasonable under the circumstances restraints shall not be used to inflict punishment nor to restrict blood circulation or breathing us personnel shall take reasonable and prudent care to avoid causing unnecessary physical pain or extreme discomfort when applying restraints 6 tactical level logistics considerations needs and considerations checklist planning factors acquisition lawprocedures for detainee supply requirements aerialseaport throughput

to ensure the safety of the aircraft and all us resources the secondary concern is to ensure the security of the detainees aircraft configurations will be determined based on the mission type and detainee throughput requirements missions may be classified as one of the following escort missions transporting mobile detainees and ambulatory patients only aeromedical evacuation mission transporting litterbound detainees only mixed escortaeromedical mission transporting both litterbound non ambulatory detainees and mobile detainees or ambulatory patients technical considerations technical considerations will drive many of the configurations of the aircraft as rule twentyinch centers will be used for the bench seating on the aircraft general technical considerations include but are not limited to weight considerations maximum passenger considerations positioning of the friendly forces comfort pallet forward in pallet position 1 positioning of the detainee comfort pallet aft in pallet position 11 the use of pallet position 12 for crew baggage the use of pallet position 13 for backend crew baggage and equipment space and weight limitations for the ramp pallet on pallet position 13 available litter positions for aeromedical missions floorloaded equipment weapons crates suppliesetc at various locations crewdriven considerations tactical considerations the inside of an aircraft is basically linear environment running fore to aft and requires friendly forces to adjust their tactics based upon the terrain inside the aircraft the ability to establish physical security framework within the aircraft to ensure positive control of every detainee all the time is the primary driver for the establishment of the backend team configuration and aircraft configuration general tactical considerations include but are not limited to the ability of security elements to contain any attempted breach of security the mobility of friendly security elements the ability of security elements to respond in timely and safe manner the lateral and forwardbackward movement of forces the timely ability for leaders support specialists and response forces to maneuver to incidents and positively affect the situation to ensure mission success the reduction of physical congestion at critical points the ability to mass friendly forces when needed the ability to maneuver to economize forces when necessary and respond to multiple security andor medical incidents simultaneously the ability of security elements to mutually support each other the countermobility of detainees the ability to position forces for immediate and continual visual assessment of detainees the ability to establish defenseindepth for critical or sensitive aircraft areas such as the flight deck the ability to rapidly and safely egress the aircraft in the event of an emergency aircraft configuration should provide friendly forces with adequate engagement lanes should deadly force be necessary and ensure fire is directed away from critical aircraft systems configurations the establishment of functional efficient and effective configuration on the aircraft for each type of mission will provide for better security and servicing of the detainees mated with an appropriate backend team configuration tactics will be devised and fielded to meet the known and postulated security and medical problems associated with the detainee transport proper aircraft and team configuration will also reduce the likelihood of an escalation of force within the aircraft and allow security elements to minimize risk and liability by allowing them to respond quickly and effectively to keep the incident at lower level of risk and threat to the aircraft and friendly forces note on schematics the

location upon landing at an unscheduled stop if possible the detainees will not be removed from the aircraft emergencies threatening the safety of the crew friendly forces or the detainees may force the evacuation of the aircraft upon landing the security oic will contact hq amc security forces for guidance on security actions to be taken if possible the foreign clearance guide will be consulted for restrictions regarding arming and employment of forces security actions if the detainees can remain onboard the aircraft if the detainees are not removed from the aircraft the oic will establish security for the aircraft and will ensure the safety and security of the detainees the oic will determine if friendly forces on the ground can and will provide physical security for the aircraft oics should be cognizant of the threats to the aircraft and the density and importance of the personnel inside the aircraft when determining onsite security requirements an aircraft loaded with friendly personnel and detainees warrants more than routine protection level 3 security if the friendly forces can provide adequate security the oic will ensure appropriate communications and liaison is maintained between the onboard security element and the onground defense forces if inadequate security is at the divert location to protect the aircraft the oic will direct the flight deck denial team to arm with m16 rifles and take up positions to defend the aircraft if diplomatic agreements allow the arming of united states personnel off of the aircraft an adequate number of security forces personnel will be positioned to protect the aircraft against hostile action if unable to arm personnel outside of the aircraft the oic will position an adequate number of personnel of the flight deck denial team on the ground outside of the aircraft to perform immediate visual assessment iva of the aircraft area this will likely be the whole flight deck denial team the oic will arm one of the quick reaction teams with m16 rifles for external protection of the aircraft and position them inside the aircraft in hatches doorways et in overwatch positions in support of the onground iva
