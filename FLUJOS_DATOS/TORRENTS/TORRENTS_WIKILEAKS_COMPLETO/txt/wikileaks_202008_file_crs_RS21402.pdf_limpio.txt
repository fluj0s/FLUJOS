act but also protected valid rs 2477 rights of way in existence at the time of repeal certain rights of wa asserted under rs 2477 may be controversial because they run either through undevelope d areas that might otherwise qualify for wilderness designation or across lands that are now private or included in federal reserves such as parks or national forests httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21402crs2

however in that it can be argued that the court looked to the common law meaning of the terms used in rs 2477 includi ng eg that highway could include river rather than on the historical context and rms of congressional enactments involving roads merged acceptance by state for purposes of state maintenance and tort liab ility with acceptance by state of the terms of the fede ral grant and relied on state cases that did not involve the federal government or its interestson january 6 2003 the department of th interior doi publishe d new final regulations on disclaimers of interest3 issued under 315 of flpma these new regulations amend existing di sclaimer regulations at 43 cfr part 1860 subpart 1864 to allow states state political subdivisions and others to apply for disclaimers dropping requirements from the previous regulations that claimant must be the owner of record and creating exceptions to the 12 year statute of limitations disclaimer is recordable document in which the united states declares th at it has property inte rest in land the issuance of disclaimer can help remove cloud from land title because it has the same effect as though the united states had conve yed any interest it has the explanatory materials published with the new rule assert that the rule is completely separate from determinations of the validity of rs 2477 rights of way claims yet also stated that disclaimers would be used to acknowledge rs 2477 rights of way initially the doi executed memorandum of understanding mou with the state of utah and negotiations were begun with other states to acknowledge rs 2477 rights of way by issuing disclaimers several applications for disclaimers were published but later withdrawn4 the relationship between the di sclaimer regulations and rs 2477 determinations is c ontroversial because congress in 108 of pl 104208 stated that rules pertaining to recognition or validity of rs 2477 rights of wa could be effective unless authorized by congress on march 22 2006 doi issued new rs 2477 guidance that rests on the 10th circuit case southern utah wilderness allian ce v bureau of land management 5 this guidance purports to be policy document and not to impose binding obligations on the agency or private parties and therefore doi asserts that it is not inc onsistent with pl 104208 the policy repeals previous rs 2477 policies and directs that the approach taken in the suwa case be followed even beyond the 10th circuit jurisdiction this approach allows broad role for state law in determining compliance with the elements of valid rs 2477 right of way6 doi directed the termination of the mou with utah as inoperative in light of the suwa decision it is not clear why this would be so except that the court in the suwa case distinguished between instances when federal land agencies might need to make rs 2477 deter minations to carry out executive f unctions related to the lands such as planning from instances involving terminations of legal title to real property the latter is judicial not an executive function it is one thing for an agency to make determinations regarding cond itions precedent to the passage of title and quite another for the agency to assert continuing authority to resolve by informal adjudication disputes between itself and private parties who claim that they acquired legal title to real property interest at some point in the past the c ourt noted instances in which the bureau of landhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21402crs3 7 suwa supra 2005 us app lexis 19381 at 40 8 yet the court also in commenting on the issue of burden of proof stat ed at 90 in note 20 that the burden may be different in cases wh ere the rs 2477 claim has previously been adjudicated or where there is federal discla imer of interest memorandum of understanding or other administrative recognition we have oc casion in this case to opine on the legal effect of such administrative determinations given that disclaimer has the same effect as quitclaim deed by the united states it is difficu lt to see how the court could conclude on the one hand that an executive agency may not properly d ecide title issues but then also intimate that agency disclaimers renouncing title could nonethele ss affect title adjudications see discussion of administrative disclaimers infra management and other agencies resolved title questions in court rather than deciding them7 doi acknowledged in its 2006 guidance that suwa found that blm lacks the authority to make binding dete rminations on the validity of rs 2477 rights of way yet the guidance also states that disclaimers remain available to settle questions regarding the united states interest in rights of way such disclaimers have the same effect as quitclaim deed estopping the united states from asserting claim to the interest that is disclaimed arguably use of administrative disclaimers in the context of disputed rs 2477 highways could cons titute binding administrative determination relating to title and hence may be ina ppropriate or invalid8 what are rs 2477 rights of way and why are they controversial rs 2477 rights of way are those obtained under an 1866 statute reenacted as 2477 of the revised statutes and later repealed by 706 of flpma the 1866 statutory language was succinct stating simply that the right of way for the construc tion of highways over public lands not reserved for public uses is hereby granted section 701 of flpma provided that valid rights of way in existe nce at the time of repeal in 1976 were to be recognized in most states it was clear whic h highway beds were valid because there had been an acceptance process under state w eg county maintenance or formal recognition in few states however there was clear system of acceptance or recording and the existence and recognition of the highways as factual matter was not always clear in these circ umstances determining whether way qualifies as rs 2477 highway can be difficult because the mean ing of construction highway and not reserved in the federal granting language and the appropriate scope of the role of state law have been controversial the issues are significant because areas traversed by asserted rs 2477 highways may be dis qualified from consideration fo r possible inclusion in the national wilderness preservati on system or might now be private lands or federal reserves such as parks or national forests cr eated after the establishment of the rights of way on the other hand validating rs 2477 rights of way may increase access to and across the federal lands and f acilitate economic development flpma 315 regulations section 315a of flpma authorizes the secretary to issue disclaimers when property interest of the united states has terminated

recordable federal discla imer of interest has an effect equivalent to quitclaim deed the original disclaimer regulations add that although disclaimer does not actually convey title10 presumably because the disclaimer indicates there is title interest of the united states to be conveyed it may stop the united states from later asserting claim to the lands these regulations also state that the purpose of the procedure is to eliminate the necessity fo r court action in the circumstances set out in 315 the previous regulations limited those who could apply to use the procedure to any present owner of record11 limitation that does not appear in the statute the new regulations allow any entity to file an application for disclaimer and also provide that although most applicants must file within 12 years of the time they knew or should have known of claim of the united states this time limitation does not apply to states the explanatory materials i ndicate that this is to make th 315 regulations consistent with the quiet title act qta which has stri ct 12year limitation except for states and state has been narrowly construed such that counties and other subdivisions of state cannot avail themselves of the exception12 however the new disclaimer regulations also add definition of state as including state political subdivisions and any of its creations and other official local governmental entities this language is not elaborated on but appears to include any independent commission or body state or possibly county might choose to cr eate for any purpose13 which implies that these entities may now seek disclaimers even thoug h they could not undertake suit under the qta scope of flpma 315 disclaimers what were the intended uses and scope of 315 there is little legislative history of 315 except that it was to be used when the united states had interest in certain lands and it was to eliminate the necessity for court action or private relief legislation in that circumstance14 absent more detailed legislative history to indicate the intent of congress court might look to other provisions and to the history of title disputes historically it was difficult to correct title problems involving the united states the united states as the federal sovereign is immune from suit but may waive its sovereign immunity and one cannot advers ely possess property against the united states and thereby obtain title typically special acts of congress were used to clear up title problems the supreme court has held that the quiet title act qta of 197215 is now the exclusive means by which adverse claimants can challenge the united stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21402crs5 16 block v north dako ta 461 us 273 1983 17 id at 287 18 28 usc 2409ae 19

confirm disclaimer of interest issued in the context of qta suit19 flpma was complicated and detailed stat ute that developed over several years to consolidate and modernize the statutes on the remaining public domain lands managed by the bureau of land management one of the major policy changes of flpma was to put in place policy of retention of the remaining federal lands unless certain facts justifying disposal are present20 the general policy of the government is that there must be some authority for the disposal of federal propert to be lawful21 issuance of disclaimer is not conveyance but indicates that there is interest of the united states in particular property given the flpma po licy of retention of nds an argument may be made that conservative in terpretation of the scope of 315 is prudent and the process should not be used to determine title on the other nd the brevity of 315 and the sparse legislative history may allow consid erable range of discretion to the secretary it also is not clear whether the disclaimer process can be used to disclaim less than full fee title interest in lands or if so wh ether disclaimers are appropriate in the rs 2477 context the explanatory materials with the new regulations note that there have been only 62 disclaimers issued under 315 since its enactment in 197622 and none resolved rs 2477 issues congressional language on regulati ons pertaining to rs 2477 language enacted by congress relative to r s 2477 may apply to the expansion of the availability of disclaimers to adjudicate and acknowledge rs 2477 claims following the issuance of proposed rs 2477 regulati ons in 1993 that generated controversy congress enacted prohibition on using appropr iated funds to prom ulgate or implement rule concerning rs 2477 rights of way this approach was re iterated and broadened in the 1997 omnibus appropriations act which stated final rule or regulation of any agency of the federal government pertaining to the

statutory language was deleted from the interior appropriations act for fy1998 in reliance on the assertion that the language in the 1997 act was permanent law and hence an additional enactment was unnecessary24 there have been further statutory prohibitions since and further attempts at rs 2477 regulations committee report language states that the statutory language does not limit the ability of the department to acknowledge or deny the validity of claims under rs 2477 25 the clinton administration submitted legisl ative proposal on r s 2477 but it was not introduced arguably 108 of pl 104208 technically onl prevents rules that set out specific standards for rs 2477 rights of way26 and is unrelated to the disclaimer rule changes27 it can also be argued that the utah mou and the new doi guidance confirm that the newdisclaimer regulations are to be part of new adjudication process to clear up rs 2477 claims 28 the expansion of parties who may now qualify to file for disclaimers and fit within the waiver of the 12year limitation on administrative claims many applications may now be filed for 315 disclaimers related to rs 2477 rights of way29 this fact combined with the doi use of the 10th circuit approach to evaluating compliance with the elements of valid rs 2477 grant may resu lt in the use of the administrative disclaimer process to validate many more rs 2477 rights of way than in the past it is not known whether lawsuits will challenge this process legislation in the 109th congress hr 3447 would defi ne the crucial terms in the rs 2477 grant and would establish ag ency processes for determining the validity of rs 2477 rights of way subject to judi cial review the bill was referred to three subcommittees of house resources committee on july 26 2005 but
