imagery products products collected five canned global hawk images pulled from the china lake cohost additional comments after discussions with the gbs support here in canberra the gbs issues of not being able to receive the imagery packets from china lake has not been resolved furthermore after troubleshooting last friday with the gbs support in china lake it has been discovered that the issue is not isolated her in canberra it is with all receive nodes the lesson here is for all gbs support to gi ve daily updates to the leads at every node so the leads can feed that information back we may have been able to resolve this issue earlier if the other nodes would have fed this information in timely manner canadian army task force victory location ecr pocs major keith laughton personnel 45

sensor data was sufficiently terse to be allowed through the guard other sensorweb sensors have been truncated to be able to pass their data across the guard to ddte this problem is universal not limited to sensorweb we put manned client in the jbaiic trailer this morning we have initiated sensor alert service in t heir name to push the data to them in their desired cot format this is not
