august 4 2005 robert pirog specialist in energy economics and policy resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress oil industry profits analysis of recent performance summary high prices for crude oil in 2004 and into 2005 have reduced consumers purchasing power and raised costs for businesses while providing billions of dollars to the oil industry and oil exporting countries the industrys increased revenues have led to record profit levels as the 109th congress engages in oversight of recent broad energy legislation which aims to increase the domestic supply of crude oil to mitigate oil price increases in the longer term another key factor in determining increased supply is how oil companies decide to allocate their profits between shareholder returns and investment in oil production this report is written in response to number of requests from congress concerning profits in the oil industry this report provides background information concerning the level of oil industry profits the sources of those profits and discussion of the potential uses of profits in response to the increased price of crude oil since the fall of 2004 profits of virtually all firms in all segments of the oil industry have increased however the greatest increases have been in the downstream or refining and marketing segments of the industry these increases in profit are apparent whether the major integrated oil companies the independents or refiners are considered lending some credence to the viewpoint that industry profits are the result of factors beyond the elevated price of crude oil historically the current combination of high oil prices and high profits have been seen before and periods of low prices and profits tended to follow the relatively high profit levels earned in refining and marketing suggest that conditions in the petroleum products markets including the gasoline diesel and jet fuel segments contributed to earned profits above and beyond the effect of higher crude oil prices key factors in these markets included tight refining capacity and low inventory levels mergers acquisitions and asset sales may also have changed the relative profit positions of many firms in the industry all of these factors have been influenced by investment decisions in the oil industry firms in the oil industry are likely to use their recently earned profits in variety of ways they are holding record cash balances buying back their shares and increasing dividends merger and acquisition activity in the industry again appears to be on the rise in addition the major oil companies are investing in variety of energy related projects although not necessarily oil including liquified natural gas and gastoliquids technologies these projects tend to be international in scope in the longer term investments in exploration production and refining capacity are likely to be needed to mitigate the high prices of

increase in the price of crude oil which began in 2004 and has continued into 2005 has been major factor contributing to the record profits earned in the oil industry however other factors were likely also at work high capacity utilization in the refining industry led to increases in profit for refiners exceeding that for the industry as whole companies ability to expand output either of crude oil or petroleum products also might have affected profitability the effects of mergers acquisitions and other asset transactions also likely affected the profit performance of many firms in the industry perhaps of even more long term importance than the level of profits in 2004 and 2005 is what the oil industry chooses to do with them if firms invest earned profits into expanding capacity at key stages in the production chain consumers might expect to see expanded supply with moderating effect on price if firms do not make significant investments in production capacity or if those investments experience sharply diminishing returns in terms of volumes of oil and petroleum products per dollar invested then the moderating effect on price is likely to be limited in market economy decisions on the use of profit is the responsibility of the industry in which they are earned however because of the central importance of petroleum based products to the functioning of the economy as well as the direct effect of oil prices on consumers budgets public interest in the level as well as the use of profits tends to be high also government regulation can have direct impact on the ability or willingness of firms to make investments ie refineries and this could have ripple effect on other upstream and downstream investments and ultimately affect petroleum product supply on the market the price of crude oil surged during the last eight months of 2004 with the price of barrel of west texas intermediate wti the standard benchmark oil reaching over 55 in october this price represented 60 increase over the low price for the year reached in january 2004 of 3431 the average price of wti per barrel was 25 higher in the last six months of the year than in the first six months after moderating somewhat at the end of 2004 and early in 2005 crude oil prices went above 60 per barrel in the summer months gasoline prices which more directly affect consumers peaked in may 2004 earlier than those of crude oil which peaked in october the price of reformulated gasoline at new york harbor in january 2004 was 100 per gallon by may 2004 crs2 that price had risen 41 to 141 per gallon gasoline prices peaked again in june 2005 rising to 158 per gallon1 these price increases represent money transfer from consumers of oil and petroleum products to the us oil industry and foreign oil producers for example us consumers used on average about 9 million barrels per day of gasoline in 2004 with the average price of gasoline for the year about 028 per gallon higher than in 2003 american consumers spent an additional 105 million per day for gasoline compared to 2003 this money became increased revenues for the oil industry in functioning market economy increases in revenue are likely to lead to investment in the industry expansion of supply and ultimately moderating prices for consumers in the longer term if this selfcorrecting process is not working this could be an indication that factors other than traditional profit and investment incentives are at work these would likely result in additional long term increases in price and profit for the industry the public has an obvious interest in determining whether the market process is working effectively to expand supply in the oil industry in 2004 the net incomes of the nine integrated oil companies rose by 39 compared to similar period in 2003 while revenues rose by 262 net incomes of independent oil and gas producing firms rose by 37 over the same period while the net incomes of independent refiners and marketers rose by 190 over the same time period on revenue increases of 27 and 45 respectively3 an obvious explanation cited for these elevated profit levels is that the world price of oil was high factor attributable to forces in the global oil market force over which even the largest oil companies have little direct control this report analyzes the profit performance of firms in the oil industry evaluates factors that might have affected profitability in the oil industry and examines the use of profits by the industry and the implications for the development of the oil market profit performance introduction profit analysis may be carried out using total profits and their yearly growth or with profit rates total profit analysis is useful in evaluating the effect of the industrys profitability on expenditure flows within the economy as well as the potential command over resources held by companies in the industry yearly growth of profits can show whether the industry is becoming more or less of factor in over all expenditure flows in the economy profit analysis based on profit rates is useful in examining the effectiveness of the firms management in using available resources profit rate analysis is also useful 1 energy information administration weekly petroleum status report for the week ending july 22 2005 table 14 p27 gasoline price data does not include

report the focus is on total profits and the growth of profits within the oil industry and the likely uses of profits by the industry specifically the potential ability of the industry to invest in oil supply related projects4 profits in the oil industry have been volatile over the past three decades reflecting oil price changes as well as other market effects for example net income for the major energy companies as defined by the energy information administration eia increased almost threefold by 1981 compared to 1977 on the oil price increases associated with the iraniraq war by 1986 net incomes of the major energy companies had sunk below 1977 levels profits peaked and declined at least three other times during the period 198720025 volatility in the price of oil which leads to volatility in profits makes investment planning risky investments which might qualify for implementation if high oil price is assumed may not qualify if lower price of oil is assumed this uncertainty may have contributed to the cyclical nature of investment and capacity expansion in the industry major oil company profits in 2004 oil industry profits are widely identified as related to world oil

was 25 or almost 10 per barrel higher than the average price for the first six months of the year which was 3679 per barrel if the profit performance of the oil industry was based or related only to the price of oil given normal lags in the production chain between producing crude oil and distributing petroleum products it might have been expected that profits might have risen late in 2004 and

future and spot market prices more reliable measure of the real cost crs5 of crude oil to the nations refiners is the refiners acquisition cost of crude oil as shown in table 1 for 2003 through 2005 this composite cost measure is weighted average of the cost of domestic and imported crude oils used by refiners and also reflects the mix of various qualities of crude oils used in refineries refineries of different levels of technological complexity can use different mixes of crude oil to produce varying mixes of petroleum products within technological limits this ability to vary the production mix can be used to enhance profitability when price differentials between sweet light and heavy sour crude oils or between light and heavy product mixes change figure 2 shows the difference between light and heavy crude oils was generally less than 10 per barrel during the period 1992 to 2002 the spread increased in 2004 and into 2005 the average monthly difference between light and heavy crude oil in 2003 was approximately 7 per barrel the average difference increased to over 10 per barrel in 2004 approaching 15 per barrel at times for the first three months of 2005 the

peak of almost 138 per gallon occurred in october the timing of these peaks are similar to those observed in the crude oil market prices continued to be high in 2005 with peak price of over 152 per gallon attained in april 2005 the high gasoline prices of 2004 also brought what some identified as partial decoupling of the oil and gasoline markets fears related to limited refinery capacity low inventory levels and strong demand growth in china and other parts of the world led some analysts to conclude that gasoline prices might remain high even if crude oil markets weakened these conditions might be expected to yield high margins for refiners table 2 reports the basic financial performance of the major integrated oil companies from 2002 through 2004 crs7 table 2 financial performance of

lower net income in 2004 than in 2003 five of the companies in this group posted net income gains in excess of 50 for 2004 while the average gain in net income was approximately 40 comparing 2004 to 2002 base the gains in net income totaled over 175 for the major integrated oil companies total revenue growth for 2004 compared to 2003 was 35 for the group which was less than the 44 growth in net income suggesting that possibly the greater profitability of the major oil companies in 2004 did not arise solely from the higher price of crude oil compared to 2002 revenue growth for 2004 was approximately 70 less than the 175 growth in net income for the same period the profit rate on sales for this group of oil companies based on the totals of revenue and net income reported in table 2 were 7 for 2004 65 for 2003 and 43 in 2002 the growth in the profit rate experienced by these companies suggests that the stronger underlying market fundamentals in the crude oil and oil product

large increases in oil and gas production for most companies for 2004 more than half of the companies produced less oil during this year of high prices than they did in 2003 the total increase in oil production by the group of 19 was largely attributable to the 19 increase of one company bp the production results for natural gas are even more uniform every company except one occidental produced less natural gas in 2004 than in 2003 yielding total 31 decrease in production from the group as whole table 4 reports the downstream refining and marketing results for the major integrated oil

major integrated oil companies in expanding production of crude oil and oil products may be the result of several factors unfavorable geologic and political factors might have inhibited output expansion while the decision to expand oil and gas production in the united states is generally based on the underlying market economics the geology of many producing regions in the united states may not support large increases in output especially without financial investment in new technologies many us oil and gas fields have either peaked or are in decline making it difficult to expand production irrespective of the available price incentives overseas oil and gas production decisions may reflect the policies of the host governments the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec quotas or host nations tax policies another possible explanation for the relatively slow production response by the major integrated oil companies in reaction to high oil prices might be that significant investments are required and that the resulting time lags might be long enough to delay the appearance of additional supply on the market the major oil companies have been active in international investment although good part of that investment has been in new product technologies such as gas to liquids and liquefied natural gas these projects requiring multibillion dollar investments take up to five to seven years to complete this could be one explanation why little additional output of gasoline and other refined products has appeared to result from higher prices in the short term crs10 oil companies are owned by shareholders and managerial performance is evaluated in terms of corporate earnings it is possible that because of limitations on the ability of the firms to invest in additional oil and gas production in the short term profits have been returned to investors in the form of dividends or the buy back of shares to enhance the market capitalization of the companies independent oil company profits the profit picture for the independent oil and gas producers with respect to net incomes and total revenues in 2004 was in some ways similar to that of the major integrated companies however some features of their performance differed from that of the major companies table 5 presents data for ten independent producers aggregate net income for the group of 10 independent oil and gas producers in 2004 rose by approximately the same rate just below 40 as that of the major integrated oil companies similarly revenues grew by over 25 the major difference in the picture for the independent oil and gas producers is that they raised output during 2004 by multiple of the amounts registered by the major companies oil production was up by over 125 and natural gas production rose by almost 4 this increased production may however be partly the result of asset acquisition by the independent companies over the past several years the major integrated oil companies have sold off smaller producing fields and facilities which have been acquired by the independent companies for this reason it is possible that the increased production in this sector as well as the small production increases recorded by the major companies might be related and reflect an ownership transfer of existing assets crs11 table 5 financial performance of

the major integrated oil companies in their comparable downstream business although the independents production base was smaller9 the 9 increase in product sales translated into 45 increase in revenues which resulted in 190 increase in net 9 not all the increase in product sales was necessarily due to expanding production over the past decade the oil industry has experienced asset churning the major oil companies have sold producing fields refineries and other assets as result of merger and acquisition requirements inadequate returns from smaller fields and refineries or changes in business focus to more international stance these assets have typically been acquired by the independent oil and gas producers and the independent refiners and marketers these asset transfers might bias the major integrated oil companies production totals downward while the independents production totals rise the net effect might just be reallocation of existing productive capacity crs13 income with every company in the reporting category except one achieving at least triple digit increases this performance coupled with the downstream profitability of the major integrated oil companies gives some support to the viewpoint that in addition to high oil prices conditions in the petroleum product markets especially gasoline decoupled from their traditional linkage to crude oil and generated independent market tightness and higher prices key profit indicators in the refining industry are the gross and net refining margins10 table 7 presents data for the twenty four firms included in the

gross profit margin is defined as the revenue achieved from petroleum product sales minus the cost of crude oil the primary input when further deduction in operating costs is made the result is the net margin these margins are usually expressed on per barrel basis 11 the eia publishes aggregated financial data for both major and independent energy producers company specific data on refining

crude oil are likely indication that tightness in the gasoline market which is linked to refining sector running at nearly full capacity has led to profits that increased by larger percentage than the price of crude oil another indication of tightness in the refining sector is that imports of finished gasoline as well as gasoline blending components have been increasing and were at record levels in 2004 it is also true that the number of operating refineries in the united states has declined to 149 from peak of 324 in 1981 significant new refineries have been constructed in the united states for quarter of century the refining capacity growth that has occurred in the united states since 1990 has been largely due to improvements made at existing facilities called capacity creep use of oil profits refinery investment an expansion of refinery capacity in the united states might alleviate the portion of petroleum product price increases not due to the high price of crude oil construction of new refineries in the united states would add stability to the supply of gasoline and other petroleum products the current capacity is stretched nearly to the limit to accommodate growing petroleum product demand in addition the growing us dependence on imported gasoline and petroleum products would be reduced reinvesting profit into growing profitable business is also normal business strategy however current conditions may limit potential expansion the key factor in determining whether new refinery capacity will be constructed in the united states is the underlying economics an oil company seeking to meet gasoline demand in the us market can do that in any of three ways the company can either expand existing refineries build new refinery or import additional gasoline from overseas the economics dictate that companies choose the cheapest alternative given that all gasoline will sell for the same price irrespective of source in 2005 it is likely that the cheapest source of gasoline is through imports europe is thought to have surplus gasoline capacity as their vehicle fleet is in transition to diesel fuel and refineries are still largely oriented toward now excess gasoline production12 expansion of existing refineries is likely the next cheapest source of product expansion of existing refineries avoids many or all of the fixed costs associated with new refinery and allows firms to benefit from economies of scale in the refining process construction of new refineries is likely the most expensive source of new product as shown in table 7 not only have the returns to refiners been low on average but they have also been volatile even recent profit performance has not been uniformly good although returns in 2004 and 2003 were favorable 2002 was year of very low return as result of the observed volatility in returns the industry might question whether the current increases in profitability are the beginning of 12 oil and gas journal europe sees growing

respect to the permanence of high refining returns is longer term projection for the price of crude oil supply increases up and down the oil supply chain are normally linked to investment based on net present value analysis investment is likely to take place only if the long term forecasted price of crude oil is high enough to generate projected cash flows sufficient to justify the multibillion dollar costs of major petroleum projects if the companies use projected oil prices in the 25 to 35 per barrel range in investment planning decisions limited extra investment and supply expansion can be expected to develop one oil analyst has asserted that prices might need to remain in the 50 to 80 per barrel range for sustained period for investment to occur in sufficient volume to build up comfortable cushion of spare oil production capability13 reluctance to invest based on current price levels might reflect historical experience with the priceinvestmentsupply dynamic of the oil market as result of the rise in the price of crude oil associated with the iraniraq war of 197980 supply from nonopec sources increased and demand declined prices during this period reached real values corrected for inflation of between 50 and 80 per barrel and then declined to nominal value of 11 per barrel by 1985 investments undertaken early in the decade based on an expectation of continued high prices would have likely not been profitable in the market conditions that actually evolved refinery investment trends over the past two decades have been influenced by environmental compliance requirements eia has studied the effect of refinery investment required by environmental regulations and its relationship to profitability the eia report found that return on investment in the refining industry was reduced by 42 from 1996 to 2001 as result of mandated investment expenditures14 the industry is currently preparing to expand and introduce low sulfur gasoline and diesel fuels these investment requirements may claim share of the companies capital budget and reduce returns in parallel with past experience the permitting process has been identified by some as an impediment to refinery investment in the united states critics contend that even if it is possible to assemble all of the necessary permits to construct refinery the long time line required for approvals will tend to make the investment less attractive one example that has been cited concerning the length of the time required for the permitting process associated with the possible construction of new grassroots

gulf coast as well other factors15 the company first applied for an air permit in 1999 at another arizona site the application was withdrawn in 2004 local groups opposed the project based on possible health and environmental risks the us environmental protection agency decided not to object to an air permit for the refinery on march 21 2005 the company awaits an air permit from the arizona department of environmental quality expected to be issued in 2005 after that permit is obtained approximately two dozen additional permits need to be obtained ranging from county permit for zoning approval to presidential permit from the us state department to allow the importation of mexican crude oil16 the tight petroleum products market in california with the resulting high prices as well as the generally good returns to refining since 2000 have maintained interest in this project the long delays in construction startup might have led to the project being cancelled if the underlying economics especially in the california market had not been so strong in recent years mergers and acquisitions the oil industry of today has evolved to its current structure partly through years of mergers acquisitions and joint ventures in may 2004 the government accountability office gao released study on the effects of mergers and the restructuring of the us petroleum industry17 gao found that between 1991 and 2000 there were over 2600 mergers acquisitions and joint ventures in the us petroleum industry majority of the transactions took place in the last five years of the decade the transactions took place at all stages in the chain of production from exploration and production through refining and marketing these transactions included deals among the very largest oil companies for example in 1999 exxon corporation acquired mobil oil in 1998 british petroleum and amoco formed bp amoco which acquired arco in 2000 and in 2001 chevrontexaco was formed merger activity is again on the rise in the us petroleum industry in april 2005 chevrontexaco made 17 billion stock and cash bid to acquire unocal the number 9 oil company in the united states ranked by reserves of crude oil

with large cash reserves on their balance sheets are searching for ways to better position themselves on the world oil market increase their crude oil reserves and other assets and create economies of scale and cost savings individually they are able to accomplish these goals through mergers and acquisitions in addition large amount of accumulated profits is returned to investors usually at premium price through these transactions although these transactions may improve the market position of the firms involved and imply the expenditure of billions of dollars of accumulated profit they do little to improve the nations demand and supply balance with respect to oil and petroleum products in the near term dividends and share purchases19 the firms that make up the oil industry are private firms that use shareholder capital to engage in business operations when they make profits they are obliged to return those profits to shareholders unless management deems it likely that business opportunities exist such that reinvestment will yield even larger future profits for shareholders the major oil companies have increased dividends for shareholders but in general by less than increases in available funds for example exxonmobil increased quarterly dividends by 002 per share during 2004 an increase of about 8 however during the last quarter of 2004 earnings per share increased by 042 an increase of about 47 for the years 2002 through 2004 earning per share increased from 168 to 389 an increase of approximately 130 but dividends the amount actually paid out to shareholders increased by only about 15 exxonmobil did however reduce the number of shares outstanding over the period by about 300 million to 64 billion from 67 billion if company repurchases its shares the value of shares outstanding is likely to increase and the company may choose to resell them on the market if it needs capital in the future exxonmobil also held over 18 billion in cash at the end of 2004 an increase of 75 over the year similar dividend strategy was in place at chevrontexaco where quarterly dividends increased by 003 per share during 2004 an increase of about 8 while earnings per share almost doubled compared to levels attained in the last quarter of 2003 for chevrontexaco earnings per share increased over the period 2002 to 2004 by an approximate factor of 10 from 054 to 628 while yearly dividends per share increase from 140 to 153 an increase of about 9 the number of chevrontexaco shares outstanding declined by about 29 million 19 financial data used in this section was obtained at httpwwwhooverscom viewed on june 21 2005 crs18 conocophillips over the period 2002 through 2004 increased yearly dividends from 074 per share to 090 per share an increase of about 21 however earnings per share increased from loss of 031 in 2002 to 581 in 2004 conocophillips increased the number of shares outstanding over the period by about 34 million limited dividend payouts coupled with modest expansion of investment in relation to profit has left oil companies highly liquid and well positioned to take advantage of future market opportunities conclusion since oil price increases began in 2004 the oil industry has earned increased profits these profits might have resulted from other factors in addition to the increased price of oil key factor in increased profitability might be the tightness in the us gasoline market factor related to the lack of enough refinery capacity to meet us demand for petroleum products if oil and petroleum product prices are to decrease supply will likely have to increase relative to demand expanded supply results from investment in the various stages of the oil industry production process from exploration and development of new oil fields to increased refinery capacity if the underlying economic parameters and the regulatory environment are not encouraging investment might not be undertaken historically volatile prices and profit levels coupled with tight regulatory environment contribute to industry uncertainty other legitimate uses for earned profits include paying higher dividends and retiring outstanding shares acquiring assets through merger and acquisition and investing in new product areas these uses of profit may benefit shareholders and strategically position the firm in the global market but they do less to expand the supply of oil and products on the market and thereby reduce prices for consumers as result of significant time lags that tend to occur in the oil industry it may be too soon to know whether or not investments in the industry if taken will result in the increased supply of oil and petroleum products needed to reduce prices and consumers costs crs19 appendix measuring profit in market economy firms key measure of success is its ability to earn profit profit is important to firms because it is signal to the financial markets and investors that the firm is worthy of funding either through debt or equity capital firms that earn less profit than expected by the market have difficulty funding investment opportunities with negative implications for growth firms that consistently earn less than adequate profits tend to experience slow growth stagnation and ultimately failure profit is seemingly simple concept total cost is subtracted from total revenue leaving residual total profit in this approach profit is measured in dollars for the oil industry the simple total revenue minus total cost approach is complicated by the difficulty in neatly separating the revenuegenerating outputs of the firms from the costcreating production inputs for any given oil company crude oil price changes may affect both the revenues and costs of the company if the company is an upstream producer and sells crude oil the production of crude oil is revenue generating however downstream operations notably refining and marketing make use of crude oil as raw material and for them the acquisition of crude oil is cost as result it is not always clear that an increase in the price of crude oil will raise or lower profits for firms with differing positions in the upstream and downstream segments of the industry another key factor in the profit calculation is how easily the increase in the cost of crude oil can be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices for gasoline and other refined products without suffering more than proportionate decrease in sales if cost increases can be passed on to consumers and the firm has significant upstream business interests then it is more likely that an increase in the price of crude oil will yield increased profits simple way to rank companies for comparative purposes is by total profit however this type of simple ranking is likely to provide misleading picture of the relative performance of the companies in the oil industry while the total dollar value of profit is important it may be equally important to know the value of the resources or assets at firms disposal that were used to earn given dollar level of profit the size of the firm relative to the level of total profit is important especially for investment analysts for this reason the most commonly used measures of profit in investment analysis are expressed as percentages or rates independent of specific magnitudes the use of percentages allows meaningful comparisons to be made between companies of different sizes and differing access to resources profit also can be measured to include or exclude special nonrecurring items that may temporarily affect companys revenues and costs for example if company incurs substantial costs and legal penalties associated with an environmental cleanup due to an oil spill at one of its facilities its profit performance for the relevant time period might well be negatively affected however profit numbers that include the costs resulting from the spill may tell potential investors crs20 and other interested parties little about the real continuing business performance of the company20 profits from continuing operations excluding onetime charges or revenues may be more informative for some purposes all stakeholders in company do not necessarily have an interest in the same conceptual definition of profit accountants are interested in profit calculations that meet generally accepted accounting practices and are consistent with the tax code economists use profit as signal to judge the efficiency of resource allocation decisions and include opportunity costs in their calculations21 potential investors in the companys stocks and bonds may choose to evaluate profit from still different perspective comparing profit to measure of the assets management had available for business purposes relative to the risk the company faced the profit rate even once the efficacy of using profit rate is determined measurement issues still need to be addressed since profit as rate or percentage must be expressed relative to some base an appropriate base must be specified three possible bases widely used in business analysis are sales assets and net worth or shareholder equity each is useful in answering particular questions about the operation of the business but none necessarily serves as an allpurpose profit measure the profit margin on sales uses the total sales revenue of the business as the base and expresses profit or net income as percentage of sales revenue profit rates expressed in this manner can answer questions as to whether increasing sales become more or less profitable as the business grows22 this profit measure can also lead analysts to basic questions as to whether the businesses prices were too low or too high or whether adequate cost controls were in place as the business expanded variation on this profit measure results from replacing net income in the calculation with operating income23 profits based on assets or the return on assets divides profit or net income by the value of the total assets of the business this measure allows analysts to determine how well management uses the asset base of the company to generate profits for investors if the asset base represents the tools available to management 20 large nonrecurring expense might however affect companys financial condition 21 opportunity costs are the value of the returns that could be earned in the next best alternative for example if firm earns 100000 in profits according to the tax laws but could earn 150000 from liquidating the firms resources and applying them to another activity an economist would observe that the firm lost 50000 by engaging in its current activities rather than having made 100000 in profit 22 the answer to this question requires set of profit results over time as sales have presumably grown in general it is more revealing to have time dependent set of profit data rather than one data point so that trends may be ascertained 23 operating income is defined as gross profit minus operating expenses it is profit before the payment of interest and income taxes it is considered to be measure of how well the firm has succeeded in making money from the sales of goods and services before financial and tax obligations are considered crs21 to carry out business activities the return on assets gives an indication of how effective management has been in using those tools this approach has been criticized by some because certain intangibles important to the functioning of the business may not receive adequate weight in this measure profitability rate popular with potential investors is the return on equity or the return on net worth this measure divides profit or net income by the value of shareholders equity in the firm since the fundamental accounting identity assets liabilities owners equity must always hold for every business this profit rate is generally greater than and at least equal to the return on assets24 this measure is especially interesting to investors who might plan to buy shares of stock in the business while this profit measure may be revealing to potential investors care should be exercised in its use if two businesses have the same asset value and the same level of profits differences in return on net worth can arise solely as result of the amount of debt financing on the firms balance sheet difference purely of financial structure unrelated to firms ability to efficiently produce goods and earn revenues from selling goods this can generate misleading conclusions about the strength of the firms performance because the choice of financial structure for business is not generally related to its current profitability from continuing operations another measure sometimes identified with profitability is earnings per share this measure divides profit or net income by the total number of shares of common stock outstanding earnings per share provides the prospective maximum of dividends per share that might be paid by the firm however it is not relevant measure to evaluate profit like the return on net worth it is affected by the capital structure of the company the division between equity and debt financing earnings per share can also be directly affected by strategic management decisions firms may decide to buy back shares of common stock and retire them holding them as treasury shares this type of strategy raises earnings per share by decreasing the number of outstanding shares over which any level of net income is divided this strategy might well be viewed negatively by financial analysts who might interpret it as signal that the firm does not have or recognize profitable investment opportunities available and hence chooses to return to shareholders the money they had invested in the company an important factor in analyzing profit data is that in many cases it is more informative to use comparative analysis comparisons can be made over time with other companies in the same industry or with other companies that bear the same level of risk timebased comparative profit analysis may be helpful because it suggests the direction the company is heading or the direction of market trends particular rate of profit might be viewed as favorable if it was embedded in trend of rising profit rates or unfavorable if embedded in trend of falling profit rates time trends might also help to identify correlations between profit and other factors which influence 24 in the case where firm has debt assets must equal owners equity and the two profit measures will be identical crs22 profits in addition key lags that affect profit are also more likely to be identified in time trend standing alone any rate of profit might be difficult to evaluate comparisons can be drawn with other firms in the same or closely related lines of business to determine whether particular firm is profit leader average or low profit earner within its industry cohort barring special circumstances which should be clearly reported in the companys financial statements if two firms in the same line of business with approximately the same asset base report very different profit rates it is possible that this differential might suggest that one or the other firms management strategy is superior looking at profit rates of different sized firms within the same industry allows the analyst to assess whether growth of the firm to larger scale may imply any advantage or disadvantage with respect to profit in some cases particularly for investment decisions the most relevant comparison is with firms with comparable level of risk independent of the line of business in which the firms are engaged25 this approach is appropriate for prospective investors because they may have less interest in what business activity firm undertakes than the results of that activity in terms of profits earned and risk borne in many cases profits can be expressed in comparison to an index of firms designed to show average or market returns and risk 25 risk is defined as the dispersion of the rate of return for the company in terms of the stock market risk is usually measured somewhat incompletely to reflect the dispersion in the movement of share prices without accounting for variations in dividends for other versions of this document see
