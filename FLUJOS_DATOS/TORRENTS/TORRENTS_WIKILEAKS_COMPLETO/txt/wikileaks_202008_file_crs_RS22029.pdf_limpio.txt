us govern ment did not discuss or consult on specific candidates2 mr wolfowitzs nomination was received w ith both criticism and praise according to edwin truman of the international institu for economics the truth of the matter is that paul wolfowitz is better qualified to be at the world bank than many other possible contenders on the other hand he comes with lot of baggage3 many critics reportedly consider mr wolfowitz to be the intellectual force behind us operations in iraq and are concerned that he may use the world bank as another front on the socalled global war on terror according to one expert former world bank economist william easterly mr wolfowitz is the embodiment of americans forcing other societies to adopt american values whether they want them or not4 the world bank under james wolfensohns direction has increased its work on governance reform in the past ten years but the banks charter strictly forbids the institution from incorporating political decisions in its lending decisions several us politicians have come out str ongly for mr wolfowitzs mination senator joe biden of delaware has commented that ive had t of talks about paul in european

see kahler p 4647 american president and the imf has had european managing director this convention was the outcome of gentleman s agreement struck at the 1944 bretton woods conference establishing the two institutions during the bretton woods negotiations the united states believed that the world bank should be headed by an american since the united states was th only capital surplus nation and world bank lending would be dependent on american fi nancial markets according to then us secretary of the treasury fred vinson the bank would have to be headed by us citizen in order to win the confidence of the banking community14 moreover he noted it would be impracticable to appoint us citizens to head both the bank and the fund15 the united states did not break the tradition in its world bank president selection rob nichols the assistant treasury secretary for public affairs has stated that the administration intends to c onduct an open candid and tran sparent selection process16 nonetheless many still criticize the pr ocess the financial times of london editorialized that the world bank president is an executive post yet the task of managing such diverse organization both knowledge ba nk and lender with occasional shifts of priorities by shareholder govern ments is difficult in the extreme this position above all should be open to successful refo rmers from the

wolfowitz and the bank the washington post march 31 2005 the debate over th useu convention the useu arrangement is considered by many of its critics as relic of the past whereas the united states clearly dominated the postworld war ii economy and europe was the region that the world bank was designed to reconstruct the current internationa l economy is less easily categorized moreover the original rationale for the united states claiming world bank leadership is obsolete international capital markets not united states financial markets are the major source of world bank capital in 2004 34 of the world banks borrowing was in dollars and substantial sh are of these were drawn from overseas dollar loan markets21 this was down from 51 in 2000 the world bank is longer solely reliant on domestic us capital market s to finance its lending operations22 nonetheless the united states and the europeans are the largest contributors to the imf and the world bank the willingness of the united states or europe to support these institutions could be diminished if their contributions were not commensurate with influence evidence of this is the pressure that the europeans placed on the united states to support the creation of new deputy presiden t post to be filled by european although many europeans argued in opposition to the wolfowitz nomination that the selection of high bank officers should be based on merit rather than on unilateral assertions of national power23 proposals for reform in july 2000 two internal working groups the world bank working group to review the process for selection of the president and the international monetary fund working group to review the process for selection of the managing director were created to discuss th selection procedure joint draft report of the working group was endorsed by the executive directors on april 26 2001 but never formally implemented th report declared among other things that transparency and accountability is critical to the selection process during the 2004 nomination of new imf managing director wide range of experts advocated revision of the ifi selecti on process moises naim editor of foreign policy magazine commented that the next chief executive of the imf and the world bank must be selected through process that gives them and their institutions the legitimacy that only competitive and transparent process can bestow nancy birdsall of the center for global development specifi cally pointed out the need to involve the major emerging markets of south american and asia as well as the worlds poorest countries according to dr birdsall the unw illingness of the us and the g7 to share power and responsibi lity in the gl obal financial institutions is already undermining the legitimacy and effectiveness of these institutions issues facing the world bank there are several differences between the united states and other bank member countries over development issues

2003 and in j une 2004 that ida had achieved the two sets of reform targets and requested an additiona l 100 million and 200 million in fiscal 2004 and 2005 appropriations respectively as incentive contri butions to ida congress however did not include this money in either the fiscal 2004 or 2005 appropriati on the april 2003 announcement came following meeting of ida donor s at which it was agreed that ida had met the targets specified earlier for nhancing its performance standards2005 gordon brown the chancellor of the uk treasury has called for rich countries to increase aid through various proposals such as an international finance facility iff which would issue special bonds securitized on future government aid budgets the us government germany and cana da have said that their public finance rules would not allow them to participate in an iff fac ility since they cannot account for borrowing up front dr taylor by contrast has placed emphasis on increasing aid efficiency and not the volume of aid this has complicated nego tiations for debt relief while the united kingdom would like to write off all imf and world bank debt for all very poor countries in addition to hipc countries with donor count ries increasing contributions to the world bank to fund the world banks debt reduction the united states believes the world bank can instead fund its own debt relief by refra ining from providing loans to such countries and instead moving to gran tbased assistance with tight er performance requirements the world bank and congress the 109th congress could face action

concerning us international economic policy and priorities at the institutions congress appropriated 138 billion to the mdbs in fy2004 and 1219 billion in fy2005 this amount fell in between the house
