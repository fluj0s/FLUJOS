oconnors opinions charles v dale legislative attorney american law division summary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22191 an examination of justice oconnors opinions reveals gradual shift in perspective regarding the legal and constitutional standards to be applied in evaluating governmental affirmative action efforts and the manner of their application in various legal and factual settings this report briefly surveys decisions of retiring justice sandra day oconnor in affirmative action cases an area where her opinions have frequently determined the outcome an examination of justice oconnors opinions reveals gradual shift in perspective regarding the legal and constitutional standards to be applied in evaluating governmental affirmative action efforts and the manner of their application in various legal and factual settings early on justice oconnor was notably in dissent from series of rulings in 1986 and 1987 which narrowly approved of remedial hiring preferences for minorities and women in statutory title vii employment discrimination cases these measures were deemed by majority of the justices to be proper remedy for manifest racial imbalance in traditionally segregated job categories if voluntarily adopted by private employers1 or for entrenched patterns of egregious and longstanding discrimination by the employer if imposed by judicial decree2 in either circumstance however the court required proof of remedial justification rooted in the employers own past discrimination and its persistent workplace effects of equal importance all racial preferences in employment were to be judged in terms of their adverse impact on identifiable nonminority group members but affirmative action preferences had to be sufficiently flexible temporary in duration and narrowly tailored to avoid becoming rigid quotas3 1 united steelworkers v weber 443 us 193 1979 2 local 28 sheet metal workers v eeoc 478 us 421 1986 3 united states v paradise 480 us 149 1987 johnson v transportation agency 480 us continued congressional research service the library of congress crs2 the five justice majority in those cases justices brennan marshall blackmun powell and stevens were opposed by minority consisting of chief justice rehnquist and justices white and scalia justice oconnor occupied middle ground arguably less tolerant of affirmative action than the brennanpowell majority and closer to the rehnquist minority4 thus she was part of fivejustice majority concurring in the judgment in wygant v jackson board of education5 which struck down as an equal protection violation term in the contract between local school board and its teachers that provided protection from layoff in reverse order of seniority for minority staff newly hired under boardinspired affirmative action policy initially justice oconnors concurrence searched for common ground among the conflicting views of her brethren in the final analysis she concluded the diverse formulations and the number of separate writings put forth by various members of the court in these difficult cases do not necessarily reflect an intractable fragmentation in opinion with respect to certain core principles6 ultimately however justice oconnor aligned herself with the plurality view that societal discrimination will not justify voluntary affirmative action remedies and that the layoff plan was infirm because it was overbroad and not narrowly tailored to the school boards past discrimination httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22191 not until 1989 did majority of the justices resolve the proper constitutional standard for review of governmental classifications by race enacted for remedial or other benign legislative purpose disputes prior to city of richmond v ja croson7 yielded divergent views as to whether state affirmative action measures for the benefit of racial minorities were subject to the same strict scrutiny as applied to invidious racial discrimination under the equal protection clause an intermediate standard resembling the test for genderbased classifications or simple rationality in croson an oconnor led 5 to 4 majority settled on strict scrutiny to invalidate 30 setaside of city contracts for minorityowned businesses mbes because the program was not narrowly tailored to compelling governmental interest while raceconscious remedies could be legislated in response to proven past discrimination by the affected governmental entities racial balancing untailored to specific and identified evidence of minority exclusion was impermissible justice oconnors opinion stressed several factors that collectively condemned the richmond mbe setaside program first there was specific evidence of past discrimination public or private as it relates to the exclusion of qualified mbes willing to perform city contracts and the 30 benchmark reflected completely unrealistic assumption that mbe participation in particular trade will mirror minority representation in the community second the richmond ordinance was flawed by gross overinclusiveness in that it applied not only to blacks but also to various other groups 3 continued 616 1987 4 see selig joel l

minority participation in public contracts finally the focus on mbe availability with regard to whether minority applicant had actually suffered from past discrimination rendered the plans waiver provision deficient croson suggested however that because of its unique equal protection enforcement authority constitutional standard more tolerant of racial linedrawing may apply to congress this conclusion was reinforced year later when in metro broadcasting inc v fcc9 the court upheld certain preferences for minorities in broadcast licensing proceedings approved by congress not as remedy for past discrimination but to promote the important governmental interest in broadcast diversity prophetically however justice oconnor dissented from justice brennans adoption of this more lenient intermediate standard for federal affirmative action she argued that strict scrutiny should be applied to any raceconscious program including those promulgated under federal law and that diversity as an end in itself was not compelling governmental interest10 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22191 at least in formal terms the twotiered approach to equal protection analysis of affirmative action did indeed prove to be shortlived in adarand constructors inc v pena11 the court applied strict scrutiny to federal transportation program of financial incentives for prime contractors who subcontracted to firms owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals defined so as to prefer members of designated racial minorities although the court refrained from deciding the constitutional merits of the particular program before it and remanded for further proceedings below it determined that all racial classifications by government at any level must be justified by compelling governmental interest and narrowly tailored to that end but the majority opinion by justice oconnor sought to dispel the notion that strict scrutiny is strict in theory but fatal in fact by acknowledging role for congress as architect of remedies for discrimination nationwide the unhappy persistence of both the practices and lingering effects of racial discrimination against minorities in this country is an unfortunate reality and the government is not disqualified from acting in response to it further guidance is provided however as to the scope of remedial power remaining in congressional hands or of the conditions required for its exercise the lower federal courts continue to grapple with these unresolved issues bottom line adarand suggests that racial preferences in federal law or policy are remedy of last resort which must be adequately justified and narrowly drawn to pass constitutional muster the latest chapter in the high courts affirmative action jurisprudence was written at the conclusion of the 200203 term with rulings in the michigan higher education 8 emphasis in original 9 497 us 547 1990 10 id at 60708 oconnor j dissenting 11 515 us 200 1995 crs4 cases in grutter v bollinger12 5 to 4 majority of the justices led by justice oconnor held that the universitys law school had compelling interest in the educational benefits that flow from diverse student body which justified its consideration of race in admissions to assemble critical mass of underrepresented minority students but in companion decision gratz v bollinger13 six justices decided that the universitys undergraduate policy of awarding racial bonus points to minority applicants was not narrowly tailored enough to pass constitutional muster the discrepant outcomes turned on justice oconnors application of the narrow tailoring standard which differed from the dissenters in grutter justice oconnor determined that the law school program was not quota system because its was based on an individualized holistic review of each applicants file which considered race as one of many but not the sole or exclusive factor in the admissions process this was so despite the fact that the goal was to admit critical mass of minority students with at least one eye on the numbers and race may be determinative factor in some admission decisions in this regard justice oconnor found the law school program quite different from the undergraduate admissions program in gratz which did not provide for meaningful individualized review of applicants but instead assigned httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22191 every underrepresented minority applicant the same automatic 20point bonus without consideration of the particular background experiences or qualities of each individual applicant14 accordingly justice oconnor joined chief justice rehnquists opinion for the court in gratz which held for the same reasons as that stated in justice oconnors concurrence that the undergraduate program was not narrowly tailored to achieve the asserted interest in educational diversity15 the grutter opinion in the law school case was key however because it enshrined in law much debated principle first articulated by the late justice lewis powell but joined by other justice in the 1978 bakke case16 that state institutions of higher learning have compelling interest in enrolling diverse student body that justified nonexclusive consideration of race in admissions justice oconnor had earlier hinted at the same proposition when in wygant17 she noted that although its precise contours are uncertain state interest in the promotion of racial diversity in student body has been found sufficiently compelling at least in the context of higher education to support the use of racial considerations in furthering that interest18 access to education and crosscultural understanding among the races is critical justice oconnor argued as is the judicial tradition of giving degree of deference to universitys academic decisions moreover justice oconnor stressed the role of higher education in providing diverse welltrained graduates for business the military and other governmental institutions effective participation by members of all racial and ethnic 12 539 us 506 2003 13 539 us 244 2003 14 id at 27677 oconnor j concurring 15 id at 278 16 regents of the

indivisible is to be realized19 nonetheless the benefits of racebased affirmative action were not without limit it has been 25 years since justice powell first approved the use of race to further an interest in student body diversity in the context of public higher education since that time the number of minority applicants with high grades and test scores has indeed increased we expect that in 25 years from now the use of racial preferences will longer be necessary to further the principle approved today20 justice oconnors opinion was joined by justices stevens souter ginsburg and breyer the oconnor legacy for the law of affirmative action thus appears noteworthy in two major particulars first with respect to constitutional norms to be applied in judging differential classifications by race in governmental policy justice oconnor was in the vanguard of justices indeed led the charge that ultimately held that all governmental consideration of race be subjected to the most unforgiving of judicial tests the strict scrutiny standard perhaps as important however as the legal concept itself httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22191 were her views as to how strict scrutiny is to be applied in various social and economic contexts as her jurisprudence has developed justice oconnor has repeatedly recognized since her 1995 adarand opinion strict scrutiny is not strict in theory but fatal in fact when racebased action is necessary to further compelling governmental interest such action does not violate the constitutional guarantee of equal protection so long as the narrow tailoring requirement is also satisfied21 but any possibly implied leniency has not necessarily led to similar degree of tolerance for all forms of racial linedrawing by governmental action even for benign or remedial purposes rather than general principle each case appears to rest heavily on judicial inquiry into the factspecific setting from which the legal dispute arises contextual differences including the particular kind of governmental activity being challenged can be significant in evaluating the constitutionality of raceconscious affirmative action among for example the areas of public employment government contracting admission to public institutions of higher education and election redistricting22 19 grutter 539 us at 332 20 id at 343 21 id at 32627 quoting adarand constructors

violated the equal protection clause crs6 arguably one standout area where justice oconnor has perhaps most influenced the development of affirmative action law is in higher education justice powell in bakke and justice oconnor concurring in wygant had earlier noted the possibility of recognizing diversity as compelling interest in higher education but it was justice oconnor writing for the five justice majority in grutter who first held that even in the absence of past discrimination institutions of higher learning have compelling interest in the educational benefits that flow from assembling racially diverse student body but here too it appears that means may frequently trump ends so that as noted by justice scalia the courts split doubleheader in the michigan cases leaves many dispositive issues open for future consideration on casebycase basis not until the seminal decisions in the michigan case have had sufficient time to spawn caselaw progeny presumably well beyond the tenure of justice oconnor will the full import of these rulings become more predictable httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22191
