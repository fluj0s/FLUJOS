the truth behind the akps secret islamic agenda ref ankara 0629 b ankara 0610 classified by political counselor janice g weiner for reasons 14b d 1 c summary ever since its victory in the 2002 general elections rumours and suspicion have swirled around the ruling justice and development partys akp secret islamist agenda after more than four years in power some doubters are relieved to find an akp that appears conservative western as well as islamoriented reform minded and democratic others remain convinced that akp is determined to impose sharia law in turkey and undermine the countrys secular system once it gains control of the triple crown the presidency prime ministry and parliament in this years double elections the evidence either way is circumstantial but the issue is central to turkeys future turkeys traditional secularists including the civil service judiciary and military opposition parties and even ultra and neonationalists are resorting to increasingly desperate maneuvers including rumour and innuendo to counter the perceived threat of an akpdominated triumverate their concern is undoubtedly heightened by the realization that akps reform agenda threatens the established elites traditional topdown control to keep the publics trust and minimize tension as turkish society evolves akp leaders will need to continue to employ broadreaching moderate balanced rhetoric end summary the origins of suspicion 2 sbu those looking to brand the akp as islamists determined to undermine the turkish republic point first to the akps religious origins and pm erdogans political roots akp evolved from necmettin erbakans welfare party rp an islamist party founded in 1993 critics focus on erdogan who in 1994 as istanbuls mayor called himself the imam of istanbul and praised god that he was servant of sharia later in 1998 erdogan served four months of 10month sentence for inciting religious hatred by reading religious poem at rally when the constitutional court outlawed the rp in 1998 erdogan and other rp members formed the islamicoriented virtue party fp when fp was banned in 2001 for unconstitutional antisecular activities erdogan split off from erbakan and formed akp with more pragmatic members willing to work within the existing political system erbakan and more hardcore islamists formed saadet felicity party erdogan moderated his rhetoric making it easier for voters to turn to akp in the 2002 elections as an alternative to traditional parties mired in scandals corruption and an economic crisis akp surged to power with 34 percent of the vote one of the largest parliamentary majorities in turkeys history for the defense 3 c those who view akp as reformminded and democratic are quick to cite akpbacked reforms that strengthened freedoms and democracy akp legislation that reduced the militarys influence in the national secuity council mgk and eliminated military membership in the security courts and the board of higher education yok among others improved the civilmilitary equilibrium that had been heavily skewed toward military control they cite as evidence of the partys westernoriented free market approach akps liberal economic policies which have stimulated the private sector increased foreign investment reduced inflation and stabilized the currency akp supporters argue that turkeys traditional power centers the military judiciary bureacracy feel threatened by eulinked human rights and rule of law reforms that enhance individual freedoms by promoting eu membership the akp is slowly introducing more balance into turkeys strictly secular statist society supporters maintain that erdogans appointment of akp loyalists to influential positions previously held by secularists has generated resentment against the akp further fueled by the partys popularity they frame attacks against the party as desperate measures by entrenched secularists who fear that further democratization will undermine their traditional control and the economic benefits they derived from state intervention in the economy 4 c opponents charge that akp only pushed reform agenda ankara 00000648 002 of 004 as far as necessary to convince the eu to begin accession talks even then akp focused on those reforms needed to dilute the militarys power rather than those that might interfere with the partys islamic agenda they note erdogans support for greater freedom to express islamic practices such as wearing the headscarf and point to his failure to allow alevis kurds armenian and greek orthodox communities similar freedoms suspicious that the accession process is just cover for the akps antisecular islamic agenda some in the military and opposition are reconsidering the merits of eu membership akp officials admit reform efforts have slowed but explain that turkeys bureaucracy needs time to absorb and implement significant changes such as the complete overhaul of the penal code criminal procedure code and punishments law passed between 2002 and 2004 they also note that parliament passed in november 2006 much of another major reform package including legislation relating to minority foundations and schools military audits military courts and political party funding in some cases parliament has had to reapprove the legislation to overcome president sezers veto circumstantial evidence 5 c conspiracy theorists and concerned secularists alike build the case against akp using persuasive but largely circumstantial evidence many claim that erdogan has used akps parliamentary majority to weaken turkeys secular educational financial and judicial institutions they warn that an akp troika of president pm and parliament speaker would control the appointments process transforming turkeys secular system into something approaching an islamic republic they point to akpsponsored changes in the strictly secular education system to allow graduates of religious high schools imam hatip to compete for limited university seats and qualify for government jobs previously imam hatip like other vocational school graduates advanced to the clergy or other appropriate professions in addition opponents charge that akp has undermined state regulation of private koranic schools by lifting age limits and extending hours of attendance as result the number of koranic schools has increased significantly with correspondingly less government oversight 6 c erdogan is also frequently accused of trying to infiltrate the higher education system with islamistminded professors and administrators after some university rectors resisted akp efforts to introduce more islam into the curriculum akp opponents claimed the government began harrassment campaign police arrested one obstinate rector in van twice in 2006 both times he was reinstated by court decision legislation creating 15 new universities gave the government authority to appoint the new rectors rather than the usual procedure of approvals by yok and the president the law pushed through over president sezers veto is viewed as an endrun to allow erdogan to select 15 new rectors of his mindset parliament currently is considering proposal to establish another 17 new universities green money seeping in 7 c while many acknowledge akp economic successes some doubters flag the alleged influx of green money from islamic sources as proof of the real direction akp is taking turkeys economy akp opponents note that islamist capital is hard to track and question whether it is ultimately tied to more islamist policies increased investments from the uae and promised doubling of trade with saudi arabia after the saudi kings unprecedented 2006 visit raised suspicions among some westernoriented investors the overall trend of increased foreign investor inflows actually counters insinuations of an islamist takeover of turkeys financial sector however investments from islamic sources pale in comparison to total foreign inflows and do not seem to be of economic or political significance 8 c erdogan reputedly has manipulated the political appointments process to place islamist bankers in key economic positions along with finance minister kemal unakitan former board member of one of turkeys leading islamic banks albaraka erdogans appointment of seven other albaraka officials to key positions in turkeys savings deposit insurance fund is cited as support for an ankara 00000648 003 of 004 islamist takeover theory in 2006 the pm virtually paralyzed financial policy when he tried to appoint an islamist as head of the central bank against president sezers firm opposition the compromise candidate has demonstrated independent decisionmaking since his appointment to round out the damning evidence critics cite fm guls background as specialist at the islamic development bank in jeddah from 1983 to 1991 and his reported objections to state scrutiny of islamic enterprises packing the court 9 c erdogan is also accused of staging takeover of the judiciary the akp pushed through legislation to lower the mandatory retirement age for technocrats opening the way for erdogan to name almost 4000 of 9000 judges and prosecutors in standoff with the judiciary akp has threatened to refuse to implement high court rulings against the government for obstructing akpsponsored legislation similar struggles between akp and president sezer have caused sezer to veto over 3000 akp appointments and send over 100 akpbacked laws to the constitutional court for review but for sezer erdogan would already be implementing his secret agenda worried secularists claim economic reformers including the imf for their part would be only too happy to see an akpinspired change in the judiciary which has consistently blocked forwardlooking economic reforms 10 c erdogan rebutted the secularists charges in 2006 by noting that the akp hadnt been in power long enough to reshape the judiciary rigid bureaucratic controls on promotions and 1520 year career path for judges limit the influence of any particular government on the judiciarys orientation but critics note that justice ministry budgetary control over the supreme council of judges and prosecutors which oversees assignments within the judiciary gives the akp indirect influence that can have longterm impact the president appoints five of the seven council members the justice minister however heads the council and controls its funding which could discourage council members from voting against the ministers proposed appointees the most recent charge is that the minister by not attending supreme council sessions is preventing 29 judicial positions from being filled small changes 11 c akps strategy to infiltrate its islamist agenda into turkeys secular institutions extends to the municipal level and beyond according to akp opponents the party controls four of turkeys five largest cities ankara istanbul bursa and konya measures by some akp mayors to ban alcohol on municipal property establish womenonly parks or equip ferries with prayer rooms are seen as islamic encroachments on the secular system erdogan and other party leaders explained the alcohol restrictions as consistent with the states obligation to protect children from alcohol drugs and gambling rather than religious proscription municipalities are authorized to ban the sale and consumption of alcohol on municipal property and near schools religious sites and related locations of the 62 provincial capitals that have such ban 18 have nonakp mayors of the 19 without alcohol bans 14 have akp mayors as another oftencited example of small but telling changes critics note that employees at the health ministry and stateowned turkish airlines reported being questioned about their religious beliefs and attitudes toward the koran an unprecedented practice internal balancing act 12 c erdogan has performed delicate balancing act to maintain unity within the akp despite the sometimes conflicting interests of its competing factions many party faithful are pious keeping their allegiance is central to the akps hold on power but erdogan has won them few tangible successes he has not upheld earlier pledges to lift the ban on headscarves in public buildings though his strong objections when the european court of human rights upheld the ban in public schools resonated with the partys more devout members akps more conservation faction was disappointed by the failed attempt to criminalize adultery in 2004 erdogans attempts to put loyalists into government jobs can also be viewed through the prism of rewarding the party ankara 00000648 004 of 004 faithful the jury is out 12 c comment to date akp critics can only muster circumstantial evidence of an akp islamist agenda opposition leaders some media outlets the military and extreme nationalists have used this to play up fears that an akp triumvirate will allow erdogan to make significant perhaps irreversible changes that would undermine turkeys secular system using dramatic ad campaigns and threatening rhetoric they warn that turkey may soon have an islamist president with headscarf wearing wife ready to take the country back to the prerepublic dark ages president sezer military leaders and the mgk chief have all warned erdogan against unconstitutional moves that might change turkeys secular identity the secular establishments concern that akp poses genuine threat to turkeys secular system is undoubtedly heightened by the realization that akps reform agenda threatens the established elites traditional topdown control 13 c those not convinced of nefarious akp plan contend that more than four years in power have matured the party erdogan has had to moderate his message to balance factions within akp and lessen tensions with secularists threatened by akp reforms much of the partys success stems from its image as being less corrupt ak in turkish means clean dubious claim for any party here and more effective than the opposition its record to date describes centerright conservative party with islamic roots that has modestly advanced kemal ataturks core principles of westernization and modernization some of the changes tied to that process will inevitably transform the traditional power balance and strengthen civilian leaders to keep the publics trust and minimize tension as turkish society evolves akp and erdogan in particular will need to continue to employ broadreaching moderate balanced rhetoric end comment visit ankaras classified web site at httpwwwstatesgovgovpeurankara
