agencies to develop document and implement an agencywide information security program to protect their information and information systems including those provided or managed by another agency contractor or other source the objective of this audit was to determine if the african development foundations adf information security program met fisma requirements page 3 this audit which was performed by the office of inspector generals information technology and special audits division meets the fisma requirement for an annual evaluation of adfs information security program page 2 although adf complied with some fisma requirements it needed to strengthen several areas to improve its information security program for example in accordance with fisma adf updated its inventory of major information systems conducted periodic risk assessments of its three information systems and established baseline security configuration checklists for several systems however it did not meet six key fisma requirements adf did not 1 comply with federal guidance when developing security plans 2 include required procedures in its contingency plan 3 implement capital planning and investment control process 4 develop procedures for privacy impact assessments 5 develop information technology security performance measurements or 6 develop certain configuration management procedures consequently adfs operations and assets may be at risk of misuse and disruption pages 4 to 11 this report makes seven recommendations to assist adf in strengthening its information security program pages 7 to 11 in response to our draft report adf agreed with the audit findings and all seven recommendations adf outlined its plans to address the audit recommendations and provided target dates for when the final actions would be completed based on adfs comments management decisions have been reached on all seven recommendations page 12 adfs comments are included in their entirety in appendix ii to this report page 15 background in 1980 the united states congress established the african development foundation adf as an independent public corporation with mandate to promote participation by africans in the economic and social development of their countries for more than 20 years adf has helped grassroots groups and individuals in africa help themselves by providing the resources they need to advance their own efforts to promote economic and social development because adf is federal agency it is required to comply with federal information security requirements adf has 37 employees adfs information chnology it department consists of the chief management officer cmo and contractor who acts as the network administrator for adfs information systems the cmo also served as the chief information officer cio information system security officer isso and the system owner for adfs local area network lan and web site in july 2007 the cmo changed job responsibilities to become the fulltime cio and longer serves as the cmo as network administrator the contractor is responsible for providing qualified and responsive management and technical professional computer support services and assistance to adf staff the federal information security management act of 2002 fisma which was enacted into law as title iii of the egovernment act of 2002 pl 107347 december 17 2002 states each agency shall develop document and implement an agencywide information security programto provide information security for the information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency including those provided or managed by another agency contractor or other source fisma provides the framework for securing the federal governments information technology all agencies must implement fisma requirements and report annually to the office of management and budget omb congressional committees and the government accountability office gao on the effectiveness of their security systems the reports must include independent evaluations by the agency inspector general in addition fisma established that the standards and guidelines issued by the national institute of standards and technology are mandatory for federal agencies at the time of the audit adf operated three information systems1 1 general lan 2 grants management database and 3 web site adf also used two systems operated by the department of interiors national business center nbc this audit focused on the three systems operated by adf the fiscal year 2007 budget for adfs information management support was approximately 13 million 1 adf categorized its three information systems as moderate as prescribed by federal information processing standards 199 sensitive but unclassified 2 audit objective the federal information security management act of 2002 requires an annual independent evaluation of the agencys information security program the objective of this audit was to answer the following question did the african development foundations information system security program meet the requirements of the federal information security management act of 2002 appendix i contains discussion of the audits scope and methodology sensitive but unclassified 3 audit findings the african development foundations adf information security program complied with some requirements of the federal information security management act of 2002 fisma however adf needed to strengthen several areas to improve its security program during fiscal year 2007 adf devoted significant time and resources to developing security enhancements to improve its information systems as result of its efforts adf generally complied with the following fisma requirements updating its inventory of major information systems conducting periodic risk assessments for its three information systems establishing baseline security configuration checklists for desktops servers and routers scanning its network routinely to identify and fix security vulnerabilities however the audit found weaknesses in six areas of adfs information systems security program adf did not 1 comply with federal guidance when developing security plans 2 include required procedures in its contingency plan 3 implement capital planning and investment control process 4 develop procedures for privacy impact assessments 5 develop information technology security performance measurements or 6 develop certain configuration management procedures these issues are discussed on pages 5 to 11 sensitive but unclassified 4 adfs information systems security program needed to strengthen several fisma requirements to improve security summary the african development foundation adf complied with some requirements of the federal information security management act of 2002 fisma however it needed to strengthen the following six key areas to improve its information security program comply with federal guidance when developing security plans include required procedures in its contingency plan implement capital planning and investment control process develop procedures to perform privacy impact assessments develop procedures to measure information technology security performance measurements develop certain configuration management procedures among the reasons for adfs noncompliance in these areas were time constraints and other priorities faced by the agency consequently adfs operations and assets may be at risk of being compromised because of the information systems security weaknesses according to fisma each agency shall develop document and implement an agencywide information security program to provide information security for the information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency including those provided or managed by another agency contractor or other source these requirements include among others the following developing security plans to comply with federal guidance preparing contingency plan implementing capital planning and investment control process performing privacy impact assessments developing information technology security performance measurements adhering to and developing configuration management procedures adf did not meet these six fisma requirements for its information program each of these issues is discussed below 1 security plans need to comply with federal guidance the national institute of standards and technology nist special publication 80018 guide for developing security plans for federal information systems provides an overview of the security requirements of an entitys information systems and describes the sensitive but unclassified 5 minimum security control procedures that need to be in place or planned for the system to meet those requirements for example it states that the security plan should document and clearly describe all minimum security requirements in this standard by applying controls selected in accordance with nist special publication 80053 guide for assessing the security controls in federal information systems nist special publication 80018 also states that security plans should be reviewed and updated at least annually to its credit adf developed three security plans in september 2004plans that were acceptable in several respects the security plans however did not fully comply with nist special publication 80018 specifically the three security plans did not document and describe the minimum security control procedures that need to be in place or planned or provide reasons why various controls were not implemented for example the plans did not include eight selected control procedures from nist special publication 80053 table 1 below identifies those eight control procedures table 1 summary of the control procedures not documented in adfs three security plans control numbers selected nist special publication 80053 control procedures pl3 agency procedures should update the security plan to address system changes or problems ident ified during implementation or security control assessments ac2 agency procedures describe how to manage information accounts including establishing activating reviewing and removing accounts ac17 agency procedures should document monitor and control all methods of remote access ac19 agency establishes usage restrictions and implementation guidance for portable and mobile devices monitors and controls the use of portable and mobile devices and authorizes the use of portable and mobile devices au3 agency information systems capture sufficient information in audit records to establish what events occurred the sources of events and the outcomes of the events au6 agency procedures describe how to regularly review audit records for indication of inappropriate or unusual activity investigate unusual activity and report findings to appropriate officials cm7 agency procedures describe how to review the information system to provide only essential capabilities and restrict the use of the following functions ports protocols and services mp12 agency mediahandling policies are adequate to address the purpose scope responsibilities management commitment coordination among entities and compliance sensitive but unclassified 6 in addition the security plans had not been reviewed and updated annuallyall three plans were developed and last updated in september 2004 for instance in january 2007 adfs network expanded to include its regional office in ghana however the agencys general local area network security plan was not updated to describe the minimum security controls in place or planned for the network in ghana without documenting and describing controls in adfs security plans the security controls may be inadequate or improperly implemented inadequate or improper security controls may not provide sufficient protection for sensitive or critical resources adfs information technology it team is very small and the responsibility for describing minimum security controls in place or planned for each of the three systems is shared with adfs informati on system security officer isso and contractor who acts as the network administrator for adfs information systems the isso and the network administrator also function in other capacities within adf and had not identified the minimum security controls or updated the security plans because of other priorities faced by the agency because the isso longer serves as chief management officer as of july 2007 and may have more time to devote to his responsibilities as isso we are not making recommendation that addresses the issos divided responsibilities and other priorities at the time of the audit adf was in the process of replacing its three existing information systems with two new information systems the wide area network system and the program support system s the audit did not include the two new systems because they were not deployed until after the audit fieldwork was complete since adf had not developed and finalized the security plans for its new systems and its existing security plans were longer suitable we are making the following recommendation to ensure that the security plans for the new information systems meet nist requirements recommendation 1 we recommend that the african development foundation develop and implement the following two security plans wide area network system and b program s upport systems to fully comply with the national institute of standards and technologys special publication 80018 2 required procedures not included in contingency plan repeat finding2 nist special publication 80034 contingency planning guide for information technology systems provides specific instructions for restoring critical systems including instructions for arranging alternative processing facilities in case the usual facilities are damaged or cannot be accessed because of unexpected events such as temporary power failure or major disaster it is important that these plans be tested to determine whether the plans will function as intended in an emergency such tests determine whether the alternative work site will function as intended and whether critical computer data and programs to be recovered from offsite storage 2 audit report noaadf06001p audit of the african development foundations compliance with the provisions of the federal information security management act of 2002 for fiscal year 2006 dated september 28 2006 sensitive but unclassified 7 will be accessible and current moreover these tests should train personnel who have contingency plan responsibilities to carry out their roles and responsibilities during disaster contrary to the contingency planning guidance contained in nist special publication 80034 adf did not include the following specific procedures in its contingency plan damage assessment recovery procedures media protection shutdown and restart processes or procedures alternate storage site of backup tapes alternate work site detailed hardware and software recovery process in addition adf did not test the plan and adf personnel had not been trained to implement their continge ncy responsibilities the isso and the administrator had not tested the contingency plan because of time constraints without comprehensive contingency plan adf may not be able to recover quickly and effectively from service disruption disaster or other emergency as previously reported the oig identified that adf did not include specific procedures in its contingency plan the report did not make recommendation because adfs plan of action and milestones dated june 15 2006 indicated plan to update the contingency plan by august 2006 because adf did not update its contingency plan we are making the following recommendations recommendation 2 we recommend that the african development foundation revise its contingency plan to fully comply with the national institute of standards and technologys special publication 80034 recommendation 3 we recommend that the african development foundation test its contingency plan and train its personnel with contingency plan responsibilities as required by the national institute of standards and technologys special publication 80034 3 information technology capital planning and investment control process needed nist special publication 80065 integrating it security into the capital planning and investment control process helps federal agencies integrate it security into their capital planning and investment controls cpic processes this guidance introduces common criteria against which agencies can prioritize security activities and ensures that needed corrective actions are incorporated into the capital planning process to provide maximum security and financial benefit to the agency as part of the capital planning process an exhibit 300 document must be submitted to omb for all major it acquisitions and ongoing major it investments for reporting and budgeting requirements sensitive but unclassified 8 adf however did not implement an it capital planning and investment controls process and did not prepare an exhibit 300 document for its major it acquisitions at the time of the audit adf operated three major it systems the cio stated that although he was aware of the requirement for cpic process and understood its importance adf had not yet developed cpic process because it had not developed procedu res for planning budgeting and managing its it capital assets adf developed guidance on lifecycle processes which states as part of its system acquisition process that an exhibit 300 document should be prepared the guidance however was not adequate because it did not ensure that it acquisitions were selected monitored and evaluated effectively for implementation without an it cpic process adf cannot fully ensure that it will have effective investment management maximum it security and the financial benefits provided by these components therefore we are making the following recommendation recommendation 4 we recommend that the african development foundation implement an information technology capital planning and investment controls process to comp ly with the national institute of standards and technologys special publication 80065 4 procedures for privacy impact assessments needed omb defines privacy impact assessment pia as an analysis of how information is handled to 1 ensure that handling conforms to applicable legal regulatory and policy requirements regarding privacy 2 determine the risks and effects of collecting maintaining and disseminating information in identifiable form in an electronic information system and 3 examine and evaluate protections and alternative processes for handling information to mitigate potential privacy risks in addition fisma requires agencies to complete pias before 1 developing or procuring information technology systems or projects that collect maintain or disseminate information in identifiable form about an individual or 2 initiating consistent with the paperwork reduction act new electronic collection of information in identifiable form for 10 or more persons excluding agencies instrumentalities or employees of the federal government although pias are required adf did not conduct any pias for its planned information systems adf has polic that addresses safeguarding private information3 however the agency did not develop procedures to ensure that pias would be conducted when required completed pias would benefit the agency because the cio stated that adfs it system s do contain sensitive information such as individual names addresses and bank account numbers failing to conduct pias increases the risk of harm from unauthorized release of sensitive information further adf could not ensure that sensitive information is handled in manner that maximizes privacy therefore we are making the following recommendation 3 adfs policy for safeguarding private information was addressed in 22 cfr pt 1507 rules safeguarding personal information sensitive but unclassified 9 recommendation 5 we recommend that the african development foundation develop and implement procedures to perform privacy impact assessments as required 5 security program needs performance measurements nist draft special publication 80080 guide for developing performance metrics for information security provides instructions to develop and implement effective and efficient metrics information security metrics provide means for monitoring and reporting an agencys implementation of security controls they also help assess the effectiveness of these controls in protecting agency information resources in support of the agencys mission further the processes and methodologies described in the guide demonstrate how to link information security performance to the agencys strategic goals and objectives adf did not develop it security metrics and track it security performance specifically metrics were used to demonstrate progress in implementing individual it security controls some examples of metrics that could be used include 1 the percentage of employees who have signed an acknowledgement that they have read and understood information system security policies and procedures 2 the percentage of system users who have received basic awareness training and 3 the frequency with which the organization analyzes audit records for violations other metrics are available to quantify outcomes by applying security controls described in nist special publication 80053 adf did not develop it security performance metrics because it did not have agencyspecific procedures to 1 develop and implement effective and efficient metrics and 2 link information security performance to the agencys strategic goals and objectives without performance measures agency resources were allocated to it security with metrics to demonstrate how the information security program improved or supported the organizations missions therefore we are making the following recommendation recommendation 6 we recommend that the african development foundation develop and implement procedures to measure information technology security performance and b link security performance to the agencys strategic goals and objectives to comply with the national institute of standards and technologys draft special publication 80080 6 certain configuration management procedures need to be developed and followed nist special publication 80070 security configuration checklists program for it products was issued to facilitate the development and dissemination of security configuration checklists so that organizations and individual users can better secure their it products configuration management is the process by which the configuration of system and its components are identified and documented and changes are controlled and tracked system configuration includes security configuration checklist which is document that contains instructions or procedures for configuring an it product to baseline level of security the goal of configuration management is to facilitate detection of any changes to hardware and software within an information system sensitive but unclassified 10 to its credit adf developed baseline security configuration checklists for desktops servers and routers how ever some configuration management areas still contained security weaknesses 1 some procedural controls for moderate risk systems were not developed and 2 some procedures were developed but not fully followed developing procedures adfs configuration management procedures did not incorporate applicable control procedures recommended in nist special publication 80053 for example adf did not have the following procedural controls in place 1 establishment of mandatory configuration settings 2 configuration settings for essential capabilities and 3 restriction of access privileges for making changes the isso and the network administrator also functioned in other capacities throughout the agency and had not included security controls in the procedures because the agency faced other priorities at the time following procedures adf developed some configuration management procedures for documenting and authorizing changes h owever the network administrator for adfs information systems did not follow prescribed procedures or use required forms to document and authorize configuration changes for example email correspondence was used instead of prescribed forms the network administrator did not realize the importance of completing all required forms before changing the configurati on not using all the required forms increases the likelihood of unauthorized changes to the system by incorporating minimum configuration management controls described in nist special publication 80053 adf could increase the probability of faster problem resolution greater levels of security faster resolution of service and more effective and efficient change management therefore we are making the following recommendation recommendation 7 we recommend that the african development foundation develop configuration management procedures to include all appropriate recommended national institute of standards and technology special publication 80053 controls and b comply with the foundations configuration management procedures sensitive but unclassified 11 evaluation of management comments in response to our draft report the african development foundation adf agreed with the audit findings and described planned actions to address the recommendations the foundations comments are included in their entirety in appendix ii for recommendations 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 7 adf outlined its plans to address the audit recommendations and provided target dates for when final action would be completed based on adfs comments and the establ ishment of target dates management decisions have been reached for each of these recommendations sensitive but unclassified 12appendix i scope and methodology scope the office of inspector general information technology and special audits division conducted this audit in accordance with us generally accepted government auditing standards the audit was designed to answer the following question did the african development foundations inform ation system security program meet the requirements of the federal information security management act of 2002 fisma the audit covered the period from october 1 2006 through august 21 2007 the audit fieldwork was performed at the african development foundations adf headquarters in washington dc from june 4 2007 to august 21 2007 and covered fismarelated areas including the following establishing information security performance measures establishing procedures for detecting reporting and responding to security incidents establishing configuration management policies and procedures establishing procedures for capital planning and investment control process for information technology systems establishing processes to manage remedial action used to address deficiencies assessing risk periodically testing and evaluating the effectiveness of its security policies establishing and documenting continuity of operations plans certifying and accrediting its information systems adf operated three information systems 1 general local area network lan 2 grants management database and 3 web site the audit included the above systems and review of draft documents associated with two systems planned by adf that will replace the existing three information systems the planned systems were to be deployed after our audit fieldwork in addition adf used two systems operated by the department of interiors national business center nbc adf relied on its memoranda of understanding with nbc and independent audits for security assurances for the two systems operated by nbc the focus of this audit was on the three systems operated by adf adfs fiscal year 2006 fisma audit report was also reviewed sensitive but unclassified 13 methodology to determine if adfs information security program met fisma requirements we conducted interviews with adf officials and contractors and reviewed legal and regulatory requirements stipulated in fisma we also reviewed documents supporting the information security program these documents included but were not limited to adfs 1 information technology it contingency plan 2 quarterly plan of action and milestones 3 inventory of major systems and 4 it security program policy where appropriate we compared documents such as the contingency plan and security plans to requirements stipulated by the national institute of standards and technology nist special publications we selected eight control procedures from nist special publication 80053 to test whether selected control procedures were described in the three security plans we also reviewed the status of the fiscal year 2006 fisma audit recommendation4 to evaluate the security of adfs major systems we performed vulnerability scans to detect system vulnerabilities using nmap and nessus5 we did not determine

recommendations 1 we recommend that the african velopment foundation develop and implement the following two security pl ans 1 wide area network system and 2 program support systems to fully comp ly with the national institute of standards and technology special publication 80018 we accept the finding with the following comment as relayed during the audit usadf is in the process of finalizing system security plans for both of the new systems mentioned in your recommendation wh ile both plan revisions were initiated to anticipate changes in our system structure and the deployment of usadfs wide area network we also are taking this opportun ity to incorporate appropriate security control procedures from nist sp 80053 and requirements from nist sp 80018 which were not part of the original plans with planned certification and accreditation of the two new systems this fiscal year we plan to have final approved security plans in place before september 30 2007 sensitive but unclassified 15 2 we recommend that the african developm ent foundation revise its contingency plan to fully comply with the national institute of standards and technology special publication 80034 we accept the finding with the following comm ent usadf has started the process of developing and performing initial tests on co ntinuity of operati ons plan coop of which our contingency plans are part th is initial work on the foundations coop pointed out the needs also identified in this recommendation to better describe processes and procedures and then train responsible foundation personnel we agree that the contingency plan has to be revised to include specific procedures outlined in nist sp 80034 be more specific in identi fying and assigning plan responsibilities be effectively disseminated to all responsible parties through traini ng and be tested our goal is to revise the c ontingency plan prior to the end of this fiscal year 3 we recommend that the african developm ent foundation test its contingency plan and train its personnel with continge ncy plan responsibilities as required by the national institute of standards nd technology special publication 80034 we accept the finding with the following comment we recognize that before it can be functional part of our overall coop the contingency plan first has to be made part of our regular and established pract ices at the foundation after the plan is revised see recommendation number 2 we plan to train responsible parties and complete testing within the first quarter of fy 2008 4 we recommend that the african develo pment foundation implement and follow an information technology capital planni ng and investment control process to comply with the national institute of standards and technology special publication 80034 we accept the finding with the following comment the audit correctly points out that usadf has never developed capital pl anning and investment control process following the guidance in omb circular a11 for exhibit 300 we intend to contact the foundations omb examiner to discuss the exact pro cess pending their recommendation we will make plans to submit exhibit 300 for this years omb submission or plan for next in either cas we will be reviewing nist sp 80065 to ensure our compliance with that guidance 5 we recommend that the african velopment foundation develop and implement procedures to perform pr ivacy act assessments as required sensitive but unclassified 16 we accept the finding with the following comment as the audit identified usadf does have policy that addresses safeguard ing private information however we have not yet developed procedures to perform privacy impact assessments while our existing policy does cause us to consider privacy issues when developing and implementing our systems usadf recogni zes that conducting st ructured privacy impact assessments would better help us to mitigate potential privacy risks to respond to this recommendation usadf will re vise its privacy policies to require privacy impact assessments and develop procedures for carrying them out by the second quarter in fy 2008 6 we recommend that the african velopment foundation develop and implement procedures to 1 develop and implement effective and efficient metrics and 2 link information security performance to the agencys strategic goals and objectives to comply with th national institute of standards and technology special publication 80080 we accept the finding with the following comment usadf will take steps to develop and implement metrics that will link information security performance to the foundations strategic goals and objectiv by the second qu arter of fy 2008 7 we recommend that the african velopment foundation 1 update configuration management procedures to include all appropriate recommendations in nist special publication 80053 and 2 comply with its configuration management procedures we accept the finding with the following comment usadf will review its current configuration management procedures and make changes to more fully employ the controls found in nist sp 80053 and update ou r checklists to conf orm to criteria
