which indian tribes may conduct gaming that need not conform to state law the three classe s of gaming authorized by igra progress from class i social gaming through cla ss ii bingo and nonbanking card games to class iii casino gaming3 one of the requirements for class ii and class iii gaming is that the gaming be located in state that permits such gaming for any purpose by any person organization or entity4 the federal courts have interpreted this to permit tribes to conduct type s of gaming permitted in the state without state limits or conditions for example tribes in states that permit vegas nights for charitable purposes may seek tribalstate compact for class iii casino gaming5 on the other hand the fact that state law permits some form of lottery or authorizes state lottery is not in itself sufficient to permit tribalstate compact permitting all forms of casino gaming6 geographic extent of igra gaming key concept of igra is its territo rial component gaming under igra may only take place on indian lands that term has two meanings 1 all lands within the limits of any indian reservation and 2 any lands title to which is either held in trust by the united states
