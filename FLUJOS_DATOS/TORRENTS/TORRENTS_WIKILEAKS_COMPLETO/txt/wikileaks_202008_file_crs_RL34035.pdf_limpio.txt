requests from grant seekers needing funds for projects in districts and states the congressional office should first determine its priorities about how much assistance to give constituents from providing information about grants programs to active advocacy of projects congressional grants staff can best help grant seekers when they gain some understanding of the entire grants process each office handles grants requests in its own way depending upon the members legislative agenda and overall organization and workload there may be fulltime grants specialist or several staff members under the supervision of grants coordinator working solely in the area of grants and projects in some offices all grants requests are handled in the district or state office in others they are answered by the washington dc staff to assist grant seekers applying for federal funds congressional offices can develop working relationships with grants officers in federal and state departments and agencies because more than 90 of federal funds go to state and local governments that in turn manage federal grants and subaward to applicants in their state cong ressional staff need to identify their own state administering offices to educate constituents congressional office may sometimes mail or email selected grant seekers about funding opportunities or may sponsor seminars on federal and private assistance because most funding resour ces are on the internet member home pages can also link to grantsinternet sources such as the catalog of federal domestic assistance and grantsgov so that constituents themselves can search for grants and funding opportunities the crs grants business opportunities and student financial aid web page at httpwwwcrsgov referencegeneral wg02001shtml covers

congress receive numerous requests from grant seekers including state and local governments nonprofit social service and community action organizations private research groups small businesses and individuals for information and help in obtaining funds for projects both government and private foundation funding may be appropriate federal grants are not benefits or entitlements to individuals most federal funding goes to state and local governments which in turn subaward to local entities such as nonprofit organizations grants may be available for projects serving communities and needs for example government assistance may be available for nonprofit organizations including faithbased groups for initiatives such as establishing soup kitchens or afterschool programs benefitting entire communities and local governments seeking funds for community services infrastructure and economic revitalization may be most eligible for state and federal funds congressional offices may often need to direct constituents seeking government aid to funding options other than grants community fundraising may be most suitable for school enrichment activities such as field trips or for band or sports uniforms local business or foundation funding might be more appropriate for supporting projects such as construction of local memorials or commemorative programs for others such as for starting or expanding small business or for students loans may be available individuals looking for government benefits may find useful the website govbenefitsgov at httpwwwgovbenefitsgov students seeking financial aid should search the department of education website at httpstudentaidedgov to start or expand small business the federal government provides assistance in the form of loans advisory or technical assistance see the small business administration website at httpwwwsbagov given the competition for federal funds the success rate in obtaining federal assistance is limited grants staffs effectiveness often depends on both an understanding of the grants process and on the relations it establishes with federal departments and agencies with state grants administering agencies saas private and local foundations and other contacts this report does not constitute blueprint for every office involved in grants and projects activity nor does it present indepth information about all aspects of staff activity in this area the discussion describes some basics about the grants process and some of the approaches and techniques used by congressional offices in dealing with this type of constituent service httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34035g9g155g138g151g157g156g561g25g152g155g148g561g146g151g561g138 g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g146g152g151

resources to grants and projects activities in order to assist the constituents with projects of potential benefit to their districts cities or states each congressional office handles grants requests in its own way depending upon such factors as the members philosophy on federal support for local projects the relation of certain proposals to his or her legislative activity or the members particular interest in specific locations or types of projects other factors may include the degree of economic distress in any given locality and the current level of federal assistance it receives grants activities in any congressional office depend very much upon the overall organization staff and workload of the office most offices divide responsibility by function ie legislation is assigned to legislative assistants and correspondents media relations and newsletters are handles by press secretary and caseworkers help with problems of individuals offices organized in this way may have fulltime grants specialist or several staff members under the supervision of grants coordinator working solely in the area of grants and projects some offices divide responsibilities by subject area ie specialist in health issues is involved with legislation correspondence casework grants projects speeches and press releases in that subject area dc state or district office in some offices all grants requests are handled in the district or state office in others they are answered by the washington dc staff still others divide grants and projects activity between the district or state office and the washington dc office regardless of how this responsibility is assigned it is helpful to have at least one person in the district or state office and one person in the washington dc office familiar with the whole process district or state staff may be more readily able to communicate and develop relationships with federal state and federal regional offices or state administering agencies often the preferred contact office for federal programs state delegation cooperation since some constituents request the aid of the entire state delegation for grant or project cooperation among members of the delegation can minimize duplication of effort and permit more effective use of staff time to increase the chances of projects funding members may solicit the support of other members either from the same geographic region if the proposal would benefit wide area or from those who hold key positions in leadership or on committees which exercise funding and oversight of the federal program political considerations can limit the amount of such cooperation one states delegation has established state projects office to help its constituents learn about the grants process and follow through on all applications until awards are made the grants person in the congressional office can serve constituents not only as source of information but also as facilitator with agencies and foundations and in some cases even as an advocate the congressional office is seen by constituents as potential source of assistance such as

through federal programs clarifying the intricacies of proposal development application and followup procedures writing letters of interest or support from the member to the granting agency resolving problems that occur when an applicant is unsuccessful in obtaining funds or other assistance and suggesting other sources for grant assistance in both the private and public sectors the congressional office should first determine the priorities of its particular office where do grants requests fall within the operations of the office should grants officers be located in washington dc or the state or district what should be the role of the congressional office information source or active advocacy or sometimes even earmarking appropriations for project that mirrors the members legislative agenda assess the volume of incoming grants requests what criteria determine how much attention should be given to each grants request eg number of people who will be affected visibility of projects or political implications congressional grants staff can help their constituents best when they thoroughly understand the entire grants process defining the project searching for likely funding sources writing proposals applying for grants understanding review and award procedures and knowing postaward requirements

monitor the progress of the grants and projects operation several resources can be developed commercial computer software packages are ava ilable to manage correspondence projects and workload

procedures and ensure continuity when staff changes among the items that might be included in such manual are as follows statement of the members policy on letters of endorsement and press announcements along with samples checklist of procedures to facilitate the training of new staff sample project worksheets allowing space for agency contacts status reports and followup timetables

county and tracking records agency files agency files which could also be arranged under broad subjects or use subject subdivisions for example defense depa rtment district contracts education department curriculum development justice department community oriented policing cops program program files which include detailed information on the most frequently used programs in communities in the state or district with fact sheet describing each program plus agency brochures and contacts project files which may contain lists of applicants for each project some offices keep records on the steps taken in support of all grant applications as documentation constituent files by county these can prove especially useful for the members visits to the state or district correspondence on each grant application and local press coverage of awards can be added these clippings along with letters from grateful constituents can serve as source for favorable quotations tracking requests monitor grant applications as they move through an agencys review process maintain followup calendar or log track all grants awarded in the district or stateeven those your office did not work on

informed of significant developments this is particularly important for offices organized by functional responsibility the report prepares the member for the types of questions that may be asked during visits to the state or district and provides topics to be addressed in speeches the legislative staff may benefit from knowing about pending state or local government actions that would have an impact on grants and projects conversely grants and projects staff should also be able to rely on the legislative staff for information about pending bills that would alter or create federal programs or change relevant funding levels sometimes comments from constituents can supply data on whether programs are carrying out legislative intent and whether changes in agency regulations or legislation are needed such recommendations might then be the subject of congressional oversight hearings or might result in recommending changes in legislation the press secretary should also be kept up to date on programs of interest in the district so that current information can be presented in newsletters and press releases g3g156g156g142g156g156g146g151g144g561g5g152g151g156g157g146g157g158g142g151g157g561g20g142g154g158g142g156g157g156g561 if proposal or serious inquiry is submitted to congressional office an assessment of the stated problem should be made first this benefits the grant seeker since any application for assistance will require that the problem be clearly stated and that the proposed solution provide some remedy secondly this initial assessment can provide staff with sense of direction are there other projects currently under way that address the problem is there already an appropriate federal or state program that is designed for such project or is the issue better addressed through local state or private organizations or through legislation will the soughtafter aid produce other problems for the community what are its chances for success the initial review of the request should also involve an assessment of the applicant formal grant proposal will require an applicant to establish credibility individuals connected with proposal might mention education training and pr ofessional credentials credibility for an organization may be established by giving its history goals activities and primary accomplishments as well as by letters of support including by local governments by reviewing such information an office may avoid the hazard of offering support for questionable applicant and may be in better position to make decisions about support when several communities or organizations are applying for the same programwill all be treated equally or will support be given to selected applicants httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34035g9g155g138g151g157g156g561g25g152g155g148g561g146g151g561g138 g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g146g152g151

constituent should always be acknowledged if the request is fairly common one the office may be able to respond with prepared packet of materials on available programs another alternative would be to send c opy of your constituents letter to the agency with buck slip asking the agencys attention and to inform your constituent of your action and advise that he or she will be hearing more from the office once the agency reports back another approach is to call the agency contact this procedure is generally more time consuming for congressional staffer than simple referral but it is often more informative the agency may provide facts about budget levels authorizations and appropriations the amount of money available for the program the total amount requested in applications on file the number of applications received and the number likely to be approved agency priorities categories of competition or targets by region key dates and deadlines and information on who makes recommendations and decisions if your constituent decides to submit formal grant application for particular program the congressional office may recommend or arrange meeting with agency offices in the district or state another way to get input from the agency early in the process is prereview of the application many agencies provide procedural re view of proposals one or two months before the application deadline such review while not dealing with the substance of the proposal allows an agency to inform the applicant of any technical problems or omissions to be corrected before the proposal is formally submitted when constituent notifies the congressional office that proposal has been submitted the office can send letter to the agency expressing the members interest in being kept informed of developments relating to the application in addition the letter may also request list of all applicants for the particular grant this enables the office to consider initiating letters of support from the member to those applicants in his or her state or district who did not approach the office prior to submission of their application whether the member chooses to support an applicant or extends support to all applicants from the state or district the office should maintain contact with all interested parties as it is notified of progress reports from agency contacts

made possible only through combination of funding sourcesfederal and state government grants as well as private or corporate foundation grants should be considered grant seekers should know that most federal funding goes to states in the form of formula or block grants for many programs application for federal funds must be made through state administering agencies saas whatever the funding source it is important to emphasize that once project has been clearly defined constituents can improve their likelihood of success by doing preliminary research in order to find potential funding sources whose goals are most nearly consistent with their own because the state local or private groups needing assistance may be unaware of available funding or uncertain how to go about obtaining it congressional offices can help identify sources congressional grants staff can also serve as liaison between grant seekers and government executive offices including their own state offices that administer federal grants to assist members in their representational duties and to help congressional offices respond to grants questions crs has developed two grants web pages

occasionally choose to communicate with selected audiences through targeted mailings to inform constituents of the possible impact of new legislative or executive actions that might revise existing programs create new ones or alter funding levels important dates and deadlines and the advantages and limitations of various programs this is especially important as new programs for are created and receive congressional appropriations for example newly funded economic development program may be announced on grantsgov with short application deadline of which constituents should be made aware another way to get information to interested constituents is for congressional office to coordinate seminars on federal and private assistance at state and district locations an office can sponsor programs bringing together federal state and local officials as well as foundation academic and corporate specialists experienced volunteers and constituents who share common concerns many agencies foundations or the found ation center at httpwwwfdncenterorg and corporations are willing to provide speakers for district seminars arranged by congressional offices and also to provide such materials as brochures sample proposals and lists of information contacts for telephone numbers to contact speakers from federal departments and agencies congressional staff can use crs report 98446 congressional liaison offices of selected federal agencies for constituent orientation and group seminars member may consider use of crs products as handouts and presentation materials although

congressional offices to write letters to federal departments and agencies on their behalf crs report rs21117 ethical considerations in assisting constituents with grant requests before federal agencies provides some guidance some grants such as for firefighters and other funding for homeland security are determined by formula to states and jurisdictions and letters may not be needed explain to your constituent that the federal grants process is competitive that your office can consider writing letter to the department or agency once the individual submits fully developed grant proposal for most requests use neutral language expressing the members interest in proposal rather than support lending support to proposal that might not be funded under the competitive process and when there are competing applications from several constituents might lead to disappointment and reflect negatively on the member for most constituent requests for lettersrite letter only when your constituent has submitted the grant proposal to the department or agency information needed from the grant seeker name of applicant contact person for the project if different grant program name and number agency contact address grants officers name if available deadline for proposal submission project name and summary the project summary should highlight what the projectprogram does and who it serves why this program is important to the community any unique features of the project needs not already being met other support for the project such as local government specifically how the grant money will be used write directly to the person in the department of agency provide copy of the letter to your constituent to submit with the proposal the members letter could say why this is important to his district what needs are being met etcthe summary supplied by the constituent should give the objectives of the propsalproject close by asking the grants officer to let the member know when decision will be made and to keep your office informed about the progress of the proposal httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34035g9g155g138g151g157g156g561g25g152g155g148g561g146g151g561g138

for the agency making the award to notify the senate office first senator of the presidents party may be first notified then the house office and finally the recipient this allows members of congress an opportunity to notify recipients of grants not all awards are announced publicly in the case of block grants the office of management and budget notifies senate offices of the allocations among the states the states decision on how to distribute funds among local communities is however not necessarily communicated to congressional offices in these cases good state agency contact may be willing to provide the office with this information announcements of grants awarded are often posted on member web pages many congressional offices develop files or databases of grants awarded to track funding to their districts and states detailed information is difficult to obtain though legislation in the 109 th congress pl 109282 the federal funding accountability and transparency act of 2006 calls for the office of management and budget omb to develop database beginning july 2007 for summary of sources and limitations of currently available data and the new laws requirements see crs web

implementation issues by garrett hatch to avoid disappointment congressional staff might consider cautioning people from making requests that are unlikely to be approved at the federal level suggest considering other funding sources early in the process in cases where grant applications are made and turned down the congressional office may notify constituents of their right to know why the award was not granted and what the appeals process is constituents may ask the agency for an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the proposal or may give the agency permission to provide the congressional office with this information alternative programs or other approaches may be suggested following an adverse decision your constituen t might also decide to improve the initial application and start the process again g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g3g156g156g146g156g157g138g151g140g142g561g138g151g141g561g21g152g158g155g140g142g156g561 hundreds of grants or loans for various

district grants and projects staff usually work closely with federal agency representatives in their areas with their state members of congress and senators with state and local elected officials and with state councils of government many federal programs are administered directly by state agencies or other entities within the state and many states have programs funded out of their own appropriations that supplement or complement federal programs local councils of government where they exist have access to federal funds for providing technical assistance guidance and counse ling in

available competition for these funds is great and just as is the case in searching for federal support grant seekers enhance their chances for success by doing preliminary research to find grant makers whose priorities and goals match their own by searching foundation websites grant seekers can find guidelines copies of annual reports and tax returns to learn whether their proposals match foundations areas of interest and geographic guidelines whether the proposal is within its budgetary constraints and whether it normally funds the type of project being considered there are many different kinds of foundations with widely varying resources and purposes some are national in scope others are set up purely for the purpose of local giving some are endowed by an individual or family to provide funds for specific social educational or religious purposes others are companysponsored still others are publicly supported community foundations grant seekers might begin by identifying state or local foundations these may have greater interest in local projects than larger foundations mainly concerned with programs of national significance direct corporate giving should also be explored many corporations support local projects in areas where they have their headquarters or plants or sponsor projects which somehow enhance their corporate image because of this variety different strategies may be needed for dealing with different foundations there are few foundations that publicize their funding policies and even initiate projects but generally they do not usually the grant seeker must take the first step and approach the foundation about his or her proposal although it is hard to generalize about foundations they tend to be more flexible than federal funding agencies and to have fewer bureaucratic requirements many foundations see their purpose as providing shortterm startup funding for demonstration projects frequently such foundations are the best source to turn to for funding emergency situations or small highrisk innovative programs in some cases foundation officials will work closely with inexperienced grant seekers to help them develop realistic proposals the foundation center serves as clearinghouse of information on private philanthropic giving and is good starting point for identifying likely funding sources the centers office in washington dc provides each congressional office with its yearly foundation directory and can advise staff on other sources of private funding the foundation center can be contacted via phone at 202
