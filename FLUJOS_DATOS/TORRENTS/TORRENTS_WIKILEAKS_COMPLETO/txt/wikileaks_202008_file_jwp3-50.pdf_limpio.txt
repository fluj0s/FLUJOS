personnel involved at the operational level in peace support operations psos however compression of the levels of conflict within psos and the nature of the guidance offered dictate that this edition of jwp 350 should reach enlighten and be of utility to wider audien ce consequently comment is also made on the role of senior national and internationa l leaders in the rule of law education commercial humanitarian and health media economic and diplomatic spheres as well as the role of the execu tive leadership of interna tional organisations and non governmental organisations jwp 350 2nd edition should have particular relevance for training programmes that address the mands of complex emer gencies in general or pso specifically context 2 with the decision to cr eate the united nations and to underwrite peace and security through collectiv measures the context of the application of military force was fundamentally altere d military doctrine and strategy evolved to meet this context alongside the mature doctrine of war doctrine of peacekeeping emerged and in the hybrid context of the cold war the idealised concepts underpinning that doctrine were adequate with the end of the cold war significant shift in state practice towards defence of inalienable ri ghts the dignity of the individual and security in the face of asymmetric terror has been favoured ahead of the absolute sovereignty of nation states in response to this altered context pso doctrine must recognise and embrace the need for continue d evolution and improved sophistication the prevalence of genocide division and terrorism of unprecedented impact stand as testimony to this need 3 now the inherently more intricate and exacting role assigned in psos requires doctrine that accommodates comple xity and acknowledges the longterm commitment needed to achieve lasting resolution of crises also to be fully effective the doctrine must be multinational multid isciplinary and comprehensive in its approach accordingly this edition of jwp 350 addresses the complex of civil and military actors that must be engaged to achie ve success for this doctrine to become fully effective consistent and reciprocal level of will to enga ge by and with all agencies will be necessary it will be some time before we ca n properly regard pso doctrine as having reached maturity jwp 350 2nd edition recognises this truth and contributes to the process of evolution iii 2nd edition jwp 350 terminology 4 where appropriate terms that are already in co mmon military usage and defined in either jwp 0011 united kingdom glossary of joint and multinational terms and definitions or nato publications have been used these are duplicated in the glossary new terms that have be defined are similarly available in the glossary structure 5 in chapter 1 readers are provided with the background to psos and the agreed military definitions associated with psos as the foundation for considering the factors that must be accommodated by an effec tive contemporary doctrine for the military contribution to psos the concepts and c ontext of psos at the strategic level are subsequently developed in chapter 2 the fundamentals and principles of pso that supplement existing military doctrine are th explained in chapter 3 chapter 4 outlines the planning process and offers advice on the planning of pso and the military contribution chapte r 5 details tasks and technique s usually associated with pso these are particularly pertinent to the military peace support force supplementary information is presented in th annexes for ease of reference the annexes and appendices are printed on yellow pages with the exception of the united nations charter which is on light blue 6 given the radically change d strategic context and to improve the utility of the document for those who must participat in pso ideas are presented without reference to the historical lessons that underp in them it is hoped that those wishing to develop deeper appreciation of the subject will exploit the substantial body of work referenced in the bibliography footnotes throughout the document serve to embellish the main text and record the key references used use and evaluation 7 readers are encouraged to read all chapters sequen tially but may wish to use the table of contents to target their readi ng every effort has been made to avoid prescription instead flexible framework is offered to guide the complex of military and civil actors in planning mounting and executing comprehensive plan that delivers longterm crisis resolution ever pso will in some important way be different from past experience the user of this jwp should not therefore seek templates that can be slavishly app lied taken as whole jwp 350 2nd edition offers guidance that must be considered and creatively applied to the particular circumstances of crisis having asserted the need for rationalisation and suggested that work in this arena remains embryoni c it is hoped that this revision will be considered objectively by staffs regiona l security organisations international iv 2nd edition jwp 350 military staffs humanitarian

notwithstanding the requirement exists to develop national doctrine to address those areas not adequately covered or at all by nato doctrine and to influence the devel opment of nato doctrine this is met by the development of hierarchy of joint warfare publications jwps interim joint warfare publications ijwps are published as necessary to meet those occasions when particular aspect of join t

assure the protection of the weak and deal authoritatively with aggressors or would be aggressors 1 section i introducti on and peace support operations definitions 101 for the foreseeable future united kingdom foreign policy is likely to underpin its conflict prevention activities with the regene ration or sustainment of fragile states the united kingdom government usually undertak such actions as part of united nations led operations or as part of multinational endeavours2 occasionally it undertakes unilateral action such as in si erra leone in 2000 the generic title of peace support operations psos is given by the military to these activities typically the united kingdoms armed forces are given responsibility for preventing or suppressing any conflict so that others can undertake activities that will alleviate the immediate symptoms of conflict andor frag ile state usually there are associated activities to ensure stability in the longterm the application of military force to create the right conditions for overall success eg safe and secu re environment is key foundation the way in which the military force is pplied and the means used can promote or prejudice other immediate and stabilising activities to this end it is imperative that the military commanders ve working knowle dge of pso doctrine and its underpinning concepts it is highl desirable that the leaders of associated activities have an appreciation of the military pso doctrine so that the probability of success is increased 102 military terms and definitions throughout this publication pso terms are defined in the context of military operations where an agreed north atlantic treaty organisation nato definition3 is appropriate the nato definition will be used alternatively united ki

willing but it is increasingly likely that some psos may be european unionled 3 nato definitions are contained in allie d administrative publication6 aap6 nato glossary of terms and definitions those which are nato agreed are yet to be incorporated 4 united kingdom definitions are contained in joint warfare publication jwp 0011 uk glossary of joint and multinational terms and definitions 11 2nd edition jwp 350 103 key current pso and associated term s and definitions are as follows peace support operations an operation that im partially makes use of diplomatic civil and military means normally in pursuit of united nations charter purposes and principles to restor or maintain peace such operations may include conflict prevention pe acemaking peace enforcement peacekeeping peacebuilding andor humanitarian operations56 b conflict prevention peace support operation employing complementary diplomatic civil and when necessary military means to monitor and identify the causes of conflic t and take timely action to prevent the occurrence escalation or resumption of hostilities5 c peace support force military force assi gned to peace support operation7 nato agreed d peacemaking peace support operation conducted after the initiation of conflict to secure ceasefire or peaceful settlement that involves primarily diplomatic action supported wh necessary by direct or indirect use of military assets5 peace enforcement peace support opera tion conducted to maintain ceasefire or peace agreement where the level of consent and compliance is uncertain and the threat of disruption is high peace support force psf must be capable of applying credible coercive force and must apply the provisions of the peace agreement impartially5 f peacekeeping peace support operation following an agreement or ceasefire that has established permi ssive environment where the level of consent and compliance is high and the th reat of disruption is low the use of force by peacekeepers is normally limited to selfdefence 5 g peace building peace support operation employing complementary diplomatic civil and when necessary military means to address the underlying causes of conflict and the l ongerterm needs of the people it requires commitment to longterm pr ocess and may run concurrently with other types of peace support operations5 5 aap6 6 this is interpreted to mean that the application of diplomatic civil and military means will be impartial it is recognised that the objective of the operation may be perceived by some as partial for example pso mounted t prevent conflict and reform the governmen t in failing state where internal collapse th reatens peace may be seen as partial to the opponents of that state government 7 the definition of peace pport force is nato agreed and published in ajp34 nonarticle v crisis response operations but awaits publication in aap6 12 2nd edition jwp 350 104 levels of war 8 an appreciation that mil itary activities are conducted at different levels involving different peopl will help nonmilitary readers understand the context of pso the united kingdom interpretation9 of these levels can be summarised as follows the strategic level the strategic level concer ns the application of the full range of national resources to achie ve policy objectives and is the domain of the prime minister and the cabinet the military are one component of the national resources of the government although the changing nature of politics economics and tec hnology have added to the complexity of the strategic level military st rategists face the same challenges as their forbears developing deploying sustaining recove ring and redeploying military forces for the attainment of political objectives b the operational level the agreed definition of the operational level is the level of war at which campaigns and major operations are planned conducted and sustained to accomplish stra tegic objectives within theatres or areas of operations 10 in short the operational vel is about employment and provides the vital link or gearing between strategic objectives and the tactical employment of forces during the pla nning phase this responsibility rests with the joint commander jt comd who for united kingdomled operation would normally be based at the permanent joint headquarters pjhq once force is deployed to th joint operations area review and execution of the plans are the activitie s of the joint task force commander jtfc on ukled pso the jtfc would be the psf commander the title psf commander is used in this publica tion on multinational operations which are not led by united kingdom officer the highest united kingdom military representative is known as the national contingent commander ncc c tactical level tactical level is the level at which actions actually take place in joint military operation th highest tactical commanders are the environmental component commanders ccs for maritime land air special forces and logistics who work directly to the jtfc or psf commander below them ar formation and unit commanders whose task it is to engage directly with adversaries armed factions or the civil population 8 jdp 01 joint operations identifies 3 levels of war for the purposes of this publication the of war has been dropped 9 jdp 01 10 jwp 0011 13 2nd edition jwp 350 section ii background 105 this section briefly outlines the history of pso concepts and doctrine offering an insight into how this rela tively new area of military thou ght has evolved résumé of the rationale for this revision of the united kingdoms pso publication is included for those seeking greater detail of how collective security and pso doctrine has evolved fuller analysis is at annex tracing the history 106 the maintenance of inter national peace and security by effective collective measures is one of the uns founding purposes for reference the charter is at appendix a1 light blue pages however throughout the cold war the was generally limited to moderating tension nd aggression by mounting traditional or nordic peacekeeping11 operations the fundamental principles of the traditional approach were that all partie s must consent force would onl be used in selfdefence and peacekeeping forces would be impartial in the context of the dispute in addition to the trinity of peacekeeping princip consent limited use of force and impartiality the secretar general unsg exercised daytoday control of the peacekeeping operations 107 notable successes were recorded for this approach largely because consent of belligerent parties was secured before pe acekeeping force depl oyed few foresaw the abrupt end to the cold war era w ith its inherent stability and the serious implications for the roles capacity flexib ility and reach of the and those seeking to contribute forces 108 by the 1990s it became abundantly clear that the traditional concept of peacekeeping was inadequate in the face of contemporary conflicts and that capacity to assemble deploy and control forces in psos was poorly matched to the tasks it then faced in parallel with atte mpts to reform the military doctrine responded to the more demanding remits now being placed upon psf commanders unfortunately the diplomatic convenience of considering mandates in terms of the chapter divisions of the charter had b ecome restrictive norm for those deployed in support of peace united kingdom pea ce support experience 109 for the united kingdoms military forces vast body of learning was drawn upon in the search for credib and effective pso doctrine12 counterinsurgency 11 the term peacekeeping does not appear in the united nations charter and was first adopted following the deployment of force to the sina i in 1956 unef to secure ceasefir between egyptian and israeli forces 12 this ranged from lessons noted during the colonial policing of the north west front ier through the notable and informative malaya campaigns of the 1950s to experiences in the oman and northern ireland 14 2nd edition jwp 350 doctrine derived during the period of decolonisation provided an important framework upon which peacekeeping and c ounterterrorism experience could be moulded 110 throughout the later part of the 20th century the peacekeeping trinity consent coupled with the linked principle of impartiality and limits on the use of force13 remained relatively unaltered however by the end of the millennium it was clear that the doctrine had not kept pace with events critically the extant doctrine offered little guidance on peace enforcement ro which in bosnia and iraq14 the united kingdom and coalition partners were now performing section iii the need for contemporary peace support operations doctrine 111 the end of the cold war altered the strategic context in which psos were conducted as international actors15 have elected to do so mething in response to genocide famine and barbarity contr oversially recourse to intervention16 has increased responses have however be far from uniform frequently being determined by issues and interests beyond humanitarian or legal obligation17 the unsg had this to say in 1998 why was the established if not to act as benign policeman or doctor can we really afford to let each state be the judge of its own right or duty to intervene in another states internal conflict if we do will we not be forced to legitimise hitlers championship of the sudeten germ ans or soviet intervention in afghanistan most of us would prefer i think especially now that the cold war is over to see such decisions taken collectively by an internationa l institution whose authority is generally respected 18 intervention sovereignty and obligations 112 debate over recent years has struggled to balance the precepts of sovereignty with theories that support higher and im perative obligation to uphold human rights whilst international law has not yet accomm odated these altered pe rceptions state and 13 the inherent right to use force in selfdefence is wellgrounded in law and readily understood 14 during operations to protect minorities in the north and south of iraq following atrocities after the first gulf war 15 the expression international actors has been used to encompass both states and the many internati onal organisations ios and nongovernmental organisations ngos 16 here intervention is considered as inclusive of all actions both military and legislative which are desi gned to exert influence within the jurisdiction of an independent political community 17 actions by groupings that sought to ban the use of antipersonnel mines are illustrative of this trend 18 kofi annan unsg in an address at ditchley park 26 june 1998 15 2nd edition jwp 350 regional organisation practice coupled with security council precedents suggests that changes in international law or its interpretation are occurring 113 there are occasions when national gove rnment or subnational organs of government fail to uphold international norms they may be unable or unwilling to prevent abuse or perhaps prove to be the sponsors of abuse they may be unable or unwilling to prevent faction or group being bject to or threatened with significant harm when this happens fundamental dissociation19 may have occurred20 consequently responsibility to provide protection21 may fall upon the international community this shift in the concept of sovereignty places obligations on governing authority as precondition for that governing authoritys own protection under international agreements thus membership of the confers the protection of the charter by moderating interstate relati onships whilst in parallel imposing intra state obligations22 that seek to ensure effective governance in accordance with united nations charter purposes and principles to respond to these changes and the associated responsibilities those who are tasked with or choose to assist with upholding renewing or rest oring acceptable governance need an expansion of the concepts and doctrine that guide their actions working in civil military complex 114 the 1990s brought significant blurring of the boundaries between civil and military personnel engaged in supporting peace synopse s of key international and nongovernmental agencies commonly encount ered in psos are given at annex b23 the complex of participants particularly the nonmilitary is increasingly diverse however there are signs that many agencies bringing security aid and assistance to those in need are increasingly able to id entify common goals and to derive mutually advantageous operating agreements 19 when it can then be argued that an authority cannot claim to be by for or of the people fundamental dissociation between the people and the ruling elite or governing body can be said to have occurred 20 this view was first expressed by weller in sovereignty and suffering harris ed the politics of humanitarian intervention 1995 p 33 et seq and subsequently in access to victims reconceptualizing the right of humanitarian intervention asser institute international law and the hagues 750th anniversary as the capital of international law1999 p353 et seq 21 an extensive literature exists on this topic and whilst work can yet claim to be definitive the report of the international commission on intervention and state sovereignty international development research centre ottawa dec 2001 does offer comprehensive balanced and compe lling contemporary analysis of the intervention sovereignty paradox see also wwwyaleeduacunsnew_ggggindex 22 these obligations have 3 facets firstly the governing body is responsible for the safety and welfare of its citizens secondly failure to discharge this responsibility will be subject to internal censure by the people and ultimately by the international community through the thirdly these obligatio ns are personal in character such that individual agents of the state can and will be held responsible for their acts of commission or omission the inception of the international criminal court icc stands testament to this reality and the resolve to uphold and enforce international human rights norms as codified in treaties and other legally binding instruments 23 synopses are also given for the key agencies and departments of the united kingdom government and of the government of the united states of america as resu lt of its preeminent position in international affairs 16 2nd edition jwp 350 115 in parallel government departments traditionally associated with military action and other departments are increasi ngly working in collaboration even so psos do impose demands in planning executing and supporting action that may be at odds with the different departmental work ing cultures these cultural differences manifest themselves in varying attitudes towards coordination to lerance of ambiguity the need for and nature of planning and criti cally the legitimate role of the military 116 many civilian agencies and departments of state routinely function with high tolerance for ambiguity in these agenci and nonmilitary partments several differing perspectives on an issue may hol d sway at any give n time and decision making has evolved to accomm odate the ebb and flow of international and domestic sentiment political will political intent and media attention in these areas ambiguity affords freedom to negotiate and manoeuvre in contrast military staffs generally seek to minimise ambiguity by making informed assumptions where absolute clarity proves impractical in mounting and directing pso neither institutional position should be regarded as improper facets of each approach are appropriate to the pso environment nd collectively improve the probability of success 117 for many civilian agencies and government departments the term planning is associated with higher management proce ss and the need to formulate programmes driven by economics or donor considerat ions whilst analogous planning is undertaken in the management of defence military planning at the operational level is focused on the use of military force and is conducted using hi ghly developed and trusted procedures although wedded to the value of deta iled planning most military staffs are acutely aware that plan is ev er executed without revision accordingly british defence doctrine especia lly the concept of mission command24 places great emphasis on timely action and initiative wh ilst remaining responsive to superior direction 118 notwithstanding the wider intervention bate there is invariably tension between government departments as to how nd when military forces should be used until the 1990s many held that military force as an instrument of foreign policy was too frequently held idle waiting for wars that might never arise events have since demonstrated the wider and near constant utility of military force and the prevalence of protracted psos the demands of this new era have seen scar ce military resources training capacity and equipment expended in activity well in excess of earlier planning assumptions in such cha nged environment seni or commanders and ministers face difficult task in matchi ng capability to commitm ent especially as many psos are of indeterminate and poten tially longterm duration budgetary procurement training and manning plans are now adjusting to accommodate the new reality 24 jwp 0011 17 2nd edition jwp 350 the comprehensive approach 119 events have shown that the prospects of success in pso are much enhanced if comprehensive response is used in adopting such an approach planning and execution must be coordinated across government departments and potential participants unfortunately there remains tendency for government mechanisms to be optimised for the demands of routine gove rnment or shortterm crisis response rather than the specific comp lex and protracted demands of psos in the absence of unifying leadership and suitable coordinating structures the full range of contributions may not be used or may be delivered in less than efficient manner rivalries may manifest themselves in obstructionism or the imposition of conditions for engagement moreover the rivalry may become part of the problem further risk may also be introduced by the tendency in moments of crisis for ad hoc arrangements to subvert proven working practices methods of communi cation and decisionmaking such ad hoc arrangements prejudice the chances of long term success by seeking shortterm gain only 120 in the united kingdom crisis manageme nt organisation has been established to counter many of these pitfalls for th military commander at the operational level and above understanding precisely how the defence crisis management organisation25 dcmo is configured for given em ergency is of critical importance the commander must know how strategic direction of the campaign will be determined and how he can support or exploi t the range of effects available to his force the contributing gove rnments and the mandating authority adoption of comprehensive response demands that stra tegic and operational level planning be conducted using sophisticated doctrine to guide suitably configured command and control system the way ahead 121 the key to success in effectively underw riting peace is the will to fund the necessary action the will to do what is needed for as long as it is needed and ultimately the will to accept casualties in defence of the basic freedoms of distant strangers 122 if collective security is to become universal reality more reliable understanding of the rights and obligations conferred by sovereignty is needed however to assist in bringing this into effect military doctrine must respond to the existing perceptions hence this evolu tion of pso doctrine by updating and reviewing the united kingdom national pso doctrine the ability of her majestys government to underwrite peace and augmen t the rule of international law may be enhanced 25 more detail on the defence crisis management organisation is provided in chapter 5 18 2nd edition jwp 350 123 there is an aspiration that others will accept this experiencebased revision of the united kingdom approach to pso and in particular the milita ry contribution ideally it will achieve nearuniversal consis tent and more flexible doctrine this may in turn guide the actions of those seeking to uphold the principles of the charter and contemporary conceptions of co llective peace and secu rity practically recognition of the need for symbiotic relati onship with and by the military is key so that the objectives of all those contribut ing to pso their working practices and cultures continue to be acknowledged and importantly deliver benefits 19 2nd edition jwp 350 intentionally blank 110 2nd edition jwp 350 chapter 2 peace support operations strategic context and concepts 201 it is important for all those working in peace support operation pso to have an understanding of the strategic cont ext within which pso is conducted an appreciation of the strategic intent the sired solution or outcome or any interim stages to be achieved will shape the way in which the ope ration is conducted and the means that are used whilst 2 psos will be the same the use of generic concepts and principles at the strate gic level will aid initial planni ng and the implementation of an operation section i instruments of national power 202 the agreement on and issue of the manda for pso to counter threat to peace is matter of international politics the creation of military peace support force psf is subject to the same political process the conduct of international politics is about applying natio nal power within the international political system typically national power is applied in conj unction with allies and partners in support of national and collective interests national power consists of trinity of diplomacy economic power and military power1 each of which can also be used as an instrument of policy the diplomatic instrument 203 the diplomatic power of persuasion result s from wide range of attributes the ability to negotiate to broker agreements to massage relationships between allies and potential partners and generally to get ones way by force of argument rather than by resorting to economic or military means effective diplomacy relies on combination of reputation integrity and both economi c and military substance to back up the negotiating skills necessary to turn them into influence the diplomatic instrument is constantly in use particularly during pso when the need to influence allies and neutrals is as essential as the need to use military force against those perpetuating conflict the economic instrument 204 overseas investments and the ebb and fl ow of capital and trade provide scope for the exercise of economic influence th economic instrument is multifaceted as with all instruments of policy economic ac tion has to be used appropriately and in 1 recognising the increasing importance of information the us has added it to the three traditional instruments resulting in dime the united kingdom approach is to see information as an essential underpinning of the economic diplomatic and military instruments in achieving political obj ectives not as separate and discrete instrument see jwp 001 british defence doctrine bdd 2nd edition page 24 and 25 21 2nd edition jwp 350 conducive circumstances one aspect of th economic instrument is the imposition of economic sanctions this is c ontroversial as sanctions ar seldom prompt or precise in their effect within the global economy and because success is difficult to measure the economic instrument may re quire the application of military force to bolster the desired effect for example through em bargo operations to enforce economic sanctions the military instrument 205 military power is the definitive instrument of policy the instrument to be brought into play when othe r means are inadequate have failed in some way or require reinforcement the status of military power and the ability to engage successfully in combat could be the key to restoring peace to country region or ethnic group however nations must also be conscious of the utility and limitations of military forces in conflict prevention including defence diplomacy2 the military in turn should be conscious of the precon ceived ideas and indeed misperceptions that other actors might have of them the essence of strategy in peace support operations 206 the key to the successful conduct of pso is the c onsidered use of the most appropriate mix of instruments in the prev ailing circumstances although diplomatic means are always employed they often require economic or military actions to support and enhance their effect indeed it will very often be the case that diplomatic means are only successful because they are ba cked up with an implicit or declared threat to use other means if diplomacy fails any threat matter how it is communicated must be credible and must be capable of being carried out if the conditions warrant it to be an effective instrument of national power the military instrument must be mainta ined and developed in ma nner consistent with the demands that are likely to be placed upon it it should not operate in isolation but only as part of fully coordinated and cohere nt strategy in whic h the diplomatic and economic instruments will be as important in their way as the military forces and the military component of the strategy suppor ting them overall the diplomatic economic and military instruments have to be used in relation to one another and co ordinated multinational nd national crossgovernment information campaign3 should be used to enhance their effectiveness 2 defence diplomacy the promotion of

typically the psf is used to promote create and maintain safe and secure environment where short and longterm solutions can be put in place shortterm solutions typically address the symptoms of

policy responses to internati onal crises in turn range of military tasks have been approved in which united kingdom armed forces are likely to be involved all the tasks draw upon military capabilities in different ways for the united kingdom the distinction between tasks that fall within the definition of peace support operations and other tasks lies not in doctrine or the range of

full range of military tasks b governments under the auspices of the regional organisation or coalition may consider at least 4 policy response options6 which can be broadly characterised as 1 option 1 mount pso that seeks to exploit the complementary operation of the instruments of nati onal power in an effort to bring about longterm conflict resolution 2 option 2 mount focused intervention using the military instrument of power assisted by limited range of other agencies to neutralise immediate threats to peac and security thereby establishing stability7 in the conflict 3 option 3 mount

able to deter or coerce potential belligerents away from conflict while the other instruments of power are used to secure lasting peace 212 previous responses to crises have of ten involved transitions between or combinations of these options however such approaches are far from efficient shifting intent alters the effects that must be achieved and therefore the means assigned to the task the ef fectbased differentiation bri ngs clearer focus upon what is to be achieved and hen ce the means and methods that must be employed to ensure success the spectrum of tension 213 for many years the use of military force has been conceptually compartmentalised these co mpartments have been iden tified by reference to the theoretical or legislative context of the use of military force as consequence there have been clearly demarcated di visions warfighting in war8 or outside war as operations other than war ootw9 in so doing doctrine has fallen victim to similar compartmentalised thinking whilst desire to adopt simple models may be understood in the context of the cold wa r era their unaltered application in the inherently more complex and challenging world of the 21st century would be inexcusable 214 shifting international understanding of co llective security and the lessons of recent history now demand an altered focus from the apparent context of use to the outcome or effect that is to be achieved this is the strategic intent to be of practical value modelling of military powers utility and hence the precepts guiding its use must recognise the place and purpose of military power in the progression of politically defined objectives figure 22 illustrates how with respect to pso doctrine the spectrum of tension has evolved into an increasingly compartmentalised matrix that misrepresents the fluid nature of such crises 8 war the most extreme manifestation of armed conflict char acterised by intense extensive and sustained combat usually between states jwp

217 while distinguishing pso from othe r operations may be clear from the strategic intent the precise outcome that is desired for the longterm is often less clear for number of reasons it may not be possible for nations to agree on the desired final outcome of engagement in pso th urgency for immediate action to relieve suffering and prevent escalation or stop fu rther conflict may override the need to define the final outcome the crisis may prevent meaningful engagement with an indigenous population in order to determin an acceptable outcome it may not be possible to gain early international consensu s on longterm outcom however it is usually possible to gain international ag reement to initiate pso and thereby mandate for an interim result or objective 218 it is against the desired outcome or interim objective that nations will determine their own national strategy and as result they will establish their contribution to the nature and length of th eir engagement in pso and any supporting psf historically the final outcome sought is either degree of stability at which disengagement can occur without risk of return to crisis in the short term or the point at which number of criteria have b een satisfied that i ndicate that longterm stability is selfsustaining for psos it is c onvenient to consider steadystate criteria as the analysis of an endst ate the steadystate criteria will comprise broadly based list of essential criteria that must be achiev ed and be selfsustain ing before pso can be treated as accomplished ideally the mandate agreed at the strategic level should make unambiguous reference to these crit eria and only exceptionally should the mandate include time criteria in the ab sence of agreement on the desired final outcome interim criteria may be agreed as goals to be attained enroute to defining and attaining the steadystate criteria idea lly the success of pso will be measured against the intended outcome practically it will be easier to measure the individual interim and steadystate crite ria that have been met interim and steadystate criteria military guidance 219 military commanders have often found th emselves obliged to operate with ambiguous or limited strategic guidance in june 1999 general sir michael jackson as commander kfor was obliged to opera with scant direction from nato14 endstate had been declared and clear focus had been developed on the civilian dimensions of the situation in such ci rcumstances general ja ckson was obliged to formulate an interim endstate15 that could unify civil and military objectives the text produced read as follows 14 jackson general sir michael kfor the inside story in rusi february 2000 p18 15 an unfortunate oxymoron that tends to cause debate of process and doctrine in preference to the i ssues at hand 28 2nd edition jwp 350 kosovo is province of fry16 under effective administration with arrangements in place for local electi ons with all refugees having

activities within kosovo with growing appreciation of the benefits of respect for the rule of law with an independent appointed judiciary and an effective civilian police force with recovering agricultu ral economic sector and opportunities identified for economic diversification with increased inward investment and reducing inflation thereby couraging further normalisation and improvement of conditions in kosovo 220 although general jacksons definition was complete and able to enfranchise wide range of actors it would undoubtedly have helped to shape and refine the campaign had the strategic aim of the interv ention been adequately and transparently declared at the strategic vel where strategic guidanc is incomplete or ambiguous the responsibility for guidance to psf lies with the military commanders 221 the concept of using steadystate cr iteria as the mandated goal in pso campaign planning18 seeks to apply the lessons of th past if the mandating authority does not know cannot or will not defi ne the desired outcome for pso an unnecessarily indirect route may be followe d ideally steadystate criteria will set targets for sustainable development tran sparent government electoral process security sector reform judicial probity human rights observation equitable social structures and respect for other internationa l norms of behaviour as the psf is often the first representation in crisis region of the authority of pso mandate the psf may be able to create safe and secure environment in which the complex of actors can operate without an adequate view of the steadystate or interim criteria however in such circumstances the military activity may not adequately take account of the wider aspect of the pso and thereby prejudice success overall section iv the constituents of nation or society and the complex of actors 222 the conclusion from chapter 1 was that post coldwar state practice and the prevalence of intra state crises and conflicts has co mbined with the emergence of globally significant nonstate actors to offer new threats19 these threats challenge traditional perceptions of how we should pr otect international peace and security when considering the origins of conflict and more importantly how the origins may 16 federal republic of yugoslavia serbia and montenegro 17 ustria çlirimtare kosevës kosovo liberation army 18 see chapter 4 19 more detailed consideration is given in annex 29 2nd edition jwp 350 210 2nd edition be addressed by pso it is helpful to have conceptual model of the key constituents of nation or society the instrume nts of national power are supplemented by internal components of national and local governance including the rule of law an education system commercial sector the in stitutions concerned with the welfare and health of the population and an informati on infrastructure including the media in this model the constituents come together to form the nation or society with levels of interdependency between each of the cons tituents in addition the constituents themselves will be based upon the culture and hi story of the nation or society this is shown graphically in figure 24 education commercial humanitarian health information military economic diplomacy administration governanc enation or societyrule of lawconstituentsconstituents history and culture figure 24 the key constituents of nation or society 223 the origins of crises often lie in the fa ilure of nations or societies to govern adequately one or more of these constitu ents in manner wh ich benefits their population and eradicates or suppresses the pot ential sources of conflict in each key constituent there may be issues or percep tions of inequality with regard to ethnic origin class gender or religion or challenges to the underlying cultural values these issues or perceptions may provide the nutrients for or be the seeds of conflict using the conceptual model the origins of conflict may be more readily identified this may assist in determining how to regenerate reform or sustain the constituents that are failing or have failed using the instrument s of national power typically under united nations or regional organisation auspices and involve interested parties such as international organisations ios and nong overnmental organisations ngos where the seeds of conflict lie in et hnic origin class or religion action will be needed in each of the constituents to ensure that the potential for conflict is reduced or removed the action may be complicated by the need to take account of other factors that are changing or have changed the society or nation irreversibly such as hivaids and genocide jwp 350 the complex of actors 224 experience of conflicts in bosnia si erra leone and afgha nistan support the need for response that brings all the international communitys power to bear upon given crisis to achieve decisive effe ct in so doing the failures in the key constituents can be addressed in complementary and longterm response typically this will involve complex of actors these are representatives from the international community working alongsid representatives of the indigenous populations in each of the constituent areas as well as the psf in collaboration with any international civil authority such as special representative either of the secretary general srsg or the european union eusr or head of mission hom this is represented in figure 25 war key constituents international community complex of actors work with indigenous

peace at best there may be subservience and dependency on pso to maintain peace representativ of the indigenous population may not be forthcoming until pso has established an environment in which all indigenous representatives can work with out fear the complex of act ors will therefore change as pso progresses 211 2nd edition jwp 350 section v the framework20 concept 226 comprehensive planning when specific conflict or crisis emerges members of the complex of act ors should all have their part to play in strategic planning process to achieve conflict resolu tion however practical necessity and recent events have shown that the pursuit of an effective and timely response is best served through the adoption of framewo rk body this framework could be provided by the nato or regional body such as the europ ean union eu or the organisation for security and cooperati on in europe osce in the case of coalition single nation may be lected as the fra mework nation 227 application of the framework the framework concept can be applied at all levels of planning and execution however the impact of the concept is most pronounced at the operational level it is this level that forms the nexus between those shaping the strategic environment and promulgating their strategic vision usually by means of mandate and the web of operational nd tactical actors that will strive to achieve the desired effects fo r the psf this level involves the creation and execution of the operational plan in orde r to achieve the campaign objectives above and below the operationa l level the breadth and diversity of the actor complex constitute the difficulties inherent in and f undamental strength of pso response in the rare event of purely national response the model remains of relevance with the breadth of the strategic level repres enting the executive pangovernmental engagement this must be mirrored at the tactical level by actions and actors from the ministries able to contribu to the desired effects 228 practical constraints in attempting to coordinate complex of actors and potential effects the planning process must be iterative each iteration should refine contextspecific options through exposure and discussion the need for rapid response though often an important consider ation should not lead to illconsidered and narrowlyconceived planning defining the something in do something is the most important aspect of pso planning th task demands close attention to detail and early engagement of as many member s of the actor complex in the planning process as possible within the strictures of operational security the mechanism used to achieve complementary action by the acto r complex across the key constituents of nation may be thought of as lines of activity21 20 two terms are in common use lead nation and framework nation each is based upon an acceptance that in mounting comprehensive response efficiency is best achieved through core agency or nation adopting ading role in nato and the eu the framework nation will provide the commander and the main body of the hq staff procedures and processes will conf orm to alliance standards but refl ect the modus operandi of the framework nation framework nation leads an alliancebased response by contrast the lead nation assumes full responsibility for the planning and execution of the entire operation with other nations or agencies force elements embedded into standing lead nation structures 21 military commanders will be familiar with the concept of lines of operation within an operational campaign plan the strategic lines of activity within comprehensive pso plan are analogous 212 2nd edition jwp 350 229 guidance as minimum the initial stra tegic guidance from the strategic level should provide steadystate andor interi m criteria to be achieved b clearly defined mandate or the route towards obtaining mandate c limitations on the nature of action and means that may be employed by the pso this direction sh ould encompass all the inst ruments of power able to contribute effects across the key constitu ents of nation that will assist in satisfying the criteria section vi authority for peace support operation campaign auth ority and compression of levels authority for peace support operation 230 the fundamental consideration that mu st be addressed at the outset and throughout pso by those contributing to the operation is the authority for the operation to be undertaken ie its internati onal legitimacy in absolute terms the authority for pso is usually derived from the politically brokered mandate differing authorities can approve pso mandate as discussed in chapter 1 the most widely respected authority for pso to begin is that confe rred by mandate22 however regional mandates ca n provide for more timely preventative or responsive action than might be possible through the un23 however such mandates are vulnerable to perceptions of bias and may pr ove sensitive to variations in international will similarly the legitimacy of unilate ral or small coalition action is frequently challenged and can ac t to compound the underlying cause s of conflict when the pso is thought to reflect disregard for inte rnational law the customary diplomatic process or to be symptomatic of colonialist or hegemonic pretensions small coalitions do nevertheless offer an attractive compromi between responsiveness and political legitimacy in addition the mandate that is established at the strategic level is critical in shaping pso and th supporting psf in particular it will determine the freedom of action allowed at the opera tional level in pursuit of campaign objectives 22 although at times attractive due to the machinery of the system retrospective authorisation has invariably attracted international opprobrium and accusations of acting above international law 23 the attainment of consensus across the diverse membership has catastrophically delayed responses in the past and despite extensive reform initiatives it seems unrealistic to exp ect that the diplomatic process will be abridged in the near future 213 2nd edition jwp 350 campaign authority 231 campaign authority is the term used to describe the amalgam of four related and interdependent factors the perceived legitimacy by the various actors within the complex of the international mandate that establishes pso b the perceived legitimacy of the freed oms and constraints explicit or implicit in the mandate placed on those executing the pso c the degree to which factions th local population and other actors subjugate themselves to the author ity of those executing the pso from unwilling compliance to freely given consent d the degree to which the activities of those executing the pso meet the expectations of the factions local population and others 232 while the mandate should confer gal authority on pso successful outcome requires compliance with and cons ent to be bound by agreements brokered as part of the pso how the pso is conducted specific activities undertaken and expectations managed not least by ny psf will vary the level of campaign authority this will be reflected in the extent to which factions the local population and others cooperate with or hinder th activities of the ps because of the interdependence between the four factors indi vidual assessments are difficult hence campaign authority is conceptual tool that can be used at the strategic operational and tactical levels it defines the capacity of pso to act in the collective interest of all parties and thereby achieve sustainabl peace the level of campaign authority that pso can achieve will be grounded in the authorising agency mandate but the means used and tempo will also be reflecte d in the levels of consent and compliance that can be achieved and maintained idea lly all parties will consider both the pso and its activities as legitimate they will freel consent to work with the pso and their expectations will be satisfied compression of the levels 233 in psos action taken at the lowest tac tical level may need to be especially responsive to strategic decisionmaking with the tactical outcomes having immediate strategic significance for example the comme nts or actions of corporal may prompt ministerial statements as result of medi reporting this may lead to political and military leaders at the strategic level wishing directly to influence the lowest tactical actions missing out the intermediate opera tional and higher tactical levels of command this compression is exacerbate d in the multinational environment that dominates pso the effects of reach back in to several national capitals may be seen as fragmenting the will of the internatio nal community to achieve the outcome it 214 2nd edition jwp 350 desires to see in turn this may undermine the campaign authority by placing restrictions on the execution of the pso figure 26 contrasts the theoretical modelling used in earlier conflict analysis with the contemporary reality of pso strategic tactical strategic operational tactical operational figure 26 contrasting traditional lev els and the compressed reality of pso planning 234 in addition the strategic level has rged across the complex of actors strategy is generally expre ssed in government policy statem ents that set down policy goals nationally these policy goals enca psulate the national strategic direction on defence which in turn will influence the manner in which the na tional forces deployed as part of psf may be employed section vii peace support operations activity types 235 the pso concept encompasses activities befo re during and after conflict it thus embraces types of activity to prevent conflict intervene in conflict regenerate and sustain following conflict figure 27 mode ls this pso concept the activity types are not sequential phases indeed the ideal situation would embrace concurrency these types of activity can be defined as follows prevent an activity within pso that demands action to monitor and identify the causes of conflict and tim ely action to prevent the occurrence escalation or resumption of hostilities consequently it can be characterised as anticipatory preceding conflict or sustained in the post conflict phase when it seeks to protect and consolidat the reform and velopment process 215 2nd edition jwp 350 b intervene an activity within pso that demands action to bring about andor uphold cea sefireagreement or im pose mandated settlement c regenerate

activity based analysis of pso 236 this conceptual model provides tool for considering the nature of activities that may be undertaken simultaneously dur ing pso its use during planning is covered in detail in chapter 4 section viii the peace support force 237 it is usual for pso to include uni fied multinational military force under single military commander the psf th removal of pso compartmentalisation within the spectrum of tensio n means that the full range of combat techniques should be available to assist in diverse range of tasks moreover the military instrument of strategy is now applicable preconflict during conflict and in the postconflict period as part of complementary complex of act ors in pursuit of charter purposes and principles the psf should be an integr part of the pso and the psf commander usually has his own complementary campaign pl an despite the removal of distinctive compartments there is still temptation to divide both the psf campaign plan and the pso into time or eventbased phases 238 earlier pso doctrine suggested distinct boundaries between phases of pso and tended to create the impression that forces could be deployed under mandate for particular period prepared and equipped to deal solely with the demands of 216 2nd edition jwp 350 particular task such as peacekeeping in practice this led to grave errors most notably in srebrenica wher peacekeeping forces were unable to respond to the escalation of violence and tension more alarmingly some nations and security coalitions have assumed with scant appreciation of the ri sk that force of limited capability trained and authorised to conduc t only specific operations can have full utility in the inherently volatile context of pso experience has shown that pso campaigns do not progress in linear manne r campaign authority which defines psfs capacity to act as well as the nature of the force required to uphold the mandate varies fluidly with time and location24 the concept and use of psf stances is intended to acknowledge and accommodate this reality peace support force stances 239 there are 3 distinct psf stances enforc ement stabilisation and transition each is characterised by principles th at condition and guide the use and the capabilities of the military force in relation to the desired outcome or effect it should be noted that boundaries be tween stances are soft and hence realistic as they reflect gradual shift in emphasis rather than th hard step changes driven by time or discrete event as suggested by earlier models whereas phases are considered in terms of events or time stances should be consid ered in terms of the required effect or dominant condition 240 the definitions that follow describe m ilitary force stances according to the context in which the psf must operate however it is imperative that force capabilities and rules of engagement25 are sufficiently robust and flexible to match the unpredictable fluctuation of campaign authority enforcement military forces are pa rt of the complementary instruments of national power used to s ecure andor implement ceasefire or settlement when necessary they will employ the coercive and deterrent effects of military force to implemen t and uphold an intern ationally derived mandate the level of campaign author ity will be uncertain and high risk of conflict escalation could well exist in large proportion of the population possibly across wide geographic area an enforcement stance therefore demands the possession and when necessary the use of credible coercive or deterrent force 24 this fact has been graphically described by general charles c krulac 31st commandant usmc who coined the expression the three block war in his illustration general krulac highlighted the fact that psf unit could find itself obliged to employ range of milita ry stances on the same day within th space of 3 city blocks on the same operation 25 rules of engagement directives issued by competent military authority which specify the circumstances and limitations under which forces will initiate andor continue combat engagement with other forces encountered jwp 0011 217 2nd edition jwp 350 b stabilisation following an agreement or ceasefire and the emergence of generally permissive environm ent the psf acts as part of complementary instrument of national power to reduce the level of tension and increase the level of campaign authority the level of campaign authority will normally warrant the use of military force in selfdefence alone however it may be necessary to use th coercive and deterrent effects of military force to uphold the internationally derived mandate attention will focus upon the monitoring and identifi cation of the underlying causes of conflict with timely action being taken to prevent the escalation of tension or the resumption of hostilities stab ilisation stance therefore demands the possession demonstration and when ne cessary the employment of sufficient credible coercive or deterrent force as well as campaign authority building measures c transition the psf acts as one of the instruments of national power to address the underlying causes of conf lict through longterm commitment to indigenous military reform reintegra tion training and reconstruction the international military forces help to achieve the final steadystate conditions that were specified as the pso campa ign objectives the level of campaign authority will generally be high with the use of military force rarely warranted the psf will continue to mon itor the underlying causes of conflict and initiate timely action to consolidate and provide incentiv for coherent progress towards the campaign objectives priority will be given to the planning and execution of the handover of security responsibilities to suitably trained equipped and effective indi genous forces once this handover is complete the conditions will be set for significant reductions in psf force levels with the balance of effort switc hing to continue training and advisory roles as part of sustained conflict prevention activity transition stance therefore demands the possession of credible coercive and deterrent force the psf will be used in concert with or as advisors to the indigenous forces once they have achieved prescribed operati onal capability this will maintain or enhance the campaign authority and provide credible deterrent to resumption of hostilities force stance agility 241 planning realities experience has repeatedly shown that full definition of interim or steadystate criteria will rarely be completed before the decision to engage has been taken as resu lt military and civil actors will find themselves obliged to formulate plans and assessments based upon informed assumptions of the strategic intent at the outset the military role in the campaign may have primacy as efforts are made to establish safe and secure environment into which other agencies can 218 2nd edition jwp 350 employ their individual strengths to effect primacy andor main effort26 will shift and military forces must be sufficiently ag ile to match their response in terms of behaviour and stance to the prevailing circumstances 242 geographic realities it is unlikely that campaign authority will be consistent across the geographical area of pso campai gn authority will vary with the location of factions and groups within the local population he nce the stance may change across the joint operations area nd it may ebb and flow in particular location campaign authority should be ssessed and constantly mapped to ensure that the appropriate stance and hence capabilities can be maintained in specific localities and for the whole psf multinational

peace support operations psos in the spectrum of tension and the constantly changing demands of pso engagements has generate d new doctrinal concepts consequently 4 types of pso activity prevention intervention regeneration sustainment and 3 peace support force psf stances enforcement st abilisation and transition have been introduced in concert with this conceptual shift the guiding principles for pso show marked change from earlie r models the rationale fo r the change comes from 2 areas first an appreciation of what th international community seeks to achieve when mounting pso secondly the practical implications of the way in which state practice have come to shape the tasks faced by psf operational commanders and their civil counterparts the following observati on made by an experienced multinational psf commander reflects the impact of this reality pso coordinates the application of state power to direct or facilitate the movement of the social economic and political affairs of others in the direction that the intervening states think they should go the political objectives of the intervening states may be ill defined transient limited variable and unpredictable politicians may exercise tight control clear finite mission statement and final po litical end state is unlikely psos evolve success or failure opens or closes doors of opportunity the environment is

pursuit of campaign objectives the existence of ma ndate and the absence of any form of consent on behalf of the local popula tion does not remove the obligations of commanders and service personnel to act re sponsibly within all the aspects of international law such as the law of armed conflict5 indeed the signatories to the treaty that created the international criminal court icc6 underlined their commitment to ensuring that both military and civilian pers onnel are held responsible for their actions moreover all civil and m ilitary leaders must rema in acutely aware of the potential for censure7 and alert to prevailing levels8 of the campaign authority for given pso assessment of campaign author ity and action to reinforce it needs to take place constantly amongst the populati on at which the pso is aimed and on global regional and national ba sis in addition it may be appropriate to focus upon the level of campaign authority within give n ethnic cultural or religious grouping in all cases the level of campaign authority will be subject to the influence of events 3 jdp 01 joint operations and jwp 001 british defence doctrine 4 discussed in chapter 2 5 joint service publication 383 joint service manual on the law of armed conflict provides guidance for the united kingdom armed forces 6 this court may review the actions of political and military leaders when breaches of inte rnational norms are held to have occurred however the icc takes jurisdiction only wh the nation of the accused declines to investigate the charge note the us is not cu rrently signatory to the icc 7 in addition to the censure associated with legal process commanders and h ead of mission in pso must accept and constructively operate under the constant scrutiny of media commentators who will represent range of political ethical and religious stances 8 these perspectives must be rigorously and constantly asse ssed by operational analysis oa and the results should inform adjustment of the campaign plans and the means of execution 32 2nd edition jwp 350 and their presentation by the media in ma ny situations perceptions held will not be as result of first hand knowledge or experience but rather the compound effects of views opinion and sentiment in part proj ected by the media consequently unless perceptions are changed they will be seen as reality as result the level of campaign authority must be regarded as highly sens itive factor variable with time location and vertically within the hierarchies of th complex of actors authorising agencies and nations engaged in pso 305 the psf must demonstrate its resolve on deployment to the joint operations area joa any subsequent adjustment s to the psf stances should be driven by assessments of campaign authority which may include operational analysis oa throughout the campaign successive psf commanders are responsible for the application of the rule s of engagement roe9 and international law even in the face of attempts by parties hostile to the pso either to gain an advantage or to undermine the psf mission 306 all actors in the pso complex must be encouraged to understand and fulfil their role in enhancing the level of campaign authority this is achieved by maintaining the highest possible standards of professionalism comp assion and regard for the higher aims of the campaign both on and off duty through status of forces agreements sofa or other special agreements the psf may enjoy certain immunities related to its duties notwith standing this its members must routinely respect the laws and customs of the host nati on and must be seen to have respectful regard for local religious and secular beliefs this latter point is particularly important where local religious or cultural beliefs ma consider behaviour routinely acceptable to members of the international community as socially or culturally unacceptable such perception would u ndermine campaign authority10 it is important that psf commanders act to ensure that common st andards of behaviou r are recognised and implemented across the nati ons contributing to psf 307 when considering national sentiment subdivision can realistically and usefully be made between th ruling elite the body of the potential electorate and importantly those civil and military personnel committed to supporting operations in attempting to maintain mora enhance campaign authority and supp ort national will the psf operational commander11 must focus on perceptions in the joa whilst maintaining an awareness of international opinion variations of perception in one 9 jwp 0011 10 in extreme circumstances the cultural differences may be such that psf rest and recuperation facilities and arrangements may need to be arranged outside the joint opera tions area judgement will be needed to ensure that these arrangements do not isolate the psf from the people and the benefits of close encounters it is also importa nt to consider the impact of international community expenditure in the cal economy and emergent business sectors an excessive reliance upon this expenditure or pandering to what should be transient demand ma induce an unhelpful dependence and thus act against campaign objectives 11 the shaping and nurture of international cohesion and resolv is an issue for the strategic level command of the troop contributing governments and the au thorising agency or agencies 33 2nd edition jwp 350 grouping may rapidly affect other parts of the national or intern ational population accordingly operational commande rs must exploit information operations as part of their combat power in the pso campaign12 second fundamental credible and reasonable force 308 to implement and uphold the terms of th internationally agreed mandate psf must moderate the use of available for ce to achieve the desired effect without detriment to the campaign authority for ce must be credible and used in manner that is reasonable to achieve the mandate d outcomes or desired effect the action should be proportional and discriminatory ch that it is confined in effect to the intended target moderation of the force used will be achi eved through the terms of the mandate observance of internationa l domestic and host nation law where it exists and through commanders and nati onally imposed rules of engagement controlled and with clear focus upon all aspects of the effects achieved military force should act to enhance the campaign au thority and hence promote and enable the realisation of the longterm strate gic goals set down in the mandate third fundamental perseverance 309 experience has demonstrated that pso engagements are likely to be longterm and they should seek to address the underlying causes of conflict and instability perseverance demands that the complex of actors identify campaign objectives and pursue them with complementary resolute and tenacious attitude until the interim or steadystate criteria have been reached 310 the underlying causes of the conflict are unlikely to be addressed if the full range of skills in the actor complex is not exploited because action is shortterm force levels are inadequate rules of engagement are overly rest rictive interim or steady state criteria are superficially defined or campaign plans are poorly conceived for example pso that has mand ate which is valid for only 6 months is likely to create the impression of stability for the period b ecause those interested in perpetuating crisis will suspend their acti ons and wait until the mandate expires planning with an honest and realistic appreciation of the factor s inherent in perseverance should ensure that the actor complex particularly the international community understands what needs to be done and most importantly for how long 12 see chapter 5 section v 34 2nd edition jwp 350 section iii guiding principles of peace support operation first principle comprehensive and comp lementary campaigning 311 to produce the decisive effect in pso analysis planning and execution of campaign must involve comprehensive and co mplementary action to achieve this there are 4 facets to be considered comprehensive campaigning b complementary campaigning c military implications d specific focus comprehensive campaigning 312 the aim of comprehensive campaigning is to exploit the tenable synergistic effects through the coordinated activation of each instrument of national power having analysed pso on this basis set of interim or steadystate criteria 13 linked to the instruments of national power should define the strategic objectives for the psf operational military planning cannot take place in vacuum and must retain sharp focus on the extent to which military ac tivity will contribute to the fulfilment of the criteria in pso all the means to ach ieve the prescribed in terim or steadystate criteria are not under single authority th need for comprehensive campaigning to exploit each actors strengths by collaboration or coordination is th erefore increased however the complexity of the task faced in formulating comprehensive plans should not be reflected in the nature of the directions issued to subordinate levels with effort these plans can be incorporated into direction that exploits the principle of mission command14 so that those being tasked can succeed15 complementary campaigning 313 it is more difficult to apply the key principle of bdd selection and maintenance of the aim16 across the spectrum of tension and complex of actors in pso achieving and maintaining the princi ple of complementary campaigning should be adopted considerable effort may be re quired to agree the purposes of the pso and 13 see chapter 2 section iii 14 see annex c for summary of mission command fuller explanation is available in bdd 15 not all agencies and assigned units will have adopted or be able to operate competently guided by the principle of mission command operational commanders must actively differentiate between those force elements or assets imbued with the necessary ethos and those for whom different approach may be more helpful 16 see annex c for summary fuller explanation is available in bdd 35 2nd edition jwp 350 to set down these shared goa ls as steadystate criteria against which planning can take place arguably unless debate occurs an d there is shared intent to address the underlying causes of the conflict any use of military force ca nnot be considered to be pso17 the debate will be led by diplomac and involve experts in the other instruments of national power diplomatic ac tors at the strategic level should strive to produce direction on what needs to be done it is imperative that the something in do something is defined and more impor tantly that it is fully understood by all parties to the conflict and the complex of actors that ma contribute to achieving the desired outcome when direction18 has been issued efforts can begin to identify the actors who could achieve the pso objective 314 focused analysis of the desired outcome by all actors will ensure that nugatory or counterproductive action is avoided during the initial stages of the pso the definition of steadystate criteria will identif groupings of actors w ho have an interest in complementary planning and negotiati on these groupings may not match traditional military command chains as re sult bespoke arrangements that cover the constitution communication and admini stration of these functionallybased groupings19 may need to be agreed and widely publicised military commanders and their subordinates may find themselves coopted in these structures and it is vital that suitable military personnel are lected to work in such diverse environment in particular personnel used to operating in military environment must appreciate20 the value placed upon informal as well as form relationships when working in pso complex 315 once appointed the uns special re presentative sr of the secretary general srsg european union special representative eusr or head of mission hom should have prime responsibility for achieving unity of effort across the pso complex this responsibility sh ould whenever possible be matched by granting the srhom delegate d and meaningful authority over assigned civil and military resources where command relati onship is not formally established the success of pso is likely to depend on close working relationship between the 17 see chapter 2 section ii 18 although seeking such clarity may bring accusations of idea lism the evidence of the past suggests that errors in the mounting of campaign can have catastrop hic effects repeatedly poor obj ective definition has led to creeping development of the mission and hence the range of assets and materiel required cohesion and diplomacy are undermined and often the outcome has proved to be an openended and costly compromise conflict has not been resolved and an untidy commitment continues to drain limited international will and materiel resources it is also increasingly the case that an informed and global media or international bodies such as the icc may call leaders to account for their actions or omissions those empowered to di rect action must therefore resi st the habit of constructive ambiguity without clear direction subordinate levels of command can only guess what may be requir ed basis for shared goals can be found and the principle of comprehensive campaigning is forsaken 19 functional groupings will naturally form around lines of activity eg law and order 20 training to achieve the requisite capability already exists at th tactical level especially in preparing those destined to operate in designated civil military cooperation cimic appoin tments however staff at all levels should be aware of the underlying tenets of cimic and the operating norms of othe r agencies if they are to function efficiently at parallel levels in the pso complex see ijwp 390 cimic 36 2nd edition jwp 350 srhom psf commander and othe r leaders of the international community mission success will demand considered timely nd close liaison by the srhom with the authorising agency leaders of troop contributing nations tcns national government departments intergovern mental organisations igos and non governmental organisations ngos21 at times the diverse demands of the many organisations can work to the detriment of the pso and its effective leadership in what will almost invariably be adhoc structures leaders and commanders at all levels must actively seek to manage this risk by minimising friction and maintaining clear focus on the higherlevel purpose of the ps where psf precedes the appointment of an sr or hom the military commander ma find that he has to initiate and fulfil the coordinating role 316 product of complementary campaigning ideally orchestrated by the srhom should be series of individual campaign plans with comprehensive pso plan being summary of the individual campaign plans for each line of activity for example the line of activity to create safe and secure environment is usually the responsibility of the psf however the p sf may be assisted by the group of actors involved in establishing the rule of law moreover the psf may be assisting in the distribution of humanitarian aid by providing protected convoys the psf campaign plan will itself contain lines of operation to achieve the safe and secure environment but one or more of the lines could be associated with convoy protection the campaign plan associated with the rule of law may incorporate assistancelines of operation to the psf complementary ca mpaigning requires coordination during execution the ebb and flow of the differ ent campaign plans may require the holder of the comprehensive pso plan to indicate th current priorities if the steadystate criteria are to be achieved military implications 317 in pso specific military objectives will constitute milestones or decisive points along the way to achieving the politi cally defined interim or steadystate criteria attainment of the interim or st eadystate criteria does not necessarily imply that military endstat has been reached and vice versa in pso military engagement is usually required until the indi genous structures prove able to uphold the interim or steadystate criteria for security nd rule of law without external assistance unchecked or protracted development of comprehensive and complementary campaign plans can degrade the military for ces ability to achieve operational tempo lead to military frustration mission failu re and the potential unnecessary loss of innocent lives balance mu st be achieved and it may pr ove useful for initial military planning to proceed based on an agreed military endstate or interim endstates rather 21 as the adversary or belligerent organisational structure be comes more complex commensurate improvement in the sophistication and scope of the response will be needed this reality is accommodated in the princi ple of specific focus 37 2nd edition jwp 350 than waiting for the interim or steady state criteria to be fully defined22 nevertheless the pursuit of shortterm military success should be sensitive to the aim of achieving social economic and political transformation specific focus 318 an important factor in achieving ting resolution and hence the prevention of further conflict is the evolution of comprehensive pso plan that remains pertinent to the problem at hand the imperative at the outset is to analyse dispassionately the conflict fr om global regional and cal perspective efforts expended to gain an accurate understanding of the crisis and its root causes will be vital having evaluated the crisis plans to resolve the crisis can be developed at 2 levels strategic exploring the global intent and impact and recognising the regional balance of power dynamic and operational focusing specifically on the problems presented within the target geographic ar ea planning is covered in chapter 4 319 stress friction and chaos will invariab ly challenge the bestmade plans clarity of purpose and sound objectives set down and widely understood from the outset will greatly assist in overcoming th effects furthe rmore complementary and comprehensive operations that are pe rceived as successful will have compound effects the cohesion and morale of actors in the pso complex w ill be strengthened the level of campaign authority will also be enhanced winning over the silent majority in contrast those parties oppos ing the comprehensive pso plan will find their morale capability and will to resist much diminished second principle preventative action 320 in addition to the increase in intrastat conflict the globalisation process has irreversibly extended the scope nature and reach of those that reject international norms of behaviour in res ponse many nations now recognise responsibility to protect their citizens from the coercive or lethal inte nt of destabilising factions keen to exploit global reach and the lethality or impact of terrorism and asymmetric warfare for the occasions where conflict is the likely resu lt of failing or faile d governance conflict prevention remains an enduring feature of an effective pso discharge of nations responsibility to protect occasionally and exceptionally may demand precautionary action to alter the will of destabilising f actions and deny them capabilities that give them global reach preventa tive action can be taken both as part of pso or in response to an emerging threat that ma also require the restoration of good governance to some or all of the key constituents of nation or society 22 it should be understood that the comprehensive pso plan which seeks to encompass action by the pso complex would be conducted ideally against the steadystate criteria adoption of interim criteria or militarily defined endstate or interim endstate is an expedient th at recognises the imperative for timely action and operational tempo the need to act with the clear vision of the likely interim or steadystate criteria cannot be over emphasised 38 2nd edition jwp 350 321 the threat and the need to act in accordan ce with international practice will define the nature and tim ing of preventative action23 preventative action using instruments of national power will normally be proportiona discriminatory and confined in effect adherence to the funda mentals and principles of pso will ensure the desired effects are achieved without triment to any existing campaign authority or the authority of campaign in itiated by the preventative action 322 in addition to the direct effects associ ated with preventative action wider range of deterrent and coercive effects also become tenable fac tions may be deterred when they are forewarned of the inte ntion to destroy the moral and physical components of their power in addition those who would actively or passively harbour or sponsor these groups are pers uaded or coerced into observance of international practice by the judicious application of the preventative acts third principle sensitised action 323 pso requires all personnel to develop detailed understanding and respect for the law religion customs and culture of the range of actors engaged in the pso complex particularly with respect to th indigenous population ideally intelligence activity will inform the training process nd constant effort will be needed during pso to ensure that responses and actions remain culturally appropriate and are perceived by the recipients as intended through the sensitive action of individuals or groups within the actor complex mutual trust and respect can be developed the need for sensitivity is not confined to cu rrent pso there are s econd order effects where the actors have reputation from prev ious pso for being sensitive it is likely that their presence will enhance campaign au thority similarly across the divide between the psf and the belligerent par ties understanding and rapport can be developed over time campaign authority is improved markedly by investing research planning and training to accord with this principle culturally astute and responsive pso will increase th prospects of success fourth principle security 324 the creation of safe and secure enviro nment is invariably primary objective of pso and one that is usually undertaken by the psf selfdefence is an inherent right and force protection24 is command responsibility in any military operation in addition the psf may also be given speci fic responsibilities for the protection of 23 overt covert or combination of both these actions w ill frequently demand the collection collation and presentation of information of evidential quality using forensic techniques and equipment beyond the requirements of combat united kingdom forces have extensive experience in this area th rough protracted engagement in northern ireland and the balkans the demands of international legal process pose new challenges that must be met by additional training equipment and operational level planning consideration 24 force protection process which aims to conserve the fighting potential of deployed force by countering the wi der threat to its elements from adversaries natural and human hazards and fratricide jwp 0011 39 2nd edition jwp 350 civilian components of the pso this w ill have to be taken into account when planning the size and composition of the force and rules of engagement 325 frequently aid agencies may employ loca l civilians or expatriates as guards and escorts the employers should consid er security screening and monitoring to ensure that those employed do not jeopardis the employers actions andor undermine the campaign authority precise responsib ilities and operating pro cedures for private security arrangements will require coordin ation with the activities of the psf the psf commander must regularly re view this interaction 326 all military personnel involve d in pso must recognise that balance must be struck between hard force protection measures and those soft measures25 that can significantly contribute to overall force prot ection civil actors operating within joa should be accurately briefed on threats in particular mines and minefields and should be encouraged to make their personnel aware of th risks and dangers they may face most responsible civil sector actors will be keen to participate in threat briefings in comprehensive pso all participants shoul d make every effort to ensure that the process involves the mutually beneficial exchange of information and views26 fifth principle transparency 327 pso campaign aims as defined by the pol itically ascribed steadystate or interim criteria must be easily understood and obvious to all partie s the parties to the conflict and the indigenous populace mu st be made fully aware of what the mandate demands of them and what the cons equences would be for failing to comply likewise they should also be made aware of th clear advantages to be gained by compliance failure to ach ieve common understanding may lead to suspicion mistrust or even hostility information should be communicated through sources appropriate to the joa where adequate or efficient information system exists high priority should be given to the construc tion or provision of an appropriate public information network that is both effective and trusted 328 while transparency of intent should be th general rule this must be balanced against the need to ensure operational s ecurity force protection or mission success 25 these measures would include quick impact social proj ects and cimic activity that serves to enhance campaign authority and support from the majority of the people in the joa through improved contact with the people information flow understanding trust and the intelligence pictur can all be improved resort to fortress mentality has rarely proved effective as means of force protection 26 dialogue trust and understanding between military and civil actors is delicate area that requires pers onnel trained in and familiar with the respective agencys agenda those briefing civilian agencies should have undergone additional training and should not simply be intelligence specialists livering standard military threat assessment officers briefing civil sector representatives must ensure that their in formation is of the highest quality and currency as the lives of igo and ngo workers may well depend upon the data offere d in addition the longterm credibility of the psf and the cimic staff in particular will depend upon the quality of these briefings the perceived value to all concerned and the rapport achieved when available psf commander should attend briefings present personal assessment and garner the views of civil actors many of whom may have regular access to regions and population groups denied to the psf 310 2nd edition jwp 350 will occasionally render transparency who lly inappropriate ca reful and high level consideration needs to be given to the exercise of transparency 311 2nd edition jwp 350 intentionally blank 312 2nd edition jwp 350 chapter 4 peace support operations campaigning crisisdriven response to conflict that measures success in terms of arresting disease and starvation and achieving ceasefire must be embedded within the painstaking ta sks of relationship and confidence building and of the design of nd preparation for social change 1 section i introduction 401 to achieve comprehensive nd complementary campaigning2 in peace support operation pso it is necessary that all those invol ved have general appreciation of campaigning this chapter serves as précis of military campaigning and guidance3 with an emphasis on those aspects pertinent to pso campaigning 402 campaigning at the operational level consis ts of three notions operational art operational design and operational management in the united kingdom operational art is defined as the orchestration of all military activities invol ved in converting strategic objectives into tactical actions with view to seeking decisive result4 for psos this may be interpreted as the orchestration of all peace support activities involved in converting strategic intent into practi cal actions with view to satisfying steadystate criteria thus opera tional art uses creative and innovative thought to find possible solutions to pr oblems these solutions may be viewed as operational ideas b operational design is the process that further develops and refines operational ideas into campaign plan the campaign plan which articulates the overall scheme for operations results from the operational estimate and is largely constructed using number of theoretical building blocks collectively known as the campaign planning concepts cpcs c operational management is the integration coordination and synchronisation of deployed multinationa l and joint operations using control 1

and are therefore readily pplicable to the peace suppor t force psf however the principles and processes they embody can be applied to the development of complementary plans by other agencies contributing to the pso peace support operation campaigning 404 psf and its commander may be the first formal representation of pso in region in crisis invariably nongovernment organisations ngos are already in the region indeed it may be through their effort s that the crisis has been highlighted and the decision to mount pso taken until such time as civilian representative such as special representative sr of the united nations secretary general6 srsg or european union eusr or head of mission hom is appointed and given primacy the psf military comma nder may have to lead the pso as

section ii peace support operation planning types of peace support operation plan 405 complementary campaigning identifies th need for range of plans to be drawn together to support and implem ent comprehensive strategy the comprehensive pso plan to avoid confusi on reference will be made to 2 types of plan only the comprehensive peace support operations plan master plan of how the international community plans to employ the instruments of national power to achieve the interim or steadystate criteria in pso and how the indigenous population and othe r organisations that are willing to complement diplomatic economic and military camp aign plans intend to make their contribution to the same effe ct typically the plan will address the need to regenerate reform or sustain key constituents of the nation or society in crisis as well as addressing the i mmediate symptoms of the crisis the activities of the complex of actors with common theme may be drawn together into lines of activity each line of activity may have interim criteria to be reached enroute to the overall steadystate criteria b the peace support force campaign plan the plan of how the military instrument of national power the psf will be employed in achieving the interim or steadystate criteria in pso typically the campaign plan will have lines of operation where capab ilities are used together to realise decisive points enroute to the achievement of litary endstate the psf campaign plan should be complementar to the comprehensive pso plan the psf campaign plan may include milita ry contributions to most of the lines of activity within th comprehensive pso plan the planning cascade 406 planning pso usually begins with politicallyled agreement within the international community to do something national governments consider their contributions to an international or nati onal response and their crisis management organisations plan their national strategy7 in turn government departments refine their plans on how they intend to meet thei r national strategic objectives ngos may choose to act independently8 and plan their response according to their unique purpose however synergistic approach is recommended because the overall effect is likely to be greater than the sum of the parts leaders and commanders are appointed to create campaign plans determin ing how their department or organisation 7 within the european union eu an euwide response may be developed this is known as the eu crisis managment concept 8 understanding the likely behaviour of other organisations is outlined in annex b jwp 350 should organise and utilise their resources to achieve their obj ectives once these plans have been generated those working in the crisis area develop tactical plans to determine how to achieve the assigned elemen ts of the plan pl ans are modified and refined as the overall intent and individual missions become better defined the constraints and difficulties become mo re obvious and requests for additional information and resources are either satisfied or rejected the united kingdom crisis management sequence 407 the united kingdom also maintains diplomatic mission at the united nations headquarters in new york the united kingdom is also fully represented within the organisation for secu rity and cooperation in europe osce the european union and nato the represen tatives roles in each body are to inform the united kingdom of potential operations to take part in the formal and informal contingency planning discussions and ne

takes place within the cabinet office and the defence crisis management organisation dcmo other government ministries involved will include the fco the department for internationa l development dfid

determines his military pl an and the military objectives to be achieved by his subordinate commanders at th tactical level ideally the complete planning process should include representativ from the civil sector and other major agencies that could become involved in the operation types of planning 408 in the united kingdom military strate gic planning is initiated following recognition of situation that may warrant response by the armed forces there are two main types 9 where the operation is united kingdom led pso the jtfc will be the psf commander 44 2nd edition jwp 350 advance planning10 b crisis response planning11 409 during peacetime the government includi ng the mod monitors world events and in certain circumstances directs that contingency plans be developed in case the united kingdom has to exercise military optio n if however the situation is such that the united kingdom will be militarily i nvolved and the lead times are short then the mod will adopt its crisis planning pro cess this process may utilise existing contingency plans or create new plans these types of planning equally apply to psos section iii application of operational art in peace support operations operational art12 410 operational art is heavily dependent on an understanding of the complete problem an understanding that has 3 main face ts the first is comprehensive insight into the local population in particular the adversaries or factions their values aims and intentions and their responses second is the ability to visualise 2 aspects the practical activities that may make up compre hensive response to crisis which in turn hinges on an understanding of availabl capabilities and the ef fect of practical actions on both the adversaries and the alliance or coalition of which the psf will normally be part last but reliant on the fi rst 2 is an understanding of risk its effect and how it is to be nimised and managed 411 when devising comprehensive pso plan the srhom or psf commander will identify the final conditions steadystate criteria that will achieve the strategic mandated objectives this may be selfevident in theory but is not always easy to achieve in practic and the use of interim criteria may be necessary b order activities both sequentially and simultaneously that lead to the fulfilment of the final conditions it is unlikely that the strategic objectives can be achieved by single action 10 advance planning is conducted principally in peacet ime to develop plans for contingencies identified by strategic planning assumptions advance planning prepares for possible contingency based upon the best ava ilable information and can form the basis for crisis response planning jwp 500 joint operations planning 11 crisis response planning is based on current events and conduct ed in time sensitive situations jwp 500 essentially unforeseen events for whic h specific advance plan exists 12 the application of operational art is cove red comprehensively in jdp 01 and jwp 500 45 2nd edition jwp 350 c apply the available resources including those allocated such as the psf and those organisations willing to work alongside for mutual benefit such as international government organisations igos and ngos within the constraints imposed and inherent to the type of resource to sustain the sequence of actions if commander believes that insufficient resources have been allocated to him he may atte mpt to seek more from the mandating authority and contributing nations d identify the risks involved their effect and ho w they are minimised and managed to achieve success the comma nder must be prepared to take acceptable risks in doing so he must ensure that those with responsibility for and involved in decisionmaking at all levels are aware of those risks he should plan contingency action in case the selected action should fail operational ideas 412 operational ideas are in effect the output of operational art they represent the basis of campaign plan and are furt her refined by the process of operational design in generating opera tional ideas for their appropri ate plans the srhom and psf commander should seek to express their id eas in terms of the four key functions derived from the ma noeuvrist approach13 shape shaping the region in crisisba ttlespace in manner most likely to achieve the objectives this include s shaping perceptions on the validity of the mandate and its permissions creati ng consent and managing expectations thus determining campaign authority b attackbuild attacking the adversaries cohesion and will at places and times of the commanders choosing in order to undermine their centres of gravity cogs build regenerated nation or society c protect protecting the campaign author ity and progress to date and ensuring the will of the complex of actor s perseveres for the psf protect the fighting power and mu ltinational cohesion d exploit exploiting opportunities and the situation by direct or indirect means 413 in addition there are 3 closely inter linked concepts which are particularly useful in the formulation of operationa l ideas cog analysis campaign fulcrum and the decisive act the key to operational art is to identify beforehand what is going to be decisive to restore pe ace and to cause adversaries to be reconciled identifying the decisive act comes fro m an analysis of cogs 13 see annex c jdp 01 and jwp 500 46 2nd edition jwp 350 centre of gravity analysis 414 the cog is defined14 as the characteristics capabilities or localities from which nation an alliance military force or other grouping derives its freedom of action physical strength or will to fight in pso it is the cogs of the warring factions or parties in dispute and the potential cogs for the reformed nation or society that are most likely to be of interest the fi rst step is to identify the adversaries cogs denial or destruction of or threats to these cogs should deter or coerce the parties from conflic t however it must be cl ear why they are cogs and what each does to make it cog these are termed the critical capabilities the next step is to examine what is needed to achie ve each critical capab ility in other words the critical requirements these critical requirements are then examined to determine if they are in some way incomp lete or vulnerable these become the critical vulnerabilities the things that ca n be exploited in order to undermine the adversaries cog having completed this analysis it is then possible to develop objectives that will assist in undermining t hose cogs these obj ectives are selected by comparing the degree of criticality with vulnerability and the friendly capability to attack those vulnerabilities in due course and having attacked the vulnerabilities it is quite possible for cogs to change and ther efore the analysis must be constantly updated 415 using similar analysis it is possi ble to identify critical capabilities requirements and vulnerabilities for each of the key constituents of nation or society however in rebuilding nati on or society the vulnerabilities of each constituent need to be addressed rather th an attacked for those implementing the pso their cog may be the cohesion of the complex of actors and their determination to succeed their perseverance15 416 campaign fulcrum there is stage in ever operation or campaign where the tide turns and the initiative switches irrevers ibly this will be caused by number of issues acting in combination but the valu of attempting to identify this event is in order to be prepared to exploit fully its po tential in pso th fulcrum may be seen as the point at which campaign authority incr eases and becomes selfperpetuating it may also be seen in negativ sense it might be the re sult of for example failure to build any campaign authority or change in political context 417 the decisive act closely linked to the idea of campaign fulcrum is an associated concept that of the decisive act or the decisive operation activities are now viewed as stepping stones towards higher goal it is important to try to find something or series of linked events that

ceptualise and describe campaign in broad terms they serve 3 purposes to fo cus effort in the estimate16 to help describe in plans and directives what needs to be achieved and to assist in monitoring the execution of plan or operation they can be used indi vidually although they ar all closely related and are best used as part of set it is for the srhom andor psf commander to decide their utility

endstate17 describe the state of affairs that needs to be achieved at the end of the comprehensive pso plan and the psf campaign plan respectiv ely to terminate or to resolve the conflict it is necessary to ensure that both the plans reflect common understanding of what conditions constitute success ll activities and operations should be judged against their relevance to achieving th steadystate criteria or endstate 16 this process is described later in this chapter 17 jwp 0011 48 2nd edition jwp 350 421 interim criteria or decisive points the successful achievement of interim criteria and decisive points dps18 which are actions or events usually targeted on critical capabilities or vulnerabilities are preconditions to achieving the steadystate criteria or endstate identifying interi m criteria and dps during the estimate process is fundamental part of campaign planning th at leads to the development of objectives and tasks 422 lines of activity or operation lines of operation19 are the link between decisive points in time and space on the pa th to the endstate lines of activity establish relationship between interim crite ria in order to construct development path to the steadystate criteria and to ensu re that criteria are satisfied in logical progression lines of operation establish the interrelationship between decisive points in order to construct critical path to the ndstate through cog and to ensure that events are tackled in logical progression lines of activity or operation are usually functional or environmental fo r example activities to reinst ate rule of law or maritime activities 423 sequencing sequencing20 is the arrangement of activities within plans in the order to achieve the steadystate criteria or endstate although simultaneous action on all lines of activity or operation may be ideal lack of resources usually compels activities actions and the llocation of resources to be sequenced accordingly alternatively sequencing activ ities and actions may reduce th risks to an acceptable level once sequence s been determined it may be appropriate to divide campaign into phases21 this process can assist in developing the entire campaign logically and in terms of available capabilities resources and time however there is temptation to tie psf capabilities and force st ructures ie force stances to phases that are determined by time or discrete ev ents for psf campaign the predominant pso conditions rather than time or discrete events should determine psf stances22 424 contingency planning contingency planning is the process by which options are built into plan to take ac count of opportunities and setbacks the development of contingency lines of activ ity or operation will greatly enhance the flexibility of the campaign plans branches branches are options for pa rticular phase and provide the flexibility to retain the initiative 18 decisive point is point from which hostile or friendly centre of gravity can be threatened this point may exist in time space or the information environment aap6 19 line of operation in campaign or operation line linking decisive points in time and space on the path to the centre of gravity aap6 20 jwp 0011 21 phase is discrete and identifiable activity along military line of operation in time andor space that allows for the reorganisation

current phase may simply be the next preplanned phase however to ensure that the campaign can proceed ev in the face of setbacks prudent planners will prepare several sequels to the next phase once sequel is activated it will become the next phase in the campaign 425 culminating point an operation reaches its culminating point when the operation can just be maintained but not developed to any great advantage23 the value of attempting to identify culminating point is to be able to exploit fully the potential of this event when an adversarys is reached or plan pauses in order to avoid ones own intelligence operations and logistic staffs need to liaise closely to avoid delay the onset or minimise the ffects of culminating point 426 peace support operation or operational pause pso or operational pause23 is pause in one or more pso activity or psf operations respectively whilst retaining the initiative in other ways ac tivities and operations cannot always be conducted continuously concentration of resources or force and economy of effort may determine the need to concentrate activ ity on one line of activity or operation in time or space to achieve this pause ght be planned on another line of activity or operation implicit in the term pause is allocation of time and or resources within the overall campaign plan to regain and if ne cessary maintain the initiative on line of activity the estimate process 427 the estimate process is military problem solving mechanism for drawing together vast amount of information nece ssary for the thorough analysis of set of circumstances in order to allow the developm ent of feasible courses of action coas and the subsequent translation into plan the estimate process is central to the formulation of the campaign plan and the subsequent issue of operation orders and directives although there are variations in scale or focus there is nothing fundamentally different about the products of the process the estimates carried out at different levels by different components or in various functional areas the term operational estimate is used to desc ribe the process carried out by the psf commander and his staff at the operationa l level other estimates either environmental or functional at the operational or tactical level may contribute to the operational estimate in rn the operational estimate may contribute to the pso estimate should the srhom or psf commande r choose to use the process for the comprehensive pso plan the prevalence of fluctuations in political will which is central to the formulation of pso plans and changes in the operational environment mean that the estimate process should be re visited throughout pso to ensure that the ramifications are properly considered th estimate process comprises 6 stages 23 jwp 0011 410 2nd edition jwp 350 stage 1 review of situation geostrategic analysis b stage 2 identify and analyse the problem c stage 3 formulation of potential coas d stage 4

be international interests positions of international organisations io neutral to th conflict and other competing or distracting international situations 429 identify and analyse the problem experience would ggest that mandates developed by consensus are rarely as pr ecise as srhom or psf commander would wish it is for the srhom assisted by the psf commander nd his equivalents within the actor complex to determine preci sely what is to be accomplished and is essentially the deduction of what has to be done and why the mission analysis should consider what other instruments of policy particularly diplomatic and economic will be used to support the strategic objectives this should include the determination of any implied tasks or preconditions such as political imperatives which have pre eminence over all else the impact of on the execution of the mission will also have priority 430 formulation of potential courses of action through combination of intuition and process thorough analysis of the problem will produce various coas not all of the potential courses will be po ssible without close consideration before adoption it may be appropr iate at this stage for the srhom or psf commander to provide some initial guidance to the staff deve loping the estimate thus at this point the ends should be clear and some possible ways and means may be beginning to emerge the rest of the estimate must set about proving the art of the possible by the application of planning factors and by conf irmingmaximising the understanding of the problem 431 development and validation of courses of action the job of the various staffs is now to develop and validate potential coas by considering the impact of specific factors in more detail each course must be credible nd achievable each should be formulated with likely concept of operations and should outline the missions activities and tasks to be accomp lished the resources required and the 411 2nd edition jwp 350 estimated time and space required in orde r to validate each c ourse the effect of action by the adversaries on each one must be analysed the result provides coas for evaluation 432 courses of action evaluation the comparison of co as should evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each cour with the aim of identifying the best course of action if appropr iate elements of different courses should be merged to form one the risk associat ed with each course togeth er with its potential gain should be highlighted coas should also be compared against the adversaries cogs the analysis concludes with the revalidation of suitability adequacy and feasibility of each course determines what additi onal requirements exis t makes required modifications and lists the advantages nd disadvantages of each course will the actor complex and contributing nations in par ticular perceive the likely cost or risk of the proposed coa as justifiable and sustainable 433 the decision the decision is the logical result of the estimate having evaluated the workable courses of acti on the srhom or psf commander is in position to decide which one is most likel to be successful following this the relevant campaign plans are developed what is to be done explaining as appropriate the elements of when where how why and by whom section v key considerations general considerations 434 command the complex political and multi agency nature of pso creates unusual challenges for those in command actions at any level can have considerable and disproportionate strategic effects nd the levels of command tend to compress24 moreover command or rather cooperation andor coordination in the context of the complex of actors may bring opportunities to achieve unexpected effects but it may also impose limitations on the conduct of operations within the psf each national military contingent is likel to have separate nationa l command arrangements that could impinge on operational mpo and flexibility this is of particular concern where unexpected escalations of violence may occur it mu st be remembered that the srhom and psf commander as individuals may become key actors in the conflict in particular the psf commander must have the ability to plan lead and execute the military campaign along with political diplom atic and media awareness negotiating skills appropriate to the actor complex nd an understanding of international law given the crucial role the selection of psf commander with suitable experience and attributes is critical 24 see chapter 2 section vi 412 2nd

account when considering the social infrastructure the impact of disasters such as hivaids and other diseas should not be overlooked intangible elements of the operational environment will include the indigenous and any displaced groups culture psyche and perceptions of campaign authority the potential for sudden and unexpected escalations of the c onflict and the degree of control of the leadership over the military paramilitary criminal and other elements of the population should also be assessed these intangible elements ar likely to exert significant influence on the conduct of the

realistic appreciation of the region the origins and na ture of the current conflict and potential reactions to intervention should they be required 439 parties to the conflict in addition to cog anal ysis detailed and thorough assessment should be made of the parties willingly or unwillingly involved and the 414 2nd edition jwp 350 dynamics of the conflict when there ar multiple parties to conflict and those parties are disorganised and undisciplined such an assessment may prove far from straightforward however as far as possibl this assessment will need to cover wide range of military

resist all attempts to manage their activity except when milit ary cooperation proves the only realistic means of access or information few media ag encies can claim to be fully impartial some will be selective in their representati on of the truth for their own ends and those of the party they have elected to support others may have particular line they wish to promote such as increased internationa l involvement for humanitarian reasons despite the apparent moral ascendancy of must do something or must do more headlines the secondary eff ects of the media must be carefully considered by the srhom and psf commanders 441 other agencies in pso the range of actors operating in the crisis region will have profound and important impact on the conduct of the campaign at all levels commanders should make deta iled assessment of the other agencies operating within the area this assessment should be ba sed upon the overall campaign plan lines of activity so interaction and coordination can be readily implemented planning should take account of the identity role interests intentions and methods of operation of those elements of the actor complex within the area of responsibility only through painstaking preparation in this area can comprehensive and complementary plans be produced 442 transfer of responsibility pso will frequently require the handover or takeover of functions and responsibilities between militaries and civilian actors these transfers should be preplanned coordinated and managed by the srhom and psf commander the parties to the conf lict for their own dvantage may exploit alterations in operational competence and discrepanc ies in the responsibilities transferred the greatest risk to suc cessful pso may lie in the management and manner of transferring responsibility 443 allocation of resources in multinational pso the quantity and quality of other national contingents may be difficult to predict planners should also take account of the availability of local resources note the resources of the actor complex 25 see jwp 345 media operations 415 2nd edition jwp 350 and any neighbouring nations support that could be employed planning staff should liaise closely with the actor complex and host nation agencies to identify and bid for local resources access to local materials and construction resources may need to be carefully controlled and the availability of specialists ab to restore the life support infrastructure such as bakeries flourmills water treatment plants sewage works power generation plants quarries sawmills and other strategic industries should be considered the contributions that can be made by resources from the joint military components are detailed in annex d 444 simultaneity tempo peace support operation activities and planning timelines simultaneity and tempo are em ployed to undermine the will of adversaries rather than simply overwhelm them by mass british defence doctrine utilises the concept of the ooda26 loop and the aim of attempting to get inside the adversaries decisionmaking cycles there by achieving superior operational tempo when constructing the psf campaign plan the aim may be to bring force to bear on the adversaries entire structure in order to overload their decisionmaking cycle the goal is to overwhelm or cripple their cap ability and will to fight by placing more demands on the adversaries than can be handled tempo is relative to the adversaries decision action cycle and is critical in exploiting friendly capabilities whilst denying the enemy freedom of action it may be the means to establish and build campaign authority at the outset of pso the aim is to operate at an ppropriate tempo in order to dominate the action remain unpredictable and operate beyond the adversaries ability to react however the ability to maintain mpo in the overarching comprehensive pso plan will depend on th complex of actors and their willingness to work closely together however tempo is relative and in seeking to address the underlying causes of crisis it is inevita ble that the timelines guiding pso planning will be extended the history of pso in the 1990s demonstrated capacity to respond to the immediate needs of crises however more recent events have bolstered international willingness and ca pacity to take longterm view that will shape the

conflict or achieve conc iliation before conflict breaks out effective and comprehensive planning may result in panoply of outcomes again however the effects achieved by military force alone will be limited it has been shown that early engagement accompanied by realistic investment in the planned effects can have disproportionate in fluence on pso the costs associated with preventative action despite the prot racted time scales involved are likely to be dwarfed by the expenditure require d to fund military intervention less obvious is the potential need for preventative activity to stop

to establish the secure environment in which others can act to achieve the campaign objectives realism will demand that immediate pr oblems are met with effective and perhaps shortterm solutions nevert heless the existence of longterm comprehensive pso plan should ameliora the potentially negative effects of this shortterm activity whenever operational tempo permits decisions should be biased towards the longterm ef fects that must be achieved this will be particularly important in cons idering the nature and scope of both deterrent and coercive uses of force the selection of targets to be defeated will usually be made giving more weight to secondary effects and their impact on campaign authority for example targets vital to the achievement of long term goals may be withheld or attacked

paid to ensuring that implied tasks which are subject to wide interpretation do not beco antagonistic to comprehensive pso plan objectives close politicalmilitary coordin ation in defining tasks specific and implied should ensure coherence between tac tical activity and the strategic intentions of the mandating authority commander should identify the necessary objectives and tasks then prioritise them commanders should also be awar of those tasks that have to be carried out concurrently by othe r agencies and those that may only occur sequentially with military activities having reached this stage subordinate commanders are then able to select and prio ritise the techniques most appropriate to accomplishing the tasks33 and objectives identified 451 resource allocation having assessed the require d tasks and the techniques required to accomplish them commanders next step is to allocate his available resources to those tasks he should also where appropriate ne gotiate with ngos and others in the actor complex to ensure coordination or deconfliction between his military activities and those of the civilian or ganisations this should be done for each military line and phase of operation and will determine which activities may be done concurrently and which will need to be u ndertaken sequentially this process will provide general overview of what is feasible and set prudent limits on commanders aspirations accordingly the t roops to task calculation may adjust the lines of operation and sequencing 452 financial considerations early in the planning process for the psf campaign plan there are 2 financial issues to be addressed first the financial authority for the costs of maintaining the psf and secondly the costs of project work authority the funding of national cont ribution to psf will rest with the government in the case of ope ration while the authority to establish psf belongs to the security council th power to authorise the expenses of the operation rests with the general assembly there are 2 methods of funding pso 1 assessed contributions under the authority of united nations charter article unc 17 paragraph 234 psfs are normally paid for by members of the on scale worked out to take account of their ability to pay 33 typically in pso this may involve participation in security sector reform or disarm demobilise and reintegration

inevitably the main burden of costs falls upon those states contributing the forces and equipment b projects specific financial provisi on may be made for projects undertaken as part of hearts and nds programme or broader package of regeneration activity where possible th projects should seek to draw on local resources and the local infrastruct ure and thereby create bridge between relief and development in some situations it may be necessary for military units to become project managers nd implementing partners for projects sponsored by the contributing nations35 flexibility should guide this relationship and the focus should fall upon responsive tasking funding and action cycles the humad36 will have central role to play in the planning of projects history has shown however that project funding can create dependency culture with distorted and inflated prices such that local businesses are unable to sustain themselves in the longerterm the paramount need is to ensure that quick impact pr ojects are planned with clear view of the longterm campaign objectives reference to the srhoms comprehensive campaign plan and the f unctional grouping associated with infrastructure projects should ensu re that pitfalls are avoided 453 training in addition to the full sp ectrum of military capabilities psos require particularly high standards of in dividual skills discipline

support operations section i introduction tasks and techniques 501 there are number of task s primarily associated w ith the peace support force psf which are either unique in that they lie outside the usual ambit of military forces and their commanders or have unusual emphasis during peace support operation pso the variation in the sp ecific geopolitical circumstances of each pso makes it impractical to positively ssociate tasks with pso activity types1 table 51 is an indication of the degree of relati onship between tasks and pso activity types such tasks are undertaken on pso for 1 or more reasons which also provide method for categorising the tasks and techniques as follows campaign authority promotion to enhance perceptions of campaign authority by persuasion and influence or combination of consent promoting techniques b operational environment control to control the operational environment through the use of military force c interim management to assume responsibilities more usually undertaken by civil administration or agenci that either do not exist or are unable to operate because of the crisis d common serving more than one purpose ie common to the previous 3 categories 502 the techniques employed in meeting th tasks within pso may draw upon core military skills however the unique circumstances of each pso may require commanders to create practical and pragmatic solutions of their own where possible guidance on the more common techniques is gi ven with the associated task in this chapter the following sections outline task s and techniques most associated with pso according to the categories however contents of each section should not be regarded as exhaustive 1 pso activity types prevent intervene regene rate and sustain are detailed in

degree of association be tween tasks and pso activity types 503 the applicability of each task each technique and the appropriate force stance to be adopted by the psf should be considered by the pso authorities the special 52 2nd edition jwp 350 representative sr of the secretar general srsg or european union eusr or the head of mission hom an dor the psf commander the employment of control techniques however will generally be only an option for force able to adopt an enforcement stance psf s hould possess the potential and agility to escalate or deescalate its stance to match the threat situation section ii campaign authority promotion campaign authority enhancement and assessment 504 the nature of campaign authority 2 the psf commander is unlikely to have any influence over the original mand ate for the pso however subsequent action can shape the response of the complex of actors to the mandate and afford increased operational flexibility information ope rations and the media can influence compliance expectations and perceptions of the legitimacy of the mandate the conduct of the psf and the civil actors associated with an intervention will be critical in this respect actions to enhance cam paign authority can be viewed from two perspectives first those actions associated w ith the conduct of the international community in particular the psf b secondly from the perception of t hose intended to benefit from the pso the parties to the conflic t and indigenous population 505 actor complex conduct the psf and the associat ed civil international community must understand how their conduct on and off duty will affect how the local population perceives the campaign to ensure that personnel are properly equipped to participate in pso they should receive thorough and current briefings on the local cultural ethnic religious and mora l issues and history of the conflict the conduct of psf in particular should be designed to enhance consent and promote the cooperation of the local people in or der to create more operational space and greater freedom of action this can best be achieved by the deployment of psf with sufficient capability to deter hostile actions by the judicious application of force to demonstrate and reinforce credibility when force is used it will be necessary to have sound appreciation of the full range of effect s that actions may trigger the need to promote campaign authority may at times constrain the use of force and some combat techniques this should not be confused with the principle within the overriding law of armed conflict loac that limits the application of force to that which is reasonable to achieve the desire d outcome when the level of campaign authority is in doubt in all sectors nd areas of the community its enhancement should be priority task when campai gn authority is more certain it may be 2 campaign authority is discussed in chapter 2 53 2nd edition jwp 350 possible to use more robust methods in conf ined areas without detriment to the overall level of campaign authority campaign aut hority may be enhanced by hearts and minds programme using military resources to provide carefully targeted support to the local community the less formal but equally important role of improving relations with the local population is the res ponsibility of all members of psf it is an operation support staff j3 ops sp resp onsibility to advise commanders of those actions that will have negative effect on community perceptions of the psf such as collateral damage or actions that might ca use cultural offence relations may be developed through formally hosted events or informal meetings during the normal course of military operations while projects may largely be supervised by specialist teams all service personnel sh ould consider themselves agents in the hearts and minds campaign through training and l ong periods of engagement in pso united kingdom armed forces have welldeveloped ability to forge the required levels of contact with the local populace comma nders may find advantage in offering guidance to other nations less experienced in this approach hearts and minds programme requires careful coordination w ith information and media operations to ensure that it is not perceived as blatan tly manipulative or conducted in way that might degrade campaign authority such projects should be undertaken with advice from both the civil military cooperation cimic staff and the humanitarian advisor humad effort should be made to ensure that the programmes do not create any dependency in the local popula tion and steps taken to ensure that responsibility for the services provided to be transferred to local civil control as soon as practicable all staff should be clear that this work is not humanitarian assistance 506 legitimacy compliance ex pectations and justice from the outset of pso there will be need for strenuous ef forts to enhance campaign authority individuals views of the legitimacy of the ma ndate their consent to be subject to the authority of mandate their compliance with those implementing the mandate and their expectations of the ma ndate are all separate but related campaign authority issues the view of legitim acy is unlikely to change r eadily however if the people and parties can be made to recognise their interdependence and the gains to be derived from compliance their motivation to coope rate will increase compliance may exist already or may need to be encouraged by inducements nd rewards or enforced by coercion or deterrence generally compliant environm ent however allows the psf to identify and manage reca lcitrant elements and prom ote cooperation amongst the remaining elements of the population campaign authority can be further promoted if it can be shown to the parties that their stat us and authority will increase if they show themselves able to resolve issues without re sort to violence if the immediate military object in pso is to bring an end to any fighting commanders must communicate with the leaders of those engaged in the fi ghting however the victims of violence and those who are not party to the violence and who already wish to live in peace are often left voiceless and with unsatisfied xpectations this invariably means that 54 2nd edition jwp 350 those involved in the fighting determine th terms of any settleme nt consequently crimes against humanity and violations of the fundamentals of in ternational law may appear to be rewarded in such ci rcumstances peace with impunity for the perpetrators and without justice for the victims is unlikely to enhance campaign authority indeed it is likely to provide cause for return to conflict in the long term accordingly the creation of selfs ustaining and politically defined steadystate requires that the srhom and psf co mmander do not focus their activities exclusively on those involved in the fighting but also work to enhance the perceptions and consent of those already ngaged in peaceful activities 507 diplomaticeconomic assistance and communications throughout pso combination of diplomatic leverage pe rception management judiciously targeted economic measures and the dete rrent or coercive use of force should be applied to ensure compliance with the directive of the authorising body whilst steadily enhancing campaign authority experience has shown the need for continued effort not only to expand areas of general consent but also to communicate consent up and down partys chain of command fo r example when the srhom or psf commander has secured the agreement of lead er to particular course of action they should ensure that the terms of that agreement are promp tly and accurately passed it is vital that those party members facing subordinate psf commanders are able to avoid misinterpretation and nonco mpliance liaison officers with faction headquarters can help monitor the passage of orders and agreements and if necessary assist with their transmission 508 assessment periodic assessments of the vel of campaign authority should be made against the permanen ce fragility or volatility of consent across all elements of the population and within the hierarchie s of the parties to the conflict in the aftermath of an interstate conflict the degr ee of consent should be relatively clear cut and agreed in peace plan by the disputing states in the event of an intrastate conflict or civil war the pa rtiesfactions may be diffic ult to differentiate from the general population the consent of the par ties will usually be driven by local events and prevailing popular opinion this may give geographic variations in the level of campaign authority whilst there may be cons ent at the strategic level by virtue of national or party commitments to an agreem ent at the tactical level there may be renegade local groups who disagree violently with their strategic leaders and who may be hostile to the psf this may resu lt in noncompliance by elements of one or more of the parties and attempts to restrict the freedom of movement of the psf in this case making any judgements of campaign authority is highly problematic however this does not remove the need to make an assessment the level of co operation given by the indigen ous population to those implementing the pso and the degree of coercion required to achieve that cooperation will be good indication of the level of campaign authority 55 2nd edition jwp 350 negotiation and mediation 509 the significance of negotiation and mediation by negotiation and mediation positive relationships between the factions and the psf can be formed that enable agreements to be reached promote the process of conciliation and enhance the level of campaign authority objective and effective negotiations which are created controlled and fostered at every level by the psf will develop climate of mutual respect and cooperation necessary for the successful resolution of the conflict in this context negotiation and media tion and the associated activities of arbitration and conciliation may be scribed as follows negotiation this refers to direct dial ogue between parties in the conduct of negotiations the psf will usually have its own operational objectives b mediation this describes the activitie s of gobetween connecting parties to dispute in this role the psf representative s act as the means whereby opposing parties communicate with each other and are encouraged to identify and reach mutua lly agreed solutions c arbitration in arbitration an authoritative third party provides judgement by considering the opposing po sitions and suggesting settlement there is less initial scope for arbitration in most pso environments arbitration requires degree of control th at may take some time to establish d conciliation this describes the process that occurs as the result of agreements achieved by successful negotiati on mediation and arbitration by series of compromises by all partie s an agreement is reached which accommodates many of the aims and aspira tions of the parties such that there is little or motivation to resort to c onflict and greater motivation to work together for common good 510 aim the aim of negotiation and mediation is to reach agreements to which all parties have concurred and which will help to build campaign authority and to contain deescalate nd resolve the conflict 511 the wider context negotiation and medi ation may be conducted independently but more normally as an adj unct to other pso activities it is skill required at all stages of pso and will n eed to be exercised at every level consequently all personnel could be involved from seni or commanders meeting with faction leaders to individuals at isolat ed observation points who may find themselves trying to control an incident or arbitr ating in local dispute negotiation and mediation may be conducted as part of deliberate process or as an immediate response to lifethreatening incident in th cases it is important to remember that 56 2nd edition jwp 350 the commander of the psf involved at the inci dent is often perceived as part of the problem he should therefore set the scen in order that his senior commander and should one exist the senior commander of th hostile party can solve the problem when there is chain of command identifying other people of influence such as the local mayor religious leader or womens repr esentatives could be crucial in resolving the problem identifying and addressing th source of the incident and the most appropriate level of authority to deal with it lies at the heart of preventing further incidents 512 process the selection of individuals or groups of individuals who are acceptable to the parties is fundamental to the successful conduct of negotiations essentially there are three stages in the process of negotiation and mediation stage 1 general preparation clear aim should be defined to determine what is to be achieved th is will take into account many factors including the objectives and capabilities of the hostile parties as well as realistic appraisal of what is feasible in practice the initial aim may be more than to get competing factions to meet and future objectives may be discussed and refined durin g subsequent meetings specific preparations will include researching the background and hist ory of the issue to be discussed so as to help the negotiator or mediator to identify those arguments that the belligerent parties may employ options limitations minimum requirements areas of common interest and possible co mpromises should be identified if negotiating the psf representative should be clear on those points that must be won or protected and those that may be used as bargaining chips he should also make thorough study of the partic ipants who will attend the meeting this should include their 1 cultural origin 2 personality 3 faction status authority and influence 4 known habits and attitudes b stage 1 hosting preparation if hosting the meeting specific arrangements should take account of the following 1 location in the conduct of formal negotiations or mediation the site should be secure and neutral in the control of an incident those persons relevant to defusing the problem should be identified and persuaded to conduct negotiations aw ay from those more immediately involved in the incident 57 2nd edition jwp 350 2 administration the administrative organisation should include such items as arrival and departur arrangements the provision of parking communications meals and refreshment the meeting should usually have an agenda seati ng plan and notetakers perhaps supplemented with interpreters and ot her advisers on specialist subjects separate rooms will proba bly be required by each pa rty to allow them to confer in private 3 attendance attendance should be at an appropriate and equal rank level offence may be caused if senior representatives from one faction are required to meet with j unior representatives from another to avoid unmanageable numbers ttending the size of each party should where possible be agreed beforehand policy on the carriage of weapons and bodyguards should be announced in advance when appropriate psf commanders should so bring bodyguards attention to protocol and other courte sies should not be overlooked c stage 2 conduct in the case of mediation parties to the conflict will confer with the gobetwee n in separate locations negotiations on the other hand will be held openly in one location with all the participants present although it may be extremely difficult the first item on any agenda should be for the participants to agree the pur pose of the meeting if hosting the occasion the psf representative should offer the customary salutations and exchange of courtesies and ensure that all parties are identified and have been introduced to each other refresh ments should normally be offered or received some introductory small talk is useful on such occasions to make everybody feel more at ease the fo llowing negotiating techniques should be borne in mind 1 preserve options the opposing sides should be encouraged to give their views first this will enable the negotiator to reassess the viability of his position if possi ble he should avoid taking an immediate stand and he should be wary of making promises or admissions unless it is necessary to do so 2 restraint and control belligerent partie s are often likely to prove deliberately inflexible they may distort information and introduce red herrings to distract ttention from discussions which might embarrass them nonetheless vi sible frustration impatience patronising manner or anger at such antics may undermine the negotiators position cheap point scoring may achieve shortterm gain while in the longer term it is likely to undermine or forfeit goodwill loss of face is likely to increase the belligerence of faction leaders facesaving measures by the controlling authority will probably 58 2nd edition jwp 350 serve the longerterm interests of all parties whenever possible respect should be shown for the negotiating posit ions of other parties speakers should not normally be interrupted however incorrect information and matters of principle should be correct ed if necessary with appropriate evidence facts should take prefer ence over opinions negotiations should be conducted in firm fair and friendly manner 3 argument if necessary the negotiator should remind participants of previous agreements arrangements accepted practices and their own pronouncements howeve r this should be done tactfully and accurately with regard to facts nd detail it may be appropriate to remind participants that they cannot change the past but if they wish they could have the power to influence the future 4 compromise partial agreement or areas of consensus should be carefully explored for compromise so lutions related common interests may offer answers to seemi ngly intractable differences 5 linkage linkage of point of negotiation with their wider ambitions is technique frequently us ed by parties linkage is to be anticipated if subsequent actions nd negotiating positions are not to be compromised d stage 2 written summary negotiation and diation should be finalised with summary of what has b een resolved this summary has to be agreed by all participants and if possible written down and signed by each party time and place for furthe r negotiation should also be agreed stage 3 followup effective followup is as important as successful negotiation without followup ach ievements by negotiation or mediation could be lost the outcome of the negotiations or mediation has to be promulgated to all interested parties background files s hould be updated with all pertinent information including pers onality profiles of the participants agreements have to be monitored implemented or supervised as soon as possible the immediate period following negotiated agreement is likely to prove the most critical to preserve th credibility of the negotiating process what has been agreed has to occur and any breach of agreement should be marked at the very least by an immediate protest 513 languages the ability to negotiate nd mediate will place premium on basic language skills however working through interpreters is currently more usual and therefore should be practised before ployment the use of locally recruited interpreters may provide shortterm solution but reliance on such source of linguistic support can have disadvantages cal interpreters may use ethnic or tribal 59 2nd edition jwp 350 dialect deliberately to give offence intelligence services friendly and hostile regularly employ many linguists so security checks will be required 514 negotiating peace and ceasefire agreements psf commanders have clear interest in the detailed provisions of agreements and ceasefi re terms personal and timeconsuming involvement will be requi red from higher aut horities and will be highly influential in ensuring success agreements should include precise arrangements and procedures to cover the following peace support operation mandate and statement of intent 1 acknowledgement of the legitimacy of the pso 2 statements of expectations b constitutional and judicial arrangements 1 likely constitutional reforms 2 applicable body of law c jurisdiction 1 leaders jurisdiction over their

to life they can also be employed to train local forces to do the sa they will generally seek to identify areas of hazard this information will usually be produced on master map and disseminated to all elements of the operation including civilian agen cies this sharing of data is an important feature of pso and at times it may be the case that the military clearance assets work to ad civilian agency that may be better equipped and have long experience of the crisis region ea rly liaison with these civil agencies is advisable and efforts to agree upon compatib databases will prove advantageous in the longerterm nonmilitary personnel shoul d be made aware of mine threats and the cmoc should be regularly updated w ith mapping of the explosive ordnance threat within the united nations the mine acti on service with the department of peacekeeping operations is the focus for all mine related and mine clearance operations freedom of movement 530 the psf may be required to guarantee or deny movement by air land or sea operations guaranteeing or denying movement will not be credible if they rely for success on the consent of the parties to the conflict such operations will therefore need to be conducted by force capable of adopting an enforcement stance when necessary examples might include implemen ting maritime exclusion zone or nofly zone to prevent the harassment of an unpro tected population or the creation of safe corridor to allow for the free and unmol ested movement of aid and refugees incident control 531 overview at the tactical level where ma ny hostile incidents are reaction to situation elsewhere an understanding of the operational framework will guide which techniques may be most approp riate and where within that framework they can be applied most effectively 532 incident management faced with situation of actual or threatened violence service personnel and the psf should at the outset be capable of defending themselves either by evasive manoeuvre or fire or combina tion of both having reduced the threat to manag eable level the resolution of an incident will generally follow particular sequence of steps 516 2nd edition jwp 350 step 1 attempts should be made to identify the cause of the problem and to establish accountability for ny hostile actions however the belligerents involved and the weapons used especially in the case of indirect fire may not provide sufficient evidence to show at what level the incident was initiated and therefore at what level it should be resolved b step 2 the next step will usually require negotiations with the belligerents at the site of the incident in order to contain and defuse the situation typically in pso violen t incidents cannot be resolved only controlled at the level they are initiated c step 3 if an immediate local acc ountability for actions cannot be established or local negotiations fail to resolve the situation but the belligerent forces have coherent command and cont rol infrastructure the answer may lie in raising negotiations higher in the be lligerent partys chain of command if the belligerent forces do not have cohe rent system of command and control more robust response on the ground ma be necessary from the outset d step 4 the resolution of the situation will often be beyond the immediate capability of the psf elements involved in the incident and require the application of other techniques else where and at more senior level if negotiations have failed the key to re solution may lie in combination of coercive measures of increasing intens ity and more substantive negotiations higher in the chain of command escalat ion may involve the use of threats demonstrations or the actual use of di rect or indirect fire and longerrange precision fire should this be available 533 impact of incidents the resolution of every in cident at whatever level should be viewed and judged within the wider context of the pso hence the significance of mission analysis and the re quirement for commanders to possess both lateral vision and perseverance intelligence operations 534 terminology the parties to conflict in pso environment may be suspicious of all intelligencere lated activities they are lik ely to regard the gathering of intelligence itself as hostile act it is for this reason that in the past intelligence operations have been termed military info rmation operations the use of such terminology was an attempt to accommodat both local sensitivities as well as those that might exist within multinational and multiagency pso however there is now general acceptance that the intelligence function is an inte gral part of the conduct of any operation be it military or civilian and will therefore be addressed as such 517 2nd edition jwp 350 535 the intelligence process intelligence operations will drive the conduct of pso in much the same way as they drive other operations as an operational function military intelligence will represent prime in fluence in directing and synchronising operations themselves intelligence operati ons work through continuous cyclical process of direction collection interpreta tion evaluation collation and dissemination that must be controlled and coordinated in the intelligence ma nagement plan the intelligence organisation during the conduct of pso must be flexible and task organised and will probably re quire considerable augmenta tion to include specialists in wide variety of fields 536 intelligence requirements the intelligence requirements of the psf commander are likely to be as broad but more complex than those of normal combat operations as well as requi ring detailed assessments of the geopolitical situation including historical and cultural infl uences the commander will also require continuously updated assessments of the ttitudes capabilities intentions and likely reactions of all local forces and their leaders ethnic groupings and interested parties to the conflict particularly those that are potentially hostile 537 sources open source material including libraries the media multinational business corporations and commercial satellite services will provide some background information all other sources of strategi c and military intelligence will be available including technical sources and assessment s from higher formation as well as those from national and regional authorities at the tactical level the primary source of intelligence will be human in telligence humint often from reports and routine debriefings of observers patr ols and other elements of the force that pass through areas of interest and are in contact with the local population and human rights monitors ngos are often rich sources of in formation but must be handled with care to protect their status liaison teams will have key role in meeting the psf commanders intelligence requirements welldeveloped information system is vital to the effectiveness of pso military in telligence activities should be directed by the commander to meet clearly fined requirements to satisfy operational needs in addition military intelligence will meet vital early warning requirement in monitoring and reporting those aspects th at may destabilise or escalate the overall security situation interposition 538 overview the interposition of forces be tween opposing parties remains one of the basic military techniques in pso in terposition may be scribed as separation of forces operations it is generally unde rtaken to prevent or stop the resumption of conflict by the establishment of buf fer zone or where the communities are intermingled the establishment of areas of paration it may also be discrete task which traditionally has been the establishm ent and maintenance of ceasefires within the context of demobilisation operations although there is consent for interposition 518 2nd edition jwp 350 at least from the states or parties in confli ct peace plan or fo rmal ceasefire may not have been agreed and the situation may be characterised by sporadic outbreaks of violence where this is the case the psf must be able to adopt the enforcement stance interposition operations in mult ifaction dispute or conflict will be highly complex whenever possible interpositio n actions are preplanned with the consent of parties to the conflict and normally in clude the withdrawal and assembly of opposing factions from ceasefire line or specified geograp hical area the interposition might be phased with advan ce groups of the psf deployed to provide screen between withdrawing factions such psf groups might take the form of individual units including ships standing pa trols or even single armoured vehicles interposition in this situa tion should be accomplished as quickly as possible to forestall clashes and brea kdown of other ceasefire rrangements interposition forces may be required to protect the partie s to conflict from out side interference and attack as well as taking action agai nst the violators of ceasefires 539 emergency response interposition may also be used as shortterm emergency response to forestall or manage local crisis as with preplanned interposition speed is crucia l factor in defusing such situ ation in the early stages of crisis it is advantageous if commanders can promptly insert leading elements of an interposition force between the parties concerned whilst co ncurrently conducting negotiations with the antagonists while ne gotiations may continue to reduce tension the advance elements of the interpositi on force should be reinforced until it is sufficiently strong to regain control of the situation should negotiations fail care should be taken not to escalate crises by such action 540 interposition tactics whether the interposition force has separated the opposing forces by peace agreement or enfo rcement the geographical separation may be delineated in any environment by one or combination of the following ceasefire line the ceasefire line mark s the forward limit of the area or areas occupied by opposing factio ns it is by its nature usually the subject of contention particularly when it is part of significant tactical feature b zone of separation zone of separation is neutral space or mans land between ceasefire lines th is is term now being used in the context of intrastate conflict instead of the term buffer zone which was more appropriate to interstate c onflict the width of the zone of separation may be based on visual distances or weapon ranges out of visual sight is preferable as it reduces the temptation of illdiscipli ned soldiers to take pot shots at one another zone of separa tion may contain residents farmland or other assets that the force may need to patrol mon itor and protect ccess to zone of separation and perhaps the air space bove it will usually be controlled by 519 2nd edition jwp 350 and limited to the supervising author ity any maritime zones should specify the limitations applied to in ternational shipping rights c control zones control zones are areas ither side of zone of separation the forward limits of which will be the ceasefire line in these areas limits are set for numbers of pers onnel tanks artillery by calibre and missiles permitted in the control zone at any one time or during any particular period 541 delineation procedures the following procedures should be used when delineating ceasefire line zone of separation or control zone the designated line or area shoul d be clearly marked on common largescale chart map or air photograph b the line or area should if possibl be physically identifiable c detailed and accurate descripti on of any demarcation lines using agreed grid references should be produced d the lines on the ground should be surv eyed and marked or if at sea recorded by some form of recognised maritime marker entry points to the zones should be agreed and clearly marked on the map and ground f record of the lines signed by all si des should be given to the parties concerned with the original retained by the psf alterati ons should be signed and promulgated in the same way g designated control lines and areas shoul d as far as possible be kept under surveillance observation and monitoring 542 overview observation and monitoring ar both fundamental techniques of pso and category of task as technique the purpose is to gather information and monitor verify and report adherence to agreements thus deterring and providing evidence of breaches should they occur strategic and operati onal maritime and air assets including satellites may conduct observation and monitoring however traditionally individual observer teams ve deployed into the same theatre of operations from number of political authorit ies including the security council the observers have acted as the authoriti eyes and ears observers may be employed individually or in small multina tional joint teams to observe monitor verify report and where possible to us consent building measures to defuse 520 2nd edition jwp 350 situations of potential conflict as far as is politically possible their efforts should be coordinated with if not part of the ployed psf and their produc t shared examples of specific tasks include operational level observation and intelligence gathering by maritime and air assets such operations w ill generally provide their own force protection b observing zones of separati on and ceasefire lines c confirming the withdrawal of forces d monitoring conditions in potential conflict area for signs of war preparation or increased tension monitoring and reporting the movement of refugees and displaced persons f monitoring and reporting human rights abuses g inspecting industrial facilities to ve rify compliance w ith security council resolutions 543 security observation teams w ill depend partially for their security on their status which will be considerably enha nced by credible and professional performance by the rest of the psf at time s of low threat observation may be carried out by unarmed personnel in small multina tional teams often including civilian representatives at times of higher threat and when the requirements of credibility are paramount observers may be armed and grouped in nationa l military teams possibly drawn from special forces 544 communications effective liaison with all par ties involved is also valuable supporting element of these methods th success of observation activities depends largely on accurate timely reporting using re liable communications by their nature observation and monitoring teams are normally limited in the scope of any reaction they may wish to take howe ver they may act as trigge r for other more robust joint reaction forces protected or safe areas 545 overview the requirement to establish and supervise protected or safe area can arise when any community is at risk from persistent attack however unless those within the safe area are disarmed it may be used as base from which to conduct raids clear guidance should be given theref ore as to what is demanded of any force that is tasked with establishing and superv ising protected or safe area inevitably 521 2nd edition jwp 350 efforts will be needed to counter the accusations from those within and beyond the safe area that the operation is signed to assist the other side 546 practical considerations areas to be protected or made safe may contain residents refugees displaced persons and substantial numbers of forces of one or more of the parties to the conflict the psf may be charged with the establishment and supervision of such areas and to provide support and assistance to other organisations within the safe area the fi rst stage in any pso designed to protect or make an area safe is to demilitarise that area having accomplishe d that and taken all necessary measures to defend the area specific military tasks may include establishing monitoring and enfo rcing weapon exclusion zones b establishing and maintaining cant onment areas and weapon holding areas and sites c holding ground d dominating approaches conducting patrols and searches f manning checkpoints and other control measures g the development of reinfor cement and extraction plans provision of protection 547 protective tasks include the protection and the safeguarding of individuals communities and installations commanders should be aware of the need to balance protective tasks against the need fo r more active operational measures response 548 the ability of the psf to respond to fresh in cidents is essential to retain control and keep the initiative psf commanders shoul d have reserves and contingency plans prepared noting that responses may consist of range of measures as well as the use of force it may be appropriate for re serves to be on call from outside the joint operations area joa sanctions 549 sanctions concern the denial of supp lies diplomatic economic and other trading privileges and the freedom of mo vement of those living in the area of sanctions sanctions may be conducted partially against specific party or impartially over an area embracing all parties the task may require the psf to enforce the 522 2nd edition jwp 350 restrictions and coerce or deter parties from attempting to circumvent the restrictions surveillance will be key task surveillance 550 the perceived or actual pres ence of surveillance throug hout the crisis area the joa and the wider region can he lp to deter breaches of ag reements and embargoes surveillance can also provide the means for attribution of blame when compliance is questioned moreover it can act as ba sis for judicial proceedings if rules on evidential quality have been adhered to section iv interim management tasks and techniques coordination 551 in most pso engagements there will be requirement to coordinate the activities of large number of agencies initially the psf may have central role in facilitating effective coordina tion across the actor complex demobilisation disarmament and reintegration 552 demobilisation disarmament and rein tegration ddr ta sks will generally form part of longerterm security sect or reform programme involving civil and military agencies there is however little chance of conducting such programme without rudimentary security framework and the agreement of parties to the conflict financial inducements and the offer of fu ture employment either in reformed military or as part of the local economy following civilian skills training are often used to promote participation in ddr programme forcible demobilisation and disarmament may prove necessary however experience has shown this to be high risk and highly demanding task when attemp ted over wide area the final military phase of security sector reform programme may be the handove r of security tasks to legally constituted and properly trained local forces the costs involved are considerable both in terms of the imme diately apparent costs of conducting the programme and the subsidiary costs of cont racted civilian training investment will also be required for commercial ventures th at will provide gainful employment for ex combatants the srhom and psf commande rs should pay close attention to the overall coordination of security sect or reform programme recognising that it usually forms critical point in the overall campaign electoral process support 553 the reestablishment of the rule of law and the creation of secure environment are essential prerequisites to th successful conduct of elections without 523 2nd edition jwp 350 some guarantee of protection and security i ndividuals will not have the confidence to vote and the electoral process will lack cred ibility military support for the electoral process may take many forms but will generally consist of the establishment and protection of voting centres and the secure transportation of ballot boxes and electoral staff human rights activity 554 the psf may be involved in human rights monitoring and reporting alongside specialist civil actors8 where widespread violations are apparent the mandate should specify the relevant military tasks the p sf may be called upon to fulfil variety of functions in close coordination with speci alist agencies and civilian police early consultation with human rights advisors and the civilian police will provide commanders with essential predeployment planning details covering this sensitive area when violations of human rights ve occurred or are still occurring it is essential that all evidence and in pa rticular details of those involved is systematically and accurately recorded by tr ained and equipped inve stigators for use in future war crime investigations in particul ar the apprehension of the perpetrators of war crimes will generally re quire the deployment of force supported by specialist war crimes investigators international or national po lice and other enforcement agencies humanitarian assistance 555 the foremost task for the psf will be the creation of stable and secure environment in which aid can be distributed freely and human rights abuses are curtailed however humanitarian assi stance may be provided within pso to relieve the immediate effects of the conflict where the conditions are unsuitable for the specialist agencies to do so without military assistance in cases of dire emergency military forces may be re quired to conduct specific hu manitariandisaster relief operation hdro it is more usually s econdary task to that for which the psf has been constituted and deployed the ta sk will be conducted using hdro doctrine9 in circumstances where aid agencies employ local guards or where protection is provided by companies from the civil sector it is important that their activities are co ordinated within the wide r operational context th srhom and psf commander may also wish to act to ensure probity and competence of civil actors providing their own security services such humanitarian activities will need the closest cooperation and coordination between the psf aid agenci and human rights groups not least to maintain the independent status of the aid agencies guid ance on working with humanitarian agencies is at annex b 8 amnesty international and the international committee of the red cross icrc are examples 9 jwp 352 humanitariandisaster relief operations details the united kingdom military doctrine for such operations 524 2nd edition jwp 350 interim administration 556 in the absence of any working indigenous or inplace internationally led civil administration the psf may have to undertake civil administration tasks such tasks might range from liaison to the establishmen t of an interim military government between these wide ranging tasks the psf ma be required to assume responsibility for essential services care should be take n in planning and execution of these tasks so that responsibility can be transferred to the appropriate authorities with minimum risk reconstruction 557 the reconstruction of life support infrast ructure should be undertaken as part of civilled regeneration programme for the united ki ngdom dfid specialises in assessing coordinating funding and execu ting many of these projects psf staff will work closely with dfid humad may be appointed to the psf headquarters to advise the psf commander and lead liaison activity amongst the humanitarian sector actors logistics staffs may wish to velop knowledge of local contractor facilities and consultation with the humanitarian sector will often prove mutually beneficial speedy considered and effec tive response to requests for assistance will enhance the credibility of the psf with both recipients and the humanitarian sector nevertheless care must be taken to ensure that military activities do not create dependency culture that will in the longerterm prove to be counterproductive irrespective of the success of regeneration and reconstruction activities w ithout rule of law and an international perception of an acceptable steady state having been reached inward investment and economic growth will not take place the longterm success of the campaign must therefore guide the allocat ion of resources cimic staff should constantly balance short term military necessity ch as hearts and minds programmes10 against these longterm consider ations in administering these programmes it is often necessary to ppoint dedicated civilian secretary or budgetary officer refugees and displaced persons assistance 558 the abuse of human rights and the gration of displaced persons those forced to leave their homes and refugees those forced to leave their home states are common features of conflict the numbers involved can range from individuals to entire ethnic groups normally support to displaced persons and refugees should be conducted by specialist agencies such as the international committee of the red cross icrc and high commissioners office for refugees unhcr however the scale of the pr oblem may see requests made fo r military assistance the 10 see 507 525 2nd edition jwp 350 scale of the task and its duration require special consideration as does the potential impact of civilians having been associat ed with the interven ing military forces rule of law 559 establishing basic rule of law regime may be principal task for the psf ahead of the role being taken on by an inte rnational or an indigenous police force this task will be made more difficult in circumstances where the organs of governance do not exist or are incapable of functioning and armed factions seek to exploit the opportunities this may present to them the psf may need to adopt the range of stances and employ number of types of ope ration in order to address the security situation from combat counterinsurgency and counterterrorism to the protection of human rights key to determining the appr oach to be taken will be the mandate the legal constraints that flow from it and th existing level of campaign authority gradually in the restoration of the rule of law the security situ ation will improve and civil agencies will be able to operate the transition from security provided by the military to the point where it is provide d by police will require confidence in functioning legal framework within which th police and courts retain the capability effectively to tackle crime and the confid ence of the local population in so doing timing needs to be carefully assessed for example functional judicial and penal systems are usually required earlier than police section v common tasks and techniques humanitarian law enforce ment and investigation 560 overview the detailed investigation of war crimes is highly sensitive activity with political overtones that should be left to specialist teams of investigators generally working directly to the authorisi ng political body however military forces have moral and lega l responsibility to prevent violations and when they have occurred to ensure that all details and evidence are accurately and systematically collected recorded and reported for subseque nt investigations military involvement in such investigations shou ld be precisely defined in the military mission and closely coordinated within the mission plan with human righ ts agencies and officers violations of the mandate and breaches of international humanitarian law should be the subject of formal protest as well as formal investigation where individuals have been indicted for breaches of human rights the psf may need to undertake the arrest of the individuals where possible th is should be undertaken with the assistance of international or indigenous civilia n police and specialist investigators11 561 protest procedure protest is formal notification of an act by one of the parties to dispute or by the psf which th originator considers to be violation of 11 see 556 526 2nd edition jwp 350 the status quo or international law pr otest indicates that the violation has been observed and that action to redress the grieva nce or an explanation is required as soon as possible protests may be communicated verbally but have to be confirmed in writing while the full details of the protes t will be sent to the offending party the other parties if formal par ties exist will normally only be told that protest has been made without further elaboration this proce dure is to reassure all parties that the psf will not in the first instance betray confid ences however if the violation is not redressed the psf may pass deta ils to the other parties all protests should be recorded 562 enforcement and the investigation of violations every breach of the mandate international humanita rian law or peace agreemen t which is witnessed by psf should be dealt with immediately in accordance with its mandate and mission statement failure by psf to preven t violations will undermine its campaign authority and the effectiveness of the missi on enforcement may require the arrest and disarmament of violators and their detainment until they can be handed over to an appropriate civil legal authority roe sh ould be designed for ch contingencies and to make legal provision for the psf to us all necessary measures to achieve compliance such actions wh ich must be catered for in detail in the mission plan may also require the deployments of reserves and reaction forces not all violations will be dealt with as official complaints those that are minor in nature can often be dealt with at an appropriate level however they should still be reported and recorded speed of reaction is also essential to secure evidence before it can be removed and to question witnesses before intere sted parties coach them to dopt particular line the procedure for enforcement interventions investigations and reporting should be detailed in the appropriate psf standing orders in acco rdance with the mandate information and media operations 563 overview info ops12 are an integral element of the manoeuvrist approach to the conduct of operations and should be fully coordinated with other activities and operations of the psf in order to enhanc campaign

activities is to assist the media in veloping balanced and fully informed understanding of the campaign objectives mission execution and events as they unfold the media will require sophisticated and professional handling from the start of the mission and is best served by c onsistent and transparent information policy that recognises the pressures imposed by th real time reporting of the electronic media media staff should be fully integr ated into the chain of command and extreme care must be taken to ensure coordination of public information activities and civil affairs as component parts of an overa ll information campaign to achieve consistent and credible message clear lines to take should be passed to all contingent commanders and subordinate headquarters media reports may rapidly and decisively enhance or degrade campaign authority at times it should be recognised that the judicious introduction of press reporters to th scene of an incident may act to restrict hostile parties action and in some cases avert atrocity an effective media service is an essential element in the conduct of pso and will require the commander to agree plans and personally participate in their delivery 528 2nd edition jwp 350 567 the principles of information oper ations in peace support operations the following principles may assist the psf commander in formulating and directing the information campaign honesty unless the information promulga ted is believed info ops will serve purpose obvious attempts at propaganda or lies will impose serious risk to the longterm credibility and viab ility of any operation on certain occasions however force protection cons iderations may limit the extent to which operations can be transparent however that should not exclude timely and accurate statements concerning culpab ility when evidence is irrefutable the commander should be aware of any decision concerning the use of disinformation its use is to be very strongly discouraged b campaign authority the authority of the pso mandate has to be repeatedly stressed and enhanced in mess ages that reach audiences both in the joa and externally nothing should be communicated that might prejudice perceptions of the mandate comp liance should be encouraged and expectations managed c timeliness to be effective info ops mu st be timely all activities and operations should be analysed from the pe rspectives of the media indigenous population and parties to the conflict so that appropriate responses are prepared these responses briefings or press releases should be designed to inform more accurately and when ne cessary preempt the potential adverse publicity or misinformation that may be propagated by the parties to the conflict for their own partisan purposes d cultural knowledge thorough understanding of local culture including linguistic dialects is vital ev ery effort should be made to gain this understanding sociocultural studies and opinion surveys need to be conducted to identify prevailing attitude s and expose any misconceptions and misunderstandings that can then be subsequently addressed through any information programme close liaison w ith staffs formulating measures of success is desirable harmonisation as activities that determine and influence perceptions information operations must be coordinat ed with other lines of activity that seek similar goals these could in clude military information operations specialist agencies civilmilitary coo rdination committees humanitarian and political advisors f style information material should be presented to the local population in the most appropriate and cultura lly acceptable manner and should avoid being patronising arrogant or naively manipulative 529 2nd edition jwp 350 568 additional principles of public information activities the principles described above apply to all info ops the following are additional principles that should be given greater emphasis when formulating pso public information plans accreditation media representatives should normally be accredited in order to gain eligibility for official public information support the accreditation should require the representa tives to abide by clear set of rules that protect the operational security of the psf if the rules are violated consideration should be given to excl uding those representatives from access to further official public information services b transparency open and independent repor ting is the norm in most situations unrestricted access shoul d be allowed to accredited media representatives warnings of dangers sp ecific to certain areas should be given but without precluding media access threats to personal security are an occupational hazard for medi representatives they ar ultimately responsible for the consequences of the risks they take c liaison given the potential for poli tical repercussions commanders should be kept informed of all signi ficant developments of potential media interest public information staff s hould be available for detachment to incidents at short notice d quality of service public information s upport should be prompt accurate balanced and consistent high quality officers with proper understanding of the operation and th military capabilities involved should assist media personnel where necessary liaison 569 overview conflict thrives on rumour uncerta inty and prejudice the timely passage of accurate information based on trusting relationship is key method of combating uncertainty and promoting stab ility in conflict region liaison is therefore vital tool of psf and key to the successful execution of operations failure to liaise risks understanding friction opposition and escalation of the conflict 570 purpose the purpose of liaison is to ensure the timely passage of information to notify intentions lodge pr otests coordinate activity manage crises and settle disputes liaison system is therefore required to link the psf the communities the civil authority if it exists the parties to the conflict the civil actor complex and critically the media it s hould be established at every possible level including formation unit subunit and so metimes at lower level the specialist skills and background experience of liaison officers should if possible match those of 530 2nd edition jwp 350 the organisation with which they are to liais the most effective form of liaison is that of an individual who is permanently tached from his parent organisation to the group or faction with which the organisation is liaising alterna tive methods of liaison include patrols regular or occasional meetings and visits 571 requirements liaison officers ar the eyes and ears of the commander and can be used by him to focus on issues of immediate or more general concern or liaison ams will require robust relia ble communications with an alternative backup system in situations of particular tenseness consideration should be given to creating hot lines linking force command posts with that of opposing factions in order to facilitate the handlin g of crises liaison must be founded on friendly working relationships team members should familiarise themselves with the names and responsibilities of the leaders they deal with they should also assess attitudes and attempt to predict and anticipat the direction that events may take everything should be done to foster an atmos phere of trust daily meetings should be arranged if necessary off the record to develop relationships nd keep channels of communication open 572 priority opportunities for liaison should be explored and exploited by commanders as priority at every leve l it will normally be necessary for commanders to augment their establishments with additional officers warrant officers and senior ncos for liaison purposes if liaison is interrupted for any reason commanders should seek to reestab lish it at the earliest opportunity 531 2nd edition

kelloggbriand pact7 which prohibited recourse to warfare as an instrument of national policy the concept of an attack on one party constituting an attack on all had been born8 a3 despite these promising developments the world was again plunged into conflict with the outbreak of world war ii nevertheless preparations to ensure lasting peace were undertaken even as the war raged landmark conferences at bretton woods dumbarton oaks yalta nd finally san francisco saw strenuous efforts made to identify the weaknesses of the league of nations covenant9 and work to draft legislation realistica lly matched to the regulation of international behaviour the result was the united nations and its charter cold war traditional peacekeeping a4 world war ii demonstrated that the founding fathers of the league of nations had been idealistic in their rejection of fren ch pressure to establish an international general staff and associated standing military forces to underpin article 1010 of the covenant this lack of an enforcement cap ability was considered critical feature to be incorporated in the unc indeed the united states originally proposed standing force of 20 divisions 3800 aircraft and 200 ships including aircraft carriers and submarines11 in parallel the ussr made proposal of similar scale nevertheless the adoption of veto policy in the security council prevented the evolution of an enforcement capacity as result responses by the continue to depend upon the will of member nations to f und and participate in actions for which it provides the mandate this cold war

frustration felt by many when he wrote 5 to avert war the covenant outlined three methods of conflict resolution mediation judicial settlement by permanent court of international justice and enquiry by the organs of the league 6 in 1927 however the league took further step towards outlawing war by adopting resolution that characterised wars of aggression as international crimes 7 entitled general treaty for the renunciation of war the original architect of the legislation was briand the then french foreign minister the pact was signed in paris on 27 august 1928 8 this concept should not be confused with the stimson do ctrine which denies recognition of territorial acquisition through conquest armed force or treaty concluded under coercive conditions this doctrine was applied by the usa in its response to the soviet incorporation of lithuania latvia and estonia 9 it is generally accepted that the key functional weakness of the league covenant was the absence of an explicit obligation for member states to respond collectively to an ac t of aggression devoid of any military capability to either threaten or impose coercive measures the covenant was fatally flawed 10 this article

order was dissembled and the security council unsc became increasingly willi ng to act consequently it became abundantly clear that the traditional concep tions of peacekeeping were inadequate in the face of contemporary conflicts and th at capacity was poorly matched to the tasks it then faced a9 such was the pace of growth that between 1989 and 1991 the unsc mandated as many peacekeeping missions as it had done during the preceding 40 years successes in namibia untag cent ral america onuca and iraqkuwait unikom bolstered confidence arguably unr ealistically as the tasks conducted were far from complex in llel with efforts to accomm odate the everexpanding tasks placed upon the organisation demands for co incident and radical reform came from many quarters that the was judged unab to fulfil its destiny is matter of record sir brian urquharts comment on the fa ilure to reform the is typical of the observations made in the early 1990s many of the security councils d ecisions on conflict resolution at present lack either the legal and political strength to make them respected or the means to implem ent them in an effective way after brief cold war honeymoon the is once again suffering from the inability to enforce its d ecisions in critical situations this time without the excuse of the cold war if this trend is not reversed both the credibility and re levance of the organisation for maintaining peace and security will be in more and more doubt 17 a10 the key word in urquharts statement is enforce in parallel with attempts to reform the military doctrine responded to the more demanding remits now being placed upon pso mission commanders the concept of enforcing the peace was born unfortunately the habit of conceptualising peace support roles in terms of the

of the doctrine mode lled consent as line or rubicon22 dividing peacekeeping and wider peacekeeping from peace enforcement crossing the rubicon was to be avoided and recrossing to regain consent and impartiality was thought to be almost impossible once pso had transitioned to peace enforcement stance operations would be conducted in accordance with standard military principles predicated on the identification of an enemy 23 the perception created 22 general sir michael rose is accredited with conferring upon this conceptual line the epithet mogadishu line during the 1990s the term was widely

doctrine this return to familiar and pr oven fundamentals of defence doctrine arguably encapsulated by the pri nciples of war wa s welcomed by many26 as an important step forward the trinity of pso principles was retained though effort was expended to make their in terpretation less absolute importantly the risk inherent in simplistic application of principles meant to guide rather than constrain action had been recognised27 the need for contemporary pe ace support operations doctrine a17 during 1995 as general sir rupert sm ith adopted an increasingly robust stance in bosnia unprofor progress was made towards more flexible approach to the grey area28 between peacekeeping and pea ce enforcement utilising the full spectrum of warfighting skills this culm inated with the move of the pso in bosnia to nato rather than comma nd in parallel calls for reform continued the prevailing perception was th at the was poorly matched to the tasks it faced this led to the unsc mandati ng action by regional security structures effectively outsourcing peace support the im plications of this and recent events in afghanistan and the middle east have creat ed fundamental shift in the strategic context of pso the shift demands rec ognition in the underlying doctrine that revision is presented in this volume 24 great care must be used to differentiate between the us of warfighting skills and capacity to undertake combat operations and the use of the expression when describing par ticipation in an interstate conflict warfighting skills are required within pso 25 these terms are defined in the glossary to appreciat more completely their context and use see jwp 001 british defence doctrine 26 notable and vehement exception was commentary by the distinguished academic and auth or richard connaughton having retired from the army as colonel in 1992 his position on pso doctrine has altered little over the years essentially he questions the centrality afforded to co nsent and impartiality most recently his book military intervention peacekeeping see bibliography has restated his beliefs and called for an intellectually rigorous revision of the concepts and terminology used in pso 27 valuable feature of this acceptance has been the widespread adoption throughout nato and i n other nations of doctrine influenced by the uk approach to pso developing pso doctrine has also been subject to this influence the obvious operational benefits that may accrue in any pso need explanation 28 many commentators have vehemently criticised the inadequacy of doctrinal guidance in grey area operations a7 2nd edition jwp 350 a18 this edition of jwp 350 identifies the fining characteristic of pso as the strategic intent that is sought uniquely in pso the strategic intention is to resolve conflict through process of longterm enga gement by complex of actors in war deliberate or focused intervention the inte ntion is less ambitious focusing on short or near term objectives despite these differen ces of intent the application of military power in all instances can be soundly guide d by adherence to warfighting doctrine however this doctrine must be

alliances onto bodies whose lineage and intended role are quite different nato a21 nato has often been cited as the model upon which peace and security architecture should be based however slav ish acceptance of nato model and its associated doctrine would be both imprac tical and undesirable nato can offer lessons of value derived from many years of active military integration and co operation however few orga nisations share its heritage as military alliance or its raison dêtre there are therefore major lim itations to the crossover of ideas that can realistically be achieved a22 at the

unlikely that the ambiguity inherent in the term petersberg tasks will be resolved indeed the ambiguity may prove advantageous in the longterm for the eu military staffs attempting to define force

intentionally blank a134 2nd edition jwp 350 annex b understanding key nongovernmental and international organisations united kingdom and united states governments departments and agencies section i understand ing the actor complex b1 experience has shown that the context of peace support operations pso can vary markedly common feature however is the complex of act ors engaged in the joint operations area joa and beyond in addition to the indigenous population and the parties to the conflict multinational military forces find themselves operating alongside the media diplomats internatio nal organisations ios nongovernmental organisations ngos and aid workers1 this disparate comp lex must increasingly operate in coordinated nd complementary style ideally orchestrated by special representative sr of the united natio ns secretary general srsg or european union head of mission hom or peace support fo rce psf commander unfortunately stereotypical images ove r zealous idealism bigotry and plain ignorance have individually or collectively often hindered or prevented fully effective complementary activities individual elemen ts in the complex have regarded each other with suspicion disdain envy and at times shear contempt as result groupings of likeminded actors have tend ed to function independently and in consequence less efficiently than may have been possible had efforts to identify unifying focus for complementary planning been successful b2 over time actor groupings have also veloped an exclusive language that has institutionalised the unhelpful division the situation has been further compounded by failure to rationalise terms and acronyms or to seek rigour in their application in military doctrine advocacy publications polic statements diplomacy debate or the literature of academe planning exercises that bring together the actor complex can do much to improve the situation and it should be clear to all that exercises at every level can only truly claim to be realistic if th ey encompass and accommodate the full range of actors demanded by the pso approach b3 this chapter seeks to offer psf commande rs and their civil equivalents an insight into the key ngos and ios includ ing the system an outline of the key united kingdom government departments is included given their importance in many operations us government agencies roles and responsibilities are also 1 national governments private individuals religious groups special interest groups or foundations may sponsor these workers b1 2nd edition jwp 350 described it is hoped that this insigh t will improve awarene ss and understanding and hence the prospects for compleme ntary action in the future section ii nongovernmental organisations b4 description the formally recognises ce rtain private associations as result of their consultative status with the economic and social council ecosoc the collectively refers to these asso ciations as ngos in common usage however the term is applied to any priv ate body engaged in humanitariancharitable activities whether or not they maintain consultative status in recent decades there has been an enormous increase in the number and scale of ngos at one extreme the body may resemble multinationa l corporation with significant budgets international presence and cons iderable diplomatic leverage at the other end of the scale local ngos may pursue narrow agenda with w budget and limited means b5 principles and values ngos are often highly motivated displaying vocational drive and belief in the causes championed by their donors increasingly they are willing to concede th at coordination is necessary in pursuit of highlevel aims caution over partiality and associa tion with psf remains very real and understandable issue milita ry personnel must understand the necessity for ngos to defer the values their donors expect them to be championing this donor sentiment demands that ngos seek effe ctive solutions in the most pressing of circumstances including many instances where sympathetic military forces are absent ngos are first and foremost accountable to their bene ficiaries ensuring that the effects of their actions do benefit those that they are tryi ng to help secondly ngos are accountable to their benefactors be they individu als or national donors ensuring that funds donated are spent effectively and appropriately finally ngos are accountable to their trustees ensuring that their actions rema in true to their organisations values b6 liaison and understanding closer liaison through civil military operations centres cmoc and humanitarian information cen tres hics and information pooling has repeatedly proved that an acce ptable degree of complementary activity can be achieved whilst adhering to the human itarian principles that must guide ngo activity most ngos have now become signatories to the code of conduct for the international red cross and red crescent m ovement and ngos in disaster relief this voluntary code lays down principles of conduct for ngos and describes how host governments donor governments and ios shoul d shape the working environment to deliver humanitarian assistance it is important that military personnel understand the true basis of these humanitari an principles and the rationale for their adoption to this end nnex 1c contains extracts from the code of conduct for the international red cross and red crescent movement and ngos in addition to guiding the actions of ngos the code also describes the working environment that humanitarian actors would like to s ee created by donor go vernments host b2 2nd edition jwp 350 governments and ios annex 1d contains extracts from an operational example of voluntary ngo code of conduct adopted in sierra leone stereotypical imagery and lack of mutual respect often underpin antagonism between military forces and the ngo community to this end the has published guidelines on the use of military and civil defence assets to sup port united nations humanitarian activities in complex emergencies2 transparency over pso campaign objectives developing ngomilitary contact and understa nding as well as the conjoint approach to planning promoted in pso offers the prospect of the actor complex working with greater harmony towards shared goals b7 organisation most ngos will operate within territory using recognisable and flat command and control c2 structure based upon country director supported by small number of deputies and beneath th at level field personnel bring policies and programmes into effect section iii working with the humanitarian sector standards and evaluations b8 the rapid growth in the number of ngos and past criticism of ngo actions have led to an increase in professionalism within the humanitarian sector this has been manifested by an increasing focu s on standards and on accountability b9 the most well known set of standards is the sphere standards these standards provide widely ccepted set of universal mini mum standards in core areas of humanitarian assistance and ai m to improve both the quality and the accountability of assistance the cornerstone of the sta ndards is the humanitarian charter3 which describes the core principles that govern humanitarian action the standards themselves are broken down into 5 sectors water sanitation nutrition food aid shelter site planni ng and finally health services b10 psf personnel involved in hu manitarian activities shoul d be familiar with the sphere standards4 and apply them as appropriate taking into account the local situation although the sphere project s been adopted by most ngos there is some criticism of them and consequently some ngos refer instead to the quality project this project provides tools to assist with the 3 stages of project initial diagnosis and context analysis design and implementation and evaluation and learning 2 published in march 2003 available from the reliefweb library wwwreliefwebint 3 the charter is based upon the icrc code of conduct see appendix 1b international humanitarian law international human rights law and refugee law 4 the sphere standards can be accesse d and downloaded directly from th internet via their website at wwwsphereprojectorg b3 2nd edition jwp 350 b11 all major ngos are now subject to ev aluations both during and on concluding projects and many have their own lessons id entified processes evaluations seek to measure the effectiveness of drawin g on relevant minimum standards and the views of the beneficiaries external assessors conduct many evaluations and the results are open to public scrutiny enc ouragingly lessons are increasingly shared amongst ngos enabling them to learn from each others experiences participation in the lessons learned process by military pers onnel should be of mutual benefit in improving understanding and procedures potential areas of discord b12 discord between the military and humanit arian community is usually focused on three areas the need to maintain humanitarian space military provision of humanitarian assistance nd the use of language b13 humanitarian space conceptually humanitarian space can be thought of as the distinction between politically motivated actions to bring conflict to an end and apolitical humanitarian assistance to amel iorate the effects of conflict the maintenance of this distinction is essen tial for humanitarian agencies it is this distinction that assures their independenc and allows them access throughout the conflict zone enabling them to distribute relief on the basis of need impartiality this distinction is also key element in the security of their staff where humanitarian space becomes co mpromised the effectiveness of humanitarian agencies is reduced and their staff ndangered in the field the need to maintain this distinctiveness leads ngos to consider carefully the extent to which perceptions of their relationship with the military can undermine their mission it is these considerations that underpin ngos hesi tancy over the use of military facilities transport logistics and escorts or about ssociating too closely with the military at the operational and strategic level b14 humanitarian assistance the area that causes ngos the most concern however is the perceived move by many nations armed forces towards direct involvement in the provision of humanitarian relief where humanitarian resources are clearly overwhelmed it is accepted that th use of the military may be appropriate in these exceptional circumstances the m ilitary should act in support of the most appropriate humanitarian agency and should hand over responsibility as soon as suitable humanitarian resources are availabl however many humanitarian actors see the routine involvement of military forces in humanitarian activity as inappropriate the ngos recognise the rationale behind m ilitary hearts and minds programmes but object vehemently to these being in anyway described as humanitarian b15 use of language the use or misuse of humanitarian language can cause considerable friction betwee n military and humanitarian ac tors the majority of misunderstandings hinge around the following words b4 2nd edition jwp 350 humanitarian there is common definition of humanitarian amongst the ngo community however mo st would agree that humanitarian action is motivated by moral concern fo r other human beings on the basis of common humanity it is not subject to political interests or military objectives and can only be conducted in accordance with the principles of impartiality and universality clearly milita ry actions are invariably in pursuit of military and political objectives nd will rarely be conducted fully in accordance with humanitarian principl the use of terms such as humanitarian interventions to describe military interventions or humanitarian tasks conducted to achieve military objec tives therefore directly contradict the understanding of ngos and will inevitably lead to friction b impartiality impartiality is word used by both military and ngos for the military impartiality is with respect to the mandate the military interpret and apply the mandate5 rather like football referee impartially imposing the rules of the game ngos on the other hand ar impartial with respect to the absolute humanitarian needs of the ci vilians and the non combatants that they seek to assist they will distribute relief supplies impartially with respect to the greates t need impartiality is thus highly subjective its use in earlier versions of pso doctrine proved highly contentious and operationally difficult to achieve whilst the military may be applying the mandate impartia lly that application ma well appear partial to one or other party similarly whilst ngos may be distributing relief supplies impartially and according to need to community that does not receive aid that distribution may appear decidedly partial c security military and ngos are both c oncerned about security and both use the term the intended meanings frequently differ the military tend to view security from relatively narrow perspective equating it to the absence presence or level of violence the provision of secure environment therefore relates to reduction in leve ls of violence against priorities set usually by the military ngos view secu rity from broader perspective that takes account of an individuals immedi ate physical security as well as their longerterm situation their vulnerability to future conflict or disaster their access to food and livelihood and th sanctity of their fundamental human rights when dealing with ngos it is therefore more productive and important if agreement can be reached on where responsibility for the broader facets of security actually lie 5 ngos would be swift to highlight the fact that our mandates are invariably born of political process and are therefore inherently partial b5 2nd edition jwp 350 complementary working b16 it has already been stated that wo rking in complementary manner is perceived as realistic goal in both the huma nitarian and military sectors the ideas offered below seek to reduce discord between the military and human itarian sector and thus enhance the mutual benefits of civilmilitary interaction focus on the best the number of ngos s increased dramatically and in consequence it is impossible to with them all commanders at all levels must learn to diffe rentiate between the various agencies focusing on the key organisations and the individuals of influence within them do not overlook local organisations they will frequently have more experience and knowledge than external organisations the following questions may assist 1 does the organisation have clear mandate and purpose 2 are their objectives clear 3 what experience do they have in the region and how long have they been operating there b share information get to know the key players personal contact is critical and will permit considerably mo re manoeuverist solutions than might otherwise be the case be as open with information as possible and be transparent recognise that good ngos can be trusted with sensitive information in certain circumstances they may have be tter local knowledge than that available to the military co mmander understand that experienced ngo staff and their pare nting hqs appreciate the need for opsec at all times humanitarian actor security depe nds upon intelligence and opsec they have other means of fence most ngo staff are highly qualified and experienced they are experts in thei r field and often possess years of region specific knowledge be prepared to liste n to them and recognise that differing operational cultures prevail c respect their independence humanitarians are rightly and at times fiercely independent they are not der command attempts to dominate or command them will usually be counterpr oductive recognise and accept the difference between military and ngo objectives but work to identify those high level objectives upon which compleme ntary activity must be based respect and maintain humanitarian space b17 understand their methods for humanitarian actors the process by which objectives are achieved matter as much as th end result methods may appear slow and ineffective however they will be designed to build local skills and empower local people to take responsibility for themse lves they will also attempt to make use b6 2nd edition jwp 350 of local staff that are often highly experienced6 and capable individuals do not always assume that expatriate staffs pa rticularly western ones are in charge section iv

country within ios there are both n go and igos for the purposes of this chapter national and inte rnational humanitarian ngos have already been discussed in the previous sections th is section therefore deals with ios igos and ngos that are not humanitarian for clarification igos are deemed to exist when two or more government s have agreed to finance and form the igo unlike ngos many igos are treated as legal entity in internationa l law as result they can be party to agreements treaties or conven tions their staff are afforded diplomatic status although the body itself can be sued or indeed sue others membership generally extends to many more than two states and treatie s or charters set down the organisations purpose operati ng parameters and principles b32 principles and values the disparate nature of ios makes it difficult to generalise about their characte ristics clearly secur ity focussed body like nato is fundamentally different to an io that serv humanitarian or diplomatic agenda security actors tend to have evolved charact eristics that mirror military hierarchical structures whilst the humanitarian sector w ill reflect the decentralised and flattened approaches needed to derive maximum field based impact the humanitarian bodies decisionmaking financing and resourcing procedures will be highly devolved with individuals operating with considerable autonomy in the joa rather than being appointment based authority is rived from competence and egalitarian b10 2nd edition jwp 350 negotiations where the impact of personal dyna mics can be very important internal management is achieved through policy stat ements that can readily be challenged b33 between humanitarian organisations coordination is rarely ordered instead it tends to reflect temporary accommoda tion born of pragmatism and necessity however as the sophistication of the solu tions fielded by security and humanitarian actors has increased there is some convergence in the nature of those operating in the field both sectors value characteristics such as loyalty integrity initiative humanity leadership perseverance and in tellect cross flow of personnel from the military into ios has increased so that many major io country teams will now contain exmilitary staff nevertheless dist ance between the military and io actors remains reality that should not necessarily be resented in many situations it is this distance that affords the space or latitude needed for th actor complex as whole to achieve the high level aims of pso campaign b34 military personnel spanning the operationa lstrategic levels of operation will notice that ios can suffer the same discontinuities in perspectives between the field and headquarters these discontin uities can become pronounced when communications become difficult or the mpo of events exceeds the decisionmaking capacity of io institutions an awarenes s of these differences and similarities can serve to improve overall capacity and hence the extent to which international action can achieve its higher aims united nations system7 b35 the united nations charter unc tablished general assembly the security council the

trade organisation b58 the world trade organisation wto cceeded the gene ral agreement on tariffs and trade gatt in 1995 with an annual budget of us 70 million it seeks to ensure that trade and co

assisting developing countries in trade policy issues through technical assistance and training programs and cooperating with other international organisations the wtos highestlevel decisionmaking body is the ministerial conf erence which meets at least once every two years below this is the general co uncil normally composed of ambassadors and heads of delegation in gene va which meets several tim year in the geneva headquarters the wto secretariat base d in geneva has around five hundred staff and is headed by directorgeneral it so has dispute settlement body to resolve trade disputes the wto does not have country offices however request for technical assistance in the context of pso are likely to be favourably viewed international court of justice b59 the international court of justice ic j which is also known as the world court consists of 15 judges elected by the gene ral assembly and the security council it role is to adjudicate in disputes between states only countries may be parties in case before the icj if country does not wish to take part in proceeding it does not have to do so unless required to do so by specific treaty provisions however if state agrees to recognise the courts jurisdiction in dispute then it becomes duty bound to comply with the courts decision in july 1998 160 nations decided to establish permanent international criminal court icc to try individuals for the most serious offences of global concern such as genocide war crimes and crimes against humanity the 1998 rome statute created the icc like the icj the icc will be seated at the hague unlike the icj which deals with stat it may deal with individuals in its courtroom international criminal court b60 the international criminal court icc was intended to be permanent court with world wide jurisdiction for trying in dividuals charged with the most serious breaches of international law namely genoc ide war crimes crimes against humanity and acts of aggression the courts st atute was adopted on 17 july 1998 and recognises the courts competen ce with regard to war crimes18 committed during international and internal armed conflicts the icc is able to charge individuals and time or place does not limit its jurisdiction 18 icc statute article 8 defines the icc jurisdiction in respect of war crimes b19 2nd edition jwp 350 b61 it is important to recognise however that unlike the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia icty or international criminal tribunal for rwanda ictr the icc does not have primacy over national criminal jurisdictions instead the icc must complement national syst ems thus the icc will only be able to initiate proceedings if the national body is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution 19 an additional compromise imposed on the courts jurisdiction demands that the state of nati onality of the accused or the state on whose territory the crime was committed accepts the courts jurisdiction20 in practical terms this constitutes serious impediment to the courts jurisdiction with respect to internal conflicts in such situations the nationality of the criminal and the state in which the crime was committed will often be the same the statute further limits jurisdiction over war crimes for seven years af ter the statutes entry into force for that nation21 b62 it is also significant that the unsc is afforded special status in the courts statute in practical term s the unsc can forbid action22 by the icc or override the requirement for state consent by referri ng case directly to the court b63 the icc may impose imprisonment of up to 30 years or at most term of life imprisonment uniquely it may also or der fines and confiscation of proceeds property and assets derived from crime23 the principle of ne bis in idem 24 is enshrined in the icc statute and therefor an individual judged by national body is not vulnerable to icc prosecution or viceversa for the same crime25 at this early stage in the courts existence it is realistic to regard the ic c as an independent judicial body operating under political tutelage and sponsorship the significance of the courts existence is great however state practice in relation to the court has yet to be established international criminal tribuna l for the former yugoslavia b64 the unsc established the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia the icty statute gives it pow er to prosecute persons who breached the geneva conventions of 1949 violated th laws or customs of war committed 19 icc statute article 17 this may be overruled if it can be proved that the national proceedi ng are not being undertaken in good faith eg cases of unjustifiable delay or proceedings conducted other than indep endently and impartially icc statute article 17 and 20 the court ma exercise its jurisdiction if it can be sh own that the national judicial system has collapsed icc statute article 173 20 icc statute article 12 21 icc statute article 124 22 icc statute article 16 the adoption of resolution unde r chapter vii of the unc can prohibit an investigation or prosecution from being started or proceeded with for one year such resolution may be for on year renewable indefinitely 23 icc statute article 77 24 commonly known as the double jeopardy rule this forbids in both criminal and

purpose this code of conduct seeks to guard our st andards of behaviour it is not about operational details such as how one should calculate food rations or set up refugee camp rather it seeks to maintain the hi gh standards of independence effectiveness and impact to which disaster response ngovernmental organisations ngos and the international red cross and red crescent movement aspires it is voluntary code enforced by the will of the organisa tion accepting it to maintain the standards laid down in the code in the event of armed conflict the presen t code of conduct will be interpreted and applied in conformity with in ternational humanitarian law the code of conduct is presente d first attached to it ar three annexes describing the working environment that we would lik to see created by host governments donor governments and intergovernmental or ganisations in order to facilitate the effective delivery of humanitarian assistance definitions nongovernmental organisations ngos refers here to organisations both national and international which are constituted separately from th government of the country in which they are founded nongovernmental humanitarian agencies for the purposes of this text the term nongovernmental humanitarian agencies nghas has been coined to encompass the components of the international red cross and red crescent movement the international committee of the red cross the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies and its member national societies and the ngos as defined above this code refers specifically to thos nghas who are involved in disaster response intergovernmental organisations intergovernmental organisations igos refers to organisations cons tituted by two or more governme nts it thus includes all united nations agencies and regional organisations b11 2nd edition jwp 350 disasters disaster is calamitous event resulting in loss of life great human suffering and distress and rgescale material damage the code of conduct principles of conduct for the internationa l red cross and red crescent movement and ngos in disaster response programmes 1 the humanitarian imperative comes first the right to receive humanitarian assistance and to offer it is fundament humanitarian principle which should be enjoyed by all citizens of all countries as members of the international community we recognise our obligation to provide humanitarian assistan ce wherever it is needed hence the need for unimpeded access to affected populations is of fundamental importance in exercising that responsibility the prime motivation of our response to disaster is to alleviate human suffering am ongst those least able to withstand the stress caused by disaster when we give humanitarian aid it is not partisan or political act and should not be viewed as such 2 aid is given regardless of the race cree d or nationality of the recipients and without adverse distinction of any kind aid priorities are calculated on the basis of need alone wherever possi ble we will base the provision of relief aid upon thorough assessment of the needs of the disaster victims and the local capacities already in place to meet those needs with in the entirety of our programmes we will reflect considerations of proportionality human suffering must be alleviated whenever it is found life is as precious in one part of country as another thus our provision of aid will reflect the degree of suffering it seeks to alleviate in implementing this approach we recognise the crucial role played by women in disasterprone communities and will ensure that this role is supported not diminished by our aid programmes the implementati on of such universal impartial and independent policy can only be effective if we and our partners have access to the necessary resources to provide for such equ itable relief and have equal access to all disaster victims 3 aid will not be used to further partic ular political or religious standpoint humanitarian aid will be given according to the need of individuals families and communities not withstanding the right of nghas to pouse particular political or religious opinions we affirm that assistan ce will not be dependen t on the adherence of the recipients to those opinions we will not tie the promise delivery or distribution of assistance to the embracing or acceptance of particular political or religious creed 4 we shall endeavour not to act as in struments of government foreign policy nghas are agencies which act independently from gove rnments we therefore formulate our own policies and implemen tation strategies and do not seek to implement the policy of any government except in so far as it coincides with our own b12 2nd edition jwp 350 independent policy we will never know ingly or through negligence allow ourselves or our employees to be used to gather information of political military or economically sensitive nature for governme nts or other bodies that may serve purposes other than those which are strictly humanitarian nor will we act as instruments of foreign policy of donor gove rnments we will use the assistance we receive to respond to needs and this assist ance should not be driven by the need to dispose of donor commodity surpluses nor by the political interest of any particular donor we value and promote the voluntary giving of labour and finances by concerned individuals to support our work and recognise the i ndependence of action promoted by such voluntary motivation in order to protect our independence we will seek to avoid dependence upon single funding source 5 we shall respect culture and custom we will endeavour to respect the culture structures and customs of the commun ities and countries we are working in 6 we shall attempt to build disast er response on local capacities all people and communities even in disaster possess cap acities as well as vulnerabilities where possible we will strengthen these capacities by employing local staff purchasing local materials and trading with local companies where possible we will work through local nghas as partners in planning and implementation and cooperate with local government structures where ppropriate we will place high priority on the proper coordination of our emergency responses this is best done within the countries concerned by those most directly involved in the relief operations and should include representatives of the relevant bodies 7 ways shall be found to involve programme beneficiaries in the management of relief aid disaster response assistance should never be imposed upon the beneficiaries effective relie f and lasting rehabilitation can best be achieved where the intended beneficiaries are involved in the design management nd implementation of the assistance programme we will strive to achieve full community participation in our relief and rehabilitation programmes 8 relief aid must strive to reduce future vu lnerabilities to disaster as well as meeting basic needs all relief actions affect the prospects for longterm development either in positive or ne gative fashion recognising this we will strive to implement relief programmes wh ich actively reduce the beneficiaries vulnerability to future disasters and help create sustainable lifestyles we will pay particular attention to envi ronmental concerns in the sign and management of relief programmes we will also endeavour to nimise the negative impact of humanitarian assistance seeking to avoid longterm beneficiary dependence upon external aid 9 we hold ourselves accountable to both those we seek to assist and those from whom we accept resources we often act as an institu tional link in the partnership between those who wish to assist and those who need assistance during disasters we b13 2nd edition jwp 350 therefore hold ourselves accountable to both constituencies all our dealings with donors and beneficiaries sha ll reflect an attitude of ope nness and transparency we recognise the need to report on our activiti both from financial perspective and effectiveness we recognise the obligatio n to ensure appropriate monitoring of aid distributions and to carry out regular assessmen ts of the impact of disaster assistance we will also seek to report in an open fash ion upon the impact of our work and the factors limiting or enhancing that impact our programmes w ill be based upon high standards of professionalism and expertise in order to minimise the wasting of valuable resources 10 in our information publicity and advertising ac tivities we shall recognise disaster victims as dignified humans not hopeless objects respect for the disaster victim as an equal partner in action should never be lost in our public information we shall portray an objective image of the di saster situation where the capacities and aspirations of disaster victims are highli ghted and not just their vulnerabilities and fears while we will cooperate with th media in order to nhance public response we will not allow external or internal mands for publicity to take precedence over the principle of maximising overall relief ssistance we will avoid competing with other disaster response agencies for media c overage in situations where such coverage may be to the detriment of the service provided to the beneficiaries or to the security of our staff or the beneficiaries the working environment having agreed unilaterally to strive to ab ide by the code laid out above we present below some indicative guidelines which desc ribe the working environment we would like to see created by donor governmen ts host governments and the inter governmental organisations principally the agencies of the united nations these guidelines are presented in spirit of openness and cooperation so that our partners will become aware of the ideal relationship we would seek with them recommendations to the governments of disaster affected countries 1 governments should recognise and re spect the independent humanitarian and impartial actions of nongov ernmental humanitarian agencies nghas are independent bodies this independence nd impartiality should be respected by host governments 2 host governments should facilitate rapid access to disaster victims for non governmental humanitarian agencies if nghas are to act in full compliance with their humanitarian principles they sh ould be granted rapid and impartial access to disaster victims for the purpose of deliver ing humanitarian assistance it is the duty of the host government as part of the exer cising of sovereign responsibility not to b14 2nd edition jwp 350 block such assistance and to accept the impartial and apolitical action of nghas host governments should facilitate the rapid entry of relief staff particularly by waiving requirements for transit entry nd exit visas or arranging that these are rapidly granted governments should grant overflight permission and landing rights for aircraft transporting inte rnational relief supplies and pe rsonnel for the duration of the emergency relief phase 3 governments should facilitate the timely flow of relief goods and information during disasters relief supplies and equipment are brought into country solely for the purpose of alleviating human suffering not for commercial benefit or gain such supplies should normally be allowed free nd unrestricted passage and should not be subject to requirements for consular certificates of origin or invoices import andor export licences or other restrictions or to importation taxation landing fees or port charges the temporary importation of necessary relief equipment including vehicles light aircraft and telecommunications equipment should be facilitated by the receiving host government through the temporary waving of licence or registration restrictions equally governments should not restrict the reexportation of relief equipment at the end of relief operation to facilitate disaster communications host governments are encouraged to designate certain radio frequencies which relief organisations may use incountry and for international communications for the purpos of disaster communications and to make such frequencies known to the disaster response community prior to the disaster they should authorise relief personnel to utilise all means of communication required for their relief operations 4 governments should seek to provide coordinated disaster information and planning service the overall planning and coordination can be greatly enhanced if nghas are provided with information on relief needs and government systems for planning and implementing relief efforts as well as information on potential security risks they may encounter governments ar urged to provide such information to nghas to facilitate effective coordination and the efficient utilisation of relief efforts host governments are urged to designate prior to disaster single pointofcontact for incoming nghas to liase with the national authorities 5 disaster relief in the event of armed conflict in the event of armed conflict relief actions are governed by the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law b15 2nd edition jwp 350 recommendations to intergo vernmental organisations 1 intergovernmental organisations should recognise nongovernmental humanitarian agencies local nd foreign as valuable partners nghas are willing to work with and other inter governmental agencies to effect better disaster response they do so in spirit of partnership which respects the integrity and independence of all partne rs intergovernmental ag encies must respect the independence and impartiality of the n ghas nghas should be consulted by agencies in the preparation of relief plans 2 intergovernmental organisations should assist host governments in providing an overall coordinating framewor k for international and local disaster relief nghas do not usually ve the mandate to provide the overall coordinating framework for disasters which require an in ternational response this responsibility falls to the host government and the releva nt united nations authorities they are urged to provide this service in timely and effective manner to serve the affected state and the national and international di saster response community in any case nghas should make all efforts to ensure the effective coordination of their own services in the event of armed conflict relief actions are governed by the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law 3 intergovernmental organisations should extend security protection provided for organisations to ngovernmental humanitarian agencies where security services are provided for in tergovernmental organisations this service should be extended to their operational ngh partners where it is so requested 4 intergovernmental organisati ons should provide nongovernmental humanitarian agencies with th same access to relevant in formation as is granted to organisations igos are urged to sh are all information pertinent to the implementation of effective disaster response with their operational ngha partners b16 2nd edition jwp 350 annex c synopsis of the essential elements of british defence doctrine c1 this annex sets down synopsis of the essential elements including the principles of war of british defence doctri ne bdd that guide the use of military force across the spectrum of tension th synopsis is provided for ease of reference and to place understanding into the context of peace support operations pso1 section i the essential elements warfighting ethos c2 the uk considers the need to prepare for and if necessary to fight and win in war as the most important function of its armed forces every member of the armed forces must be prepared to fight and die for whatever legitimate cause the uk is pursuing through military endeavour it follows that doctrine must have at its core warfighting ethos and as was highlighted earlier warfightin g techniques will often be required in the context of pso given the destructive nature of warfighting those involved are forced to endure constant threat to their lives and wellbeing they will themselves be attempting to create the same fear in the minds of opposing forces and factions the dynamic and destructive natu re of this exchange produces massive uncertainty confusion chaos and an in evitable abandonment of initial plans for the conduct of the campaign with parties to the conflict attempting to gain advantage surprise and shock will be constant drai n on resources both physical and mental for those who have not experienced it it will be difficult to imagine just how demanding and frightening the deployment of warfighting skills can be one can be sure how he or she will react fear is commonplace even within the minds of those most conditioned to cope with its challenges courage nd leadership coupled with cohesion and discipline are th best counters to that fear the bravest men and women are frightened it is their ability to carry on spite their fears that is the measure of their courage importantly by its very na ture military activity is about confronting risk and managing it it is emphatically never about avoiding risk the military profession is not one for those who are risk averse c3 in recent years in particular its ability to mount conduct and sustain wide range of psos has led to extensive and prolonged involvement in activities not directly related to the maintenance of the uks own political independence and territorial integrity the success of uk fo rces in these operations has been based largely upon their ability to escalate and control the level of force they deliver whenever the circumstances demanded it 1 military readers may wish to cross reference these notes with jwp 001 british defence doctrine bdd chapter 3 and jdp 01 joint operations chapter 3 c1 2nd edition jwp 350 c4 warfighting ethos thus provides the uk s armed forces with the vital moral and emotional capacity to cope with all th circumstances that they are likely to confront whether pursuing aims associated with war typically deliberate or focused intervention or more frequently those associated with pso the ethos imbues casualty tolerance within the military and the wider population this is perhaps most pronounced when military action has proved necessary to support legitimate and justifiable cause or through widely ack nowledged and ethically based obligation the manoeuvrist approach c5 the manoeuvrist approach is one in wh ich action is taken to affect the adversaries cohesion and w ill to flout international manda tes rather than simply seeking to destroy military capacity signi ficant features are momentum and tempo which in combination seize the initiative and apply constant pressure at the times and places of maximum effect it calls for an attitude of mind in which doing the unexpected and seeking originality is comb ined with ruthless determination to succeed c6 such thinking offers the prospect of rapid results or of results disproportionately greater than the resources applied it is therefore attractive to numerically inferior force or to stronger one that wishes to minimise the resources committed however it does entail the risk that disruption of an adversary will not occur as predicted and hence can be less certain than an operation which relies on the use of overwhelming force2 key characteristic of the manoeuvrist approach is undermining of the adversaries leadership or commanders decisionmaking processes by attempting to get inside their decisionma king cycle often described as the ooda loop see figure c1 and hence achieve superior decisionmaking tempo this involves accelerating the rate of decisionma king to faster rate than the adversary can cope with thus pressurise d an adversary is likely to initiate or take increasingly inappropriate action or indeed none at all any degradation of the adversaries command systems by physical or other means will hasten the onset of paralysis 2 the manoeuvrist approach does not preclude the use of attrition c2 2nd edition jwp 350 observation action orientatio n decisioninformation figure c1 the ooda loop mission command c7 sound philosophy of command has four nduring tenets it requires timely decisionmaking clear understanding of the superior commanders intention an ability on the part of subordinates to meet the superiors remit and the commanders determination to see the plan through to ccessful conclusion this requires style of command that promotes decentralised command freedom and speed of action and initiative whilst remaining responsive to s uperior direction mission command is the british way of achieving this it has the following key elements first commander ensures that his subordinates understand his intentions their own missions and the strategic operational and tactical context b second subordinates are told what ffect they are to achieve and the reason why it is necessary c third subordinates are allocated fficient resources to carry out their missions d fourth commander uses minimum of control so as not to limit unnecessarily his subordinate s freedom of action finally subordinates decide ho w to achieve their missions joint integrated and multinational operations c8 all components of the uks armed forces have the potential to offer ways and means of enhancing manoeuvrist operations to do this most effectively all are allowed to play to their particular strengths in order to make their unique contribution c3 2nd edition jwp 350 maritime land and air forces have differen t but complementary attributes that are amplified in maritime military and air pow er doctrine thes are the access mobility versatility sustained reach resilien ce lift capacity forward presence poise and leverage of maritime forc land forces capacity for shock action protection the ability to take and hold ground and endurance and air powers flexibility penetration perspective speed re sponsiveness and reach c9 these are the inherent strengths and they are used to overcome relative weaknesses the weaknesses are both those that are themselves inherent and those that arise for reasons of circumstance or situation land forces for example may experience difficulties on their own in achiev ing surprise in time because the terrain and physical features may severely restri ct mobility in such circumstances combination of airlift and maritime mob ility may enable them to move significant distances and redeploy to maximum effect c10 joint and integrated operations are not si mply matter of fo rces from different arms of the armed forces and people from other agencies and organisations operating in the same joint operations area joa one vital key to the effective command of joint manoeuvrist operations is recognitio n of the relative strengths and weaknesses both inherent and situationa l of each component of the force and the playing of each to its strengths in support of the othe rs the commander must concentrate on the effects he needs to generate and employ the best means possible of achieving them this will often require lateral thinking nd the employment of units in ways not traditionally associated with their principal operating environment c11 by adopting an approach3 which concentrates on the effect to be achieved by operations and utilising all elements in an integrated fashion the va lue of joint force is more than merely the sum of its component parts to ac hieve this requires state of mind that instinctively capitalises on joint and integrated strengths this is only achieved when all are workin g effectively and harmoniously with those from the other services from other government department s and from other nations in pursuit of common purpose effectively and harmoniously is meant as merely the ability to get along with each other and obtain the lowest common denominator of agreement it means having an ability to deal with comple xity to have specialist understanding of high order and to apply that to the task in hand c12 pivotal role is played by the civilian actors in the planning and execution of many operations in pso this blending of staf fs occurs at the strategic operational and at times the tactical level of operations although the application of military force 3 an effects based approach maintains focus on the outcome or result that is to be achieved all possible routes to achieving that outcome are considered before selecting the op timal means or combination of means that will deliver the desired effect in pso at the operational and tactical level the desi red effect is often compliance with the conditions of mandate or ceasefire this will requir combination of credible diplomacy legitimate action and when necessary sufficient force to coerce or deter pa rty or faction in pursuit of the mandate c4 2nd edition jwp 350 at the tactical level is pr imarily military function it s effective delivery will depend on all components military and civil working toward mutually derived and complementary goals increasingly military forces depend not only on joint endeavour but also on their ability to coordinate and work with the plethora of civilian agencies engaged in pso the full integration of th actor complex into single campaign plan is demanding goal especia lly as the actors aims and objectives will often appear inconsistent and incompatible nevert heless successful peace support campaigning will demand that commanders and civil l eaders work towards comprehensive campaign plan4 that addresses the underlying causes of conflict in doing this they must take into account the need for coo peration without the benefit of unified command and control architecture this re quires fluid and flexible approach to others who have legitimate role in the campaign and willingness to shape decisions by taking into account the needs of others c13 finally the ability to operate with the armed forces of other nations is an essential quality in pso the uk may still from time to time deploy forces on its own without support from other allies or co alition partners however those occasions are likely to be rare and in much the same way as different components bring different attributes and limitations to joint camp aign so allies and co alition partners will do the same clear understandi ng of the ways in which other nations armed forces operate and the ability to merge units from veral nations into one cohesive force are increasingly important factors in the conduct of military operations flexibility and pragmatism c14 the fifth element to be understood is th at of flexibility and pragmatism manoeuvrist operations require conditioned and resilient attitude of mind developed through experience in training and if possi ble in practice they also require considerable thought and imagination in bo th planning and execution commanders and leaders must be conditione d to think constantly of ne w ways of approaching an objective imaginative and innovative thinking is source of initiative to allow for such thinking bdd adopts flexible approach in two ways first it is constantly reviewed and reconsidered and if found wan ting is changed to reflect the developing military environment second and in many ways more important it allows for deviation doctrine is promulgated for gui dance only not for slavish adherence an intelligent and talented commander or lead er faced with unique circumstances will always be better placed than the writer of doctrine to assess the most appropriate way of achieving his objective this combin ation of flexibility and pragmatism is necessary for the successful conduct of the range of military operations across the spectrum of tension it is reflected in british doctrine by the simple expedient of avoiding obligatory prescriptive rules while couraging distinctive way of thinking 4 this feature is critical to success in pso an d thus forms the master principle of pso c5 2nd edition jwp 350 about military operations this way of thinking should be guided but not constrained by the principles that conclude this chapter section ii the principles first principle the selectio n and maintenance of the aim5 c15 in the conduct of military operations it is essential to select and clearly define the aim the ultimate aim in warfighting is to break th enemys will to fight each phase of the conflict and each separate operation is directed towards this supreme aim but will have more limited ai m which must be clearly fined simple and direct once the aim6 is decided all efforts are direct ed to its attainment until changed situation calls for reappreciation and probably new aim every plan or action must be tested by its bearing on the chosen aim second principle maintenance of morale c16 success in military operations often depe nds more on moral than on physical qualities numbers armament and resources cannot compensa for lack of courage energy determination skill and the bol d offensive spirit that springs from determination to succeed the developmen t and subsequent maintenance of the qualities of morale are theref ore essential to success third principle offensive action c17 offensive action is the necessary forerunn er of success it may be delayed but until the initiative is seized and the offensive taken success is unlikely fourth principle security c18 sufficient degree of security is essen tial in order to obtain freedom of action to launch bold offensive in pursuit of the lected aim this entails adequate defence of high value assets and information that ar vital to the nation or the armed forces security does not however imply undue cau tion and avoidance of all risks for bold action is essential to success on the cont rary with security provided for unexpected developments are unlikely to interfere riously with the pursuit of vigorous offensive 5 the selection and maintenance of the aim is regarded as the master principle ac ross the spectrum of tension jwp 0 01 it has therefore been placed first in the list the remaining principles are not given in any particular order since their relative importance varies accordin g to the nature of the operation 6 in pso the overall campaign aims are more complex than t hose set down for war reduction to simple endstates is likely to result in narrow planning that will see essential fe atures of the intended outcome or effect neglected in the formulation of the campaign plan accordingly the campaign plan should seek from the outset to est ablish the steady state criteria that express the politically defined objectives of the pso campaign see chapter 2 c6 2nd edition jwp 350 fifth principle surprise c19 surprise is most effective and powerful influence and its moral effect is very great every endeavour is made to surprise the adversary and to guard against being surprised by the use of surprise results out of all proportion to the efforts expended can be obtained and in some operations wh other factors are unfavourable surprise may be essential to success surprise can be achieved strategically operationally or tactically or by exploiting new material the elements of surprise are secrecy concealment deception origin ality audacity and rapidity sixth principle concentration of force c20 to achieve success it is essential to concentrate superior force moral and material to that of the adversary at the cisive time and place concentration does not necessarily imply massing of forces but rather having them so disposed as to be able to unite to deliver the decisive blow when and where required or to counter the adversarys threats concentration is mo re matter of time th an of space and has more to do with the effects it has than on the massing of force for its own sake seventh principle economy of effort c21 economy of effort implies balanced employment of forces and judicious expenditure of all resources with the object of achieving an effective concentration at the decisive time and place eighth principle flexibility c22 modern warfighting demands high gree of flexibility to enable pre arranged plans to be ltered to meet changing situations and unexpected developments this entails good training organisation discip line and staff work and above all that flexibility of mind and rapidity of deci sion on the part of the commander and his subordinates which ensures that time is never lost it also calls for physical mobility of high order strategically operationally and tactically so that forces can be concentrated rapidly and economically at decisive places and times ninth principle cooperation c23 cooperation is based on shared goals and sp irit it entails the coordination of all actors so as to achieve the maximum co mbined effort from the whole above all goodwill and the desire to cooperate are ssential at all levels the increased interdependence of the individual services and their increasing mutual dependence on the armed forces of allies and potential coalition partners s made cooperation amongst them of vital importance in modern warfare it is also necessary to co operate closely with other nongovernmental agencies many of wh ich will have aims and objectives that are not aligned with those in the military plan c7 2nd edition jwp 350 tenth principle sustainability c24 sound logistics and administrative arrange ments are crucial for success they should be designed to give the commander maximum freedom of action in carrying out the plan the logistics and administrative organisation should be kept as simple as possible with component commanders having degree of control over logistics and administration within their sphere of command corresponding to their responsibilities for the operational plan summarising the approach c25 woven together the elements and pri nciples detailed above represent the british approach to military operations across the entire spectrum of tension retention of warfighting ethos is central ready to be pplied if the circumstances demand it in psos it is the key characteri stic that gives the uks armed forces the ability and credibility to establish base of influence from which both they and other agencies can operate joint integrated and multinational operations are the means by which the uks full range of capabilities nd attributes are brought to bear the uks armed forces operate together as c oherent entity to maximise their ability to deliver operational effect in doing this they are guided by these elements and principles which are as applicable at the strategic level as they are at the tactical the intelligent application of th principles underpins the manoeuvrist approach that results in commanders being allowed and encouraged to prosecute their objectives using methods of their own choosing through flexible and pragmatic state of mind to do this they need the necessary ans not only the physical means men equipment and other tangible resources but also the command conditions inherent in mission command that are conducive to seizing the initiative obtaining the advantage of tempo and achieving surprise c8 2nd edition jwp 350 annex d component contributions to peace support force joint operations d1 the following sections describe the nature of contributions that can be made by individual military components to joint force engaged in peace support operation pso as peace support force psf the descriptions are based on the united kingdom armed forces section i the maritime component principles d2 application of maritime power br 1806 british maritime doctrine provides highlevel uk mariti environmental doctrine which complements the capstone source of allied maritime doctrine ajp31 allied joint maritime operations maritime forces possess number of inherent characteristics including access mobility versatility sust ained reach resilience lift capacity forward presence poise and leverage1 the sea is valuable strate gic medium as manoeuvre space for power projection theatre entry and the pplication of combat power whilst the capability to operate in blue water is re tained the focus for manoeuvre forces now lies in these characteristics being used to contribute effectively to joint operation whose main effects will invariably influence the land environment in this context maritime forces and particularly amphibi ous forces can provide manoeuvre from the sea where mobility is used to best effect mariti force can move up to 400 nautical miles in day maritime contribution to joint operations d3 maritime power provides the psf comma nder with an enduring and flexible combat capability that can be employed from the open ocean or in the littoral environment in benign to high intensity operations the maritime contribution to joint operations consists principally of control sea denial and maritime power projection supported by ma ritime command control co mmunications information intelligence surveillance nd reconnaissance capabilities nd seabased logistics sea control this is the condition that ex ists when one has freedom of action to use an area of sea for ones own purpose for period of time and if necessary deny its use to an opponent sea control includes the airspace above the surface and the wate r volume and seabed below 1 the ability of maritime forces through suitable positioning an d force packaging to explo it access and to have influence on events ashore disproportionately greater than the scale of for ce applied br 1806 d1 2nd edition jwp 350 b sea denial this is the condition short of full sea control that exists when an opponent is prevented from us ing an area of sea for his purposes2 at the operational level this may be used to provide outer or flank defence for force or area or as means of containing adve rsaries capabilities at the strategic level sea deni may be used to deny adversaries the ability to reinforce by sea or operate in certain areas for pso this may be the imposition of sanctions th rough an embargo c maritime power projection maritime power projection is the threat or use of maritime combat capabilities at global range to achieve effects in support of national policy objectives it exploits sea control to achieve access to the littoral in order to deter or coerce an adversary or if necessary to project force ashore directly maritime fire power can be delivered ashore in the form of amphibious forces organic air pow er tomahawk land attack missiles tlam and naval gunfire support mar itime forces can also deliver special forces ashore and can conduct offensive information operations maritime forces may provide critical contribut ion to joint campaign through their ability to project seabased firepower in areas that are less accessible to land forces d seabased logistics the logistics support provided to other components from maritime assets this may include bulk stocks medical support limited maintenance capab ility personnel movement capability and temporary accommodation functions d4 sea control is the ultimate enabler fo r all aspects of maritime operations however distinction can be made between the functions of maritime power from the sea which broadly equate to power projec tion operations and those at sea to which sea control operations are focused powe r projection operations have an inherent relationship to joint operations whereas so aspects of sea control may be purely naval in nature but might contribute to joint pso d5 types of maritime operations the maritime component will be task organised to undertake the various types of maritime operations required for the conduct of given mission each encompassi ng and contributing to the full range of joint operations envisaged in the campaign pl an these types of maritime operations are described in detail in maritime tactical doctrine and are inherently linked to the composite combat functions discussed below however they can be drawn into 3 groups 2 mining is classic ap plication of sea denial d2 2nd edition jwp 350 military combat is used or threatened this grouping presupposes combat capability b constabulary maritime forces used to force law or to implement regime established by in ternational mandate c benign maritime forces have sp ecialised capabilities that may contribute to range of ta sks in which violence has part to play nor is necessary backdrop increasingly rge scale operations are critically dependent on access to commercial shipping task organisation d6 composite warfare commander the prosecution of maritime military operations is undertaken through an app lied combination of distinct composite warfare commander areas3 or functions the degree of ef fort in each depending on the size and scope of the operation analogous to teeth arms within the combined arms approach in the land component elem ents of these warfare areas may be applicable to constabulary operations eg in the conduct of maritime interdiction operations although combat skills are unlik ely to be required in benign scenario specific capabilities inherent to particul ar warfare area such as high frequency sonar may be of critical benefit d7 multinational aspects the task organisation inherent in the maritime component and widespread adherence to sta ndardised maritime t actical procedures amongst allied navies permits integratio n of multinational na val and amphibious forces down to unit level

resource heavy particularly in terms of manpower land forces by their nature have limited standoff capability and their most enduring feature is their persistent ability to conduct close combat and dominate ground hence their dominance in pso task organisation d15 the prosecution of land operations is characterised by its combined arms nature that is mix of combat forces s uch as infantry or armour combat support forces such as artillery or engineers nd combat service support forces such as logistical or medical held within hi erarchical command and control framework enabled by communications and informati on systems cis the land component commander lcc will normally be organised by task with combat combat support and combat service support assets allocated as required d16

consider sf as an enabling capability rather than decisi ve force in itself except that when operating in support of the civil power they may be employed in defensive role functions d25 sf have 3 principal functions which are equally appli cable in any theatre in war conflict and peace each can be used in isolation or to complement another surveillance and reconnaissance sf conduct covert surveillance and reconnaissance by land or sea in static or mobile role they can provide timely information to political and milita ry decisionmakers and commanders this contributes to the overall

flexibility and balanced support with limited uk logistic assets thinly spread between the services fundamentally jflogc provides means of coordinating logistic activity either into andor within the

jwp 350 task organisation d31 figure d3 illustrates typical structure for large scale jflogc and as consequence encapsulates the scope of its responsibilities d32 the uk does not currently maintain dedicated standby jflogc hq17 therefore the requirement for and composition of jflogc including its commander must be determined early in th planning cycle th jflogc hq may be selected from range of existing headquar ters such as on the smaller side the commando log hq extending up to for larg operations logistic brigade hq another service logistic hq or bespoke organisation put together specifically for the operation whatever structure is chosen requires substantial augmentation from tri service logisticians and it must remain focused on joawide activity and should not be drawn into the provision of support to one component at the detriment of others where risk exists of this occurring the joint force element table jfet should be adjusted to provide add itional component support18 on multinational operations the jflogcc is also likely to assume the ro of head of the uk national support element nse d33 uk logistics within multinational context when undertaking logistic planning the default is to consider how the uk will suppor t its deployed force elements alone indeed in most multinati onal operations even alliance operations it is always assumed that logistic suppor t is national responsibility however pragmatism dictates that opportunities to exploit economies of scale will soon materialise particularly as multinational operation ri ch in nations would be correspondingly logistically ex cessive contributions to multinational logistics could be templated perhaps by following nato m odels but are more likely to be ad hoc for this reason it is one of the key considerations at early force provider meetings for the deputy chief of staff dcos or the jf logcc if he has been chosen to seek maximum opportunity to find ec onomies and reduc duplication19 the commander of the jflogcnse will need to determine precise logi stic command relationships externally with coalition partners interna lly between the uk co mponents as well as with any deployed
