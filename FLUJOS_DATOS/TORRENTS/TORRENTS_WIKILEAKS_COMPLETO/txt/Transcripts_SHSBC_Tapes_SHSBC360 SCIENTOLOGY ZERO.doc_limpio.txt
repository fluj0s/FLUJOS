scientology zero lecture given on 10 december 1963 im glad to see you too well it works out this way having completed the entire span of scientology research at all of the upper levels and rounded it all out i never thought id be called upon to suddenly undercut the lot find brand new series of processes and processing theory and philosophy on which to build the edifice you dont think thats quite trick of course actually knowing the upper strata it might be seen to be very simple to build the lower strata well actually its quite the contrary you see with such enormous clarity exactly what has been going wrong and exactly what youve been doing that you wonder how anybody could miss it you see and you say well its very simple matter you know you got into knuckleheaded frame of mind and started postulating purposes you see and then these accumulate mass and the basis of the solution of your difficulties in the physical environment and for the last trillions multiple some vast figure you seeyou been lousing yourself up that s what it is you get it now huh and you wonder why dont you understand this you knucklehead its awful clear to its very clear to i postulate these things and get all messed up and so on and so on and then all this energy mass is still around and its automatic solutions to everything and it knocks hell out of see i cant do anything and i have to wear body and all kinds of wild things occur dont you get it im afraid youd find people would look at you blankly they would look at you blankly they are worried just today about the fact that the stock exchange trembled and that tel tel rose while gold shares sunk and this shows that there is some interesting implication concerning racialism in lower slobovia and thats whats really wrong with them they know its the fact that they might go broke if they didnt go broke or something you see if they didnt have enough money in order to buy wah and then the wafwah and then the boss is wafwah and then so fowah wa they know whats wrong with them and their wife was cross at them at breakfast they know whats wrong with them and you say well actually you just think that thats whats wrong with you because in actual fact what youve been doing is carving yourself down see lot of trillions of years ago you had these goals and postulates and so on and you run around and make these gpms and so on and they react against you and so on and youre not very able and your environment and so on dont you get it well of course our communication line is absolutely stopped at that point you can know so clearly exactly what is wrong with the being you can know so brilliantly with such insight exactly whats wrong with you and see it unraveling at great speed and with considerable accuracy and so seeing it you wonder how anybody else could fail to see it well the funny part of it is that if you try to you got fellow there and hes facing this boa constrictor and this boa constrictor is about to constrict and you say to this fellow were going to run little process on you in your childhood im afraid youre not going to get much attention from this fellow see he sits there looking fixedly at this snake you know hoho he knows whats wrong with him hes about to be constricted well some religious activities have had solutions to this they say its very simple all you do is say there is substance to reality and you seeyou look at the boa constrictor and you think good thoughts and you think there aint boa constrictor you see and if you think these thoughts strongly enough while youre being constricted you wont mind it theyve had methods of coping with this in the past so were not completely original here but to jack up scientology one level and run whole new philosophy underneath of scientology which is immediately graspable understandable and quickly agreed with which can be discussed in the highest intellectual planes over the very very best breakfast tables and in the lowest hovels all with complete and utter reality the whole way and to provide in that sphere therapy based on different an understanding than this and reason why and the last few weeks ive been walking around in small circle trying to do just that and finally succeeded and finally got scientology zero that undercuts scientology one and which everybody would im sure agree with scientology zero as you knew before was descriptions of the environment and what was wrong with it and so forth this takes care of the world in which the person lives has nothing to do with his mind at all scientology one is the isness of things and takes care of his mind as well but scientology zero simply takes care of the environment in which the person lives now the whole subject is instantly summable inof its own heading which is the dangerous environment thats all you just say the dangerous environment you see and that sums up what youre talking about and the frame of mind of the individual who is listening to you you have immediate agreement that the environment is dangerous now the funny part of it is great many people who are professional dangerousenvironment makersthese include the politician the policeman the newspaperman all of these blokes are specialiststhe undertaker these birds are specialists in the dangerous environment thats their mainstay they sell dangerous environment if they didnt sell dangerous environment they feel they would promptly go broke and so on so it is to their interest to make the environment far more dangerous than it is the environment is dangerous enough but they make it far more dangerous than it is they sell dangerous environment100 percent and like judo the avidity with which these people sell dangerous environment can be used by the scientologist the whole activity of judo is using the strength of the opponent to overcome the opponent he aims whale of blow at your head and the strength which he used to propel that blow takes him over your shoulder and onto the floor so understanding scientology zero would include an understanding that the very person who is the worst enemy of scientologythe chaos merchant the slave master the fellow whos trying to hold everybody down the fellow whos trying to keep everybody shook up one way or the other and so he cant ever get up again and so forth the fellow who makes his money and his daily bread out of how terrible everything isthat fellow of course would forward scientology zero for you with great speed its an interesting comment to make and its worth thinking about in passing now let us takelets go in now to modernhahaphilosophy of the toynbee school fellow by the name of toynbeehe spent lot of time in library back end of the library you see and he knew life finally he finally knew life hed read enough library books written by other fellows who had spent most of their time in libraries and he came to great understanding of life his actual information on the subject of mexico of course is the tourist poster and the picture of the mexican sitting against the wall with his sombrero over his eyes and his serape around his shoulders sitting in the sun there he is so he says with great conclusive exclamation points followed by innumerable degrees the reason the mexican does not succeed is he has insufficient challenge in his environmentnot enough challenge in his environment therefore he doesnt amount to anything the reason the south american see isnt an upandcoming breeder of countries and so forth is its people have an insufficient challenge in the environment the reason the african black has never made any progress in civilization is because his environment has insufficient challenge then he closes his library books having written these asininities and goes back to sleep hed never talked to any mexicans out in the philippines why brassy energetic white man jumps up and he says to the igorots now if you will just cut pathway from the village down to the river and take bullock cart in the morning and go down to the river and fill up water tank and bring it up here why your women will not have to be making that walk to the river and you should engage in this public works project at once and hes absolutely outraged because these people do not engage in it at once and he goes away and he says haha those people have insufficient challenge in their environment nothing for them to measure up to ambition not like us in the west weve got challenge in our environment this guy had challenge in his environment huh his mama opened up his mouth and spooned wheaties into it and papa wrote all the checks as he went through college and the way was paved in all directions with machinery and vehicles and the environment had been licked so of course he can stand up there and be brassy whats the real environment of this igorot sitting there around the fire listening to this fellow telling him how he has to cut this path down to the river whats the real environment hes got little boy and he thinks this little boy is very nice little boy and he knows this little boy hasnt got chance in hades of living until hes seven he knows that disease bad food and so forth so he just sort of quits along that line gives it lick and promise he knows that when the rains come they wont just be rains theyll just flood every seed out of the ground and pound the fields to pieces and if he can salvage anything out of that why maybe maybewhy he might live few months and he knows very well that all hes got to do is walk under the wrong tree and get hit by snake and thatll be that in other words he already knows he cant live thats what he knows he cant live so why try in other words the challenge of the environment is absolutely overwhelming to this fellow ive studied twentyone primitive races including the white race i know these boys pretty well ive eaten lizards tails around the campfires with them and its absolutely staggeringstaggeringthe threat of the environment of such peoples mexicothe political situation the crop failures the avarice of taxation religious taxation two or three different kinds of courts that you could be hauled up to everything going to hell in balloon and if you havent got that youve got bandits dysentery so forth strictly case of why try so why not put your back up against wall and pull your sombrero over your eyes and just go to sleep its just too much and thats your black in africasame story too much challenge in the environment the environment is too dangerous and that environment is too dangerous for fellow to have ambition now they like to tell favorite type of thingthat you must have challenge in your environment they like to tell story about well how about this young painter and here he is out there in terre haute indiana and theres challenge in his environment at all he doesnt have any friends and he eventually of course moves to the big city they make big deal out of this thing you see the environment you see offers challenge or something of this sort you know heck the reason he became painter in the first place is he didnt want to work down there at the feed store with butch gregerty throwing bales of around this guy beat him up during kindergarten beat him up during grammar school and beat him up during high school now hes supposed to work for him in the feed store thats little bit too much challenge nobody around there buying any paintings too and hes prompted by the fact that nobody says sir the environment is hostile to that degree nobody believes in what hes doing its hostile to that degree he doesnt have any future as far as hes concerned in any line that he can do in other words he faces continual starvation he faces social ostracism hes unable to communicate or contribute to his community and so forth thats very hostile environment so he goes to friendlier one greenwich village see hed ratherhed rather starve to death quietly down in greenwich village dont you see than be threatened to death out in terre haute indiana challenge of the environment and we come to the conclusion that the individualwhether he be white black red or yellowif he is man and if he is on this planet and if he has not been able to achieve his own destiny we must conclude that he is in an environment he finds overwhelming and that his methods of taking care of that environment are inadequate to his survival and that his existence is as apathetic or as unhappy as his environment seems to him to be overwhelming now if we get those principles down we have scientology zero of course the chaos merchant who wants an environment to look very very disturbing somebody says theres such thing as good news story have you read paper lately theres good news stories train wrecked child raped murderwhats good about these stories there is such thing as good press these are fellows who are shoving the environment in your face and saying lookdangerous lookoverwhelming lookthreatening look look well they not only report the most threatening bits of news that they could possiblycouldnt have any possible effect upon their readers lives but also sensationalize it and make it worse than it is what more do you want as proof of their intention well of course this is the chaos merchant hes paid to the degree that he can make the environment threatening now it isnt just and only the politician the soldier the militarist the fellow making the big rockets and the newspaper reporter and so forth thats making the environment threatening theres lot of people spend their whole lives as professional chaos merchantsjust worry everybody around them to death in fact the percentage is pretty good the percentage is probably one out of four pretty good if i can just keep henry worried enough why he does what i tell himthis sort of philosophy just spread the confusion spread the upset you see and along with this goes i wonder why henry doesnt get ahead of course theyre making henry sick so the chaos merchant has lots of troopsa lot of people with vested interests whats blackmailer but somebody whos trying to extort money by telling somebody that he can make the environment far more dangerous if i just tell people that you and mamie glutz were seen in the tourist cabin few quick pounds will keep this environment little less dangerous see because i wont tell you get the whole theory of the thing well it isnt as crude you see as extortion the newspaper prints thousands dead in and the thing lies there on the newsstands and people think god thousands dead in you see theyre hit with the news they cant let go of it and actually they respond to an extortionthey throw pennies down and you turn the inside page to see the rest of the headline and it says history thousands dead in history past strewn with death have you been plagued lately the great plague took twelve million citizens in the year 1204 will you be cancer victim support your local doctor the medico you know he doesnt get paid for the number of people he makes well he gets paid for the number of people in the society who are sick dont think its any accident that the cops will take dangerous criminal throw him into prison make him more antisocial and more dangerous and then release him upon the society dont think this prison system which is being used is an accident its marvelous method of getting police appropriations if you didnt have that much crime why nobody would permit police salaries and equipment to be extorted out of them of course the police chief hes as important as he has policemen under him hes got fifty policemen or hes got thousand policemen hes important and draws pay in ratio to the number of policemen well the number of policemen give you the number ofamount of crime there must be in the society if theres crime in the society naturally you dont have very many policemen if theres lots of crime in society naturally you have lots of policemen see so the more crime why the more cops and the more sickness the more doctors see newspaper reporters for instance sit around and think solely on this basis if i could just run into big story i can see this fellow sitting there now theres schoolhouse you know big beautiful school has just been finished you see school children are playing out in the yard playing happily ringaroundtherosey and this newspaper reporter is sitting there looking at the schoolyard supposing that should all catch on fire just as they all go inside what story you know what story ivesitting right here with my cameraman why id become famous overnight you see time magazine life magazineprobably give coverage all over the place you know charred bodies of little children you know well thats what he eats thats what he eats that makes his life forward and of course thats an exaggerated case but this does run and is to be found in the society to very very marked degree it isnt just the newspaper reporter the politician its also the individual whohere and there that you seethat engages upon this sort of thing so the environment is not as dangerous ever as it is made to appear here you have tremendous numbers of peoplevast amounts of money in fact i think three quarters of the national income of the united states right now is dedicated to atomic war well thats interesting there hasnt been one if they hadnt developed it there wouldnt be one elementary so the money that financed the horror is now busy supporting the horror dont you see and you know i dont think there have been two cents spent on the actual reduction of the threat of atomic war they talk about shelters people could crawl into shelters and that sort of thing the truth of the matter is that if you had few billions to throw around you could probably dream up defense for atom bombs that would detonate them in the air you could probably render them null and void without too much troubleif anybodyif any politician was ever interested in peace they arent they get all their appropriations and public interest and so forth from the amount of disturbance why he could probably dream up some solution of some kind or another that would handle this international tension situation and certainly if they spent as much money on it as they did on rockets they could certainly come up to some kind of solution oh i dont know in scientology we could undoubtedly solve the thing without too much trouble and talk about money and expense and so forth it wouldnt take anywhere near the money and expense but look at the money we would do people out of boy look at the incomes we would cut oh man so anything moving forward that tends to pacify or bring calmed environment is met and makes ridge withis met by and makes ridge with the backflow of vested interest in making disturbed environment so you get this ridge now if scientology moved on forward the environment would become calmer and calmer not less adventurous but calmer and calmer in other words its potential hostile unreachable untouchable threat and that sort of thingthe amount of threat contained in itwould reduce thats for certain because you see somebody who knows few more things about life and knows something about himself and knows something about others and gets grip on the situationwhy he actually has less troubleless trouble in his environment even though its only reduced slightly it is reduced dont you see so thats reduction wed say well somebody hasnt heard of hardly any scientology and yet hesone of the things you can say about him well he has less turmoil in his environment now that of course is movement in the right direction and that would bring about all sorts of things that would bring about the individual resurgence so that an individual less threatened just from the standpoint of the environment tends to resurge he gets less apathetic he thinks he can maybe do more about life you see he can reach little further therefore he can exert calming influence upon his immediate environment and so on now as that progressed forward why you would produce individuals more and more and more who could bring more and more and more calm to the environment or handle things better and better you see and its only things which arent handled which are chaotic so wed get situation where the threat of the environment would be dying out this overwhelming overpowering environment would be tamer and tamer as far as this is concerned people would be less and less afraid youd have more and more opportunity of handling the actual problems that exist instead of people dreaming up problems in order to make couple of quick bucks or pounds off of them you see be differentdifferent looking picture so in actual fact the chaos merchant does not like calming influences he tends to fight these things this wifeshes made her coffee and cakes for long time scaring her husband to death and she keeps him good and scared to death scares him at breakfast table scares him at dinner and so forth and so on if nothing else works she brings in the pile of bills after supper dont you see stress she keeps putting stress on it and somehow or another consoling him during this thing aboutyou know consoles him about this even though he is completely overwhelmed theres nothing they can do about it and so on got him completely under her thumb see all right this bird walks down to pe course he hears about communicationtalk to somebody or something like this he starts talking to his wife just as an experimentsaying hello to her or something like this see he looks little calmer this is not to be borne and incidentally at that time you can expect considerable explosion shes going to go on tirade about the subject that he must not have anything more to do with scientology and every once in while youll run into this in pe courses and that sort of thing youll run into this in practices and so on bill or pete or oscar or somethinghe mustnt have anything more to do with scientology well what have you run into at that point youve run into chaos merchant see and theyre buying and selling this commodity called disturbance and hes less disturbed and so therefore he obviously then is less under control and can be extorted from less and so therefore he is being lost as an edible breakfast youre taking the food off the plate of the chaos merchant see well youll see that ridge develop just on an individual basis and youll certainly see it develop on third dynamic basis the newspaperoh my gosh lets take the story of scientology the simple story of scientology is quite remarkable in its simplicity and in all the fog of press one loses sight of it and i thought of this the other day when i was walking through door into the lounge and so forth almost knocked myself out i suddenly thought of this and i began to laugh and i couldnt stop laughing because id been pressed to death here in the last few weeks you see ive had more silly questions asked by silly reporters than you could count theyre marvelous theyre marvelous and ive developed new technology for handling thats very disconcerting i laugh at them new york times on the phone the other dayi went into howls of laughter at the fellowa couple of the questions he was asking and so on standard patterned questions always been asked before you know goof questions and so on youd be surprised this guy almost went into tears he almost went into grief he wasnt bothering he wasnt upsetting he wasnt annoying dont you see and of course even though hes only trying to annoy the public and disturb the public when hes interviewing somebody you ought to be worried and if youre not suitably worried as his public should be suitably worriedtaking this thing seriously and taking the potential threat that he has there seriouslyof course youve taken away from him practically everything hes got to offer he cant hit you with anything dont you see this particular bloke wound up very very friendly and made sure that hedo come by and see him up in london and so forth if i got to town very happy to buy dinner and drink he was very very cheerful about the whole thing he wasnt trying to get more information by this time he was overwhelmed he washe was propitiative it was him that was going to give up the dinner and the drink see up to that time it was that was going to give up the news only his impingement didnt work mine did i didnt take him seriously ive noticed lately thats very disconcerting or direct them to sure openandshut source just dont answer the question just direct them to source and the source smile at them and go oh youre asking that you know well see soandso and soandso and soandso lets talk about something thats more important but lets look at the true story of scientology lets put it into its most banal form but nevertheless very true form doctor of philosophy develops philosophy step one doctor of philosophy develops philosophy step two people find it interesting step three people find it works step four people pass it along to others and step five it grows thats the story of scientology if you think it over for moment that is the story of scientology it really has further ramifications than that its just blunt straightforward thats exactly what happens you see doctor of philosophy develops philosophy people find it interesting people find it works people pass it along to others and it grows next time you read the news story think of this story i went into stitches over this when i thought look at the story that theyre trying to make story out of theres story thereexcept its just an interesting story the way youd sometimes read in the old spanish newspapers the roses of valencia are beautiful at this season of the year modern story has got to have disturbance and chaos in it its got to have conflict its got to have upset its got to be chewing everybody up must be conflict how do you get conflict into this story well this isobviously theyre dealing with something potent because it is growing because it is spreading because people are doing things with it because itorganizations are appearing with regard to it obviously theres something going on here but still what is going onthat doctor of philosophy developed philosophy and people found it interesting and people found that it worked and people passed it along to others and it grew now you begin to look over this situation you actually cant make any more story out of it than that you can tell some bits here that amplify the thing you can get some statistics well all right doctor of philosophy develops philosophy doctor of philos all right well its is he and so on do you know anything about it oh yes hes betterbetter educated in terms of semester hours and so forth than practically anybody thats teaching in philosophy in universities today and didnt spend all his time in the back room of library but went out and studied various races of man and saw how their ethnical patterns fit together and saw how man was getting along and found there was common denominator to existence and applying this to known philosophy and developing new materials on the thing developed philosophy and its all very adventurous theres lot of amusing anecdotes that go with it but thats all the story you can make out of it well this reporter hehes tohoho hehes got to have some disturbance here hes got to get this thinghoho how do you make conflict out of it how do you get the wuhh and the rrr and how do these things go together with shwirr well we take point number one hes got to say well this fellow actually isnt educated he doesnt have any degrees hes never been anyplace and so on he actually never gets as far as saying it isnt philosophy because thats bit above his educational level see but he can try to find something wrong with the fellow who is doing this thing he can never really find anything wrong but he tries hard you see and he punches in all directions and he comes up with some interesting adjectives and so on but he really cant make the grade on the thing because his facts arent supported now as matter of fact people finding it interestinghe tries to say that people are hypnotized or they become unwilling victims or theyre dragged off into lairs you see or hes got to do something here to make this disturbing and sensational dont you see well thatsof course cant quite make the grade there but he tries he tries you see he leaves it works strictly alone he drops that like the cat dropped the hot chestnut because he knows it works theres not really any doubt in these peoples minds about any of these points you see theyre just desperately trying to make story out of this thing as far as people passing it along to others is concerned why the medico he thinks gee you know if they passed this stuff along here to others why this would be pretty grim because people would become happy and then what would happen to my income you see and that must be stopped so everybodys got to be hammered and pounded and so forth actually the biggest job of work which we do is trying to smooth it out so actually there are economic hardships or otherwise im working hard on that these days where abuses might exist but they immediately have to dream up word like cult see that bars everybody out because it makes it look like closed group see cult the cult of earththat makes just as much sense see hes an earthman so therefore he belongs to the earth cult see i mean it makes just as much sense you see but he works and sweats over this thing and he really cant get anyplace with this thing you know i noticed them sweating over this in the washington raid stories and so on they found the boxa message put into this box goes right to ron you knowthey found this box and my god they took more portraits of that thing i think i dont know what they did seemed very very terrible and unusual to them that communication line did exist there and it was very upsetting to them how they worked at it see well yet they couldnt do anything much about it and it grows and thats what alarms them saturday evening posts whole theme is how startled they were to find out that it had grown they thought it had all died away and they were all being very complacent about it and its the writer told this you see and everybody was quite relaxed about the whole thing and then all of sudden they found out that it had grown to enormous proportions and had kept on growing all through those years and it hadnt disappeared and it hadnt been just twentyfour hour fad and this was terrible and so forth and he became quite frothy about it he tries to find things now as far as scientology developing here or there some ridges and some upsets and so forth look at the planet its being released into you mean to say were responsible for the conduct of the planet well were not yet entirely responsible but well make it see you start releasing things to people and races and that sort of thing and here and there theres going to be little switch around and an upset or something like that but believe we have less of them than anybody else ever had and we straighten them out eventually we take care of these things well thats quite remarkable so there really isnt any real trouble for them to look at to make story out of this youd have to sock at each one of these points one way or the other you see and yet because there is story there of course they cant write the story because it doesnt fit into the modern press specifications there must be disturbance there must be upset people must be worried and people must have by reason of this story more disturbed environment than they had before nevertheless all things to the contrary the true story of scientology is simply doctor of philosophy developed philosophy people found it interesting people found it worked people passed it along to others and it grew well you could dream it up you could even make story out of it if it was sane press see you could say look nobody ever found these answers before there has never been one on this planet you could say lot of things of this particular character all of them equally true and very startling and well worth announcement but theres conflict in it so therefore the story of scientology goes true as an arrow and nobody really can do very much about it or do very much to it because they cant rough up its edges if you ever want to be completely crashed get in the road of truth now all disturbance and chaos folds up in the teeth of truth the duke of alba is dashing about losing battles left and right and talking about how horrible the enemy is and thehis troops and his government are getting very very upset hes aand his king is getting more and more discouraged and so forth and then one day the fatal shaft of truth cuts through this whole chaos hes been in the enemy pay all the time immediately everything sets back to rights again and the troop morale comes back and they go and they defeat the enemy and the king it works out at the end well thats dramatic incident with regard to truth but all truth whether dramatic or simple has the same effect dont ever try to stop truth thats the only thing that can go through sixteeninch armor plate this fellow is screaming and howling and raving around and hes cutting you up one side and down the other and if you know the mind you say the reason youre mad at is because you had withhold from concerning my paycheck two months ago watch him fold up if thats the truth dont watch him fold up if it isnt because he wont if its not the truth fellow named jones lives over here on the edge of saint hill he has been snapping and snarling and screaming and howling about what horrible things were liable to do to him at any minute and i wrote him letter not too long ago and i said if youll just carefully review the things which you have done to us that you think we dont know about youll feel much happier about us i havent had word since its just been tomb like silence interesting its interesting the clean blade of truth and it cant be stopped now in universe which is kept going and made very disturbed continuously by lies all the basic and fundamental facts of the universe had been completely covered up and particularly those related to life and death these things were completely masked and nothing but disturbance and chaos had been dug up around them for so long that that data was gone it wasnt just hard to find it was just gone in fact many datamany contrary data existed it was pretty hard to sift this stuff out and get toehold on to this sort of thing what is the truth about man what is he what kind of being is he who is he whats he doing whats he here for what am i here for what am i doing what am i trying to do what am i trying to get done how long have i lived whatll happen to when i die what kind of being am i anyhow these are the basic and fundamental questions those questions and answers theretoon the timehonored basis belonged in the realm of philosophy the answers to those things always have well philosophy had come to such decadence that i think in the west it mainly was somebody sitting around cracker barrel uttering witticisms and i think the last time anybody really came up with any really civilized philosophy of any kind or another they gave him nice slug of hemlock its not been very popular subject but it was only unpopular to this degree that it disturbed the merchants of chaos and these fellows that had trouble with this were only luckless to this degree that they didnt reach the truth they had limited truth and the road to truth is something that you must follow all the way down there is not such thing as limited truth youve got to go all the way when you start talking about the truth of life you mustnt hold up and not find out what it is but people set you the consistent and continual example when they say look philosophy is very dangerous stuff well yes it is very dangerous stuff to fellow whos supporting himself by lies whos it dangerous to its only dangerous to people who are dangerous its only dangerous to people who are dangerous to others well this gives us very interesting view when we start looking over the situation not that the story of scientology isnt rather remarkable one its actually unparalleled but its very simple its extremely simple and the goals and targets of philosophy are inevitable whether i said they were this or said they werent by the mere fact of people looking at this truth finding these things were true applying these things and achieving higher state of existence you would inevitably getwhether anybody said you would or nota calmer life calmer environment calmer civilization and there would be less disturbance and there would be less pay for disturbance to be bilked out of that civilization people would go uptone just on that basis alone therefore the first targetthe first target when one starts to introduce scientology to anybody would of course be that persons own environment his own environment not his mind but his environment and here is whole workedout philosophy now on the subject of the environment under the heading of the dangerous environment now if you scatter your own wits around in this thing you could at once extrapolate knowing as you know upper levelsyou could at once extrapolate the ramifications of well diagnosis and treatment you could dream up processes on just this basis this individual believes that the environment is more dangerous than he isthan it is he certainly believes this individual certainly believesthat the environment is too dangerous for him that were completely convinced of see its too dangerous for him there are zones and areas in that environment which he believes are completely overwhelming and that he will not be able to personally cope with this we can say with absolute certainty whether or not were talking to joe bill or pete or even politician or newspaper reporter or cop this individualthis individual would be able to agree with you on that basis unless of course he were completely insane hed be walking around in toga saying i am emperor of earth you see and all earth is subject to my orders you see and hed be in booby hatch someplace see hed be crazy he has of course got the final solution you just make up your mind youre dangerous enough and you wont worry anymore but falling short of that any relatively sane person that you can talk to will agree with you that the environment and certain spheres of the environment are bit too much for them im not by the way reviling the merchant of chaos hes completely crazy in that he thinks the environment has to be made chaotic i dont know why he thinks it needs his assistance but this fellow has his points and he thinks the environments too much for him and he certainly knows hes making the environment too much for others he certainly knows this so in talking to an individual we know that the environment is being made more dangerous for him or her than it is lord knows its dangerous enough and lord knows there are real areas of danger in this environment but also we know that there are areas of that environment being made more dangerous than they are see we know that point and that is one of the key points of scientology zero see one point is that thethat the environment seems dangerous to the individualyoull get an agreement on thisand that he is undertaking certain methods to hold the environment down and keep it from biting him we certainly know that and we also know due to the presence of people who have vested interest in this that the environment is being made more dangerous in certain areas than it actually is we know those things exist so therefore we can then say that the individual could be marched forward into some sectors or quarters of this environment with his own inspection in some way and perceive that the environment was being made more dangerous than it was now we can also see that and another operating principle of scientology zero is that the individuals health level sanity level activity level and ambition level are monitored by his concept of the dangerousness of the environment these various levels are monitored by his concept of the dangerousness of the environment now what have we got here we have factors out of which we could work well we have factors out of which we could draw up an improvement program for any human being rather quickly we could draw up an improvement program for any given human being one he considers his health and wellbeing and that sort of thing to an enormously greater degree this is the discovery the rest of this is just built up on this one discovery the discovery is that his health and wellbeing his sanity his ambition are monitored by how dangerous and overwhelming he believes his environment is that hes actually not operating to the challenge of the environment he is withdrawing from the threat of the environment to this degree now knowing that we could therefore improve these things in the individual without regard to his mind ah you see now were dealing with very interesting sphere here arent we weve mentioned this before under destimulation this previously has occupied just one little level in the auditor handling the pc he finds out where the pcs living is too restimulative for him tells him he wont process him again till he moves tells him he mustnt go home during the whole period of this next intensive but must stay downtown in hotel where hes less restimulated weve seen this around dont you see but now lets makelets make wholea whole banquet out of this tidbit see now were not explaining to this fellow anything about his mind were explaining to him about his environment we know were going to getit doesits minor amount but itll nevertheless be demonstrable amountwere going to get resurgence and betterment in the area of his health were going to get betterment in his physical and mental alertness and were going to get betterment here on his ambition his amount of activity and that sort of thing and if were working in this particular fieldwith scientology zerothen were actually not going to work with his mind do you see that were not going to work with his mind were going to take this as another entirely different sphere and activity well naturally thee and know that the reason he flinches every time he enters red room and so forth has to do with whole bunch of facsimiles hes developed on the subject of red rooms which are being firmly held in place by bunch of ris that have to do with this and that and the other thing we know this mental combination and in the absence of thatin that mental combination isnt eventually subtracted or knocked out and so on we know that his gain is limited but now lets talk within the real reality of the individual were talking to now what is his expectancy what is his expectancy at this level it may be this low that he just wont be so frightened when the doorbell rings you get awere talking now about very tiny improvement but nevertheless this improvement would be quite real to himbe enormously real and in the story of scientology what were butting up against here now is this one particular level threepeople find it works if people dont find it works that is the end of scientologys progress in that particular direction well this is an area of highlevel workability you see all the fellow has to do is study his environment little bit he doesnt even have to study his mind well this is very very good thing this is very easy one so were just going to get it that when he wakes up in the morning he doesnt have an agonizing feeling like something horrible is going to happen if he gets up you see this is going to not disappear perhaps but diminishthat he will be little more active in life now the funny part of it isi just tell youyou can settle for those gains but the gains you will actually get will in most cases if youre settling for those greatly exceed your expectations and greatly exceed his expectations these gains are adequate here to startle guys ears into thrumming quiver all right how do we go about this how would we use this material using these various principles well remember now that mostthe threat he is worried about is probably imaginary see its really not anything to be worried about lets embark upon simple therapy this is therapy at scientology zero dont read the newspapers for two weeks and see if you dont feel better of course he doesnt read the newspapers for two weeks of course hell feel better hell say fine now read it for week and youll feelfind youll feelat the end of that week why youll find you feel worse and after that time make up your mind whether or not you ought to pay any attention to the newspapers you could just lay this out as simple experiment you see well he can easily do that because its negative action its not expensive as matter of fact its slightly microscopically cheaper not to buy newspapers you see than to buy them so it isnt costly experiment at all thats in the direction of destimulation dont you see now thats all very well from his personal viewpoint you could actually tell him and here by the way you have the little junior cousin or the little gene that grows into all of the havingness processes later when properly placed in this position see just tell him to look around the environment and find something that isnt threat to him if he ever gets too upset or confused why just start looking around his environment and find something that isnt being threat to him thats magic process by the way and that is very smoothly worded that is far far more sophisticated in upperlevel scientology than it looks you could actually find what sort of threat he was experiencing at level two and run that as havingness process on negative see hes very worried that things are going to fall on him so you could dream it up on the basis of well look around here and find something that isnt going to fall on you you see and he would eventually gradually with great comm lag find one thing someplace and you must make him find the one thing you see that isnt going to fall on him he feels much better and he even has lesser gain than that he realizes if heif he just ran it to cognition that he has thought that everything was going to fall on him thats the cognition hes already told you this see but he now knows it by inspecting the environment thisunder the heading of this in processing is old take walk you feel bad go take walk and look at things as you walk well of course this is forward progress into the environment and the reason that works i can tell you now is the person finds out that the environment is not threatening this is whole positive education on the negative threat you understand what i mean positive education because he goes around and looks and see if something is doing this to him and of course if he finds out its negative threat this fellow is all in sweat on the subject of the chinese situation well of course you could arc break somebody and chop him up with this thing too by just negating and notising the whole situation you could say to him well what threat have the chinese ever been to you anyhow that youre so worried about now he has to protest and justify his own thinking he has to get himself all tangled up trying to prove hes right and youre wrong so of course that has workability at all but this is true but this you could do now in an upperlevel process youd run repetitive process something like well what event have you heard about that hasnt affected you much you could run that as repetitive process and youd get big gain but your effort at scientology zero is somehow or other to get the individual to inspect the environment and find out that there is some slight greater security in it thats all that doesnt sound like much but then im just dumping it on your heada complete wagonload of work on the subject of scientology zero i can give you the principles which i have just given you and those principles are very short and sweet and out of those principles you have to work with any individual as he walks up because hes got different environment than every other individual that walks up so youcant tell you too many processes to run with this individual you see what i mean i mean hes going to come up and hes going to tell you hes worried about different things i can only give you the principles by which you could get him to not worry about them quite so much but it has nothing to do with talking to him it isnt up to itsa at all it all runs on the single auditing command look dont worry look and find out if the environment is as threatening as it appears to be this is your single auditing approach to the thing individual is very worried hes sitting at his desk and so on papers are piling in everything seems to be going up in high uproar and he just feels completely overwhelmed well he himself ought to be able to look at the papers on his desk theyre the source of the threat arent they and find something about them that isnt threat the threat of course will balance out in the discovery that would be an action thats sort of take walk while sitting at the desk see person feels like everybody is hostile in the environment to them just say well now you findfind something people say or do around here that isnt hostile to you all on the gradient you see findis there one person in the organization who isnt actively hostile to you is there anything said today that wasnt directly and immediately hostile to you this could also be played in the direction of exaggeration but you get into mental things and so forth you get into mental responses when you go in this direction and move up in levels so you know what i mean by that you can get the exaggeration of it get the idea of chinese in every corner shooting at you with tong hatchets you know you can do all kinds of wild things and an auditor extrapolating and auditing somebody and so forth would undoubtedly go hog wild with it perfectly all right let him go do so i was running process the other dayjust on this basis just on readying up this material for scientology zeroand it was on the basis of look around here and find something that isnt trying to exteriorize you pc didnt find anything but had the cognition that she thought things were and was very happy about that did find two answers both the same answer im not trying to exteriorize you see this almost any inspection that you give it is valuable inspectionalmost any inspection for instance one of you right now sitting still or minding your own business or all by yourself could just think over carefully its very bad thing to get into what things in the environment do threaten now im nothahai dont advise you to go off in that particular line you see but sit down and figure out if theres anything that isnt threat to you fellow who has ptp or something like that usually cant get his mind disentangled from it very far but is there anything around that isnt pushing this ptp at methats an interesting question sometimes takes you few minutes to get the thing answered the guy who has just lost his girlhe just lost his girl and he feels the horrible sadness and loss and so forth it imparts to everything actually everything in the environment will talk to him about this girl you possibly have had similar experience here somebody justyou think of somebodys name and so on you can remember time when there was moment or few moments or period of time in which it was impossible for you to look around and not be reminded of this person just uhhnn that was personless environment when ones concentration has been very very heavy on an individual or person it is sometimes almost heroically difficult to not associate everything with that person well the trick is to find something of course that isnt reminding you of that person you might have to search long way this is how to recover from love affair this is little bonus could have used it myself few times in the last few trillennia but the situation is in actual fact simple one the individual has identified everything in the environment with his unrest everything in the environment has become identified with the threatening things in the environment and the individual cant pull his attention off of these things but by indicating things in the environment even quite simply and by directing anybodys attention to things which are not so connected making the individual find things which are not actively reminding one you get differentiation going where an identification existed before and where differentiation exists intelligence and judgment can return intelligence and judgment cannot exist in the face of an identification but can exist in the face of differentiation so this opens the door pretty wide now the funny part of this is that an individual oddly enough usually finds data more workable that he can work on others than data which is being worked on him unless he also has the opportunity to work it upon others youll find this as truth when teaching pe courses or even small groups of people or even an individual that if you give him something he can use to help others its an interesting commentary on the actual character of man man is basically good if you can give him things which will help him help others hell be far more interested than if youre simply giving him things which help him and therefore in pes and that sort of thing and in teaching the individual or in any booklets laying out this material and so forth your supplementary advice in the matter should always go on the basis of who are you trying to help who are you trying to help find that their environment is not as dangerous as they think it is this is so true that many of the questions you get in pe are from an individualare the hypothetical question which is in reverse to the doctors question the doctors patients are always asking them for friend friend has this trouble and what would be your advice that i could give my friend when its the person himself that has this trouble you see the medicos always running into this that way well scientologist always runs into itnot being in the same profession and more honest one which is quite different quite different and in actual fact the individual will ask for himself because he wants it to help somebody else one of the things that plagues an instructor is thathis questions he is being asked are very frequently simply being asked by student so that this student then will make sure that some other student knows now the question is being asked for the benefit of another student or other students quite interesting now thats true of all such wisdoms so this scientology zero has to be pretty darn well understood by you in order to pass it along to joe so he can help pete because he will actually go help pete with it find out that it works to some degree and use it to help himself and quite often that is the cycle it goes into not he uses it to help himself dont you see and then goes helps pete its got flipflop type of cycle that is to say he helps pete with it and then finds out that it helps pete little bit so he takes some of the advice himself its quite remarkable but that factor enters in particularly at this level of scientology zero now take walk and look at things is just the mildest mildest mildest advice that you could possibly give anybody that is almost certain to produce result if the person will do it its quite aits quite an interesting process there is nothing very dangerous about it of course an oldtimer like myself i mean i gave myself this advice one time up at 250 old brompton road several sections of the sky had fallen in that day and there were considerable amounts of tumult and turmoil going on and so on and i decided that it was just all too much so i decided i would take my own advice and go out and take walk so i proceeded to do so and because i told people to look at things so on i went around old brompton road district up there in london and i was busy looking at things and of course i looked at them real good and this intrigued very much and i found out by the process of looking at things and then putting tension on the beam with which i was looking at them well i could pull myself forward and i didnt have to walk and this became very intriguing to and skidding my heels along the pavement and so on and i became quite cheerful about the whole thing till i noticed cop on the corner regarding with some shook confidence it did little bit almost pulled meself out of the body that way anyway did lot of good cheered up enormously but theres theres level of action dont you see theres level of activity level of something or other now that was about 1956 or something like that the only earlier one i had that could produce the same result was go out and clip hedges and you know you can only trim hedge so often you run out of hedges its quite effective its quite effective now the master question is what part of the environment isnt threatening youre basing this on the identificationthe individuals identification of everything that is your master question isntits negative because he has everything identified with that part of the environment which is threatening well you get him to differentiate and find out there are some parts of the environment that arent threatening and hell make some considerable forward progress then the individual can also arrange his life somewhat and its funny thing that by making an individual plan life by which he could live calmly and unthreatened that the life he is living becomes less threatening well this even applies to some guy whos on thepoor fellow whos on the complete treadmill he has to keep this job it doesnt pay very much money hes got to stay there theres chance of his getting off of it and so forth and he finds that environment very hostile well hes sort of in trap isnt he hes in sort of box all of his own making you get him to planwe dont care how wildly he plans it or how he dreams it but just get him to plan life which would not be so threatening and he will go on working at the job he is working at much more happily and much calmer now when you move this up then in scientology one and you start introducing communication factors and show him how to communicate to people and so on they find they can produce an effect upon people and people cease to be as threatening and these things all tend to multiply on up the line and if you keep havingness alive as you go on up the levels of scientologyi mean you keep havingness in mind and dont drop it out of view completely and forever you really never cease to lose totally the benefit that is started there at scientology zero the environment isnt as threatening people are looking for less threatening environment or knowing mostly that they cant escape to that looking for way to be more enduring in the environment theyre in thats what people are looking for its twoway look theyd love to be able to get out or theyd love to be able to master but they dont think they can to large degree they know they cant get out very far and it wouldnt do any good and nobody has ever been givenable to give them anything by which they could exert much more influence on their environment than before and those are the basic goals and targets of the individual there are more complicated goals and targets than that that are completely general to every individual there is any thetan has these things in other words not to have to stand up to the type of threatening environment hes in or be more enduring or dominant of the environment he finds himself in so that it is less threateningthese are your basic ptps of thetan that have been with that thetan ever since hes been coming on up the universe and of course being fairly nice bloke he has actually been looking for something he could help other people be less intimidated or less fixed in their environment so they could get out of it or so that they could endure or dominate their environment better hes also been looking for something to help his friends hes never really completely forgotten those even the drunk on skid row never forgets that even the bum in j ail never forgets that these fellows then are actually trying to help others and what you need is level of help which requires practically education at all or the education which it is receiving of course is destimulation of the environment anyway just discussion of the situation now thats whats required theres auditing skill required there theres nothing required there and yet theres potential betterment this will become real to the individual matter how crudely it is put to him just the concept all by itself that he considers the environment dangerous and overwhelming and that he doesnt quite know where that danger or overwhelm is coming from that concept alone is an enormous piece of wisdom see that is just square mile of wisdom dumped right on his head its never occurred to him before he says its true he never thought of it he never thought of it for himself or anything else hes just felt it and was it all the time and what youve actually defined is what he was this is his isness quailing back from very threatening environment that may overwhelm him at any moment unable to progress forward into greater endurance or power that can handle that threatening environment this is his life you have told him the story of his life in just those few words dont you see well if you take it out from there and you actually provide therapy well you say knock off some of those things in your life that make you upset why thats good solid advice see who upsets you well dont talk to them for while i mean this is crude see what activities leave you feeling worse and so forth well just dont do them for while what things in the environment arent really threat to you all right you got some of those all right fine associate with those pay more attention to them you know youre liable to shoot that persons iq up fifteen twenty points youre liable to snap him around and get him out of the wheelchair and so forth just with more wisdom than this little package that youve had in this last hour and half so what we needed was something that was very very pervasive something very simple and something that would go forward that had auditor connected with it at all it only had teacher connected with it and given that and the developments which you can develop out of that and which i will undoubtedly write and develop out of that why we have pushed whole new philosophy under the tremendous structure of scientology it took lot of doing looks very simple now that its done isnt it but i had to think of how do i think up whole field of philosophy that has whole bodies of truth in it that are an introduction to the man in the street the person who knows nothingyou havent any time to teach him anythingthat he will immediately see the truth of that requires auditing that requires nothing about the mind in connection with it at all it was quite specification but there it is and i hope its some help to you thank you very much
