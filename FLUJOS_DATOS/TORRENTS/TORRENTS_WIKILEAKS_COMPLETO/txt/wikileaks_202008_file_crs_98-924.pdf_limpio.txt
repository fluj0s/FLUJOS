commercial interests has waxed and waned throughout the 1990s as increasing demands havebeen placed on the us budget constituent support for more traditional foreign aid has dwindled and us industries have increasingly sought federal assistance ingarnering foreign sales the trade and development agency tda operatingsince 1982 is one of several government agencies involved in aid for tradeprograms that combine development assistance and export promotion the agencyprovides grants directly to foreign countries enabling them to hire us companiesto conduct feasibility studies for incountry capital projects since several othercountries provide this type of assistance many believe the united states should also in order for us businesses to remain competitive with foreign businesses in hostcountries the trade and development agency s been viewed quite favorably by many policymakers as relatively inexpensive tool to promote us exports andemployment while keeping the united states relevant to the economic development of middleincome developing countries ho wever the program has also encountered criticism from members who view it as fo rm of corporate welfare and by those who oppose foreign aid generally tdas primary activities include funding feasibility studies overseas and definitional missions to assess the merits of funding feasibility study projectother activities include technical assistance grants orientation visits technicalsymposia training grants to multilateral development banks to hire us consultantsas well as grants to state and local entities like the national association of statedevelopment agencies nasda although funding increased nearly tenfo ld from fy1982 to its peak in fy1994 when congress appropriated 65 million tdas budget remained modest whencompared to most other agencies even at the time of its peak funding many tda proponents believed the request was still inadequate to fully utilize the agency andsupport its many potential projects others concerned with budget reductionoverlap and duplication among government agencies believed that aid for tradeagencies and offices could be consolidated or better coordinated additionally there were other matters associated with tda such as whether there was large company bias in the agencys activities and whether us tax dollars should assist corporations with ample resources of their own for expor t development despite the controversy congress appropriated 65 million for tda in fy1994 for comparison on october 20 1999 congress passed the omnibus appropriations

has been viewed quite favorably by manypolicymakers as relatively inexpensive tool to promote us exports andemployment while offering aid to middleincome developing countries othersopposed the concept as form of cooperate welfare and raised specific issuesabout tdas cost and effectiveness as members addressed appropriations for foreignaid and export promotion agencies and programs in the late 1990s however arguments against the aid for trade concept tda and its mission have tended todecline tda acquired increased attention after the end of the cold war as security and political arguments for supporting us foreign assistance weakened debate over setting new foreign aid agenda emerged which included the argument thatamerican foreign assistance in addition to promoting development overseas could also be used as tool that would benefit us businesses interest in tda intensified in the early 1990s as the us budget became increasingly strained constituentsupport for foreign aid dwindled and us industries sought help to sustain their international competitiveness some in congress and in the export communityadvocated strengthening of tda and other aid for trade activities of the

appropriations h ouse of representatives report 105719 pp6 7some of these functions or consolidation into one agency would improve effectiveness while reducing budgetary costs in the past particularly in the early 1990s some members supported merging other aid for trade agencies into tda and greatly expanding its funding levelsproponents argued that eliminating aid for trade activities in less active officessuch as usaids office of capital projects would result in greater budgetarysavings without loss in policy effectiveness others contended that tda wasefficient effective and flexible they f eared that consolidating these agencies into single entity would create inefficiencies that did not exist in tda political support for tda peaked about 1994 since then congress generally has been less enthusiastic about aid for trade programs tdas fy1998 core budget is similar to that prevailing in the early 1990s despite tdas expandingactivities in new countries tda has incr eased the number of its programs from 307 in 1993 to 390 in 1997 tda also conducted more activities in latin america asiaand africa in 1997 than in previous year s the fy1999 administration request for 50 million took into account tdas crucial involvement in number of middleincome developing country infrastructure projects congress enacted 44 millionrather than the requested 50 million because of limited budgetary

provided by the us governmentmaximize the reciprocal benefits of us foreign assistance4 tda specific mission for fy1999 is to ssist in the creation of jobs for americans by helping us companies pursue overseas business opportunities5 according to the director of tda in 1998 j joseph grandmaison the total volume of us exports associated with tda activities since its inception in 1982 hasgrown to about 10 billion to 115 billion in march 1998 congressional testimonyhe claimed that every dollar tda invest s in 1998 on behalf of american exporters results in 33 in us exports up from 30 in exports per dollar invested in 1997 6 he also pointed out that during 1997 tda funded 390 activities in 65 countries which helped american companies establish themselves in variety of projects inemerging markets 7 similar capital project activities conducted by usaid on the other hand may generate less than one dolla r for every dollar invested since usaid selects capital projects to meet the host countrys development needs rather thanprojects with the greatest potential return for us businesses 8 origin and evolution of the program the idea of reimbursable government services to foreign countries9 linking the us private sector with development activities dates back to the mutual securityact of 1954 later the policy was reauthor ized in section 607a of the foreign assistance act of 1961 in 1974 congress added section 661 to the foreignassistance act of 1961 as amended it provided authority to promote the use ofus government reimbursable services that would be paid for by foreign countries the foreign assistance act designated us aid as the agency responsible for implementing both section 607aputting fo reign governments in touch with us government agencies for reimbursable servicesand section 661funding planning studies which would lead to the use of ch services the two activities were housed in usaids office of reimbursable development programs directly under theadministrator according to usaid because of congressional initiative in theearly 1970s that shifted aid program emphasis to basic human needs and small scalepoverty projects and away from promo tion of the private sector usaidshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98924crs4 10tied aid is foreign assistance that is linked with requirement that the recipient country purchase us goods and services with the assistanceexpenditures for activities linking us businesses to development in 1976 and 1977 fell to only about 1 million annually by the end of the 1970s however there was growing sense in congress that the us private sector should be more active in development programs in 1978congress directed usaid to increase empha sis on us private sector involvement in development assistance by march 1979 usaid issued new guidelinesfacilitating the involvement of the us pr ivate sector in development from the earliest planning stages of the projects through implementation in july 1980 to further underscore the link between private sector and us development activities usaids office of reimbursable development programswas made part of the international development cooperation agency idca anewly created umbrella agency tasked with coordinating us developmentassistance programs and was renamed th trade and development program tdp independent from usaid by delegation of authority tdp received separate line item authorization and appropriation in 1982 pursuant to section 661 of the foreign assistance act congress further strengthened tdps autonomy with passage of the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 pl100418 which made tdp anindependent agency and required the tdp di rector to be appointed by the president it established tdp as the primary federal agency providing information to the privatesector regarding trade and development and export promotion the 1988 act further transferred to tdp the usaid tied aid 10 responsibilities directed by the trade expansion act of 1983 it also expanded tdp activities to include education and training programs and required that tdp be represented and vote at meetings ofthe national advisory council on international monetary and financial policieswhenever tied aid issues were discussed additionally the omnibus trade actrequired the director of tdp to establish an advisory board which must includerepresentatives from the private sector to make recommendations to the directorregarding tdp activities in december 1992 congress enacted the jobs through export act that renamed tdp the trade and development agency tda lawmakers supported the name change to clarify and emphasize that tda is an independent agency and increase its visibility as the primary federal ag ency promoting private sector trade development in middleincome developing countries in addition the act requiredannual independent audits of tdas financial statements and increased tdasspending authority to 65 million annually beginning in fy1994 funding history although tda funding has increased dramatically since 1982 it remains one of the smaller foreign aid programs despite growing foreign aid budget constraintsbeginning in 1985 however tda appropr iations have grown steadily the administration requested 60 million for fy1994a 50 percent increase over thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98924crs5 11meeting with jonathan raymond director of

would not be able to fund all project re quests received even with the additional resources11 for fy1999 tda requested an in crease to 50 million but received 44 million 25 million above the previous years level of 415 million and wellbelow the fy1994 peak of 65 million the agency points out that since 1993 the number of projects has expanded by 27 while the agencys core budget hasdeclined by 32

thecountry may continue to employ that comp any years after the initial project because of familiarity with the company name staff and quality of work also often large companies win the contracts but

to inform us businesses about tda and explain how they can participate in its programs for that tda began to inter act with the national association of state development agencies nasda to inform businesses of export opportunities at the local level generally what tda has shared with nasda is the following activity path 1host government contacts tda with prospective project or us company

1997 source tda issues for congress over the years policymakers attitudes on us foreign aid have changed in the 1960s and 1970s many supported us foreign assistance for security and foreign policy reasons with the continuation of the cold war throughout the 1980s the reagan administration shifted the focus of foreign assistance away fromgovernmenttogovernment assistance and toward fostering growth of the privatesector in developing countries in th 1990s foreign aid advocates have been looking for new rationale nd purpose of us foreign ssistance in the absence of the threat of communism foreign aid activity that promotes us businesses indevelopment programs is one of several new purposes that has received support and is under consideration tdas role in an expanded us government exportpromotion initiative is also under review by the clinton administration in recent years some members of congr ess supported the aid for trade concept as conducted by tda and other agencies congressional debate has focused not on whether to conduct aid for trade projects but rather how much should beappropriated and under what agencies congress has focused on two overridingissues concerning the trade and developmen t agency 1 the optimal funding level and 2 the designated responsibilities of the agency and the related issue of possible overlap of responsibilities with other agencies additionally policymakers haveexamined other matters associated with t da and its activities such as whether tda was an aid or export promotion agency whether there was companysize bias in tda activities and whether us tax dollars should assist large corporationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98924crs13 18source telephone conversati on with monique roske legislative representative coalition for

1997 annual report p 8 should the us government intervene in the markets currently some members question whether the us government should even intervene in the markets at all they f eel that the us government should abstain from assisting the business community in meeting the demands of the globalmarketplace on grounds that such interven tion skews the marketplace if the overseas activity were worth doing they say the businesses should take it uponthemselves to do it if it is not worth doing the us government should not beinvolved in it the us business community on the othe r hand points out that it faces highly competitive markets where foreign competitors such as european and japanesecompanies enjoy the full backing and support of their respective governments manymembers of congress maintain that th competitiveness of great number of international businesses and thus the us economy depends on the quality ofproject financing and therefore that the role played by tda is essential 18 is there bias involving company size some have claimed that tda has rgecompany bias since tda provides grants directly to foreign governments it is the host country that selects uscompanies to conduct feasibility studies as result us companies do not receiveany taxpayer dollars directly from tda thus there is direct us government action showing bias toward larger compan ies involved in tda activities however there may be some bias in favor of larger betterknown companies on the part of thehost country because they may be more comfortable with large or wellknowncompany also the larger companies can afford the money staff and paper workinvolved in marketing themselves to the host country and are more able to have staff in washington dc who are familiar with procedures and potential projectslarge firms also are better equipped with staff and resources to be more competitivein bidding especially on engineering and large construction projects small businesses can benefit whenever they have particular expertise specialty skill knowledge of region or culture in the world or have developed particular niche in the market in many cases larg businesses that win contracts subcontract some of the work to smaller businesses furthermore small and minorityownedbusinesses do all definitional missions according to tda officials large number of feasibility studies have been conducted by small firms as well according to agency data onethird of tdas program budget has gone tosmall firms tda has also sponsored conf erences and orientation visits which have been beneficial to small business 19 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98924crs14 should us tax dollars assist large corporations some have questioned whether it is really necessary to provide american tax dollars to multibillion dollar corporations to develop foreign markets theymaintain that if the foreign market were profitable the companies would beconducting these activities on their own am erican companies should be just as competitive as their foreign counterparts they argue without government assistance on the other hand supporters argue that at least until recently many us companies have not had as much experien ce and history in bidding on foreign capital projects since they traditionally have concen trated their business in the us market other competitor country governments moreover have funded feasibility studies asa normal way of obtaining foreign contracts for their national firms supporters of tda argue that us companies would be at disadvantage if the united states were to withdraw from this activity some trad experts believe that if the united states wants to remain competitive in the worl d and in these fastgrowing middleincome markets it must offer similar grants to host countries moreover they say ustaxpayers would benefit with subseque nt increase in domestic employment and economic activity as tda projects would promote us exports however critics of us government activities linking us businesses to development assistance programs assert th at large and small companies alike seem to want to be spoon fed it has been observed that often once government funds dry up the companies seem to drop their promotional activities in particularcountry this suggests to critics that t da funds are supporting projects that are not really commercially viable furthermore critics of tda contend that the agency lacks technical development and engineering expertise saying that often projects are approvedwithout adequate technical review as result businesses might be able to overpriceestimates for feasibility studies or might recommend project when it may not be sound technically developmentally or economically tda needs to have thetechnical expertise to know ifwhen ove rpricing occurs or unsound projects are considered critics claim if taxpayer dollars are to be spent to promote us businessactivity overseas another idea raised by some is that private enterprises benefitting from governmentfunded tda activities should return some of the tda grant if the company wins followon contracts according to those who espouse this conceptsuch rebates to tda could be placed in revolving fund to reduce the size of futuretda appropriations and to deflect criticism that larg businesses are receiving subsidy from american taxpayershttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98924 crs15
