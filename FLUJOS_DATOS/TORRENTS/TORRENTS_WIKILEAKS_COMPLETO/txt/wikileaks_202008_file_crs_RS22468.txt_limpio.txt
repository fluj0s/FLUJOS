economic nationalism or economic patriotism by the press is on corporate control particularly in the banking steel and energy sectors unlike in the 1980s when the main opposition to creation of the

state governments and or politicians fearful of losing national prestige and jobs as result of merger activity this report examines the nature and significance of rising economic nationalism as well as how us interests may be affected the report will be updated as events warrant the single market todays european union had its beginnings in 1957 with the creation of the european economic community eec the economic core of the eec called for the free movement of goods capital services and people among its original members france germany italy belgium the netherlands and luxembourg1 during its first two decades considerable progress was made in eliminating tariffs and quotas on trade in goods among its members much less progress was made in freeing up the movement of services capital and people for example service sectors such as telecommunications rail transport banking and medicine remained largely divided along national lines trips from one country to another required frequent passport checks changes of money and customs inspections slowing commerce and travel considerably member states also maintained controls on capital flows as tools of national economic policy2 1 the eec later became simply the european community ec and even later the european union for discussion of the evolution of the eu see crs report rs21372 the european union questions and answers by kristin archick 2 john van oudenaren uniting europe an introduction to the european union rowman littlefield 2005 pp 119120 crs2 in support of the creation of single european market where goods services capital and people could cross borders freely member states enacted in 1987 the single european act sea which made completion by 1992 of an open and free european market top priority to facilitate achieving this objective the member states agreed to pass single market legislation by qualified majority rather than by unanimous vote while substantial progress was achieved by 1992 the process is still ongoing3 for the eu to overcome remaining barriers it is necessary for the european commission in brussels to propose eulevel directives or laws these directives in turn have to be adopted by the council of ministers and implemented in non discriminatory fashion by each member state through this cumbersome and complicated legislative process directives governing the free movement of capital labor and services have taken more than decade to be crafted and implemented in terms of capital market liberalization the directives affecting mergers and takeovers were substantially watered down resulting in limited market liberalization barriers to crossborder mergers httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22468 since the summer of 2005 number of eu member states have erected barriers to prevent crossborder mergers and acquisitions that undermine the effort to deepen the single market these include new antitakeover laws politically engineered corporate mergers of domestic firms and populist appeals to national security or economic patriotism some in the media and representatives of the european commission in brussels have claimed that these actions are evidence of resurgent economic nationalism in europe the most prominent and recent of these actions occurred in france the government orchestrated quick merger of two utilities publicly traded suez sa french utility and statecontrolled gaz france gdf to fend off potential takeover by enel of italy passed new decree giving the government the right to veto or impose conditions on foreign takeovers in 11 sensitive sectors and expressed concerns about the prospect that pepsico was interested in buying the french yogurt giant groupe danone in june 2006 french president jacques chirac stated that as matter of principle he was against the proposed merger of the new york and euronext stock exchanges4 italy italian politicians from both major political coalitions advocated blocking french bids for italian companies in retaliation for frances treatment of enel and italys central bank blocked the acquisition of various italian banks by european rivals spain the spanish government is attempting to prevent hostile takeover of its gas utility endesa sa by the german electricity and gas utility on and has stated that madrid will do everything in its power to ensure that spains energy companies remain

mittal an indian steel maker from takeover of the european conglomerate arcelor company formed in 2002 from three european firms based in luxembourg spain and france and germany the government has clashed with the european commission over volkswagen law which protects volkswagen from hostile bids european commission reaction actions that discourage foreign companies from bidding for firms which are regarded as strategic or national champions present the eu with significant challenge in its efforts to enforce the principle of the free movement of capital6 several eu officials have weighed into the public debate to warn about the dangers of resurgent economic nationalism in certain member states eu competition commissioner neelie kroes threatened to break up the eu energy giants in order to open the market for greater httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22468 competition while internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy said he refused to turn blind eye to recent moves to defend national champions from foreign takeovers while neither questioned the principle of the mergers both warned that protectionism in principle and in practice was contrary to community law commission president jose manuel barroso has gone further by arguing that member state even the biggest member state can go it alone economic nationalism was never the solution and is even less so today7 in the spring of 2006 the commission initiated number of actions to counter the rise of economic nationalism these included request to the european court of justice to rule on polands attempt to block an italian lender from acquiring stake in polish bank request to the italian government to comply with june 2005 ruling by the european court on investment in italian energy companies similar request to the spanish government to comply with the courts ruling over similar restrictions on foreign investment in spanish energy companies and request to france to justify its 2005 foreign investment decree affecting foreign investment in strategic sectors8 in reality eu regulators lack sufficient powers to force countries to abide by various treaties intended to encourage competition and single european market under competition policy rules the commission can examine whether statesponsored mergers unduly impede competition and if necessary impose conditions on such mergers that 5 financial times do

the merged company the european competition rules however provide for such an investigation only if one of the merged companies accounts for less than twothirds of its sales in the domestic market and under the current eu takeover directive the eu commission intervenes only if protective measures imposed by the government against foreign investors violate eu rules such as the principle of the free movement of capital9 the takeover directive also contains exemptions and leeway for member states to adopt various kinds of antitakeover defenses10 filing lawsuits against rulebreaking member states in the european court of justice in luxembourg can take years to resolve and may not guarantee results that are consistent with single market11 in addition when the european commission files lawsuits against member states in the european court it risks igniting nationalistic or antibrussels sympathies12 significance of resurgent economic nationalism there are at least two perspectives on the significance of the resurgence of economic nationalism one view which is more optimistic interprets the resurgence as reflection of how far the single market today has advanced particularly as the blocking of mergers httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22468 remains one of the few areas left for national authorities to play an interventionist role in world where markets are increasingly global second view which is more pessimistic interprets the resurgence as part of larger pressures and developments that have put support for trade liberalization as well as support for strong europe on the defensive optimistic perspective this view sees the rise of government interventions primarily as sign of how far liberalization of markets and the single market have advanced as europewide obligations have increasingly narrowed the scope for national authorities to impose barriers on intraeu trade in goods services and people issues of corporate control are viewed as one last area where national authorities still wield some power13 thus it can be argued that recent actions to stop foreign takeovers represent the end of the battle not the beginning unlike in the 1980s when the main opposition to the creation of single market came from companies resistant to being exposed to more international competition the main opposition today comes from national governments and politicians fearful of losing national prestige and jobs as result of merger activity from this perspective with many of the larger and older members of the eu experiencing high unemployment and slow growth backlash against policy changes that encourage more competition and 9 stephan schonberg europes new protectionism the international economy spring 2006 p 48 10 oxford analytica daily brief european union diluted

response to liberalisation march 8 2006 13 jacoby mary eus kroes rejects talk of protectionist battle wall street journal march 30 2006 crs5 corporate restructuring should not be unexpected these observers maintain that as firms begin to develop europewide ambitions especially in three fragmented industries telecommunications banking and energy the momentum behind eu liberalization policy will further erode the capacity and willingness of governments to pursue economically nationalistic policies14 it is also emphasized that the resurgence of economic nationalism has emerged while europe is experiencing wave of mergers the value of crossborder mergers involving eubased firms as bidder and target in 2005 was the highest since the 1999 2000 internet boom whatever the tendency towards protectionism the vast majority of merger activity evidently is taking place without much public or political controversy15 the optimistic view asserts that even some of the controversial mergers are being settled in manner consistent with free market principles despite the early objections of the governments of luxembourg and france mittal and arcelor agreed in june 2006 to merger creating the worlds largest steel group this outcome was trumpeted by the financial times as victory over economic protectionism or patriotism peddled by some continental european politicians16 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22468 pessimistic perspective an alternative and more pessimistic perspective holds that antimerger actions are symptomatic of deeper process where progress on economic integration and completing the single market is slowing down these actions are viewed not only as at odds with the eus founding principles of common market that binds the countries together but also raise doubts over whether some member states have different vision of europe where national interests take precedence over european interests some data do show that progress on implementing the single market is slowing while many of the newer members are implementing single market directives in an exemplary manner some of the older members are lagging in this regard beyond implementation lapses there is plenty of scope for member states to shirk euwide obligations as an increasing number of infringement cases seems to suggest moreover in difficult economic times the temptation for some governments to go down the nationalistic path seems to be increasing rather than decreasing17 intertwined with the upsurge in economic nationalism is the notion that the nationality of ownership matters thus the merger of two french or polish firms is acceptable but the takeover of french or polish firm by an italian or german firm is not while this notion may not contradict eu law or obligations per it certainly contradicts the spirit the eu embodies the notion that countries are better off when they share sovereignty and that nationality should not matter in the single market but some 14 oxford analytica daily brief march 8 2006 15 oxford analytica daily brief european union ma recovering despite protectionism september 16 2005 16 financial times mittaleuropa steel june 27 2006 p 14 17 oxford analytica daily brief march 8 2006 crs6 countries or populist political leaders now appear more determined to defend sovereignty than cede powers to europe18 the commission has long had to battle member states on such issues but it has become less willing to do so recently after voters in france and the netherlands last year rejected common eu constitution casting doubt on french and dutch willingness to accept direction from eu institutions in brussels accordingly some observers maintain that member states are ganging up on brussels because it has lost some of its legitimacy19 although protectionism has always been present in the eu commentators assert that what makes todays developments most striking is the way some governments particularly france and poland present it in positive light without even mentioning eu treaty obligations as dominique villepin frances prime minister stated in july 2005 when the world is changing it is question of gathering our strengths and defending france and other things french lech kaczynski the populist polish president put it even more bluntly by stating that what interests the poles is the future of poland and not that of the eu20 number of polls show that the general public is becoming more skeptical about europe as well httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22468 impact on us interests the united states and the eu share huge and mutually beneficial economic partnership as the largest bilateral trade and investment relationship in the world actions by either economic superpower can have important economic and political repercussions not only for each other but also the rest of the world if antiforeign merger actions escalate in europe the united states could have number of concerns perhaps most importantly resurgent protectionism could aggravate europes economic problems and lead to lower economic growth rates in the process us exports to and investments in europe could be curtailed resurgent economic nationalism that discriminates against us companies could also provoke the united states as well as other countries to retaliate in response such reaction could undermine the mutual economic benefits including millions of jobs that are derived from the robust twoway flow of foreign trade and investment it could also hurt eu efforts to play constructive foreign policy role particularly in calling on other countries to open their markets and in bringing the doha round of multilateral trade negotiations to successful conclusion while these are all legitimate concerns the eus market opening activities still appear more powerful than the limited antimerger actions of some governments on balance these antimerger actions have had limited economic and political effects to date 18 economist
