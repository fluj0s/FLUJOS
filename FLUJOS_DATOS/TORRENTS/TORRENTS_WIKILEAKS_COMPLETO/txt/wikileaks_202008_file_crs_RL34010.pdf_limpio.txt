is likely that csp payments will be notified as green boxcompliant environmental program paym ents under paragraph 12 of annex ii inclusion under paragraph 12 hinges on the payments being limited to the cost of expenses incurred or income forgone in implementing conservation practices csp costshare payments fit this requirement howeve r other csp payments either made in excess of costs incurred or income forgone or made in th nature of bonus or incentive payments to induce participation are mo re difficult to classify the conservation reserve program crp compensates producers for removing environmentally sensitive privately owned land from production for 10 years or more to conserve soil and water resources the crp is the federal governments largest conservation and pr ivate land retirement program in fy2006 crp outlays totaled 18 billion and covere d almost 37 million enrolled acres crp payments for the period 1996 through 2001 have been notified to the wto as green box compliant longterm resource retirement payments under paragraph 10 of annex ii inclusion under paragraph 10 hinges on the payments being used to retire land from marketable agricultural production for at least three years use of crp land for agricultural production eg cutting gr azing or biomass production potentially could disqualify the land from green box eligibility for that particular year and potentially for all years of longterm re tirement contract if the productive activity is engaged in more frequently than once every four years potential alternative would be to reclassify the

current usda implementation rules for c sp are consistent w ith paragraph 12 of annex ii of the agriculture agreement aa also questions have been raised about whether the allowance of harvesting and grazing on crp land as well as the proposed use of crp land for biomass pr oduction would be consistent with reading of paragraph 10 of annex ii of the aa both csp and the crp are likely to remain important policy tools in the next farm bill yet certain aspects of both pr ograms potentially are ambiguous or fall into gray zones concerning their compliance with wto rules this report is not legal opinion but describes both the csp nd crp programs the wto annex ii socalled green box provisions that g overn compliance and the potential issues involved in evaluating the complian ce status of the two programs conservation security program csp payments the conservation security program au thorized in the 2002 farm bill pl 107171 is voluntary program that provide s financial and technical assistance to promote conservation and impr ovement of natural resources on tribal and private working lands within selected watersheds1 csp is administered by usdas natural resources conservation service nrcs unlike the conservation reserve program and some other nrcs prog rams csp provides payments for conservation on land that remains in production nrcs implements csp on wa tershed basis in order to focus funding on highpriority areas that offer the greatest environmental impact per dollar spent in fy2006 usda spent 259 million supporting 19375 new and existing csp contracts 4400 new csp cont racts were added in fy2006 covering 158 million acres an average ou tlay of about 1640 per acre based on review done with techni cal support fro m nrcs of producers environmental resources and current c onservation practices each participating producer prepares csp contract including stewardship plan that details the conservation activities that exist andor are to be implemented contracts extendhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34010crs2 from 5 to 10 years by statute sec tion 2001 of the 2002 farm bill pl107171 csp participants qualify for one of three levels or tiers of participation with each successive tier obligating the producer to meet higher degree of resource management standards pending on the stewardship plan described in csp contract participating produ cers may be eligible for four types of payments stewardship or base payments costshare payments on existing practices onetime new practice costshare payments and nhanced payments these are defined as follows stewardship or base payment this is payment tied to the number of acres enrolled in csp it is calculate d separately for each land use by multiplying 1 the stewardship payment rate blished for the watershed based on 2001 national rental rates by land use category times 2 the number of acres times 3 the tier factor times 4 the tier reduction factor see table 1 the reduction factor was not part of the authorizing legisla tion but was implemented by usda to provide broader distribution of limited funding to ward targeted activ ities and conservation benefits in addition to the reduction fact or the stewardship payment is subject to an annual cap by tier table 1 stewardship payment formulation tieraverage land rental rate acres enrolledtier factorreduction factor i payment rate x of acres x 005 x 025 ii payment rate x of acres x 010 x 050 iii payment rate x of acres x 015 x 075 annual costshare pa yments for existing practices onetime costshare payment for new practices usda and the participating producer each share portion of the specific costs incurred or income forgone in meeting particular tiers contract obligations the farm bill restricts payments for new and existing practices to not more than 75 of the practice cost this rises to 90 for beginning farmers and ranchers howe ver in practice usda has restricted payments to substantially smaller share of implementation costs in an attempt to facilitate their calculation and minimize pr oducer paperwork for example under fy2006 contracts existing practice payments were calculated at flat rate of 25 of the stewardship payment and new practi ce payments were made at not more than 50 of the costshare rate enhancement payments supplemental payments called enhancement payments are available for exceptiona l conservation effo rt and additional conservation practices or activities that provide increased resource benefits beyond those prescribed in the csp contract nrcs has stated that it seeks to base its enhancement payments on an objective measure of either adoption cost or environmental benefit however nrcs recognizes that it is not always possible tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34010crs3 2 interim final rule on the conservation security program federal register vol 70 57 march 25 2005 pp 1520115223 3 the total 5054 million was distribut ed as fy2003 3 million fy2004 414 million fy2005 202 million and fy2006 259

environmental activities2 f r fy2006 the enhancement payment was calculate d with variable payment rate for activities that were part of the benchmark inventory total combined payments the total of the stewardship existingnew cost share and enhancement payments cannot exceed the following percentages of the unadjusted stewardship payment which is based on average land rental rates 15 for tier i 25 for tier ii and 40 for tier iii in add ition to the percentage restriction the total combined payment for participant is subject to an annual dollar limit by tier since its authorization in the 2002 fa rm bill 5054 million of funding has been provided for csp during the fy2003fy2006 period3 usda has announced that it has funding for new contracts in fy 2007 as result csp outlays in fy2007 will be limited to support for existing contr acts and will likely be about the same as in fy2006 most csp spending is for costshare payments in fy2006 of the 259 million in outlays 71 million was for stew ardship payments and 26 million was for enhancement payments with the remainder for costshare payments relevant wto provisions for csp payments the relevant language for notifying csp payments as an environm ental program in the wtos aa annex ii is paragraph 124 wto agreement on agriculture annex ii paragraph 12 12 payments under envi ronmental programs eligibility for such payments s hall be determined as part of clearlydefined government envir onmental or conservation program and be dependent on the fulfilment of specific c onditions under the government program including conditions related to production methods or inputs b the amount of payment shall be limited to the extra costs or loss of income involved in comply ing with the go vernment program general discussion of csp payments and wto rules notifying csp payments to the extent that csp payments are in the form of reimbursement for cost incurred or in come forgone as described in paragraph 12b above they clearly comply with wt green box criteria if however csp payments are made in the form of bonus or incentive payments that exceed the costshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34010crs4 5 ibidincurred or income forgone of implementing particular conservation activity then the green box compliance status of such payments could be called into question based on the way csp payments are made it appears that costshare payments fit cleanly into the paragraph 12b criteria of reimbursing for the extra costs or loss of income involved in complying with the csp program stewardship payments appear at first glance to have bonus or incentive aspect in that they are simply based on participation ie the number of acres enrolled and th level of participation by tier thus making them questionable fo r the green box as environmental costshare payments and enhancement payments also fall into more of gray zone in that theyare described as sort of bonus for exceeding cont ract practices while it is unclear if they are limited in value to the oftendifficult tomeasure added cost of imp lementing higher level of environmental practice than otherwise called for in the contract however two considerations are noteworthy first the combined effect of the both the tier and reduction factor s as applied to the stewards hip payments is to reduce them to minor share of the 2001 average rental rate used 125 for tier i 5 for tier ii and 1125 for tier iii since costshare payments are limited to 75 of the practice cost in actuality much lower share is applied as mentioned earlier it appears unlikely that the combined value of the payments exceeds 100 of the wto permissible costshare value second even the bonuslike nature of stewardship and enhancement payments could still be classified as green box eligible direct payments rather than environmental payments under the terms of paragraph 5 of annex ii which allows for existing or new types of direct payments to be green boxeligible ie to be exempt from amber box limits provided they conform to criteria b through in graph 6 in addition to the general criteria set out in paragraph 1 all of which are reprinted below 5 wto agreement on agriculture annex ii paragraphs 1 5 and 6 1 domestic support measures for which exemption from the reduction commitments is claimed shall meet the fundamental requirement that they have or at most minimal tradedisto rting effects or effects on production accordingly all measures for which exem ption is claimed shall conform to the following basic criteria the support in question shall be provided through publiclyf unded government program i ncluding government revenue forgone not involving transfers from consumers and b the support in question shall not have the effect of providing price support to producers plus policyspecific criteria and conditi ons as set out in paragraphs 213httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34010crs5 5 direct payments to producers support provided through direct payments or revenue forgone including payments in kind to producers for which exemption from reduction commitments is claimed shall meet the basic criteria set out in paragraph 1 above plus spec ific criteria applying to individual types of direct payment as set out in paragraphs 6 through 13 below where exemption from reduction is claimed for any existing or new type of direct payment other than those specified in paragraphs 6 through 13 it shall conform to criteria b through in paragraph 6 in addition to the general criteria set out in paragraph 1 6 decoupled income support eligibility for such payments shall be determined by clearlydefined criteria such as income status as producer or landowner factor use or production level in defined and fixed base period b the amount of such payments in any given year shall not be related to or based on the type or volume of production including livestock units undertaken by the producer in any year after the base period c the amount of such payments in any given year shall not be related to or based on the prices domestic or international applying to any production undertaken in any year after the base period d the amount of such payments in any given year shall not be related to or based on the fact ors of production employed in any year after the base period production shall be required in order to receive such payments since stewardship payments are linked to the number of acres enrolled in the csp they would appear at first glance to violate paragraph 6d which states that payments may not be based on or relate d to factor of production such as land currently in use however stewardship payments are essentially fixed at signup since both enrolled area and payment rate do not vary during the life of the contract enrollment in csp contract is rived from production ac tivities on previously farmed acres and thus base for participa tion is established and fixed at signup while the payment rate is based on aver age 2001 land rental rates as result stewardship payments could arguably be described as direct payments that fit paragraph 6behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34010crs6 6 for example see should the green box be modified by david blandford and timothy josling ipc discussion paper international food agriculture trade policy council march 2007 and should the green box be modified by charlotte hebebrand ipc policy focus

both the eu ropean union and united states have argued the merits of bonustype conser vation payments suggesting that some incentive payment should be made wto legal since conser vation activities have bona fide public good aspects and only minimally if at all distort trade and without such bonus payments participation in conservation activ ities may be low6 t h wtos framework agreement of august 2004 called for doha round negotiations to review and clarify the existing green box criteria7 however little discussion of green box criteria has taken place durin g the current doha round of wto trade negotiations and none of th doha round proposals includes any such provision to permit conservation bonustype payments it is unlikely that the green box will play major part in final doha round agr eement should ongoing negotiations reach successful conclusion the vulnerability to wto challenge of such ambiguous bonustype payments is probably highly correlated with the va lue of subsidy outlays usda programs in general tend to attract more attention and are subject to more international scrutiny when subsidy payments are large and arguably marketdistorting by traditional us commodity program standards csp funding has been relatively small during fy2000fy2006 usdas commodity credit cor poration net outlays for total farm support programs including commodity nd conservation progams averaged nearly 20 billion per year in comparison csp funding during fy2003fy2006 totaled 5054 million furthermore because csp pa yments are explicitly targeted to conservation practices they are fairly benign in terms of their market effects that is they likely are minimally tradedistorting if at all however if csp funding levels were to expand greatly to several billion dollars per year they could attract greater critical scrutiny in its march 2007 ba seline projections of usda outlays the congressional budget office cbo projected csp program outlays to increase steadily from 259 million in fy2006 to 769 million by fy20138 the administrations farm bill proposal released january 31 2007 ttempts to remove the payment ambiguity from the csp program and make it fully wto compatible9 usda points out that some of the csp payments as currently structured may be considered tradedistorting under wto guidelines to specifically address the wto status issue the adminis tration proposes removing the stewardship and costshare payments and replacing th em with single enhancement payment but basing the calculation of these enhancement payments on factors such as income forgone by the producer and costs incurred by the producer to implement the conservation practices as stated in its proposed legislative language10httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34010crs7 11 for more

or environmentally sensitive cropland out of production for ten years or more to conserve soil and water resources it is the federal governments largest private land retirement program11 in fy2006 crp outlays totaled 18 billion and cove red almost 37 million enrolled acres this amounts to about 4865 per acre on somewhat less than 10 of the nations cropland the program is administered by usdas farm service agency with technical assistance provided by usdas natural re sources conservation service usda has notified the wto of crp ou tlays for the years 1996 through 2001 as green boxcompliant under paragraph 10 of annex ii which refers to longterm resource retirement programs inclusi on of crp payments under paragraph 10 hinges on payments being used to retire land from marketable agricultural production for at least three years use of the land for agricultural production would potentially disqualify the land from green box eligibility for that particular year and potentially for all years of crp contract if th productive activity is engaged in more frequently than once every four years wto agreement on agriculture annex ii paragraph 10 10 structural adjustment assistance provided through resource retirement programs eligibility for such payments shall be determined by reference to clearly defined criteria in program designed to remove land or other resources including livestock from marketable agricultural production b payments shall be conditional upon the retirement of land from marketable agricultural production for minimum of three years and in the case of

into with an owner or operator under this subchapter if the owner or operator agrees to the termination and b the secretary determines that the termination would be in the public interest since its inception two types of agri cultural production activity have been permitted on crp land under certain conditions harvesting and livestock grazing hunting privileges on crp land also have been sold but such action has not been treated as an agricultural production activity in recent years policymakers have eyed crp land as potential source fo r production of biomass feedstock for use in the production of bioenergy such as biofuels or for the installation of wind turbines for the generation of electrical energy harvesting and grazing harvesting and grazing have been permitted by the secretary of agriculture on crp lands during periods of severe drought when commercial supplies have been either unavailable or prohibitively expense and livestock managers have ex perienced extreme hardship maintaining their herds while such productive activity might be interpreted as violating the conditions specified in aa annex ii pa ragraph 10 usda has notified the entirety of its crp subsidy outlays as green box resource retirement program payments during the 19962001 period section 2101 of the 2002 farm bill appears to have formalized the use of crp land for harv esting and grazing during periods of drought and to offer further possible exemption for harvesting of biomass or installation of wind turbines on crp land by stating that crp participant shall agree to 7 not conduct any harvesting or grazing nor otherwise make commercial use of the forage on land that is subject to the contract except that the secretary of agriculture may permit consistent with the conservation of soil water quality and wildlife habitat httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34010crs9 12 for more information see crs report rl32712 agriculturebased renewable energy production by randy schnepfa managed harvesting and graz ing including harvesting of biomass except that in permitti ng managed harvesting and grazing the secretary i shall in coordination with the state technical committee i develop appropriate vegetation management requirements and ii identify periods during which harvesting and grazing under this paragraph may be conducted ii may permit harvesting and grazing or other commercial use of the forage on the land that is subject to the contract in response to drought or other emergency and iii shall in the case of routine managed harvesting or grazing or har vesting or grazing conducted in response to dr ought or other emergency reduce the rental payment otherwise payable under the contract by an amount commensurate with the economic value of the activity b the installation of wind turbines except that in permitting the installation of wind turbines the secretary shall determine the number and location of wind turbines that may be installed taking into account i the location size and other physical characteristics of the land ii the extent to which the land contains wildlife and wildlife habitat and iii the purposes of the conservation reserve program under this subchapter wto rules paragraph 10 annex ii aa allow for exception to the eligibility requirement that the land be removed from marketable agricultural production as result the 2002 farm bill exception for harvesting and grazing on crp land could be seen as violating paragraph 10 bioenergy production generation of electric energy by wind turbines whether installed on crp nd or not is not regarded as an agricultural production activity by either usda or the wto however future commercial biomass harvesting on crp land is likely to be cons idered an agricultural production activity recent strong interest in cellulosic et hanol production has s purred policymakers to consider the potential of the vast midwest ern prairies much of which is enrolled in the crp as base for producing cellulosi c biomass feedstock such as switchgrass or other native prairie grasses12 biomass harvesting is likely to attract critical comment if it is done extensively ie on significant portion of crp acreage and if large subsidies support such activity th high profile of such activity would only be enhanced if the result were to encourage either significant exports of us biofuels or the continued use of 054 per gallon tariff import barrier on foreign biofuels httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34010crs10 potential alternative classification for use of crp land for an agricultural production activity eg harvesting gr azing or biomass production would be to reclassify the program activity from longterm retirement program to an environmental program where payments would be subject to the criteria of aa annex ii paragraph 12 as di scussed under the csp program implications for congress congress will be revisiting us farm legislation this year and could potentially address the ambiguities concerning notification of csp payments and agricultural uses on crp land to the wto such tactic could potentially avoid or minimize the likelihood of future wto challenges against us conservation programs
