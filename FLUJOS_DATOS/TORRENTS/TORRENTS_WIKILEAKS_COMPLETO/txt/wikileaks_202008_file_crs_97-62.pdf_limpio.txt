europe the former soviet union and elsewhere they do so largely because the original marshall plan program of us assistance to europe during the pe riod 19481951 is considered by many to have been the most effective ever of us foreign aid programs an effort to prevent the economic deterioration of europe expansion of communism and stagnation of world trade the plan sought to stimula european production promote adoption of policies leading to stable economies and take measures to increase trade among european countries and between eur ope and the rest of the world the plan was joint effort between the united states and europe and among european nations working together prior to formulation of program of assistance the united states required that european nations agree on financial proposal including plan of action committing europe to take steps toward solution of its economic problems the truman administr ation and the congress worked together to formulate the european recovery prog ram which eventually provided roughly 133 billion of assistance to 16 countries two agencies implemented the prog ram the us economic cooperation administration eca and the european run organization for european economic cooperation the latter helped insure that participants fulfilled their joint obligations to adopt policies encouraging trade nd increased production the eca provided dollar assistance to europe to purchase commodities food fuel and machinery and leveraged funds for specifi c projects especially thos to develop and rehabilitate infrastructure it also provided tec hnical assistance to promote productivity guaranties to encourage us private investment and approved the use of local currency matching funds at the completion of the marshall plan period european agricultural and industrial production were markedly higher the balance of trade and related dollar gap much improved and significant steps had been taken toward trade liberalization and economic integration the plan had contributed to more positive morale in europe and to political and economic stability which helped diminish the strength of domestic communist parties the us po litical and economic ro in europe was enhanced and us trad with europe boosted although the plan has its critics many obs ervers believe there are lessons to be learned from the effort that are applicable to present foreign aid programs however the extent of the plans replicability is s ubject to question ce ntral europe and the former soviet union may most closely fit the mold of wardevastated western europe but the vast differences in econo mic systems and envi ronmental burden left by communist regimes among other factor s show up the distinctions between 1947 europe and the present undertaking an effo rt equivalent to the original would be an enormous task costing 88 billion in current dollarshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9762contents t h m r s h l l p l n n d t h p r s n t1 f r m u l t i n f t h

present the marshall plan and the present between 1948 and 1951 the united states undertook what many consider to be one of its more successful foreign policy initiatives and most effective foreign aid programs the marshall plan and the eu ropean recovery program erp that it generated involved an ambitious effort to stimulate economic gr owth in despondent and nearbankrupt postworld war ii eu rope prevent the spread of communism beyond the iron curtain and encourage velopment of healthy and stable world economy it was designed to accomplish th goals through achievement of three objectives the expansion of european agri cultural and indus trial production the restoration of sound currencies budgets and finances in individual european countries and the stimulation of international trade among european countries and between europe and the rest of the world it is measure of the positive impre ssion enduring from the economic recovery program that in response to critical situ ation faced by some regions of the world there are periodic calls for new marshall plan this was the case in 1984 when the kissinger commission proposed an 8 billion infusion of funds to the caribbean and central america in 1987 range of senators and representatives from both parties proposed minima rshall plan for the philippines in the early 1990s members of congress recommended marsha ll plans for eastern europe and the former soviet union and more recently international statesmen have suggested marshall plans for the middl east and south africa1 generally these references to the memory of the marshall plan are summons to replicate its success or its scale rather than every detail of the original planhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9762crs2 2 address at harvard university june 5 1947 p 284 in joseph m jones the fifteen weeks the jones book is an excellent description of events leading up to this speechsometimes parallels are drawn between the crisis to be resolved by such assistance and that faced by europe in 1947 when th plan was first proposed the replicability of the marshall plan in these diverse situations or in the future is subject to question to understand the potential relevance to the present of an event that took place fifty years ago it is necessary to understand what the plan sought to achieve how it was implemented and its resulting success or failure this report looks at each of these factors and then attempts to derive some lessons for the future formulation of the marshall plan the marshall plan was proposed in sp eech by secretary of state george marshall at harvard university in june 1947 in response to the critical political social and economic conditions in wh ich europe found its elf at that time recognizing the necessity of congressiona l participation in development of significant assistance package general marshalls speech did not present detailed and concrete program he merely suggested that the united states would be willing to help draft program and would provide assistance so far as it may be practical for us to do so2 in addition marshall required that it be joint effort initiated and agreed to by european nations the formulation of the ma rshall plan therefore was from the beginning work of collaboration between the administration and congress and between the us government and european governments the crisis that generated the plan and the legisla tive and diplomatic out come of marshalls proposal are discussed below the situation in europe european conditions in 1947 as describe d by secretary of state marshall and other us officials at the time were dire although indus trial production had in many cases returned to prewar levels t he exceptions were belgium france west germany italy and the netherlands the economic situation overall appeared to be deteriorating the recovery to date had been financed by drawing down on domestic stocks and foreign assets capital was increasingly unavailable for investment agricultural supplies remained below 1938 vels and food imports were consuming growing share of the limited foreign exchange european nations were building up growing dollar deficit as result pr ospects for any future growth were low trade between european nations was stagnant having already endured years of food shortages unemployment and other hardships associated with the war and recovery the european public was now faced with further suffering to many observe rs the declining economic conditions were generating pessimism regarding europes future that fed class divisions and political instability communist parties alread large in major countries such as italy and france threatened to come to power httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9762crs3 3 the dollar gap was considered important because the united states was the dominant economy at this time and it was assumed that us goods would remain attractive enough to outcompete other nations products for years to come the dollar gap would be likely to grow until european countries were able to build up reserves they would tend to divert their exports to and their imports away from th dollar area this would force cuts in food imports and capital goods further destabilizing europe and slowing growth the marshall plan sought to close the dollar gap 4 june 5 1947 address in jones fifteen weeks p 283the potential impact on the united states was severalfold for one an end to european growth would block the prospect of any trade with the continent one of the symptoms of europes malaise in fact was the massive dollar deficit that signalled its inability to pay for its imports from the united states3 perhaps the chief concern of the united states however was the growing threat of communism although the cold war was still in its infa ncy soviet entrenchment in eastern europe was well under way already ear ly in 1947 the economic strain affecting britain had driven it to announce its withdrawal of commitments in greece and turkey forcing the united states to assume greater obligations to defend their security the truman doctrine enuncia ted in march 1947 stated that it was us policy to provide support to nations threaten ed by communism in brief the specter of an economic collapse of europe and communist takeover of its political institutions threatened to uproot everything the united states claimed to strive for since its entry into world war ii free europe in an open world economic system us leaders felt compelled to respond how the plan was formulated three main hurdles had to be overcom on the way to developing useful response to europes problems for one as secretary of state marshalls invitation indicated european nations acting jointly d to come to some agreement on plan second the administration and congress d to reach their own concordance on legislative program and fi nally the resulting plan had to be one that in the words of the secretary of state would provide cure rather than mere palliative4 the role of europe most european nations re sponded favorably to the initial marshall proposal insisting on role in designing the program 16 nations attended conference in paris july 12 1947 at which they established the committee of european economic cooperation ceec the committee was directed to gather information on european requirements and existing resources to meet those needs its final report september 1947 called for fouryear program to encourage production create internal financial st ability develop econo mic cooperation among participating countries and solve the deficit problem then existing with the american dollar zone although europes net balance of payments deficit with the dollar zone for the 19481951 period was originally timated at roughly 29 billion the report requested 19 billion in us assistance an additional 3 billion was expected to come from the world bank and other sources cautious not to appear to isolate the soviet union at this stage in the still developing cold war marshalls inv itation did not specifically exclude anyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9762crs4 5 the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee

the separation of powers the case of the marshall plan the review of politics january 1965 p 5877european nation britain and france made sure to include the soviets in an early threepower discussion of the proposal nevertheless the soviet union and under pressure its satellites refused to participate in common recovery program on the grounds that the necessity to reveal national economic plans would infringe on national sovereignty and that the us in terest was only to increase its exports ceec formulation of its proposal was not without us input its draft proposal had reflected the wide differences exis ting between individual nations in their approach to trade liberalization the role of germany and state controls over national economies as result of these differences the united states was afraid that the ceec proposal would be little more than shopping list of needs without any coherent program to generate longterm growth to avoid such situation the state department conditioned its acceptance of the european program on six factors that participants make specific commitment s to fulfill production programs take immediate steps to create internal monetary and financial stability express greater determination to reduce trade barriers consider alternative sources of dollar credits such as the world bank give formal r ecognition to their common objectives and assume common responsibility for attaining them and establish an international organization to act as coordinating agency to implement the program the final report of the ceec contained these obligations executive and congressional roles after the european countries had taken the required initiative and presented formal plan both the administration and congress responded formulation of that response had already begun soon after the marshall speech as democratic president facing republican congress that was highly skeptical of the need for furthe r foreign assistance truman took two pronged approach that greatly facilitated development of program he opened his foreign policy initiative to perhaps the most thorough examination prior to launching of any program and secondly provided perhaps equally rare process of close consultation between the executive and congress5 from the first the truman administration made congress player in the development of the new foreign aid program consulting with it every step of the way meeting on june 22 1947 between key congressional leaders and the president led to creation of the harrima n krug and nourse committees secretary of

each year as result there was much bickering among countries but formula was eventually reached to divide the aid programs the framers of the european recovery program envisioned number of tools with

amount available only for loans to 150 milli on the administrator had decided that loans in excess of these amounts should not be made because of the inadvisability of participating countries assu ming further dollar obligations which would only increase the dollar gap the plan was attempting to close as of june 30 1949 9723 million of us aid had been in the form of loans while 4948 billion was

declined from roughly 50 of the total to only 27 th proportion of raw material and machinery rose from 20 to roughly 50 in this same time period project financing became important during the later stages of the erp eca dollar assistance was used with local capital in specific projects requiring importation of equipment from abroad the advantage here was leveraging of local funds by june 30 1951

europe maintained an investment level of 20 of gnp one third higher than the prewar rate since nati onal savings were pr actically zero in 1948 the high rate of investment is largely attri butable to us assistance but the aims of the marshall plan were not achieved by fi nancial and technical assistance programs alone the importan ce of these americansponsored programs is that they helped to create the framework in which the overall oeec european program of action functioned american ai d was leveraged to encourage europeans to come together and act individually nd collectively in purposeful fashion on behalf of the three themes of increas ed production expanded trade and economic stability through policy reform the first requirement of the plan was that european nations commit themselves to these objectives on an individual basi s each nation then utilized its counterpart funds and american dollar assistance to fulf ill these objectives they also with the analytical assistance of both fellow european nations under the oeec and the american representatives of the eca closely examined their economic systems through this process the eca and oeec sought to identify and remove obstacles to growth to avoid unsound national inves tment plans and to promote adoption of appropriate currency vels thanks to american assistance many note european nations were able to undertake recomme nded and necessary reforms at lesser po litical cost in terms of imposing economic hardsh ip on their publics than would have been the case without aid however contending with deeply felt sensitivities regarding european sovereignty us influence on european economic and social decisionmaking as direct result of plan assist ance was restricted where it controlled counterpart funds for use in capital projects influence was c onsiderable where counterpart funds were simply used to retire debt to assist financial stability there was little such influence some analysts contend the united states had minimal control over european domestic policy since its assistance was small relative to the total resources of european countries but while it could do little to get europe to relinquish control over exchange rates on less sensitive smaller issues the united states many argue was able to affect change18 on few occasions did the eca threaten sanctions if participating countries did not comply with agreements italy was threatened with loss of aid for not acting to adopt reco mmended programs and in april 1950 aid was actually withheld from greece to fo rce appropriate domestic action as collective of european nations the oeec generated peer pressure that encouraged individual nations to fulfill their plan obligations the oeec provided forum for discussion and eventual nego tiation of agreements conducive to intra european trade for europeans its exis tence made the plan seem less an american program in line with the american desire to foster european integration the oeec helped to create the european idea as west german vicechancellor blucher noted the oeec had at least one great element european men came

the oeec to take on share of respons ibility for allocating american aid among participating countries the eca elevated the organizati on to higher status than might have been the case otherwise and thereby facilitated achievement of plan aims the sum of its parts evaluating the marshall plan how the marshall pl an was different assistance to europe was not new with the marshall plan in fact during the two and one halfyear period from july 1945 to december 1947 roughly 11 billion had been provided to europe compared with the estimated 13 billion in three and one half years of the mars hall plan one of the factors that distinguishes the marshall plan from its predecessors is that the marshall plan was plan because the earlier more ad hoc and relieforiented assistance had made little dent on european recovery different coherent approach was put forward the new approach called for concerted program w ith definite purpose the purpose was european recovery defined as increas ed agricultural and industrial production restoration of sound currencies budget s and finances and stimulation of international trade among pa rticipating countries and be tween them and the rest of the world the plan as illustrated in the preceding section insured that each technical and financial assistance component contributed as directly as possible to these longrange objectives other aspects of its planlike character were distinctive it had definite time and monetary limits it was made clear at the start that the us contribution would diminish each year in addition to broad objectives it also s upported by reference to the ceec program in the legislati on and more specifically in congressional report language the ambitious quantitative targets assumed by the participating countries20 the marshall plan was also joint effo rt by bringing in european nations as active participants in the program the united states assured that the commitment to alter economic policies necessity if growth was to be stimulated would be translated into action and that the objective of integration would be further encouraged the marshall plan promoted recognition of the economic interdependence of europe by making the congress firm partner in the formulation of the program the adminis tration assured tinued congressional support for the commitment of larg sums over period of years further the marshall plan was first recognition by us leaders of the link between economic growth and political st ability unlike prev ious postwar aidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9762crs16 which was twothirds repayabl loans and onethird relief supplies marshall plan aid was almost entirely in the form of gr ants aimed at produc tive developmental purposes the reason for this large infusion of grants in peacetime was that us national security had been redefined as containment of communism governments whose citizens were unemployed and unfed were unstable and open to communist advancement only longterm economic growth could provide stability and as an added benefit save the united states from having to continue an endless process of stopgap reliefbased assistance the unique nature of the plan is perhaps best emphasized by what replaced it the cold war reinforced by the korean war signalled the end of the marshall plan by altering the priority of us aid from that of economic stability to military security in september 1950 the eca informed the eur opean participants that henceforth growing proportion of aid would be allocated for european rearmament purposes although originally schedul ed to end on june 30 1952 the plan began to wind down in december 1950 when aid to britain was suspended in the following months ireland sweden and portugal graduated fro m the program the use of counterpart funds for production purposes wa s phased out to attack inflation which resulted from the shortage of materials due to the korean war the eca had begun to release counterpart funds in the fourth quarter of 1950 13 billion was released twothirds of which were used in retiring public debt under the mutual security act of 1951 and subsequent legi slation although in lesser quantities and in increas ing proportions devoted to defense aid continued to be provided to many european countri in the 195253 appropriations for example france received 525 million in gran ts half of which was for defense support and the other as budget support the joint nature of the marshall plan disappeared as national sovereignty came to the fore again unlike the marshall plan france insisted on using count erpart funds as it wished co mmingling them with other funds and only later attributing ppropriate amounts to certain projects to satisfy american concerns accomplishments of the marshall plan for many analysts and policymakers the effect of the marshall plan policies and programs on the economic and political situation in europe was broad and pervasive while in some cases direct connection can be drawn between american assistance and positive outcome for the most part the plan may be viewed best as stimulus which set off chain of events leading to the accomplishments noted below did it meet its objectives the marshall plan agencies the eca and oeec established number of quantitative standards as their objectives reflecting some of the broader purposes noted earlier production the overall production objectiv of the european recovery program was an increase in aggregate pr oduction above prewar 1938 levels of 30 in industry and 15 in agriculture by the end of 1951 industrial production

years of the plan the 1948 senate report on the erp author ization had noted set of production goals that the europeans had set for themselves goals that they noted seem optimistic to many american experts21 the participating countries for example had wanted to increase steel production to 55 million tons yearly 20 above prewar production by 1951 they had achieved 60 milli on it was proposed that oil refining capacity be increased by 2 12 times that in 1938 in the end they managed four fold increase the goal for coal pr oduction was 584 million tons an increase of 30 million over prewar production by 1951 pr oduction was still slightly below that of 1938 but 27 higher than in 1947 balance of trade and the dollar gap in 1948 participa ting countries could pay for only half of their imports by expor ting an objective of the erp was to get european countries to the poi nt where they could pay for 83 of their imports in this manner althoug h they paid for 70 by exporting in 1938 the larger ratio was sought under erp because earnings from overseas investment had declined even though trade rose substantially pecially among participants the volume of imports from the rest of the world rose substantially as well and prices for these imports rose faster than did prices of ex ports as result europe continued to be strained one obstacle to expansion of exports was simply trying to break into the united states and south american market s where us producers were entrenched oeec exports to north america rose from 14 of imports in 1947 to nearly 50 in 195222 related to the overall balance of trade was the deficit vis vis the dollar area especially the united states in 1947 the total gold and dollar deficit was over 8 billion by 1949 it had dropped to 45 billion by 1952

the plan in raising morale in europe was as great contributi on to the prevention of communism and stimulation of growth as any financial assistance as george kennan noted the psychological success at the outset was so amazing that we felt that the psychological effect was fourfifths accomplished before the first supplies arrived24 economic integration the united states had view of itself as model for the development of europe w ith individual countries equa ted with american states as such us leaders saw healthy europe as one in which trade restraints and other barriers to interaction such as the inconve rtibility of currencies would be eliminated the erp required coordinated planning for recovery and the establishment of the oeec for this purpose in 1949 the erp authorization act wa s amended to make it the explicit policy of the united states to encourage the unification of europe25 efforts in support of european integrati on integral to the original plan were strengthened at this time to encourage intraeuropean trade the ec in its first year went so far as to provide dollars to participa ting countries to finance thei r purchase of vitally needed goods available in other par ticipating countries even if these were available in the united states in step toward encour aging european independence from the dollar standard it also established an intraeur opean payments plan whereby dollar grants were made to countries which exported more to europe as group than they imported on condition that these creditor c ountries finance their export balance in their own currencies the european payments union epu an outgrowth of the payments plan was established in 1950 by member countries to act as central clearance and credit system for settlement of all payments transactions among members and associated monetary areas such as the sterling ar ea at eca request the 1951 congressional authorization withheld funds specifically to encourage the pursuit of this program since

investments without corresponding re ductions in living standards and could be antiinflationary by mopping up purchas ing power through the sale of imported assistance goods without increasing the s

economically devastated nd besieged by millions of refugees from the east one house of every five built since 1948 had received marshall plan aid26 perhaps as result of these benefits communism in europe was prevented from coming to power via the ballot box it is estimated that communist strength in western europe declined by almost onethird between 1946 and 1951 in the 1951 elections the combined prowestern vote was 84 of the electorate27 us domestic procurement champions of the marshall plan hold that its authorizing legislation was free of most of the potential restrictions sought by private interests of the sort to later appear in foreign aid programs nevertheless restrictions were enacted which did benef it the united states and us business in particular procurement of surplus goods was enc ouraged under the plan legislation while procurement of goods in short supply in th united states was discouraged it was required that surplus agriculture commoditie s be supplied by the united states and procurement of these was to be encouraged by the eca administrator the erp required that 25 of total wheat had to be in the form of flour and half of all goods had to

marshall plan made the atlantic pact nato possible28 critiques of the marshall plan not everyone agrees that the marshall plan was success many of the current criticisms of foreign aid that it is giveaway program that it is waste of money were heard then as well one such appraisal was that marshall plan assistance had little effect it is for example difficult to demonstrate that plan aid was directly responsible for the increase in producti on and other quantitativ achievements noted above critics have ar gued that plan assistance was never more than 5 of the gnp of recipient nations and therefore could have little effect29 some analysts pointing out the experimental nature of the plan agree that the method of aid allocation and the program of economic reforms promoted under the plan were not derived with scientific precision some cl aim that the dollar gap was not problem and that lack of economic growth was the result of ba d economic policy resolved when economic controls established during the nazi era were eventually lifted30 even at the time of the marshall plan there were those who found the program lacking if marshall plan aid was going to combat communism they felt it would have to provide bene fits to the working class in europe many believed that the increased production sought by the plan would have little effect on those most inclined to support communism in congre ssional hearings congressmen repeatedly sought assurances that the aid was benef iting the working class would loans to french factory owners they asked lead to higher salaries for employees31 journalist theodore h white was another who ques tioned this trickle now called the trickle down approach to recovery the trickle theory had thus far white wrote in 1953 resulted in

appropriations committees special subcommittee on foreign economic cooperation believed that the original intent of the plan could not be accomplished under these conditions33 the tactics employed to achieve plan objectives were ofte n questioned as well much of our effort in france has been contradictory reported the committee staffer on the one hand we have been working toward the abolition of trade barriers between european countries and on the other we have been fostering or rebuilding uneconomic industries which ca nnot survive unhampered international competition34 another issue is the proportion of funding which went to the public rather than private sector one contemporary writer noted that public investments from the italian counterpart fund obtained twice the amount of assistance as did the private sector in that country another analyst has argued that the eca promoted government intervention in the economy35 in the 1950 authorization hearings us businessmen urged that assistance be provide d directly to foreign business rather than through european governments only in th is way they said could free enterprise be promoted in europe36 from its inception members of congress voiced fears that the erp would have negative effect on us business some noted that the effort to close the trade gap by encouraging europeans to export and limit their imports would diminish us exports to the region amendments most feated were offered to erp legislation to insure that certain segments of the private sector would benefit from plan aid that strengthening europe economically meant increased competition for us business also was not lost on legislators the eca for example helped europeans rebuild their merchant marine fleets and by the end of 1949 had aut

disparate elements of marshall plan assistance speak to the present it is questionable whether the program in the main could be replicated in meaningful way the problems faced now by most other parts of the world are so vastly different and more complex than those encountered by western europe in the period 19481952 that the solution posed for one is not entirely applicable to the other some aspects of the marshall plan are mo re replicable than others the plan was chiefly characterized by its offering of dollar assistance targeted at productivity financial stability and increased trade this however is the aim today of only portion of us economic assistance to the developing countries much of which goes for humanitarian relief or political security purposes surely developing and former communist countries would benefit by receiving large scale aid if it iminated the necessity of going even deeper into debt to private or public sources such grant aid could make radical policy reforms politica lly easier to adopt however many developing countries may not possess the hum an industrial or democratic base to make effective use of such aid and may n eed long term developmentoriented aid not short term infusion of capital some suggest that in many cases rapid infusion of large scale assistance w ould lead only to corruption and abuse of aid funds another key feature of the plan was its joint nature both individually and collectively european participants were collaborators with the united states in the plan it can be argued that the administr ative systems of many developing countries remain inadequate to formulation and implementation of significant program again longterm targeted interventions of technical assistance may be more appropriate at this stage there are however segments of the developing world that may be in position to benefit from marshall plantype progra m the advanced developing countries such as thailand and indonesia

one program congress and the president would have to agree that th activity was major national priority nevertheless in pondering the difficulties of new mars hall plans it is perhaps worth considering the views of the ec administrator paul hoffman who noted twenty years after secretary marshalls historic speech that even though the plan was one of the most truly generous impul ses that has ever motivated any nation anywhere at any time the united states derived enormous benefits from the bread it figuratively cast upon the internationa l waters in hoffmans view today the united states its former partners in the marshall plan and in fact all other advanced industrialized countriesare being offered an even bigger bargain the chance to form an effective partnership for worldwide economic and social progress with the earths hundr ed and more lowincome nations the potential profits in terms of expanded prosperity and more secure peace could dwarf those won through the european recovery program yet the danger that this bargain will be rejected out of ap athy indifference and discouragement over the relatively slow progress toward selfsufficiency made by the
