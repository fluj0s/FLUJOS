at the same time the debate over the iraq war resolution also reflected continuing divisions in congress regarding how to deal with the challenge posed by saddam husseins wmd programs and capabilities

united states armed forces against iraq at the same time the debate also reflected continuing divisions in congress regarding how to deal with the challenge posed by saddam husseins weapons of mass destructi on wmd programs and capab ilities and the administrations handling of this issue the final text of the war resolution featured four areas of consensus 1 congress agreed broadly that iraqs wmd programs and activities and saddam husseins possible hostile intentions threatened the security of the united states and its regional allies or at minimum the threat was sufficiently serious that the president should be give n the benefit of the doubt til more information was forthcoming 2 congress specifically limited the scope of the presidents authority to iraq and not the wider middle east region as in the original white house draft resolution 3 congress insisted that the admin istration should first seek peaceful diplomatic resolution through the s ecurity council unsc before using the powers conferred in the resolution and 4 congress also reaffirmed its constitu tional responsibilities w ith regard to war powers under the constitution and as adopted in the war powers resolution pl 93148 which was adopted over pr esident nixons veto in 19732 thensenate majority leader tom daschle called the resolution beginning not an end to the role of congress in th process of formulating us

strengthened their criticism of the adminis trations handling of the issue other members have indicated that their pport for the administrations position has grown in response to the release of more detailed inte lligence information in addition to maintaining dialogue with the administration on policy issues regarding iraq members of congress address these issues via their legislative oversight respons ibilities and appropriations powers and by consulting with and explaining their positions to their constituents in all of these functions significant areas of policy difference concerning iraq are likely to continue both within the congress and between the congress and th administration and in the wider public debate continuing broad issues in the debate congress broadly shares the concern of the administration that iraq under saddam hussein presents threat to american interests and security and to us regional allies this consensus arises from iraqs welldocumented pursuit of chemical biological and nuclear weapons and its monstrated willingness to employ horrific weapons against both the iraqi population and its neighbors congress also shared concerns that these capabilities might be put into the hands of qaeda or other terrorist groups widely shared american objectives as reflected in the congressional debate include eliminating the wmd threat from ir aq foreclosing any possible iraqi support to terrorists promoting stability in the oilrich and politically volatile middle east region and promoting acceptance of us po litical and ec onomic values of human rights democracy and free markets the appropriate ranking of these objectives their degree of urgency the best and most appropriate means for dealing with them and the likely consequences of several policy options for pursuing them remain highly contested matters the issues addressed below that have been raised and shaped by the congressional and wider public debate some have ta ken on new aspects since passage of the house joint resolution 114 pl 107243 authorizing the use of united states armed forces against iraq and the adoption by the security council of resolution 1441 on november 8 2002

considered the question what to do about states with which we had hostile relations that even if they werent directly supporting qaeda were clearly part of the insecurity we were now feeling they concluded she said that iraq fell into that category but the day after these discussions the president decided to adopt po licy of first things first4 despite criticisms of the administration s

provided in briefings to members of congress allied governments and the united nations international atomic energy agency iaea in the early fall 2002 reportedly was not deemed persuasive by some of the recipients some of them characterized the information as nothing new5 these doubts have led to calls for giving the inspectors more time to find clear evidence of iraqs violations and to declare baghdad in material breach mbers of congress and others taking this position maintain that giving the inspect ors more time to r each and report this conclusion which they appear to see as in evitable will make it easier to gain more international support nd allow the administration to launch an attack with clear security council mandate this approach is widely favored in fact insisted on by us

httpwwwnumber10govukoutputpage6117aspthus far the most clearcut indication that iraq still maintains chemical and biological capabilities is the fact that it has not provided evidence concerning the disposition of weapons and ma terials discovered by the u n inspection team which operated in iraq from 1992 to 1998 the team located and destroyed large quantities of wmd and related facilities and materials but not all these items had been destroyed as of december 1998 when the insp ectors had left iraq out of frustration with iraqi obstructionism these known w eapons systems and precursor materials reportedly were not accounted for as requi red in iraqs december 8 2002 declaration in his january 27 2003 interim report to the security council which the new york times characterized as grim the chief weapons inspector hans blix declared that iraq appears not to have come to genuine acceptance not even today of the disarmament which was demanded of it and which it needs to carry out to win the confidence of the world and live in peace8 in addition to facilities found by the unsom inspectors prior to 1998 which clearly had wmd purposes iraq has numerous dualuse facilities such as plants producing industrial machinery agricultural pesticides and pharmaceuticals9 the threat posed by iraqs presumed nuclear program has been more difficult for the administration to establish the main evidence appears substantially circumstantial and inferential notably that more than four ears have passed since the withdrawal of the inspectors during which time the administration argues iraq has had ample opportunity to restart its nuclear program the administration its supporters in congress and some regional specialists and nuclear experts have expressed particular concern about three factors the conclusion of the earlier inspectors that iraq may have been as little as two years away from achieving nuclear weapons capability prior to the 1991 gu lf war evidence that core team of scientists and technicians has been r eassembled since 1998 and indications of renewed activity in several programs incl uding suspected effo rt to obtain nuclear weapons material via uranium

unnamed african countries11 september 2002 report by the international institute of strategic studies in london came to similar conclusion about iraqs progress towards devel oping nuclear weapons12 some critics who agree that iraq poses serious threat have questioned nonetheless whether iraq should be the high est priority country they note that the absence of clear evidence that iraq is close to acquiring nuclear weapons contrasts with the case of another axis of evil count ry north korea which in late september 2002 admitted to having covert uranium enri chment program in apparent violation of its obligations under the 1994 usd prk agreed framework in apparent response to the dprks actions to reactivate nuclear power plant that had been deactivated sealed and monitored by the iaea under the terms of another provision of the same accord the administration has chosen to employ only diplomacy and has thus far ruled out the use of military force13 some members of congress and

that senator joseph biden ranking mber of the senate foreign relations committee had stated that the administration possessed highly classified and sensitive evidence that can change people s minds and although the evidence was circumstantial it would be sufficient for conviction if there were jury trial16 overall some analysts judge that th continuation of the bipartisan support reflected in the strong majorities behi nd the october 11 2002 iraq war resolution may now depend on whether the administr ation gains security council support before launching preemptive attack17 the possibility that the issue could become more contentious in congress is suggested by the strong criticisms of the administrations handling of the iraq issue leveled by the senate minority leader sen thomas daschle and house minority leader rep nancy pelosi on january 27 200318 the president appears to enjoy substantial support from both sides of the aisle as evidenced by the generally favorable reception given to his state of the union address but sentiment also appears to remain strong among many members that if war is necessary the most desirable course is to obtain second security council resolution or otherwise gain the maximum international support containment versus military action leading to regime change the option of containing iraqs wmd activities instead of going to war may be moot in view of president bushs reiteration on several occasions that in his judgment containment was not viable option and one that did not even merit consideration in view of the massive american and british buildup of military forces in the region poised for attack all signs point to military attack in the near future unless some radical change occurs in iraq19 despite the presidents dismissal of containment number of members of congress former policymakers analysts and commentators have maintained that war with iraq is not immediately necessary at least not in the near term and

for the time being especially since iraqs military power and i ndustrial capabilities are by most accounts only shadow of what th ey at the time of the invasion of kuwait some argue in fact that containment already had worked with regard to iraqs nuclear program even during the period betw een the departure of the inspectors in december 1998 and their return in nove mber 2002 they assert that inspections can continue to contain iraq especially if the inspectors remain in place and trade sanctions are strengthened or refocuse d this position draws support from the above noted british intelligence dossier which concluded that even in the absence of inspectors the existing sanctions had prevented iraq from acquiring the necessary materials and technology for pr oducing fissile material plutonium or highly enriched uranium21 the administration and its supporters counter in part by citing iraqs violations of its obligations under the terms of the 1991 agreement with the united nations and various subsequent resolutions th ey argue that economic sanctions patrols over northern and southern fly zones and periodic air strikes against military targets have demonstrably failed thus far to contain iraqs wmd activities22 and that evidence of iraqs efforts to reconstitute its wmd programs confirms that even containmentplus including renewed inspectors will not suffice proponents of military action contend that even with relatively unimpeded access to suspicious sites iraq could still hide important elements of its wmd program in remote areas23 the issue of containment versus military force as the best means to deal with wmd proliferation appear to be put into bold relief by the administrations decision to rely on diplomacy and containment in response to north koreas decision in late december 2002 to expel iaea inspectors and restart small nuclear plant at yongbyon24 opponents of using military force against iraq contend that if the administration can deal with north ko reas transgressions by diplomacy and sanctions then the same approach ought to be sufficient for dealing with iraq which does not yet have nuclear weapons some note also that

argue that once rogue country acquires nuclear capability the military option becomes much less viable secretary of defense rumsfeld asked rhetorically in identical statements to the house and senate armed services committees in september 2002 whether it would be better to wait until iraq was stronger and had more advanced wmd programs before acting26 in speech to reserve officers group on january 20 2003 rumsfeld reportedly also described north korea as country teetering on the verge of collapse27 both the north korean and iranian progra ms have given rise to concerns that other countries which have the ability to produce nuclear weapons but heretofore lacked the incentive may also decide to b ecome nuclear powers this prospect has sparked renewed debate bout the broader issue of how to combat proliferation some suggest the need for new or stre ngthened multinational approach to stopping proliferation under auspices others maintain that dealing with nuclear and other wmd proliferation by multilateral treaties and agreements is inadequate and emphasize casebycase approach in cludingimplicitlya military pr eemption option if appropriate to the situation28 ironically many of the governments of c ountries closest to iraq profess to be relatively unworried about iraqs wmd pr ograms and capabilities whether these professions are true reflections of their views is uncertain some see these statements as genuine others suspect that popular sympathy and support for saddam hussein in the arab world make it difficult for governments there to align publicly with the us view of the threat posed by the ir aqi regime although privately they may have sympathy for him as for the respective risks of seeking to contain iraq or going to war some analysts conclude that

has been that of the possible consequences of military confrontation with iraq for the war against terrorism the administration argues that destroying iraqs wmd capability is not only fully consistent with the war against terrorism but is critically important given the possibility that iraq might give such weapons to qaeda or other terrorist groups in any event administration offici als contend that the campaigns against qaeda terrorists and against iraq are all of piece and mutually supportive critics question the administrations priorities ar guing that even if iraq poses serious potential threat the present danger posed by qaeda is more immediate some also contend that going to war with iraq could unintentionally accomplish osama bin ladens main goal of radicalizing the middle east and expelling us military forces from the region efforts by the administration to establish link between iraq and qaeda have been special source of c ontroversy in late 2002 unna med administration officials reportedly provided intelligence information to the press that suggested that iraq might be providing chemical or biological weapons to terrorists linked to qaeda these claims were challenged by other unnamed intelligence anal ysts who were said to have described the evidence as circumstantial or unverified31 the administration expanded its efforts to link baghdad to qaeda and other terrorists in early 200332 the new claims focused on possible connection between iraq and top qaeda operative abu mussab alzarqawi who us officials say received medical treatment in bagdad after

explicitly with military action but but only declares that iraq has failed take the final opportunity afforded to it in resolution 1441 and that the secu rity council decides to remain seized of the matter43 although the language of the draf t contains specific statements to which exception is likely be taken the cont ext makes clear that its approval would be tantamount to authorizing military

and russia and gain unanimous support for resolution that the administration deemed acceptable the degr ee of its commitment to working through the security council remained in question especially among european allies crucial element of the final negotiated text from the administrations point of view was that the security council resolution left scope for member c ountries to maintain

however that it strongly prefers to obtain new resolution if possible given iraqs failure thus far to comply substantially with its obligation to disarm and cooperate fully with the inspectors the administration faces three important timerelated policy decisions 1 how much time to give iraq to come into full compliance with unsc resolution 1441 2 how much time to give the chief inspector to declare iraq to be in material breach of its obligations and 3 how much time to give the security c ouncil to agree on resolution authorizing military action or for diplomatic initiatives to play out

happen63 with regard to the danger that iraq would succumb to civil war the administration can point to divisions among regional analysts and iraqi specialists about the degree of risk although some of these experts argue that fragmentation or chaos is almost inevitable others contend that this possibility is less serious that it might seem david mack of the middle east institute washington dc think tank reportedly has argued that because of the immense valu of iraqs oil the three main ethnic groups are likely to compete for power in baghdad instead of going separate ways64 other analysts who tend to downplay the risk of fragmentation contend that the shia arabs of southern iraq fully consider themselves iraqis despite years of brutal repression hence these and some ot her iraqi specialists suggest that the shias may seek greater autonomy and political participation rath er than secession 65 analysts generally agree that the risks of kurdish separatism are greater because of the long history of kurdish nationalism in iraq and elsewhere but some are more optimistic than others for instance some analysts maintain that turkey and iran would strongly oppose kurdish separatism po ssibly by force rather than allow pan kurdish impulses to affect their own kurdish minorities66 some also note that the kurds in particular already have attained significan t measure of autonomy under the umbrella of the northern nofly and nodrive zones freedom from iraqi rule and guaranteed share of the pro ceeds from the current oilforfood program has allowed the kurds to enjoy revived and

common interest number of alternative plans dealing with postconflict situation have been under active consideration at least since late summer 2002 during the fall of 2002 planners reportedly were c onsidering two possible options one was said to involve postwar occupation and reconstruction ad ministration loosely modeled on the us occupation of japan after world war ii under general douglas macarthur who headed unified command involving bot h military and civilia n members of the occupation administration this plan repor tedly also would include instituting war crimes trials removing key re gime supporters who have pa rticipated in human rights violations and wmd projects and downsizing the iraqi military the other approach was said to involve the early installati on of provisional government headed by current iraqi exiles both concepts were reported to envision radical reconstruction of the iraqi political system based on democracy and some form of federalism69 in early 2003 media reports asserted th at military and civ ilian planners had settled on third approach one that envisions two year military occupation aimed at holding the country together in the face of expected civil strife restricting war crimes trials to comparatively small number of the most senior iraqi leaders and taking immediate control of iraqs oil and gas resources as means to pay for reconstruction

and the total collapse of the iraqi state and governmental structure both administration officials and their critics agree on one thing if saddam hussein is overthrown as result of war us military forces probably would have to remain in iraq in significant numbers for considerable period of time reportedly the pentagon anticipates that it will take year or more to locate and eliminate all weapons of mass destruction control separa tist tendencies and capture saddam hussein andor his most senior officials and supporters72 given these uncertainties secretary of defense rumsfeld and other senior officials have indicated that the rem oval of hussein via military coup or exile would be desirable outcome despite the personal risks to coup plotters overthrowing hussein could be attractive to the iraqi military leaders for three reasons 1 the army would not be destroye d and its integrity would be retained 2 the regular armys rival the more pol iticized republican guard would likely be broken up leaving the regular army in full charge of national security and 3 the dominant sunni arab minority centered on baghdad would not have to face the imposition by the united states and its allies of democratic process that would likely shift political power to the shia arabs and kurds who together constitute roughly threequarters of the countrys population against these eventualities giving up iraqs wmd capabilities may seem far more preferable one very large question mark is whethe r wouldbe coup pla nners could avoid detection and destruction as appears not to have happened in past attempts against saddam moreover coup would in all likelihood have to come from the special republican guard or other security forces which alone would be in position to act since the regular army reportedly is never allowed into baghdad some suggest in fact that if elite units fight rather than attempt to overthrow saddam the regular army would be valuable asset in maintaining stability

selfdescribed academic realists believers in the in evitability of power ri valries among nation states and the consequent necessity for ccasionally using military force rather than criticizing the admin istration from an internationalist or multilateralist point of view these commentators argue simply that the costs of acting in the face of international opinion could include weakening the nat alliance violent reactions in the middle east that could undermine friendly conservative regimes and most important possibly weaken the thus far hi ghly successful inte rnational cooperation on the war against qaeda in add ition the realist perspective sees the administrations course as generating increased opposition to other important american agenda items that require cooperation from other countries such as expanded global free trade91 issues related to international law the bush administration has asserted that if it decides to attack iraq to overthrow saddam hussein it will be acting in complete accord with customary international law regarding legitimate selfdefense and that such action is also justified under previous but still operative secu rity council resolutions92 in addition as expressed in his annual state of the union address president bush and supporters of preemptive war to disarm ir aq also argue that the requirements of protecting us security alone should

equally adamant in their belief that the new national security strategy report released by the white house in septem ber 2002 puts the united states at odds with international law since it makes the option of using preemptive force in the face of wmd threats matter of nati onal policy critic s acknowledge that the united states has long considered preemption an option but they contend that elevating it to the level of publiclystated policy albeit one that would not be employed in all cases will have negative ramifications for us security and other interests94 former secretary of state henry kissinger in washington post oped article in august 2002 expressed genera l support for the administrations position on the use of force even while warning of the potential negative consequences for the international system kissinger agreed with some opponents of us policy who have argued that waging preemptive war is not in keeping with longstanding interpretations of international law and the united nations charter which the united states largely drafted and ra tified however kissinger also argued that the rise of international terrorism and the proliferation of ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons have created new situation that requires new concept of legitimate actions of self defense while accepting that iraqs ac tions create an imperative for preemptive action he warned nonetheless that it would not be in the us interest to create precedent that might be adopted by other countries consequently he urged the administration also to work to create new international regime for addressing the dangers of nuclear proliferation95 the international law issue is likely to remain matter of dispute so long as the administration stresses its right to use preemptive force or actually uses military force against iraq or othe r countries some legal scholars maintain that the degree of threat posed to national security is the governing criterion under international law thus making the test of necessity th critical element ither under customary international law or the charter96 as noted above this issue of necessity in and of itself remains major source of contention moral issues those who believe that the united stat should base its policies on moral principles include some who advocate such an approach for its own sake and others who see the emphasis on morality in foreign policy as an important element of us influence and leadership some anal ysts and commentators note that the administration has sought the moral hi gh ground by emphasizing that

that overthrowing saddam hussein and creating new more democratic gove rnment is positive moral good the administration has particularly emphasized the gross violations of human rights by the iraqi regime and has also pointed to evidence that many iraqis are waiting anxiously for their liberation those who oppose the administrations policy on moral grounds pursue at least two different lines of argument some including the united methodist council of bishops the national council of church individual episcopal bishops and somewhat less categorically the united stat conference of catholic bishops have argued essentially that preemptive strike on iraq would violate the basic principles of christian morals and ethics these critics generally concede that the iraqi regime is brutal and potential danger to peace but not so much as to warrant preventive war99 one of the most categorical statements along these lines is contained in pastoral letter from the president of the united methodist council of bishops which asserts that preemptive war by the united states against nation like iraq goes against the very grain of our understanding of the gospel our churchs teachings and our conscience this statement and ot hers have emphasized that at minimum war with iraq if all diplomatic means fail should not be in itiated wit hout new authorizing resolution from the security

supporters of giving the inspectors mo re time argue that if baghdad decides in the face of an impending invasion to fully and proactively cooperate with the inspectors or if the inspectors should gain breakthroughs in spite of iraqi efforts some answers might be found to currently unresolvable questions about iraqs wmd programs at minimum it is argued the united states will be in position to obtain stronger internati onal support for its cause thus far the failure of the inspectors to find significant number of proscribed weapons or materials has creat ed dilemma for the administration as of late february 2003 key mbers of the security council continue to oppose at least publicly adopting second reso lution authorizing military action without more proof of the iraqi threat both ns blix

to discover compromising evidence or to declare that iraq is not cooperating since us forces are not likely to be fully be in place until the end of february at the earliest some observers suggest that the administration would have little to lose and much to gain by agreeing to give the inspectors few more weeks however the escalating transatlantic rhetoric moves by france and germany such as trying to block nato from dispatching defensive military equipment to turkey and growing antagonism between france and the newer nato members in easter n europe appear to have significantly reduced the possibility of eventually presenting united front to iraq should the united states go to war w ithout the clear approval of the security council the issues of interna tional law and the mo rality of using military force could gain added salience in that event the ultimate impact on us international standing likely would depend heavily on the course of the war if military or political debacle or major disr uption of internationa l oil supplies should occur as consequence of an invasion that did not have at least nominal and international approval the consequences for us foreign policy and
