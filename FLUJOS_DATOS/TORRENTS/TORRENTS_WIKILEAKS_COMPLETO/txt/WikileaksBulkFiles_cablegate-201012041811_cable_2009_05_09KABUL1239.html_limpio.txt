14 b and d 1 u summary recent trip to the northeast by representative of the embassys provincial reconstruction teamsubnational governance team confirmed the presence there of number of the same challenges thwarting progress elsewhere in afghanistan it also served to dispel few misconceptions about the region among the challenges are poor governance and corruption among the misconceptions dispelled are the notions that there are only negligible security issues in the northeast and that development assistance particularly from the germans is readily available to address the most pressing needs in fact there appears to be genuine threat to future isaf resupply convoys through kunduz as far as development aid is concerned germans on the ground are frustrated by the limits and constraints under which they have to operate and funds available from the hungarians in baghlan province provide only drop of help in desert of need end summary security more dangers than sometimes assumed 2 sbu the fact that the prt came under rpg attack during emboffs visit risked coloring his impressions regarding security in the northeast but in fact there do appear to be some serious security issues needing to be addressed clearly the most compelling is the festering situation in chahar darrah district in kunduz it is bit unnerving to realize that villages literally stones throw from the main northsouth road linking kabul to the border crossing with tajikistan at sherkanbandar are in security nogo area owing to the presence there of insurgent elements this is hardly an abstract concern given increased prospects of isaf using the road as an important resupply route joint ansfgerman operation in the district from late december to midjanuary managed to expel midlevel insurgent commanders and suppress lowlevel fighters key leaders however have been moving back into the district and the prt in kunduz is expecting the worst this summer as the thenprt commander reasoned in late march the taliban feel need to surge in order to demonstrate their reach especially in light of the influx of additional us troops to afghanistan 3 c rocket attacks on the prt and rise in ied incidents in the area are seen as harbinger of things to come the same german commander the position shifts every six months was more rigorous than some of his predecessors in addressing the insurgent threat sending his soldiers to patrol in chahar darrah even at night but he expressed frustration at the unwieldiness of the german interagency bureaucracy in berlin that left the prt unable to move forward quickly with job and incomegenerating projects in chahar darrah at time when he felt such activities could have helped cement gains made in the decemberjanuary operation the increased pace of insurgent attacks in and around kunduz since that commanders departure have confirmed his worrying predictions whether more prt projects could have prevented the ongoing security downturn in chahar darrah is hard to say the commander himself noted the embarrassed reaction of local residents there at the time of the earlier operation over the new year period people told the germans they were ashamed that international forces had had to come to help that afghan authorities were not paying heed to their calls for help and that afghans themselves should have been able to address the situation 4 sbu kunduz governor omar shares the former prt commanders view on the fundamental source of the security problem namely the lack of jobs equally important in his view however is the absence of functioning legal system capable of dispensing real punishment to malefactors he estimates the number of active insurgents in the province as between 150200 and also anticipates an upsurge in attacks this year as both taliban and hizbe islami seek to increase instability for the elections and demonstrate they can and do remain an active threat in the north the governor further shares the assessment that insurgents are likely to target the expected increase in isaf resupply convoys transiting the province he bemoans what he sees as the squandering of earlier popular support for the government as result of the governments own inabilityfailure to act decisively in the area he suggests poppy cultivation was left unchallenged for too long the disbandment of illegal armed groups was not pursued with enough vigor and ministries have failed to coordinate among themselves or mount effective programs 5 c further to the south ostensibly peaceful baghlan kabul 00001239 0025 of 005 province faces different set of security challenges as the head of the unama office for the region tells it even though baghlan generally flies under the national radar it actually deserves to be labeled the wild wild west xxxxxxxxxxxx behindthescenes contests for power including on the part of the provincial chief of police the influence of local strongmen and former mujahedeen particularly in northern baghlan unchecked poppy cultivation in andarab district underlying tajikpashtun tensions and criminality all combine to undermine stability direct insurgent activity appears limited but criminal elements have fashioned links to the taliban locals have also made themselves available to execute forhire insurgent missions the hungarian prt does little to address any of these problems they are not permitted to fire their weapons except in selfdefense do little more than patrol the main roads and undertake counternarcotics activities when two hungarian deminers were killed doing their work budapest stopped sending mine clearers to the prt when the security situation in northeastern bamyan province was threatened by baghlanbased malefactors it was the new zealanders who had to cross into baghlan to address the problem the prt sees itself as focused on humanitarian assistance and smallscale development work again xxxxxxxxxxxx his nations troops are looking to do their short stints in afghanistan and get back home unscathed 6 sbu the head of the provincial council pc in baghlan sees one of the same factors cited by governor omar in kunduz as undermining stability in his province too namely the inability of the nascent formal legal system to address peoples need for justice in fact he claims as one of his pcs singular achievements its intervention to settle legal disputes that the formal legal system failed to resolve in timely manner according to the pc chairman one dispute over murder had languished for 10 years but was settled in two days once council member from the affected district mediated another case involving tribal killing had been with prosecutors and the court for 18 months but was settled in two hours with the provincial councils help it is questionable whether these cases were in fact resolved in way that met formal justice standards but it is noteworthy that these elected subnational governance officials clearly believe they have done service to their constituents and thereby brought the government and people closer by their actions governance weak reed 7 c the governors in kunduz and takhar provinces are hardly among the countrys strongest while kunduz governor omar certainly talks good game the germans see him as so thoroughly corrupt that they avoid all contact with him to the furthest extent possible this can hardly make for optimal synchronization of security governance and development efforts the prt insists however that to be seen working with the governor would seriously taint them in the eyes of local residents as case in point they suggest their efforts to construct bridge across the kunduz river into chahar darrah district an obvious security priority have been stalled not least because of the governors shady dealings with the government land needed for access to the site of the bridge crossing the germans also say they had to rebid the construction contract for the bridge to enable firm favored by deputy minister at the ministry of reconstruction and development mrrd to come out the winner governor omar himself places finger of blame on the poor quality of some of his district administrators in other instance however he suggests the independent director of local governances idlg emphasis on education qualifications has saddled districts with officials ignorant of the important local social networks and power relationships he complains as well about his lack of funds and argues that the inability of some line ministries in kunduz to spend their full allocations from kabul exacerbates the problem the kunduz prts german development advisor had high praise for the activities of usaids local governance and community development lgcd program in the province but noted the lack of civil service training institute in kunduz the most important city in the northeast 8 c while takhar governor ibrahimi may check the uzbek ethnic box he appears to have little else going for him at least judging by desultory 90minute meeting he gave to emboff despite evidence to the contrary according to the governor his province has virtually major challenges aside from the inadequacy of international development kabul 00001239 0032 of 005 assistance he suggested that thanks to his own efforts as well as those of nds and anp and the cooperation of local elders and religious leaders security in the province is good and insurgents are under control weapons have been surrendered in fully half of the provinces districts women play an active role including in government service the governor makes special efforts to press district administrators working under him to respect human rights and anticorruption efforts are underway he dismissed reports of weapons smuggling through the province as inaccurate and blamed what he admitted is some heroin and opium smuggling on the existence of an active drug market across takhars border in tajikistan according to the german prt in kunduz ibrahimis extortion schemes are netting him 40000 month from takhar residents 9 c if there is bright spot in governance in the northeast it may be governor barakzai in baghlan while it is still early days xxxxxxxxxxxx sees barakzai as breath of fresh air while the provincial chief of police reportedly ran roughshod over barakzais predecessor the new governor has put the anp chief off balance it may help that barakzai brought with him to baglan his own bodyguard force for the moment the governor appears to have coopted the police chief as well as the local nds head is gaining in prestige among the local movers and shakers and has even gone some distance in quieting unease among the provinces large tajik population over his appointment he is pashtun 10 c comments by some key international stakeholders raise doubts that unamas local operations are likely to contribute much to turning around the situation on governance in the region the german prt in kunduz reports that the local unama office has little to offer in contrast to unamas facility in mazai sharif as the prt sees it unamas kunduz office does not coordinate or align donors has humanitarian assistance officer and has failed so far to provide much needed district mapping for chahar darrah district in baghlan where unama placed three people late last year xxxxxxxxxxxx goes so far as to label unamas role in the province just joke he takes aim particularly at what he suggests is failure by local unama staff to exercise coordinating role in unamas defense the head of unamas regional office in kunduz notes that personnel reinforcements are in the pipeline she points in particular to the upcoming addition of governance unit with two additional international staffers development pockets are deep enough 11 u three of the four provinces of the northeast enjoy something of an advantage in having as their patron the germans who see their mission as developmentfocused germany currently channels 130 million euros year in assistance to afghanistan with 60 percent of this going to the three provinces of kunduz takhar and badakhshan as well as to balkh home of the germanled regional command north of those three northeastern provinces badakhshan receives the largest share because of its greater needs the kunduz corridor also comes in for fair share of the funding with takhar receiving the least the german development agency gtz does however maintain an office in taloqan takhars capital the germans are seriously considering rehabilitating and paving the direct road link between kunduz and mazare sharif over the next few years at an estimated cost of 54 million euros for the 60mile stretch they were instrumental in getting ec funding for the rehabilitation of the major irrigation system along the taloqan river in takhar and are putting 16 million euros into repairing the adjacent khanabad i power station damaged in the war 12 u such largescale projects rather than the quick impact projects that were once staple of the german prt in kunduz are sought increasingly by the local population but even for smaller projects the prt has tried to better target local desires and needs by establishing special provincial development fund pdf each of the three provinces in the prts area of responsibility is awarded 800000 euros year in projects approved by an eightmember panel composed of four germans and four afghans including representative from the respective provincial councils and governors offices 13 sbu despite their best efforts the germans in the field in the northeast are frustrated by the cumbersomeness of their own government bureaucracy as the kunduz devad explains it back in 2003 the berlin ministries with stake in development assistance worked out an agreement defining the specific sectors to which assistance would be directed kabul 00001239 0044 of 005 these include such areas as drinking water supply basic education gender renewable energy and provision of technical cooperation and advice the list did not include sector that is key in this relatively wellwatered region namely agriculture and this has come to hamper the effectiveness of the overall effort of the prt it appears all but impossible to have the basic list of priority sectors reexamined given the existing balance of interests between the various german ministries this makes it extremely difficult for the prt to respond to evolving sometimes pressing needs this year in what they consider major victory the prt managed to extract 500000 euros in extra funding from the german foreign ministry and the german bank for reconstruction and development kfw for urgently needed projects in chahar darrah none of this assistance however keeps local authorities from complaining sometimes bitterly about their neglect particularly relative to what they see as truly massive aid being channeled to the countrys east and south 14 u baghlan falls into that unfortunate category of provinces stuck with the fatal combination of fairly benign environment and fairly indigent prt the result is minimal international development assistance the hungarians spend about 30 million year to maintain their prt outpost they invest another 3 million year in development assistance with 300000 directed at infrastructure improvements the section of the ring road in the province south of poli khumri is still unpaved the prt has budget of 500000 for civmil quick impact projects the ngo hungarian interchurch aid hia serves as implementer for much of hungarys aid selfsacrifice lost virtue yes and 15 u visit to the baghlan sugar refinery just north of the provincial capital provided window on the challenges of reviving what little industry or processing capabilities the country still possesses the mill which ran from 1929 until 1976 as private concern suffered like the rest of the country from decades of war but was reopened in 2005 after being reborn as privatepublic partnership the enterprise was capitalized at 156 million euros with the afghan government holding 30 percent stake and the remainder in the hands of two german companies and four local afghans the refinery first produced sugar again in 2006 but its potential has been difficult to realize because of local roundworm infestation that originated in the former soviet union and now covers all of baghlan in that year fully 70 percent of the harvest was lost to the infestation the following year beets were grown and in 2008 only 40 hectares of the 260 hectares planted survived and this was only due to some farmers having planted beets as their second crop the worms did not have the entire season to do their damage xxxxxxxxxxxx this is tragedy for the country since it is currently importing sugar at cost of 450 million year possible solution would be to allow fields to lie fallow for time but xxxxxxxxxxxx has been unable to convince farmers to follow his advice 16 sbu roundworm is not the only challenge facing he refinery it was notoriously the site of an explosive attack in november 2007 that resulted in death and injury to as many as 75 people including women and children sixmember delegation from the wolesi jirgas economics committee died in the incident although the german development agency gtz does not generally support agricultural projects in afghanistan it did come up with the funds to make extensive security improvements to the officeresidence complex at the mill xxxxxxxxxxxx continuing threat of kidnapping xxxxxxxxxxxx has also had to hire local strongman as his assistant to run interference for him with locals seeking to extort this or that advantage for themselves from the plant 17 u the problem of locals seeking immediate personal gain is not confined to the mill xxxxxxxxxxxx recounts it the wellknown cheese factory across the street from his mill gave local farmers dairy cows to help ensure the factory would have steady supply of milk much to the annoyance of the managers of that plant many of the farmers instead sold the animals xxxxxxxxxxxx complains further that farmers have demanded 4000 from the mill to clear their own irrigation canals something they traditionally have done for themselves xxxxxxxxxxxx suggests simple assessment of 2 per head among the farmers would get the job done 18 u elsewhere enlightened selfinterest still has kabul 00001239 0052 of 005 place at least this is what is reported by the louis berger group lbg project managers guiding the usaidfunded construction of the 60mile engineering marvel that is the feyzabadtokishim highway through the hindu kush in badakhshan province this massive 120130 million undertaking is forcing 30meter wide highway alongside the mashhad river by means of major hillleveling and blasting works if the germans ultimately do decide to rebuild the direct road between kunduz and mazare sharif then an improved asphalt band will link people and commerce across the entire north of afghanistan from feyzabad in the east to sherberghan and meymaneh in the west while government and security officials at all levels in badakhshan have been quite supportive of usaids project the lbg engineers are especially impressed by the readiness of farmers along the route to give up significant part of their extremely limited mountainside acreage for the sake of the road although giroa is supposed to pay compensation project managers doubt this is actually happening the company maintains two community development offices to work as liaisons with local residents and has tried to be accommodating for example by allowing time for harvesting of targeted fields and by rerouting of affected irrigation channels they marvel nonetheless at the goodwill they have encountered despite the destruction of 400500 houses many of which have been dismantled by the residents themselves 19 u the onsite project managers point to one other important advantage they enjoy good security they had some ieds and rockets to deal with last year but things are going well now without good security they say it would be impossible to build the road through the areas mountainous terrain where they and their crews are often dwarfed by still higher ground above them the nds licenses their protection teams who are made up basically of the troops of local commanders another advantage of good security is their ability to find willing afghan subcontractors some of these firms once worked in the southeast and reinvested their earnings in the purchase of expensive road construction equipment those afghan businessmen are reluctant to work again in those now more insecure areas for fear of losing their equipment to insurgent attack eikenberry
