oversees the financial operations of the medicare hospital insurance hi trust fund and the supplementary medical insurance smi trust fund the hi trust fund covers medicare part services including hospital home health skilled nursing facility care and hospice care and the smi trust fund covers medicare parts b and d including physician outpatient hospital home health and access to prescription drug coverage the two trust funds are statutorily completely separate the act requires that the board report annually to congress on the financial and actuarial status of the funds the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 pl 108 173 mma amended the social security act adding an additional responsibility that requires the trustees to examine and make determination if general revenue medicare funding is expected to exceed 45 of medicare outlays for the current fiscal year or any of the next six fiscal years an affirmative determination in two consecutive annual reports is considered to be medicare funding warning in the year in which the second report is made this requirement is found in 1817b2 and 1841b2 of the social security act as amended by the mma thus the medicare warning is mechanism for alerting policy makers of the impact of medicare revenues and outlays on the federal budget in effect looking at the burden of the medicare program on the treasury the trigger and the subsequent required legislative proposal by the president and congressional action serve as an warning that medicare spending has reached statutorily defined critical level there is inherent significance to establishing 45 as the trigger rather it serves as level at which congress has determined it agrees to examine medicares effect on the treasury the formula used to calculate excess general revenue spending inherently favors some options over others while the president must propose and congress must consider legislation to reduce spending below the trigger there is requirement that legislation must be enacted and automatic mechanism in place to sequester money it is also important to note that either chamber may alter these procedures should numerical majority choose to do so most recently on january 6 2008 the house approved rules package hres 5 that nullifies the trigger provision in the house for two years the duration of the 111 th congress

of the mma defines the key terms for medicare funding warning excess general revenue medicare funding occurs when general revenue medicare funding divided by total medicare outlays exceeds 45 general revenue medicare funding is defined as total medicare outlays minus dedicated financing sources1 dedicated financing sources include the following 1 hi payroll taxes 2 amounts transferred from the railroad retirement act 3 income from taxation of certain social security benefits which are credited to the hi trust fund 4 state transfers for the state share of amounts paid to the federal government for certain beneficiaries 5 medicare premiums paid under parts hi b smi and d prescription drugs of medicareincluding any amounts paid as result 1 this definition of general revenues should not be confused with the transfers from treasury to the smi trust fund required under current law to cover about 75 of part b outlays

submit legislation to congress responding to the warning within the 15day period beginning on the date of the budget submission to congress this year 3 the president submitted the legislation on february 15 2008 this requirement could have been waived if after the warning is issued but before the deadline for the presidential response 1 congress enacted legislation to eliminate excess general revenue medicare funding for the sevenfiscal year reporting period and 2 if within 30 days after enactment the board of trustees of the medicare trust funds certified that the legislation eliminates the funding warning g7g161g153g142g141g146g157g142g141g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g146g152g151g138g149g561g5g152g151g156g146g141g142g155g138g157g146g152g151g561 in any year in which the mma requires the president to submit draft medicare funding legislation the act directs that in each chamber within three days of session after the proposal is received the two floor leaders or their designees introduce bill reflecting it with the title bill to respond to medicare funding warning the presidents bill was submitted on february 14 2008 and introduced in the house and the senate on february 25 2008 this measure or under certain circumstances an alternative medicare funding measure is potentially subject to consideration under fast track rules established by the statute rather than under the regular rules and procedures that govern consideration of legislation in the two chambers 4 these expedited procedures place limits on committee consideration as well as potentially on members ability to debate and amend legislation on the floor and to offer certain motions that would otherwise be in order these procedures are designed to guarantee that each house will have an opportunity to consider legislation to eliminate the funding warning they do not guarantee however that 1 the presidents specific proposal will be the one considered or 2 congress will pass legislation to lower general revenue spending below the trigger amount as noted above either chamber may alter these procedures should numerical majority choose to do 2 2007 annual report of the boards of trustees of the federal hospital insurance and federal supplementary medical insurance trust funds pp 3540 3 similarly the 2008 annual report of the boards of trustees of the federal hospital insurance and federal supplementary medical insurance trust funds included an estimate that general revenue funding would ex ceed 45 in 2014 creating new warning based on the estimates of excess general revenues for 2007 and 2008 4 the text of this expedited procedure is contained in us congress house constitution jeffersons manual and rules of the house of representatives of the

procedures would otherwise work in the house

president to submit draft medicare funding legislation the committees of referral must report medicare funding legislation by june 30 for this purpose any other bill with the same title as required for the presidents proposal also qualifies as medicare funding legislation and the requirement to report applies whether or not the president has submitted proposal as result the committee may choose to report some other medicare funding measure rather than that of the president the chairman of the house committee on the budget is responsible for certifying whether or not any medicare funding legislation or any subsequent amendments to it eliminates the excess general revenue medicare funding whether or not the reported measure is affirmatively certified as responding to the funding warning the house may consider that measure under its regular procedures in any year in which the president is required to submit medicare funding legislation however if the house has not voted on final passage of an affirmatively certified measure by july 30 then after 30 more calendar days including five days of session any member may offer highly privileged motion to discharge committee from further consideration of any medicare funding legislation of which he or she is in favor but only if it has been in committee for 30 days and is affirmatively certified 5 the mma describes these procedures as fallback in that they apply only if the house has not already voted on legislation affirmatively certified to respond to the funding warning regardless of whether that legislation pa ssed or not in addition once the house agrees to one such motion to discharge the motion is l onger in order during that session of congress motion to discharge made under this fallback provision must be made by supporter seconded by onefifth of the houses membership quorum being present and is debatable for one hour if the house adopts the motion to discharge the speaker must within three days of session thereafter resolve the house into committee of the whole for consideration of the legislation debate on the measure is not to exceed five hours and only amendments that have the affirmative certification of the committee on the budget are admitted debate on any amendment is not to exceed 1 hour and the total time for consideration of all amendments is capped at 10 hours at the conclusion of consideration the committee rises and reports the legislation back to the house for final dispositive vote motion to recommit the measure with or without instructions is not precluded on july 24 2008 the house of representatives adopted hres 1368 resolution which provided that the expedited parliamentary procedures contained in section 803 of the mma would not apply in the house during the remainder of the 110 th congress 5 this motion to discharge is not in order if during the previous session of congress the house voted on medicare funding legislation which was affirmatively certified by the house committee on the budget to eliminate the general funding warning httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22796g15g142g141g146g140g138g155g142g561g22g155g146g144g144g142g155g561 g561

bill reflecting presidential proposal pursuant to the mma or to any other bill with the same title that either 1 was passed by the house or 2 contains matter within the jurisdiction of the finance committee measure reflecting the presidents proposal is to be referred to the senate committee on finance in year in which the mma requires the president to submit medicare funding legislation and whether or not he does so if the committee on finance has not reported the bill reflecting the presidents proposal or some other medicare funding legislation by june 30 then any senator may move to discharge that committee from any single medicare funding measure only one such motion to discharge is in order during session of congress 6 debate on the motion to discharge is limited to two hours restriction which ensures that vote on the motion cannot be prevented by filibuster in combination these provisions afford the senate only one assured opportunity to consider medicare funding legislation which will be either the measure the committee on finance reports or the one specified in the discharge motion in either case the legislation the senate will have the opportunity to consider may or may not be the one that embodies the presidents proposal after the date on which the committee on finance has reported or been discharged from further consideration of medicare funding legislation it is in order for any senator to move to proceed to consideration of the bill the mma does not explicitly make this motion nondebatable although senate precedent exists for treating as nondebatable motion to proceed to consider measure under procedures specified by statute in the absence of such limitation it might be possible for opponents to use filibuster to prevent this motion from coming to vote in any case because the mma establishes further requirements regarding consideration if the motion to proceed is agreed to the senate would consider the measure under its general rules the statute then does not preclude filibuster of the measure nor if the house and senate both pass bill does the act make any provision to expedite the resolution by conference committee or otherwise of differences between the two versions of medicare funding legislation

in order to understand the impact of legislation designed to lower the general revenue share it is important to understand how the medicare program is funded the primary source of financing for the hi trust fund is the payroll tax on covered earnings making up about 95 of the money in the fund employers and employees each pay 145 of wages and unlike the social security tax there is annual maximum limit on taxable earnings the other sources of revenue for the hi trust fund include interest paid on the us treasury securities held in the hi trust fund portion of the federal income taxes that individuals pay on their social security benefits premiums paid for individuals who would otherwise not qualify for medicare part and small amount of general revenue transfers hi funding is established through statutory tax rates that cannot be adjusted to match expenditures all expenditures for hi benefits are paid for from the hi fund the smi trust fund has different revenue sources there are payroll taxes collected for this fund and individuals enrolled in medicare parts b and d must pay prem ium of about 25 of 6 this motion is not in order at all if the chairman of the senate committee on the budget has certified that medicare funding legislation has already been enacted that eliminates the excess general revenue medicare funding

revenues about 75 for the smi trust fund come from general revenue transfers with the remainder coming from premiums interest paid on the us treasury securities held in the fund and other sources such as part d state transfers for certain medicaid beneficiaries all smi benefit expenditures are paid from the smi trust fund when considering proposals to reduce the general revenue share some changes have larger impact than others for lowering the 45 level for example an increase in dedicated revenues by either increasing payroll taxes or premiums would have the greatest impact on reducing the excess general revenues equal dollar amount decrease in part spending would have the second greatest impact and an equal dollar amount decrease in part b or d spending would have the least impact the table below illustrates the effect of changes designed to reduce excess general revenues in this hypothetical example assume that under current law the general revenue share would reach 55 in the given year 68 billion increase in dedicated revenues would lower the percent of general revenues to 45 while 68 billion decrease in part spending thus lowering total medicare outlays would only reduce the level to 494 reducing total outlays by reducing part b or d spending has the least impact because for every dollar saved about 025 would be offset by reduced beneficiary premiums thus 68 billion decrease in part b spending would only reduce the level to 519 also as shown in the table in order to bring the level down to 45 through reductions in spending it would require 124 billion dollar reduction in part spending or 227 billion reduction in part b or d spending thus dollar for dollar options to reduce the trigger level are not equal t able 1 illustrativ effect of options to w er

formula that does not directly relate to how the medicare trust funds operate legally any funds raised for one fund cannot be used to pay expenses out of the other as result of the statutory independence of the trust funds the revenues and outlays of each trust fund do not bear upon the other fund therefore reducing part spending would not reduce federal contribution requirements for part b and d spending as required under statute in other words parts b and d of medicare are financed by combination of premiums and federal contributions funded through general revenues transfers while lowering part spending would lower overall medicare spending and therefore reduce any excess general revenue spending it would have impact whatsoever on the amount of general revenues required to be transferred from the treasury to the smi trust fund in order to finance part b outlays further increasing dedicated revenues through increased payroll taxes has impact on medicare spending so that
