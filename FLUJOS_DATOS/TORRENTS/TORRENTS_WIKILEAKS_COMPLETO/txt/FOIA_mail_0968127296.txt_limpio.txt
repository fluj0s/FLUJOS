from ben matthews benchooseclimateorg to mike hulme mhulmeueaacuk subject re interactive climate sciencepolicy website date tue 5 sep 2000 001456 0100 replyto ben matthews benchooseclimateorg dear mike regarding my last mesage in case you wonder about my background i have attached 2page version of my cv in richtext format file bjhmcv2rtf my experience ranging from laboratory work with co2 fluxes and marine algae through to organising events at the climate negotiations combined with strong mathematical and linguistic background is somewhat unusual combination which perhaps makes more jack of all trades than specialist on the other hand this has given an interdisciplinary overview which may be valuable for bridging the gap between science and policy appreciating dilemmas and uncertainties and communicating these around the world however kyoto left very disillusioned by the apparent lack of connection between climate science and policy in the protocol there was not one sentence discussing what we need to do to stabilise the climate in the long term based on scientific predictions this made wonder what is the use of my intricate research on airsea co2 exchange if the policymakers ignore even the most basic knowledge i left uea and started working at home developing interactive web graphics showing the link between percapita emissions and global climate change eventually i realised that working alone was neither effective nor sustainable and this has led to unfortunate personal circumstances now i need the stimulus of working again in team in an institute even if this requires sacrificing of my own ideas i am not just looking for job it is more important to to rejoin the research community and feel i am making the best use of my skills i hope you can help if only to discuss the possibilites i have also attached zip package containing the interactive java applets which i developed its only 90k including supporting webpages and historical data once unzipped all in one directory you have to open the file startherehtml in any javaenabled web browser i can send selfextracting windows version if you prefer on the other hand you may find it easier just to look at the website wwwchooseclimateorgapplet currently this uses only very crude formulae loosely based on ipcc sar and gcis cc but the presentation is unique you can adjust the parameters just by dragging controls with mouse and all the linked plots respond instantly its hard to describe in words which is why i encourage you to have look ben dr ben matthews benchooseclimateorg original message from mike hulme mhulmeueaacuk to ben matthews benchooseclimateorg sent 04 september 2000 1338 subject re interactive climate sciencepolicy website thanks for this note ben i would be interested in talking about your ideas at some stage particularly in relation to our outreach strategy we are appointing communications manager very soon and you are welcome to attend the presentations as listed below i would suggest that we arrange meeting little further down the line once the centre has started operating in its new premises after 2 october mike ______________________________________ attachment converted ceudoraattachcca21zip attachment converted ceudoraattachbjhmcv2rtf
