combined joint task forces cjtf stanley r sloan senior specialist in international security policy foreign affairs and national defense division1 summary the nato foreign ministers meeting on june 3 1996 in berlin germany agreed in principle on significant new steps that if implemented would constitute major transformation of the north atlantic treaty organizations missions and methods of operation in january 1994 nato leaders had approved us proposal to create combined joint task force cjtf headquarters that would allow the allies to prepare to use their forces for wide variety of different military scenarios the concept had not been put into action largely because of political differences over how to create the option for europeanled cjtfs at berlin the allies agreed that european security and defense identity esdi would be created within the framework of the transatlantic alliance by opening the possibility for european officers in the nato structure to wear their nato command hat and if necessary western european union weu command hat it was also agreed that the nato structure and assets could with the agreement of all the allies including the united states be made available for future military operations commanded by the weu the government of france has said that if such multiplehatting command arrangements and the asset sharing plan are implemented france will return to full participation in natos military command structure implementation of the berlin accord now must be negotiated and hard bargaining can be expected in the months ahead the berlin meeting the us ambassador to nato robert hunter has called the berlin outcome the first significant change in the way the alliance does business since 1966 when the french 1 research assistance for this report was provided by michelle walensky congressional research service the library of congress crs2 left natos military structure2 the result did not come easily and french president jacques chirac has noted that success in berlin was not guaranteed in advance on subject where the temptation to resist was strong on both sides of the atlantic until the final hours before the ministers convened allied officials struggled to piece together an agreement that had almost come unraveled press reports suggested that us general george joulwan nato supreme allied commander europe saceur was reluctant to accept the idea that european nato commanders could wear weu hats as well fearing that divided loyalties might weaken natos command structure3 the final compromise was crafted to protect the strengths of the current nato command structure while making sufficient changes to warrant the french conclusion that they would be joining new structure not the one that president gaulle had left some 30 years ago the communique said that adaptation and reform of the alliance would be guided by three fundamental objectives to ensure the alliances military effectiveness and ability to perform its traditional mission of collective defense while undertaking new military roles to preserve the transatlantic link by strengthening nato as forum for political consultation and military cooperation and to support development of european security and defense identity esdi within the alliance in particular by creating the possibility for natosupported task forces to perform missions under the direction of the weu nations4 the berlin accord when implemented would allow the alliance to activate the cjtf concept an approach originally proposed by the united states in 19935 the intent was to establish new command arrangements within which us forces and those of allied and other nations could be combined in variable formations to take on wide variety of missions beyond the borders of alliance countries the agreement in berlin to create the possibility for europeanled cjtfs is important in its own right particularly because implementation should bring france back into full military cooperation with the other allies but the importance of making the cjtf concept operational goes beyond this one aspect the cjtf concept as originally conceived and as agreed in berlin has three goals to give natos force and command structure sufficient flexibility to allow the allies including the united states to respond effectively to alliance security requirements and new missions beyond article 5 contingencies in other words beyond defense of allied nations from direct attack the natoled 2 nato acquires european identity the economist june 8 1996 p 51 3 craig r whitney after nato

identity through weu was set in the eus 1991 treaty of maastricht for background see paul gallis the western european union crs report 95758 june 28 1995 5 for background on cjtf see stanley r sloan combined joint task forces cjtf and new missions for nato crs report 951176 december 7 1995 crs3 implementation force in bosnia ifor is classic example of this aspect of cjtf6 to facilitate the dual use of nato forces and command structures for alliance andor western european union weu operations encouraging european nations to undertake missions with forces that are separable but not separate from nato in the context of an emerging european security and defense identity the ifor was not designed as this type of europeanheavy cjtf because the allies all judged that us military capabilities and political involvement were essential to the success of the mission to permit nonnato partners to join nato countries in operations exercises and training as envisioned in the partnership for peace usproposed program of military cooperation open to all qualified nonnato european states that was also initiated at the january 1994 summit the bosnia operation does demonstrate this aspect of the cjtf concept by associating wide variety of nonnato troops including those of russia with the ifor the berlin accord should allow the allies to construct future combined joint task forces that range in terms of participation from operations like the ifor with major contributions from the united states european allies and nonnato countries to presumably less militarilydemanding operations planned and executed by the western european union in between these extremes wide range of permutations and combinations of cjtf command control and participation options could be planned under the agreed concept it is widely agreed in nato that in the near future cjtfs will in most cases include rather than exclude the participation of us forces and commanders the allies also agreed to create policy coordination group in nato composed of allied political and military representatives to facilitate coordination of the political goals of mission and its military implementation the creation of the group responded to the french belief that natos new missions require closer oversight in the conduct of military operations by political decisionmakers particularly in rapidly changing and politically complex scenarios like that in bosnia under the new arrangements nato remains the preeminent military security organization in europe and the role of the united states in this system remains critically important but the focus of natos mission has grown from the previous emphasis on territorial defense and toward perceived new requirements of the postcold war world the european members of the alliance have been given an organizational venue for initiatives designed to defend their security interests but in way that encourages and presupposes continuing political and military cooperation with their transatlantic allies 6 for an assessment of the postifor issue see stanley r sloan bosnia after ifor crs report 96344 april 16 1996 crs4 the road to berlin at the january 1994 brussels summit the nato heads of government gave broad guidance to the north atlantic council nac natos senior intergovernmental decisionmaking body with the advice of nato military authorities and in coordination with the western european union to develop this cjtf concept and establish the necessary capabilities but progress was painfully slow the main problem was the french concern that provisions be made for greater european responsibility for cjtf operations that largely depended on european forces for implementation under president mitterrand paris preferred that the nac determine the political goals for and continually monitor cjtf operations wanting to deemphasize the role of natos military decisionmaking bodies since withdrawing from natos integrated military command structure in the mid1960s france had not taken its seat on the military committee and other key nato military bodies the setting for the debate changed substantially however following the election of jacques chirac as french president in may 1995 france under mitterrand had favored creating european defense system that would parallel the nato structure but fiscal constraints on defense spending and differences among france and its european partners concerning the modalities of european defense cooperation led president chirac to the conclusion that effective european cooperation would be politically and financially possible only in the framework of nato the european experience in bosnia reinforced the perceived need for closer collaboration with the united states president chirac therefore decided that french interests called for an accommodation with nato and hopefully allied agreement to amend natos military structure to allow france to join new structure taking into account french concerns on december 5 1995 france announced that it would resume participation in the military committee and in meetings of the nato defense ministers the french return to active participation in natos military committee served as an invitation to bargain on the terms for frances return to unqualified participation in nato military cooperation the chirac position was that the full return of france to natos military structure would require fundamental changes in that structure to give real meaning to the idea of more coherent and responsible european role in the alliance dualhatting issue in the second half of 1995 the british government began actively searching for ways to create european security and defense identity within the framework of the alliance and in fashion that would facilitate frances return to full military integration early in 1996 both the french and british governments proposed what became known as the deputies proposal7 they suggested that the deputy saceur traditionally senior european officer and other european officers in the nato command structure wear weu command hats as well as their nato and national command hats this multiple hatting procedure would without duplication of resources and personnel permit the 7 for discussion of the concept see stanley r sloan natos future beyond collective defense crs report 95979 september 15 1995 p 2124 3032 crs5 western european union countries to use the nato command structure to organize and command military operation under largely european auspices the deputies proposal reportedly raised serious issues for the us joint chiefs of staff and saceur general george joulwan senior us military commanders were concerned that the weu hat might weaken the european commitment to the nato structure as well as lessen the american commitment to nato other us officials however believed that continued active us role in the alliance depended on being able to demonstrate to the us congress and the american public that the european allies were willing and able to take on greater responsibility for military missions both inside europe and beyond the reinvolvement of france in the alliance with its willingness and ability to participate in military interventions beyond national borders was seen as the key to the construction of meaningful and coordinated european contribution to postcold war security concerns the berlin accord does not explicitly mention the deputies proposal and negotiating the terms under which multiplehatting arrangements may be implemented could be contentious the berlin communique says that separable but not separate hqs hq elements and command positions that would be required to command and conduct weu led operations should be identified in advance it also says that the agreed principles imply doublehatting appropriate personnel within the nato command structure to perform these functions following the meeting when asked whether or not the results mean that the deputy saceur would become facto the military head of the european component of the alliance french foreign minister herve charette responded yes that is reasonable proposal you make the french government believes that the language of the communique already adds to the nature of the potential responsibilities of european officers in the nato command structure but the french interpretation may not be shared by all allied governments or by the saceur and some difficult negotiations on this and other details may be expected in the months to come weu use of nato assets and capabilities another difficult issue is the question of how nato assets and capabilities could be loaned to the western european union when the weu conducts an operation under the new concept nato assets are actually quite limited they include command and control structures and facilities but very few weapons systems other than the nato airborne warning and control system awacs most nato capabilities not controlled by the european allies are us capabilities such as intelligence systems and heavy airlift ally and the us in particular is willing to grant carte blanche for weu control of capabilities that might be essential to the success of weu operation france and other european allies were concerned that nato assets and us capabilities dedicated to weu mission not be withdrawn at some point during the mission thereby placing both their soldiers and the mission in jeopardy the berlin compromise provided that when nato assets and capabilities are dedicated to support weu mission on casebycase basis the north atlantic council would monitor the use of those assets with the advice of the nato military authorities during weurun mission nato authorities would keep the use of natos assets under review in fact the final outcome makes extensive provisions for joint nato weu planning in peacetime as well as close cooperation during the conduct of an crs6 operation the communique noted that the alliance will support the development of the esdi within nato by conducting at the request of and in coordination with the weu military planning and exercises for illustrative weu missions identified by the weu implications for congress the berlin accord was designed to help transform natos role for the postcold war world respond to congressional calls for more effective sharing of international security burdens and accommodate more cohesive european role in the alliance frances new relationship with the alliance could add important military and political resources for alliance missions but will also mean greater influence for france in nato decisionmaking this might require some difficult adjustments for the united states and other allies if the program is implemented nato could progressively develop military capabilities available for use in wide variety of contingencies in and beyond europe this would not guarantee that the united states or its allies would make the political decisions to use such capabilities but policymakers would have wider variety of credible options for multilateral military intervention than they do at present the nato governments apparently hope to have made significant progress on implementation of the berlin accord by the time of their regular ministerial meetings in december 1996 the clinton administration would then like the outcome to be celebrated at nato summit meeting in the first half of 1997 at which time the allies would also issue the initial invitation to certain central and east european candidates for nato membership members of congress might wish to consider how the changes agreed at berlin affect the utility and importance of nato as an instrument of us policy in the postcold war world and what further steps might be needed to complete the transformation process for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96561
