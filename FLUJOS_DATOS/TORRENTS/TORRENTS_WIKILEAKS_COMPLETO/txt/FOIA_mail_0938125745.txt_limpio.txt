from keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk to michael mann mannmultiproxyevscvirginiaedu folland chris ckfollandmetogovuk phil jones pjonesueaacuk subject re ipcc revisions date thu sep 23 182905 1999 cc tkarlncdcnoaagov mannvirginiaedu dear mike and all some remarks in response to your recent message i believe strongly that the strength in our discussion will be the fact that certain key features of past climate estimates are robust among number of quasiindependent and truly independent estimates each of which is not without its own limitations and potential biases mike i agree very much with the above sentiment my concern was motivated by the possibility of expressing an impression of more concensus than might actually exist i suppose the earlier talk implying that we should not muddy the waters by including contradictory evidence worried ipcc is supposed to represent concensus but also areas of uncertainty in the evidence of course where there are good reasons for the differences in series such as different seasonal responses or geographic bias it is equally important not to overstress the discrepancies or suggest contradiction where it does not exist and i certainly dont want to abuse my lead authorship by advocating my own work i sincerely hope this was not implied in anything i wrote it was not intended i am perfectly amenable to keeping keiths series in the plot and can ask ian macadam chris to add it to the plot he has been preparing nobody liked my own colorplotting conventions so ive given up doing this myself the key thing is making sure the series are vertically aligned in reasonable way i had been using the entire 20th century but in the case of keiths we need to align the first half of the 20th century w the corresponding mean values of the other series due to the late 20th century decline again i agree also i am not sure which version of the curve you are now refering to the original draft did show our higher frequency curve ie the version with background changes effectively filtered out intended to emphasise the extreme interannual density excursions and their coincidence with volcanic eruptions the relevant one here is smoothed version in which lowfrequency changes are preserved i can supply this and it will be in press by the time of the next reworking of the text your above point on correct scaling is relevant also to phils curve which was not originally calibrated in formal regression sense with the summer temperature data it was just given the same mean and standard deviation over specific period hence the issue of equivelent scaling of all series is vital if we are to discuss specific period temperature anomalies in different series or compare temperature trends in absolute degrees so if chris and tom are ok with this i would be happy to add keiths series that having been said it does raise conundrum we demonstrate through comparining an exatropical averaging of our nothern hemisphere patterns with phils more extratropical series that the major discrepancies between phils and our series can be explained in terms of spatial samplinglatitudinal emphasis seasonality seems to be secondary here but probably explains much of the residual differences but that explanation certainly cant rectify why keiths series which has similar seasonality and latitudinal emphasis to phils series differs in large part in exactly the opposite direction that phils does from ours this is the problem we all picked up on everyone in the room at ipcc was in agreement that this was problem and potential distractiondetraction from the reasonably concensus viewpoint wed like to show w the jones et and mann et series i am not sure this is true if the relevant series of ours is used we need to reexamine the curves and perhaps look at the different regional and seasonal data in the instrumental record and over common regions in the different reconstructed series we would be happy to work with you on this also remember that our density series does not claim hemispheric or annual coverage so if we show keiths series in this plot we have to comment that something else is responsible for the discrepancies in this case perhaps keith can help us out bit by explaining the processing that went into the series and the potential factors that might lead to it being warmer than the jones et and mann et series we would need to put in few words in this regard otherwise the skeptics have an field day casting doubt on our ability to understand the factors that influence these estimates and thus can undermine faith in the paleoestimates the best approach here is for us to circulate paper addressing all the above points ill do this as soon as possible i dont think that doubt is scientifically justified and id hate to be the one to have to give it fodder the recent crowley and lowery multiproxy estimate is an important additional piece of information which i have indeed incorporated into the revised draft tom actually estimates the same mean warming since the 17th century in his reconstruction that we estimate in ours so it is an added piece of information that phil and i are probably in the ballpark tom has used somewhat independent set of high and lowresolution proxy data and very basic compositing methodology similar to bradley and jones so there is some independent new information in this estimate fair enough but i repeat that the magnitude of the observed warming in the 20th century is different in summer and annual data one other key result with respect to our own work is from paper in the press in earth interactions an unofficial version is available here httpwwwngdcnoaagovpaleoeiei_coverhtml the key point we emphasize in this paper is that the lowfrequency variability in our hemispheric temperature reconstruction is basically the same if we dont use any dendroclimatic indicators at all though we certainly resolve less variance cant get skillful reconstruction as far back and there are notable discrepancies at the decadal and interannual timescales believe i need to add sentence to the current discussion on this point since there is an unsubstantiated kneejerk belief that our lowfrequency variability is suppressed by the use of tree ring data we have shown that this is not the case see here httpwwwngdcnoaagovpaleoeiei_datarevhtml and specifically the plot and discussion here httpwwwngdcnoaagovpaleoeiei_nodendrohtml ironically youll note that there is more lowfrequency variability when the tree ring data are used then when only other proxy and historicalinstrumental data are used this is certainly relevant and sounds really interesting i need to look at this in detail the effect of the including treering data or not is moderated by the importance of the particular series in the various reconstructions relative coefficient magnitudes there is certainly some prospect of affecting reducing the apparent magnitude of the 20th century warming by loading on highpass filtered chronologies but equally danger of exagerating it if the series used or emphasised in th calibration have been fertilized by co2 or something else as you know we tim phil and i would love to collaborate with you on exploring this issue and the role of instrumental predictors in the various approaches the key here is knowing much more about the role of specific predictors through time and their associated strengths and weaknesses so i think were in the position to sayresolve somewhat more than frankly than keith does about the temperature history of the past millennium and the issues ive spelled out all have to be dealt with in the chapter i certainly do not disagree with you the scale of your input data undoubtedly must contain more information than our set i have never implied anything to the contrary i do not believe that our data are likely to tell us more than summer variability at northern latitudes the discussion is only about how close our and your data likely represent what they are calibrated against back in time lets not imagine disagreement where there is none one last point we will like it or not have substantial opportunityrequirement to revise much of this discussion after review so we dont have to resolve everything now just the big picture and the important details im sure we can can up with an arrangement that is amenable to all and im looking forward to hearing back from keith phil and chris in particular about the above so we can quickly move towards finalizing first draft yes indeed the reviewing will lead to much comment and likely disagreement by the masses this is the way of these things it is always thankless task undertaking these drafting jobs and i think you are doing good job tommorrow ill send some very minor comments on typos and the like if you want them or have you picked many of them up anyway keep up the good work best wishes keith
