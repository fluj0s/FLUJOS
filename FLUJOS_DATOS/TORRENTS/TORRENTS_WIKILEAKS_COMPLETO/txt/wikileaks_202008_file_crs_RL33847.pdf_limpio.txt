security dhs issued an interim final rule 72 federal register 1768817745 on chemical facility security implementing the statutory authority granted in the homeland security appropriations act 2007 pl 109295 s ection 550 the regulations require chemical facilities possessing amounts and types of substances considered by the secretary to be hazardous to notify dhs and undergo conseque ncebased screening process the secretary then determines which chemical facilities are highrisk and thus need to comply with additional security requirements highrisk facilities are to be categorized into tiers based on ris k and those with higher risk must comply with more stringent performan cebased security requirements under the interim final rule highrisk chemical facilities are required to create and submit to dhs vulne rability assessmen t create and submit to dhs site security plan addressing the vulnerability assessment and complying with the performancebased standards and implement the site security plan at the chemical facility the secretary is to approve or di sapprove each step in the process and may require the chemical facility to improve the submission or implementation the interim final rule establishes new category of protected information chemicalterrorism vulnerability information cvi granting it status between sensitive but unclassified and classified in formation the secretary has discretion over access to this information how it may be used and what will comprise cvi while the interim final rule states it may preempt future state and local chemical facility security regulations the 110th congress has narrowed such preemption to when federal regulations have an actual c onflict with state and local regulations these regulations highlight key issues bated in previous congresses these issues include what facilities should be c onsidered as chemical facilities which chemical facilities should be c onsidered as highrisk and thus regulated the scope of the riskbased performan ce standards for different ers of highrisk chemical facilities the appropriatene ss and scope of federal pr eemption of existing state chemical facility security regulation and the availab ility of information for public comment potential litigation and congressional oversight one key issue not directly addressed by the regulation is the role of inherently safer technology congress may take further action since the statutory authority to regulate chemical facilities expires in 2009 policym akers may choose to observe the impact of the current regulations and if necessa ry address any percei ved weaknesses at later date congress might attempt to influence its implementation through oversight and report language or thr ough additional legislation congress addressed concerns over state preemption through the conso lidated appropriations act 2008 pl 110 161 authorizing bills hr 1530 hr 1574 hr 1633 hr 5533 and hr 5577 on chemical facility secu rity have been

homeland security presidential directivehspd7 december 17 2003chemical facility security regulation and issues for congress introduction chemical facility security has been an issue of congressional interest for many years first considered an environmenta l issue the potential for release of toxic chemicals and the associated potential health impacts on surrounding areas became linked to concerns over terrorism followi ng the september 11 2001 attacks the passage of section 550 of the homeland security appr opriation act 2007 pl 109 295 established statutory authority for th department of home land security dhs to regulate security at select chemical facilities1 how dhs implements this authority will likely be an area of intense congressional interest given that chemical facility security legislation was introduced in each of the previous four congresses and that this new statutory authority expires three years after enactment2 chemical facility security authority had been called for by both the executive and legislative branches for many year s but disagreements about how chemical facilities should be re gulated impeded consensus the potential for injuries and fatalities following an attack on chemical facility as well as the value of the chemical sector to the national economy d many security experts to suggest that chemical facilities are highvalue targets for terrorists securing chemical facilities is considered key component of prot ecting the nations critical infrastructure3 enactment of pl 109295 and promulgation of the interim final rule were seen by stakeholders as important steps in protecting chemical facilities against terrorist attack however any increase in homeland security will depend on their effective implementation this report describes the statutory author ity granted to dhs and the interim final rule promulgated by dhs and identifies select issues of contention related to the interim final rule finally this report discusses several possible policy options for congresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33847crs2 4 these interim final regulations must be issued within six months of the date of enactment of pl 109295 the statutory deadline for th interim final regulations was april 4 2007 regulations were issued april 9 2007 5 by statute some facilities are exempt from these regulations they are facilities defined as water system or wastewater treatment works facilities owned or operated by the department of defense or department of energy facilities regulated by the nuclear regulatory commission and those facilities regulated under the maritime transportation security act of 2002 pl 107295 6 according to the white house office of management and budget performance standard is standard that states requirements in term s of required results with criteria for verifying compliance but without stating the methods fo r achieving required results performance standard may define the functional require ments for the item

secured while prescriptive standard might dictate the height and type of fence to be used to secure the perimeterauthority to regulate chemical facilities the homeland security appropriations act 2007 pl 109295 section 550 provides statutory authority to dhs to regulate chemical facilities for security purposes this law directed the secretary of homeland security to issue interim final regulations establishing riskbased performance standards for chemical facility security and requiring the development of vulnerability assessments and the development and imple mentation of site security plans4 the law specified that these regulations are to apply only to those chemical facilities that the secretary determines present high levels of security risk5 furthermore the regulations are to allow regulated entities to employ combinations of security measures to meet the riskbased performance standards6 under the law the secretary must revi ew and approve the required assessment plan and implementation for each facility the statute pr ohibits the secretary from disapproving site security plan on the basis of the presence or absence of particular security measure but the secretary may disapprove site security plan that does not meet the riskbased performance standards the secretary may approve vulnerability assessments and site security plans created through security programs not developed by dhs so long as the resu lts of these programs meet the riskbased performance standards blished in regulation information developed for these regula tions is to be protected from public disclosure but may be shared at the s ecretarys discretion with state and local government officials including law forcement officials and first responders possessing the necessary security clearances such shared information may not be publicly disclosed regardless of state or local laws and is exempt from the freedom of information act foia additionally the information provided to the secretaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33847crs3 7 72 federal register 1768817745 april 9 2007 this interim final rule followed the release of an advanced notice of rulemaking see 71 federal register 7827678332 december 28 2006 8 this initial screening of chemical facilities will be done on the basis of potential consequence rather than risk it is uncle ar whether compliance with the regulation would reduce the risk status of the chemical facility since regulatory compliance would presumably decrease the vulnerability of the fa cility and vulnerability is factor used to determine risk status 72 federal register 1768817745 april 9 2007 at 17700along with related vulne rability information is to be tr eated as classified information in all judicial and administrative proceedings violation of the information protection provision is punishable by fine the secretary must audit and inspect chemical facilities and determine regulatory compliance if the secretary finds facility not in compliance the secretary shall write to the facility expl aining the deficien cies found provide an opportunity for the facility to consult with th secretary and issue an order to comply by date determined by the secretary if the facility continues to be out of compliance the secretary may fine and ev entually order the facility to close only the secretary of dhs may bring lawsuit against facility owner to enforce provisions of the law the w does not affect any other federal law regulating chemicals in commerce the statute contains sunset provision and expires on october 4 2009 three year s from the date of enactment section 550 was amended by the conso lidated appropriations act 2008 pl 110161 and established states right to promulgate chemical facility security regulation that is at least as stringent as the federal chemical facility security regulation only in the case of an actua l conflict between th federal and state regulation would the state regulation be pr eempted the scope of an actual conflict was not further defined regulations issued by the department of homeland security on april 9 2007 the departme nt of homeland security issued an interim final rule regarding chemical facility security7 this interim final rule implementing pl 109295 entered into force on june 8 2007 the interim final ru implements both statutory authority explicit in pl 109295 and authorities dhs found to be implicitly granted under the interim final rule the secretary of dhs will determine which chemical facilities must meet the security requirements of these regulations the decision is to be based on the degree of risk posed by each facility8 chemical facilities with greater than specified quantities of potentially dangerous chemicals arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33847crs4 9 the list contains approximately 300 chemical s and is specified as appendix to the regulation 72 federal register 6539665435 november 20 2007 10 audit

into riskbased tiers the dhs is to establish differen t performancebased requirements for facilities assigned to each riskbased tier those facilities identified by dhs as high risk will have additional re sponsibilities all highrisk facilities must assess their vulnerabilities develop an effective security plan submit these documents to dhs and implement their security plan vulnerability assessments and site security plans developed through alte rnative security programs will be accepted so long as they meet the tiered performancebased requirements of the interim final rule in turn dhs will approve or disapprove the vulnerability assessments the site security plans and their implementation through aud it and inspection the dhs will provide certification of the facilitys compliance status10 the vulnerability assessment will serve two purposes under the interim final rule one is to determine or confirm the placement of the facility in riskbased tier the other is to provide baseline against which to compare the site security plan activities the dhs requires the vulnerability assessment to include the following components asset characterization threat assessment security vulnerability analysis risk assessment and c ountermeasures analysis11 the site security plans must address the vulnerability assessment by describing how activities in the plan correspond to fac ility vulnerabilities additionally the site security plan must address preparations for and deterrents against specific modes of potential terrorist attack as applicable these modes of attack may include vehicle borne improvised explosive device wate rborne explosive device ground assault or other modes of potential attack identified by dhs12 the site security plans must also describe how the activities taken by the facility meet the riskbased performance standards provided by dhs all vulnerability assessments and site security plans are to be submitted to dhs for approval the secretary may disapprove those assessments or plans that fail to meet dhs standards but not on the basis of the presence or absence of specific measure in the case of disapproval dhs must identify in writing those areas of the assessment and plan that need improvement chemical facilities may appeal disapprovals to dhs the information generated under this interim final rule as well as any information developed for chemical facility security purposes that the secretary determines needs to be protected will be labeled chemicalterrorism vulnerabilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33847crs5 13 id at 17738

or affected companies may request decision from dhs regarding potential conflict between the regulations since promulgation of the interim final rule congress has amended the dhss statutory authority for chemical facility security to state that such preemp tion will occur only in the case of an actual conflict the dhs has not yet issued revi sed regulations addre ssing this change in statute the interim final rule establishes penalties for lack of compliance and the disclosure of cvi information if f acility remains out of compliance with this interim final rule dhs may order its closure after other penalties such as fines have been levied the interim final rule establishes the process by which chemical facilities can appeal dhs decisions and rulings key issues chemical facility security was the focus of several congressional hearings and policy debates surrounding propos ed legislation in the 109th congress legislation reported by the house homeland security committee and the senate committee on homeland security and governme ntal affairs some but not all of the topics that were considered contentious were addressed by pl 109295 even so many of these topics have remained issues of interest to the 110th congress this section describes several of these topi cs in light of the enacted provisions the scope of the regulated facilities inherently safer technology federal preemption and the protection of information scope of regulated facilities pl 109295 did not specify which f acilities should be re gulated and this remains an issue of policy debate under the interim final rule chemical facilities shall mean any establishment that possesse s or plans to possess at any relevant point in time quantity of chemical substance determined by the secretary to be potentially dangerous or that meets othe r riskrelated criteria identified by the department15 regulated or covered facilities represent only portion of all chemical facilities being those that present high risk of significant adverse c onsequences for humanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33847crs6 16 id 17 72 federal register 6539665435 november 20 2007 18 the environmental protection agencys ri sk management program program whose list of chemicals is almost wholly subsumed w ithin the dhs list of chemicals of interest is estimated to regulate approximately 15000 facilities some of these facilities would fall within the statutory exemptions to chemical security regulation such as water or wastewater treatment facilities 19 in 2005 dhs testified that approximately 3400 chemical facilities were considered high risk having the ability to impact 1000 or more people testimony of robert b stephan assistant secretary for infrastructure protec tion department of homeland security before the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs on june 15 2005 the use of consequence threshold as an appr oximation of risk as is used in the initial screening procedure would likely capture all highrisk facilities if the consequence threshold was set at low level that tactic might also capture many nonhighrisk facilities 20 72 federal register 1768817745 april 9 2007

assets if subjected to terrorist attack compromise inf iltration or exploitation16 the chemical substances determined by the secretary to be potentially dangerous were reported with the interim final rule final rule reporting the list of chemical substances of interest promulgated as appendix to the interim final rule has been released by dhs17 the dhs sought public comment on the chemical list and the final rulemaking incorporated dhss responses to these comments the list includes chemicals from the environmental protection agencys risk management program list the chemical weapons conve ntion schedules and the department of transportations list of haza rdous materials the list specifies the amount of each chemical that triggers the reporting requirement the dhs established three thresholds for chemical rel ease for chemical theft or diversion and for sabotage or contamination f acilities must assess the chemi cals on hand for each type of threshold the rules definition of chemical facility may describe many facilities18 while many if not most of these facilities would not be highrisk dhs will require all of these chemical facilities to complete consequencebased sc reening questionnaire to determine their risk category19 the dhs will treat facilities not completing such questionnaire as presumptively highrisk20 such an approach may tax dhs resources as well as negatively impact small businesses especially during the initial screening process retail propane dealers for example have asserted that they would be adversely affected by the proposed threshold21

and programs directorate department of homeland security before the house committee on homeland security subcommittee on transportation security and infrastructure protection december 12 2007facility have asserted that because of the low threshold for some chemicals of interest they are likely to have to report to dhs as chemical facility22 in responding to public comment on the rule dhs appears to have attempted to address these specific concerns among others for example the threshold amount for propane was increased so that dhs could focus their security screening effort on industrial and major consum ers regional suppliers bulk retail and storage sites and away from nonindustria l propane customers23 other thresholds have also been increased from the initial proposed threshol d universities and colleges which may have significant burden in inventorying their chemical holdings have been granted the option of requesting add itional time to perform nece ssary work before coming into compliance with the chemical facility regulations24 the department expects th at roughly 40000 facilities w ill be required to comply with the reporting requirements of the regulations the department estimates that between 1500 nd 6500 facilities eventually w ill be covered by risk based performance measure requirements such facilities would have completed the initial screening process and been categor ized as falling within one of the four regulated risk tiers25 as of december 2007 more than 16000 facilities had registered with dhs with more than 1000 having completed submitting the required screening information26 inherently safer technology considerable congressional debate on ch emical facility secu rity revolved around the issue of inherently safer technology during this debate the application of inherently safer technology as risk reducing security measure was generally supported by environmental groups and opposed by industry groups environmental groups proposed that reducing the inherent consequences from re lease at chemical facility would increase its security as the incentive to attack such lower consequence facility would be reduced industry groups argued that chemical substance and technology changes were bus iness and process sa fety concerns not related to security issues and best left to the discretion of the chemical facility rather than the federal government both the statute and the interim final rule are silent on the issue of inherently safer technology neither recommend nor prohibit the use of inherently safer technology as security method assuming th at it contributes to meeting the riskhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33847crs8 27 see cong rec h796869 daily ed september 29 2006 statement of rep barton stating that during negotiations it was di scussed and consciously decided among the authorizing committee negotiators to not incl ude provision exempting this section from federal preemption because we do not want

daily ed september 29 2006 statement of rep king noting that the intent of the committee was not to preempt state authority in adopting requi rements more stringent than federal standards and concluding that it is our understandi ng and we had the opinion of committee counsel on this that the bill language does not preempt states 28 new jersey arguably the state with the mo st stringent chemical security regulations requires the consideration of inherently safer technology as component of facilitys security plan 29 72 federal register 1768817745 april 9 2007 at 17727 30 72 federal register 1768817745 april 9 2007 at 17727 stating that dhs does not view its regulatory scheme as one which so fu lly occupies the field as to preempt any state law touching the same subjectbased performance standards put forth by dhs the riskbased performance standards appear more focused on hardening facilities than on consequence mitigation techniques altern atively use of inherently safer technology may reduce the quantity or type of chemical stored on site possibly removing the chemical facility from regulation both the statute nd the interim final rule in establishing riskbased performance standards expressl prohibit requiring any specific security measure from chemical facilities federal preemption another area of congressional debate was whether federal chemical facility security legislation should preempt such activities on the state level27 several states have begun to enact security regulations for chemical facilities28 supporters of explicit federal preemption assert that patchwork of state regulation provides competitive disadvantage to companies on statebystate basis and may lead to uneven security efforts opponents of exp licit federal preemption claim that federal security regulation should set floor rath er than ceiling for security efforts individual states should in their opinion be allowed to require additional security measures so long as the fe deral standard is surpassed the statute was originally silent with respect to preemption however the interim final rule contains language indicating that dhs reserves the authority to preempt conflicting state requirements according to dhs the balance struck by pl 109295 between dhs security requireme nts and facilitys flexibility to choose specific security measures must be preserved29 the interim final rules explanatory statement distinguishes consistent with federal case law between field preemption and conflict preempti on asserting that the depar tment intends only the latter to apply to chemical security regulations30 as an example dhs notes that congresss delegation of authority extends only to those facilities that pose high levels ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33847crs9 31

regulate any facility that dhs has determined not to be encompassed by this classification31 according to the statute the secretary may not disapprove site security plan submitted under this section based on the pres ence or absence of particular security measure32 the federal chemical facility security regulation thus does not require the application or use of any particular secu rity measure the interim final rule then seems to imply that any state regulation that does require specific security measure would have been preempted because it conflicts with hinders poses an obstacle to or frustrates the purposes of these regulations or of any approval disapproval or order issued thereunder33 although dhs has indicated that it s not reviewed all existing state regulations for preemption purposes they assert that these existing state regulations are unlikely to be preempted by the interim final rule future state regulations however may be found to be preempted it seems likely that prescriptive state regulations would be interpreted by dhs as preempted by the performancebased federal regulation34 subsequent to promulgation of the chemical facility security regulations congress passed the consolidated appr opriations act 2008 pl 110161 this law contained provision that established states right to establish chemical facility security regulation that is at least as stringent as the federal chemical facility security regulation only in the case of an actua l conflict between th federal and state regulation would the state regulation be pr eempted the dhs has not yet altered its chemical facility regulation to incorporate this change in statute consequently it is not yet known exactly how dhs will impleme nt this provision in regulation or how dhs will determine whether actual conflict arises between state and federal regulation information availability another issue that generated considerable congressional intere st and debate was how and to what extent the

security which incl udes defense against transn ational terrorism and the original classification authority is able to identify and describe the damage49 as result of this congressional mandate and the nature of the information at issue dhs has indicated that in admin istrative proceedings and litigation before courts cvi will only be disc losed under the narrowest of parameters c onsistent with executive orders and other congressional enactments in administrative proceedings dhs indicates that cvi will only be disclosed at the secretarys sole discretion and only when it is necessary for the pers on to prepare response to allegations contained in legal enforcement acti on document issued by the department50 even in such circumstance dhs reserves the right to require the requesting person or entity to undergo and satisfy security background check before receiving the information51 similarly in litigation arising out of enforcement actions whether civil or criminal dhs has implemented system of applicable procedures akin to those contained in both the classifi ed information protection act52 and at 18 usc 2339b for example dhs w ill permit reviewing courts after an opportunity to independently view the documents to authorize one of the following as substitute for cvi sought in discovery 1 redact ed version of the cvi documents 2 summary of the information contained in the cvi documents or 3 statement admitting relevant facts that the cvi documents would tend to prove53 the interim final rule also provides protections against the disclosure of cvi through live witness

meaning of the expiration provision of pl 109295 appears to be the subject of some uncertainty the statute states interim regulations issued under this ction shall apply until the effective date of interim or final regulations promulgated under other laws that establish requirements and standards referred to in subsection and expressly supercede this section provided that the authority provided by this section shall terminate three years after the date of enactment of this act58 in the preamble to dhss proposed regulations the department suggests that notwithstanding the plain text of the stat ute should future f unds be appropriated by congress even in the absence of an authorizing statute the regulations and the authority to enforce them would conti nue as though sufficiently authorized59 as general rule there is specific st atutory or other gal requirements that appropriations be preceded by specific au thorizations as result congress may subject to possible pro cedural points of order60 appropriate funds for programs that exceed the scope andor duration of pr ior authorization in instances where congress has opted for this type of action the enacted appropriation has been interpreted by the comptroller general to in effect carry with it its own authorization and therefore is to be av ailable to the agency for obligation and expenditure61 in addition the comptroller genera l has also held that as general proposition the appropriation of funds for program whose funding authorization has expired or is about to expire during th period of availability of the appropriation eg authorization expires during fiscal year for which money has already been appropriated provides sufficien t legal basis to continue program during that

proposed regulation and th interim final rule has been mixed some policymakers and advocates have criticized the approach taken by dhs others have been supportive as written the law anticipates further legislative activity in this area policymakers may decide to wait and observe how the final interim rule is implemented attempt to influence dhss implementation of the interim final rule or legislate to alter or supersede the enacted legislation maintain status quo the authority to federally regulate chemical facility security is new as such regulation in this area may need time to mature congress when passing pl 109 295 contemplated the eventual s upersession of these regulations interim regulations issued under this ction shall apply until the effective date of interim or final regulations promulgated under other laws that establish requirements and standards referred to in subsection and expressly supersede this section provided that the authority provided by this section shall terminate three years after the date of enactment of this act67 policymakers may view this regulatory au thority and thus these regulations as stopgap measure providing temporary so lution to the perceived chemical security problem with the intent of allowing the security policy debate to further mature in this case policymakers may decide to wait allowing dhs to implement its interim final rule before considering changes in chemical facility security policy this might more fully reveal the impacts of the current regulation attempt to influence implementation the statutory language of pl 109295 section 550 grants significant discretion to the secretary the interpretation and application of this discretion by the secretary particularly in the areas of information protection and state preemption were the source of some of the criticisms levied against the proposed regulations68httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33847crs16 68 continued jose mercury news december 22 2006

efficient implementation of regulatory structure policymakers may believe that execution of this discretionary authority has been c ounter to congressional intent policymakers may decide to influence the manner in which the secretary exercises this discretion the dhs requested public comment from interested parties on questions issues and the proposed regulatory language69 as such the comments of policymakers advocates and interested parties influenced the form and language of the interim final rule through comments to the docket policymakers expressed support for and criticism of the proposed regulations70 the docket for the proposed regulation closed on february 7 2007 the interim final rule promulgated on april 9 2007 took account of these comments addressi ng them as the department deemed appropriate policymakers may conclude that they are dissatisfied with the form of the interim final rule if this is the case policymakers could act to more explicitly describe and limit the discretionary scope granted to the secretary they may influence the interim final rules implementation through the congressional oversight process by clarifying congressional intent through hearings on the interim final rules implementation or through language added to dhs appropriations reports legislative alternatives policymakers may decide that additional legislation is necessary in the chemical facility security area such legislation could be targeted in nature attempting to remedy perceived flaws by slightly altering the existing authorities granted to dhs or more comprehensive more compre hensive approach ma make substantive changes in the existing authorities and thus extensive revision of any chemical facility security regulation policymakers may ultimately decide that the regulatory structure established by dhs does not satisfy homeland security need s or will prove too onerous to industry and opt to enact new chemical facility legi slation such legislation might expand the reach of the regulatory structure for example by mandating the inclusion of particular chemical substances as pot entially dangerous restrict the scope of regulation for example by lowering regu latory burdens or requirements on small businesses or direct the agency to incl ude or exclude partic ular components from its regulationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33847crs17 71 fy2008 appropriations for dhs were provided through the consolidated appropriations act 2008 pl 110161 rather than an independent appropriations actdeveloping new legislation or changing existing legislation to alter the dhs interim final rule may bring additional costs especially to facilities that have already come into compliance if new regula tions established unde r new or amended authority present new requirements for chemical facilities security efforts enacted under the original interim final rule ma not be entirely applicable chemical facilities may be required to invest in additional security measures to meet these new requirements potentially incurring further cost when considering whether to enact new legislation or amend existing law policymakers may opt to consider methods to mitigate additional costs to chemical facilities that have already complied with the interim final rule as the initial statute had threeyear sunset provision congress may have intended that fu ture

antiterrorism act of 2008 hr 5577 would codify amend and further define dhs s authority to regulate chemical facility security regulations conforming to the new statut ory authority would apply upon the sunset of the current statutory authority th new statutory authority would require regulated entities to assess the applicability of i nherently safer technologies methods to reduce the consequences of terrorist attack and on the dhs secretarys determination imp lement such technologies the dhs secretary would also provide chemical facilities with information on the use and availability of such technologies the act would also require the dhs secretary to establish process for confidential reporting of problems deficiencies or vulnerabilities at covered chemical facility
