fairness reflected in the us tax code is that families at the low end of the income spectrum especially those near the poverty threshold should not be subject to the federa l income tax since the major components of the federal income tax that govern these tax thresholds are indexed for inflation nominal dollar federal individual income tax thresholds change every year1 this report presents the tax thresholds for various fa mily income levels for tax year 2004 this report will not be updated the major structural components of the tax code that influence the income levels at which various households become subject to the federal income ta x include the standard deduction the personal exemption the child ta x credit and the earned income tax credit eitc each of these items increases the level at which familys income becomes subject to the federal income tax2 in contrast to the federal income tax all earned income is subject to the social security tax consider the case of married couple with one dependent child under the age of 17 in 2004 the standard deduction for married couple filing joint return is 9700 each personal exemption is worth 3100 and the child tax credit is 1000 for each qualifying child this family would reach the basic inco tax threshold for their filing status and family size at an income level of 19000 standard deduction of 9700 plus three personal exemptions of 3100 each income under this amount would not be subject to tax while any income over this amount w ould be taxed starting at 10 rate although income over this amount is subject to tax the child tax credit would offset this couples first 1000 of income tax lia bility hence this couple could earn anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21841crs2 additional 10000 of income nd still have net income tax liability 10000 of income at 10 tax rate resu lts in tax liability of 1000 that is exactly offset by the 1000 child tax credit at this point the eitc would come into play the maximum eitc for 2004 for families with one child is 2604 the maximu m credit begins to phase out for families filing joint returns with in comes above 15040 and is reduced to zero for families whose incomes exceed 31338 the income tax threshol d for the family in this example is the point at which the eitc is just enough to ffset any preeitc income tax liability so that the net tax liability of the family is still zero in the case of couple with one dependent child filing joint return the income level is 30435 at this income level the familys preeitc and postchild tax credit income tax liability is 144 and the familys eitc is also 144 the two offset each other and the family does not have any net income tax liability at incomes below the income tax threshol d the eitc is large enough that it more than offsets income tax liability and the fa mily gets refund for the excess subject to certain restrictions at in come levels above the income tax threshold the eitc has been reduced to the point that it longer fully offsets the entire income tax liability and the family ends up with net income tax liability the income tax thresholds for selected households in 2004 are shown in the table 1 table 1
