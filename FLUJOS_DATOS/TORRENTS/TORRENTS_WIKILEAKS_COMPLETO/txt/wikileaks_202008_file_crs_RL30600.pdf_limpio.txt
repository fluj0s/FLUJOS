reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra repeals the estate tax in 2010 during the phaseout period the new law increases the exempt amount to 35 million by 2009 and lowers the top rate to 45 by 2007 the federal gift tax remains though the rate is reduced to the top personal income tax rate and the exemption is separate from the estate tax exemption after repeal of the estate tax carryover basis replaces stepup in basis for assets transferred at death the legislation includes an exemption from carryover basis for capital gains of 13 million and an additional 3 million for surviving spouse however the estate tax provision in egtrra automatically sunsets december 31 2010 thus far in the 110 th congress seven bills to permanently repeal the estate tax have been introduced in the house and four in the senate seven bills to retain but modify the estate tax have been introduced in the house and one in the senate the repeal bills differ on whether or not they would preserve the other changes made by egtrra to the taxation of gifts and the basis for inherited assets the modification bills differ on th level of the exclusion what year it would take effect whether or not it would be indexe d for inflation and whether any unused exclusion could be carried over to the estate of the surviving spouse the treasury has estimated that repealing the sunset provision of egtrra would reduce receipts by 1497 billion through 2013 supporters of the estate and gift tax cite its contribution to progressivity in the tax system and to the need for tax due to the forgiveness of capital gains taxes on appreciated assets held until death arguments are also made that inheritances represent windfall to heirs that are more appropriate sources of tax revenue than income earned through work and effort critics of the estate tax argue that it reduces savings and makes it difficult to pass on family businesses critics also argue that death is not an appropriate time to impose tax that much wealth has already been taxed through income taxes and that complexity of the tax imposes administrative and compliance burdens that undermine the progressivity of the tax the analysis in this study suggests that the estate tax is highly progressive although progressivity is undermined by avoidance mechanisms neither economic theory nor empirical evidence indicate that the estate tax is likely to have much effect on savings although some family businesses are burdened by the tax only small percentage of estate tax revenues are derived from family businesses even though there are many estate tax avoidance techniques it also is possible to reform the tax and reduce these complexities as an alternative to eliminating the tax thus the evaluation of the estate tax may largely turn on the appropriateness of such revenue source and its interaction with incentives for charitable giving state estate taxes and capital gains and other income taxes this report will be updated as legislative events warrant httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30600g7g156g157g138g157g142g561g138g151g141g561g9g146g143g157g561g22g138 g161g142g156g497g561g7g140g152g151g152 g150g146g140g561g11g156g156g158g142

tax has been and will continue to be the subject of significant legislative interest the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra pl 10716 repeals the estate tax after 2009 however the legislation sunsets after 2010 reverting back to the law as it existed in 2001 congress could eliminate the sunset provision in egtrra thus making repeal of the estate tax permanent repeal of the sunset would retain the egtrra changes to the taxation of capital gains of inherited assets and the gift tax immediate repeal of the estate and gift tax in 2001 would have cost up to 662 billion over 10 years an amount in excess of the projected tate tax yield of 409 billion because of projected behavioral responses that would also lower income tax revenues eg more life time transfers to donees in lower tax brackets more purchase of life insurance with deferral aspects and lower compliance repealing the egtrra sunset wo uld cost 522 billion over the 20092018 budget window most of the revenue loss is in the out years 1497 billion over 2009 to 2013 and 3723 billion over 2014 to 2018 1 immediate repeal as opposed to eventual repeal beyond 2010 would be more expensive thus far in the 110th congress seven bills to permanently repeal the estate tax have been introduced in the house and four in the senate seven bills to retain but modify the estate tax have been introduced in the house and one in the senate the repeal bills differ on whether or not they would preserve the other changes made by egtrra to the taxation of gifts and the basis for inherited assets the modification bills differ on th level of the exclusion what year it would take effect whether or not it would be indexe d for inflation and whether any unused exclusion could be carried over to the estate of the surviving spouse potential revenue loss estimates are available for these proposals proponents of an estate and gift tax argue that it contributes to progressivity in the tax system by taxing the rich note however that there is way to objectively determine the optimal degree of progressivity in tax system related argument is that the tax reduces the concentration of wealth and its perceived adverse consequences for society2 moreover while the estate and gift tax is relatively small as revenue source yielding 26 billion in 2007 and accounting for 1 of federal revenue it raises not insignificant amount of revenuerevenue that could increase in the future due to strong performance of stock market and growth in inter generational transfers as the baby boom generation ages eliminating or reducing the tax would either require some other tax to be increased some spending program to be reduced or an increase in the national debt in addition to the extent that inherited wealth is seen as windfall to the recipient such tax may be seen by some as fairer than taxing earnings that are the result of work and effort finally many economists suggest that an important rationale for maintaining an estate tax is the escape of unrealized capital gains from any taxation since heirs receive steppedup basis of assets families that accrue large gains through the appreciation of their wealth in assets can in the 1 us department of the treasury general explanations of the administrations fiscal year 2009 revenue proposals washington feb 2008 p 129 2 possible consequences that have been discussed include concentrations of political power inefficient investments by the very wealthy and disincentives to work by heirs often referred to as the carnegie conjecture reflecting claim argued by andrew carnegie httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30600g7g156g157g138g157g142g561g138g151g141g561g9g146g143g157g561g22g138 g161g142g156g497g561g7g140g152g151g152 g150g146g140g561g11g156g156g158g142 g156g561 g561

passing on the assets to their heirs the estate tax also encourages giving to charity since charitable contributions are deductible from the estate tax base since charitable giving is generally recognized as an appropriate object of subsidy the presence of an estate tax with such deduction may be seen as one of the potential tools for encouraging charitable giving critics of the estate and gift tax typically make two major arguments the estate and gift tax discourages savings and investments and the tax imposes an undue burden on closely held family businesses including farms in the latter case the argument is made that the estate tax forces the breakup of family businesses without adequate liquidity to pay the tax critics also suggest that the estate and gift tax is flawed as method of introducing progressivity because there are many methods of avoiding the tax methods that are more available to very wealthy families although this criticism could support reform of the tax as well as repeal related criticism is that the administrative and compliance cost of an estate and gift tax is onerous relative to its yield again however this argument could also be advanced to support reform rather than repeal in general there may also be feeling that death is not desirable time to impose tax indeed the critics of the estate and gift tax often refer to the tax as death tax critics also argue that some of the wealth passed on in estates has generally already been subject to capital income taxes the remainder of this report following brief ex planation of how the tax operates analyzes these arguments for and against the tax the report concludes with an inventory and discussion of alternative policy options

that occurs when someone dies or gives gift filing an estate tax return can be difficult depending on the value and complexity of the estate the purpose here is to outline the mechanics of the estate and gift tax the first section begins with brief review of the general rules accompanied with numerical example there are some minor provisions of the law that are not discussed here however such as the phase out of the graduated rates and the credit for taxes on property recently transferred 3 the second section summarizes the special rules for farms and sm all businesses and the final section briefly describes the generation skipping transfer tax the appendix of this report provides detailed data from returns filed in 2005 the latest year for which data are available

applicable credit which is identical to the filing threshold effectively exempts from taxation the portion of the 3 for history of the estate and gift tax as well as detailed explanation of current

decedents table a2 in the appendix provides the gross estate value for returns filed in 2006 by wealth category the data represent the returns filed in 2006 not the decedents in that year thus portion of the returns filed in 2006 are from estates valued in years before 2006 g3g149g149g152g160g138g139g149g142g561g6g142g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g156g561 deductions from the estate reduce the taxable portion of the gross estate and in turn the number of taxable returns in 2006 983 billion was deducted from estates the most valuable deduction is for bequests to surviving spouse 658 billion the most prevalent though smallest reported deduction is for funeral expenses 4151 million appendix table a3 lists the deductions in greater detail for returns filed in 2006 beginning in 2005 estates may deduct state estate taxes paid before 2005 taxpayers received federal credit for state death taxes paid that credit was phased out incrementally from 2002 through 2004 g22g138g161g138g139g149g142g561g7g156g157g138g157g142g561 after subtracting allowable deductions the remainder of the estate is the taxable estate taxable estate value was 1136 billion in 2006 adjusted taxable gifts are then added to the taxable estate to arrive upon the adjusted taxable estate an individual is allowed to exclude 12000 in gifts per year per donee from taxable gifts thus only the amount exceeding the 12000 limit is added back to the taxable estate only 10997 returns filed in 2006 included taxable gifts adding approximately 77 billion to the total estate value thus adjusted taxable estates were worth 1213 billion in 2006 generally the adjusted taxable estate represents the base of estate tax

tentative because the executor has not redeemed the applicable credit amount5 as noted earlier the credit for state estate and inheritance taxes was repealed and replaced with deduction beginning in 2005 g3g561g16g158g150g142g155g146g140g138g149g561g7g161g138g150g153g149g142g561 the remaining steps in calculating the estate and gift tax are most easily exhibited through numerical example to accomplish this we first assume decedent who dies in 2008 has an 4 26 irc 2001c 5 the federal credit for state death taxes paid was repealed beginning in 2005 see table a4 in the appendix for the old

million and leaves 2 million to his wife and contributes 400000 to charitable organization we also assume the decedent has not made any taxable gifts leaving 26 million in his estate after deductions this simple example is exhibited below t able 1 numerical example 2008 r ules gross value 500 000 0 less hypot hetical marital deduction 200 000 0 less hypot hetical charitable c ontribution deduction 40 000 0 taxable estate 260 00 00 the taxable estate is valued at 26 million after the allowable deductions have been subtracted from the gross estate value6 the tax is applied to the 26 million in increments of estate value as provided for in the tax code for example the first increment of 10000 is taxed at 18 the second increment of 10000 is taxed at 20 the third increment of 20000 is taxed at 22 etc this process continues until the entire 26 million is taxed the last increment of estate value that from 15 million to 26 million is taxed at 45 rate thus even though this estate is in the 45 bracket only portion 11 million of the estate is taxed at the 45 rate g22g142g151g157g138g157g146g159g142g561g7g156g157g138g157g142g561g22g138g161g561 in 2006 the aggregate tentative estate tax after deductions and before credits was 503 billion returning to our example the 26 million taxable estate yields tentative estate tax of 1050800 recall however we have not yet considered the applicable

for decedents dying in 2008 the applicable credit is 780800 which leaves an estate tax due in our example of 270000 the applicable credit reduced the tentative estate tax by 274 billion in 2006

the state death tax credit reduced the federal estate tax due by 2615 million in 20067 this tax credit is determined by yet another tax rate schedule the taxable estate value which is 26 million in our example is reduced by standard exemption of 60000 and the credit rate schedule applies to the remainder egtrra reduces and eventually repeals the credit for state death taxes in 2004 the credit

the concentration of wealth and income through the tax and the possible adverse effect of the tax on savings behavior and family businesses there are number of other issues of fairness or efficiency

paid any estate tax9 this percentage can be contrasted with the income tax where most families and single individuals file tax returns and about 70 of those returns owe tax in addition out of the 13 of decedents whose estates pay tax about 70 of these had gross estates valued between 1 million and 25 million in 2004 which are the smallest based on gross estate value taxable estates evidence suggests that the average effective tax rate rises with the size of the estate except for the highest tax rate bracket as shown in table 3 columns f and g column f reports 2006 effective tax rates for the decedent before the credit for state death taxes and column g shows the actual amount paid to the federal government af ter all credits estates valued at less than the exemption amount of course pay taxes and the tax rate rises and then falls with the very largest estates despite the fact that the rates are graduated 9 mortality data for 2004 is the latest year available

gross estate value charitable deductions are the primary reason for the lower tax rate in the highest levels of the estate tax the charitable deduction accounts for 83 of estates on average but 178 in the highest wealth bracket the deduction for bequests left to spouse also rises as portion of the gross estate as estate size increases the progress ivity of the estate tax for the estates valued at less than 10 million is the result of the unified credit and the graduated rate structure the data in table 3 may actually overstate the amount of rate progression in the estate tax tax planning techniques such as gift tax exclusions or valuation discounts reduce the size of the gross estate and are more common with larger estates these techniques reduce the size of the estate but do not appear in the irs data thus the effective tax rates may be overstated for larger estates despite the lack of progressivity through all of the estate size brackets the principal point for distributional purposes is that the estate and gift tax is confined to the wealthiest of decedents and to tiny share of the population for example estates over 5 million accounted for 188 of taxable estates but accounted for 719 of estate tax revenues in 2006 thus to the extent that concentration of income and wealth are viewed as undesirable the estate tax plays some role albeit smallbecause few pay the taxin increasing income and wealth equality note also an effect that contradicts some claims made by opponents of the tax the carnegie conjecture suggests that large inheritances reduce labor effort by heirs10 thus the estate tax which reduces inheritances could increase output and economic growth because heirs work more increase their labor supply if their inheritance is reduced although

similar individuals differentially for variety of reasons special provisions for farmers and family businesses discussed subsequently can cause families with the same amount of wealth to be taxed

tax reduces savings since the estate and gift tax like capital income tax applies to wealth it may appear obvious that tax on wealth would reduce wealth however taxes on capital income do not necessarily reduce savings this ambiguous result arises from the opposing forces of an income and substitution effect an investment is made to provide future consumption if the rate of return rises because tax is cut more consumption might be shifted from the present to the future the substitution effect this effect in isolation would increase saving however the tax savings also increases the return earned on investment and allows higher consumption both today and in the future this effect is called an income effect and it tends to reduce saving its effect is most pronounced when the savings is for fixed target such as fund for college tuition or target bequest to an heir thus saving for precautionary reasons as hedge against bad events is less likely to increase when the rate of return rises than saving for retirement empirical evidence on savings responses while difficult to obtain suggests small effect of uncertain sign ie either positive or negative current events certainly suggest that savings fall when the rate of return rises as returns on stocks have increased dramatically the savings rate has plunged the same points can generally be made about tax on estates and gifts although some analysts suspect that an estate tax to be paid at distant date in the future would be less likely to have an effect in either direction than income taxes being paid currently reduction in estate taxes makes larger net bequest possible reducing the price of the bequest in terms of forgone consumption this substitution effect would cause savings to increase at the same time reduction in estate taxes causes the net estate to be larger allowing larger net bequest to be made with smaller amount of savings the income effect again the latter effect is most pronounced when there is target net bequest smaller gross bequest can be left and less savings required on the part of the decedent to achieve the net target unfortunately virtually empirical evidence about the effect of estate and gift taxes exists in part because these taxes have been viewed as small and relatively unimportant by most researchers and in part because there are tremendous difficulties in trying to link an estate and gift tax which occurs at the end of lifetime to annual savings behavior but reasonable expectation is that the effects of cutting the estate and gift tax on savings would not be large and would not even necessarily be positive httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30600g7g156g157g138g157g142g561g138g151g141g561g9g146g143g157g561g22g138

revenues are put if revenues are used to decrease the national debt they become part of government saving and it is more likely that cutting estate and gift taxes would reduce saving by decreasing government saving since there may be little or effect on private saving if they are used for government spending on consumption programs or transfers that are primarily used for consumption then it is less likely that cutting estate and gift taxes would reduce saving because the estate tax cut would be financed out of decreased consumption rather than decreased saving in this case reducing the tax would probably have small effect on national saving since the evidence suggests small effect on private saving similar effect would occur if tax revenues are held constant and the alternative tax primarily reduced consumption actually the estate and gift tax is in some ways more complicated to assess than tax on capital income or wealth there are variety of possible motives for leaving bequests which are likely to cause savings to respond differently to the estate tax in addition there are consequences for the heirs which may affect their savings several of these alternative motives and their consequences are outlined by gale and perozek 11 motives for leaving bequests include 1 altruism individuals want to increase the welfare of their children and other descendants because they care about them 2 accident individuals do not intentionally save to leave bequest but as fund to cover unexpected costs or the costs of living longer than expected thus bequests ar left by accident and are in the nature of precautionary savings 3 exchange parents promise to leave bequests to their children in exchange for services visiting looking after parents when they are sick and 4 joy of giving individuals get pleasure directly from giving with the pleasure depending on the size of the estate to gale and perozeks classifications we might add satiation when individuals have so much wealth that any consumption desire can be met the theoretical effects of these alternative theories on decedents and heirs are summarized in table 4 discussion of each follows in the text but it is interesting to see that there is tendency for estate taxes to increase saving not decrease it this effect occurs in part because there are double income effects that discourage consumption acting on both the decedent and the heir g3g149g157g155g158g146g156g157g146g140g561 when giving is motivated by altruism the effect of the tax is ambiguous as might not be surprising given the discussion of income and substitution effects the effects on the parents are ambiguous while the windfall receipt of an inheritance tends to reduce the need to save by the children that is the estate tax reduces the inheritances and thus increases saving by heirs the outcomes are also partly dependent on whether children think they can elicit larger inheritance by squandering their own money which causes them to save even less and whether the parent sees this problem and responds to it in way that forestalls it interestingly some parents might respond by spending lot of their assets before death to induce their children to be more responsible and save more the cost of doing this is the reduction in welfare of their children from the smaller bequest as compared with the parents benefit from consumption the estate tax 11 william g gale and maria g perozek do estate taxes reduce savings april 2000 presented at conference on estate and gift taxes sponsored by the office of tax policy research

reduced bequests for each dollar spent and causes the parents to consume more while these motivations and actions of parent and child can become complex this theory leaves us with an ambiguous effect on savings g3g140g140g146g141g142g151g157g138g149g561 in the second case where bequests are left because parents die before they have exhausted their resources the estate tax has effect on the saving of the parents indeed the parents are not really concerned about the estate tax since it has effect on the reason they are accumulating assets if they need the assets because they live too long or become ill tax will be paid bequests are windfall to children in this case and tend to increase their consumption thus taxing bequests because it reduces this windfall reduces their consumption and promotes savings if the revenue from the estate tax is saved by the government national saving rises if the revenue is spent on consumption there is effect on savings thus in this case the estate tax reduces private consumption and repealing it reducing the surplus would increase consumption reduce savings g7g161g140g145g138g151g144g142g561 in the third case parents are basically paying for childrens services with bequests and the estate tax becomes like tax on products the price for their childrens attention has increased not surprisingly the savings and size of bequest by the parents depends on how responsive they are to these price changes if the demand is less responsive to price changes price inelastic parents will save and bequeath more to make up for the tax to be sure of receiving their childrens services but if there are close substitutes they might save less bequeath less and purchase alternatives eg nursing home care in this model the childs saving is not affected since the bequest is payment for forgone wages or leisure t able 4 theor etical eff ect of estate t ax on sa ving by bequest motiv bequest mot ive effect n decedent saving effect n heir saving

estate tax will have effect on his or her behavior but will reduce the inheritance and theoretically increase the saving of children thus repealing the estate tax would reduce private saving if the parent focuses on the aftertax bequest the effect on saving is ambiguous again due to income and substitution effects

wealthy that they can satisfy all of their consumption needs without feeling any constraints and their wealth accumulation may be large residual in this case as well the estate tax would have effect on saving of the donor and perhaps little effect on the donee as well g7g150g153g146g155g146g140g138g149g561g7g159g146g141g142g151g140g142g561 evidence for these motives is not clear but this analysis does suggest that there are many circumstances in which repeal of the estate ta x would reduce savings not increase it virtually work has been done to estimate the effect of estate taxes on accumulation of assets preliminary analysis of estate tax data by kopczuk and slemrod found some limited evidence of negative effect on savings but this effect was not robust ie did not persist with changes in data sets or specification 12 this effect was relatively small in any case and the authors stress the many limitations of their results in particular their analysis cannot distinguish between the reduction of estates due to savings responses and those due to tax avoidance techniques given the paucity of empirical evidence on the issue the evidence on savings responses in general and the theory outlined above it appears difficult to argue for repeal of the estate tax to increase private saving even if the responsiveness to the estate and gift tax is as large as the largest empirical estimates of interest elasticities the effect on savings and output would be negligible and more than offset by public dissaving 13 indeed if the only objective were increased savings it would probably be more effective to simply keep the estate and gift tax and use the proceeds to reduce the national debt

the effect of the estate and gift tax on family farms and businesses and there is perception that the estate tax is significant burden on these businesses typically family farm and business owners hold significant wealth in business and farm assets as well as other assets such as stocks bonds and cash because many business owners are relatively well off and the estate and gift tax is progressive tax the probability of farm or small business owner encountering tax liability is greater than for other decedents 14 12 wojciech kopczuk and joel slemrod the impact of the estate tax on the wealth accumulation and avoidance behavior of donors in william g gale james r hines jr and joel b slemrod eds rethinking estate and gift taxation pp 299343 washington dc brookings institution press 2001 13 interest elasticities have been estimated at higher than 04 that is one percent increase in the rate of return would increase savings by 04 ignoring the effect on the deficit or assuming the revenue loss is made up by some other tax or spending program that has effect on private savings this amount is about 40 of the revenue cost so that savings might initially increase by about 12 billion outp ut would rise by this increase multiplied by the interest rate or about 1 billion or 1100 of 1 of output in the long run savings would accumulate and national income might eventually increase by about one tenth of 1 this calculation is based on the following the current revenue cost of 28 billion accounts for about 14 of capital income of approximately 25 of net national product at an elasticity of 04 14 increase in income would lead to 056 increase in the capital stock and multiplying by the capital share of income 025 would lead to an approximate 014 increase in the capital

or farm may in fact have to sell assets often at discounted price to pay the tax in his 1997 testimony bruce bartlett from the national center for policy analysis stated that according to survey 51 of businesses would have difficulty surviving in the event of principal owners death and 14 said it would be impossible for them to survive only 10 said the estate tax would have effect 30 said they would have to sell the family business and 41 would have to borrow against equity 15 are the data from this survey representative of the country as whole and what are the policy issues associated with this effect in response to the above testimony there are two questions to explore one is repeal of the estate and gift tax efficiently targeted to relieve farms and small businesses and two of the farmer and small business decedents how many actually encounter estate tax liability g22g138g155g144g142g157g561g7g143g143g146g140g146g142g151g140g162g561 congress has incorporated into tax law provisions outlined earlier that address and reduce the negative consequences of the estate tax on farms and small businesses these laws are targeted to benefit only farm and small business heirs in contrast proposals to repeal the estate and gift tax entirely are poorly targeted to farms and small businesses of the 22798 taxable returns filed in 2006 1442 63 included farm assets additionally more than 9837 432 returns included business assets in the estate16 note that some returns are double counted together farm and business owners by our definition represent approximately 495 of all taxable estate tax returns 17 however this estimate is dramatically overstated even aside from the likelihood of double counting the estimate for farms assumes any estate with farm asset is farm return thus including parttime farmers or those who may own farm land not directly farmed the estimate for business assets may include many returns that include small interests particularly for corporate stock and partnerships treasury data for 1998 indicated that farm estates where farm assets accounted for at least half of the gross estate accounted for 14 of taxable estates while returns with closely held stock noncorporate business or partnership assets equal to half of the gross estate accounted for 16 the same data indicated that farm real estate and other farm assets in these returns accounted for 06 of the gro ss value of estates similarly estates with half of the assets representing business assets accounted for 41 of estates gross values thus it is clear that if the main motive for repealing the tax or reducing rates acrosstheboard were to assist farms and small businesses most of the revenue loss would accrue to those outside the target group 15 statement before the subcommittee on tax finance and exports committee on small business june 12 1997 16 return is classified as business return if at least one of the following assets is in the estate closely held stock limited partnerships real estate partnership other noncorporate business assets counting the same estate more than once is likely which significantly overstates the number of business estate tax

the more difficult question to answer is how many decedent farmers and small family business owners pay the tax the first step in answering th is question is to estimate the number of farmers and business owners or those with farm and business assets who die in any given year we chose 2003 as our base year about 23 million people 25 and over died in the united states in 200418 some portion were farm and business owners to estimate the number of those who died that were farm or business owners we assume that the distribution of income tax filers roughly approximates the distribution of deaths in any given year or the portion of farm individual income tax returns to total income tax returns in 2004 approximates the number farm deaths to total deaths the same logic is used to approximate the number of business owner deaths note that farmers tend to be older than other occupational groups and have somewhat higher death rates which may slightly overstate our estimates of the share of farmer estates with tax in 2004 there were 1322 million individual income tax returns filed about 2 million were classified as farm returns and 203 million included business income or loss these returns represent 15 and 153 of all returns respectively if the profile of individual income tax return filers is similar to the profile of decedents this implies approximately 35267 farmers and 356245 business owners died in 2004 19 recall that the estate tax return data include 1442 taxable returns with farm assets and 9837 taxable returns we classify as business returns dividing these two numbers by the estimated number of deaths for each vocation yields an taxable estate tax return rate of 41 for farm owner decedents and 28 for business owner decedents thus one can conclude that most farmers and business owners are unlikely to encounter estate tax liability g17g157g145g142g155g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 liquidity constraints or the inability of farms and small business to meet their tax liability with cash may not be widespread cbo analysis of 1999 and 2000 estate tax data indicated that between 8 and 12 of estates with farm assets owed estate taxes greater than their liquid assets while returns with closely held stock compared to 5 of estates that owed estate taxes similarly cbo found that nearly onethird of small businesses that claim the qualified familyowned businessinterest deduction owe estate taxes greater than their liquid assets 20 further estimates using 1992 data suggest that 41 of business owners could pay estate and gift taxes solely out of narrowly defined liquid assets insurance proceeds cash and bank accounts if stocks equities were included in businesss liquid assets an estimated 54 could cover their estate and gift tax liability if bonds are included an estimated 58 could cover their tax 21 18 mortality data for 2004 is the latest year available 19 the percentages are multiplied by the 2374781 deaths of those 25 years old and over if the age were higher then the pool of decedents would be smaller and the percentage that paid estate taxes incrementally higher 20 us congressional budget office effects of the federal estate

businesses would potentially be at risk even without accounting for the special exemptions the special exemption suggests much smaller number would be at risk22 if one included other nonbusiness assets that are either not included in these estimates through lack of data such as pensions or nonfinancial assets such as real estate the estimate would be even higher for many businesses partial sale of assets eg portion of farm land might be made or business assets could be used as security for loans to pay the tax finally some estates may wish to liquidate the business because heir wishes to continue it given these studies and analysis it appears that only tiny fraction almost certainly more than percent or so of heirs of business owners and farmers would be at risk of being forced to liquidate the family business to pay estate and gift taxes g7g143g143g142g140g157g156g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g15g138g155g146g157g138g149g561g6g142g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g561 one of the most important deductions from the estate tax is the unlimited marital deduction which accounted for 311 of the gross value of all estates and over 40 for larger estates see table 3 larger estates may be more likely to reflect the death of the first spouse an individual can leave his or her entire estate to surviving spouse without paying any tax and getting stepup in basis which permits tax on accrued gains the arguments for an unlimited marital deduction are obvious since spouses tend to be relatively close in age taxing wealth transferred between spouses amounts to double tax in generation and also discourages the adequate provision for the surviving spouse although this latter objective could be met with large but not necessarily unlimited marital deduction there is however partial credit for prior transfers within decade which could mitigate this double taxation within generation moreover without an exclusion for assets transferred to the spouse substantial amount of planning early in the married couples life eg allowing for joint ownership of assets could make substantial difference in the estate tax liability nevertheless the unlimited marital deduction causes certain amount of distortion if spouse leaves all assets to the surviving spouse he or she forgoes the unified credit equivalent to an exclusion that is currently 20 million and will eventually reach 35 million in 2009 in addition because the estate tax is graduated leaving all assets to spouse can cause the couple to lose the advantage of going through the lower ra brackets twice very wealthy donor would leave enough to children or to the ultimate beneficiary after the second spouses death to cover the exemption and to go through all of the rate brackets then when the second spouse dies another exemption and another walk through the rate brackets will be available donors can try to avoid the loss of these benefits and still provide for the surviving spouse by setting up trusts to allow lifetime income to the spouse and perhaps provide for invasion of the corpus for emergencies these methods of course require preplanning and may not be perfect substitutes for simply leaving assets to the surviving s pouse who would not have complete control under other circumstances the unlimited marital deduction can cause decedent to leave more wealth to his or her spouse than would otherwise be preferable for example decedent with children from previous marriage might like to leave more assets to the children but the unlimited marital deduction may make it more attractive to leave assets to spouse one way of dealing with this problem is to leave lifetime interest to the spouse and direct the disposal of the corpus of the trust to children indeed the tax law facilitates this approach by allowing trust 22 of course if all heirs do not wish to continue ownership in the family business these liquid assets might need to be used to buy them out that however is choice made by the heirs and not forced sale httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30600g7g156g157g138g157g142g561g138g151g141g561g9g146g143g157g561g22g138 g161g142g156g497g561g7g140g152g151g152

terminable interest property qtip trust nevertheless this approach also requires planning and is not perfect substitute for directly leaving assets to children particularly if the spouse has long prospective life the point is that these provisions whether deemed desirable or undesirable distort the choices of decedent and cause more resources to be devoted to estate planning than would otherwise be the case g3g561g4g138g140g148g156g157g152g153g561g143g152g155g561g157g145g142g561g11g151g140g152g150g142g561g22g138g161g561 g5g138g153g146g157g138g149g561g9g138g146g151g156g561 one reason frequently cited by tax analysts for retaining an estate tax is that the tax acts as backup for source of leakage in the individual income taxthe failure to tax capital gains passed on at death normally capital gains tax applies on the difference between the sales price of an asset and the cost of acquiring it this cost is referred to as the basis under current law accumulated capital gains on an asset held until death will never be subject to the capital gains tax because the heirs will treat the market value at tim of death rather than original cost as their basis assuming market values are estimated correctly if heirs immediately sold these assets tax would be due this treatment is referred to as stepup in basis it is estimated that 36 or more of gains escape taxes through stepup 23 the estate and gift tax is not carefully designed backup for the capital gains tax it allows deduction for original cost basis it has large exemptions which may exclude much of capital gains from the tax in any case including the unlimited marital deduction and the tax rates vary from those that would be imposed on capital gains if realized in particular estate tax rates can be much larger than those imposed on capital gains the current capital gains tax is capped at 20 while the maximum marginal estate tax rate is 45 if the capital gains tax were the primary reason fo r retaining an estate and gift tax then the tax could be restructured to impose capital gains taxes on constructive realization basis alternatively one could adopt carryover of basis so that the basis remained the original cost although this proposal could still allow an indefinite deferral of gain

owner occupied housing and life insurance also escape income taxes on capital gains accrued through inside buildup for the most part owneroccupied housing also escapes income tax on implicit rental income there are practical economic and administrative reasons for some of these tax rules it is administratively difficult to tax implicit rental income and taxing capital gains could potentially impede labor mobility there are other assets as well that escape the income tax such as tax exempt bonds the estate and gift tax could also be seen as backstop for these lapses in the individual income tax 23 see poterba james m and scott weisbenner the distributional burden of taxing estates and unrealized capital gains at the time of death national bureau of economic research 7811 july 2000

estate and gift tax is the nonprofit sector since charitable contributions can be given or bequeathed without paying tax as shown in table 3 estates that filed returns in 2006 donated 83 of total assets to charities estates that occupy the highest wealth class 20 million or greater donated 178 of total assets to charity although one recent study found that charitable bequests are very responsive to the estate tax and indeed that the charitable deduction is target efficient in the sense that it induces more charitable contributions than it loses in revenue other studies have found variety of responses both small and large 24 one problem with these types of studies is the difficulty in separating wealth and price effects an individual would have even greater tax benefi ts if charitable contributions were made during the lifetime since they are deductible for purposes of the income tax thereby reducing not only income tax but also because the eventual estate is reduced the estate tax as well on the other hand under the income tax charitable gifts are limited to 50 of income 30 for private foundations and there are also restrictions on the ability to deduct appreciated property at full value despite this effect significant amount of charitable giving occurs through bequests and one study estimated that total charitable giving through bequests would fall by 12 if the estate tax were eliminated25 this reduction is however less than 1 of total charitable contributions26 charitable deductions play role in some estate planning techniques described in the next section in addition some charitable deductions allow considerable retention of control by the heirs as in the case of private foundations unlike the case of the income tax there are special restrictions on bequests to private foundations under the income tax system deductibility as percent of income is more limited for gifts to foundations there are also more limitations on gifts of appreciated property to foundations

number of tax planning and tax avoidance techniques take advantage of the annual gift exclusion the charitable deduction the unlimited marital deduction and issues of valuation because choices made with respect to these techniques can affect total tax liability these planning techniques complicate compliance on the part of the taxpayer and administration on the part of the irs they may also induce individuals to arrange their affairs in ways that would not otherwise be desirable resulting in distortions of economic behavior the most straightforward method of reducing estate and gift taxes is to transfer assets as gifts during the lifetime intervivos transfers rather than bequests gifts are generally subject to lower taxes for two reasons first assets can be transferred without affecting the unified credit because of the 12000 annual exclusion the exclusion was designed to permit gifts such as wedding and christmas presents without involving the complication of the gift tax this annual exclusion 24 see david joulfaian estate taxes and charitable bequests by the wealth national tax journal v53 n3 november 2000 this paper contains review of the econometric literature on the charitable response note that in general tax incentive induces more spending than it loses in revenue when the elasticity the percentage change in spending divided by the percentage change in taxes is greater than one 25 ibid 26 bruce bartlett misplaced fears for generosity washington times june 26 2000 p a16

two children who are both married could make 96000 of taxfree gifts per year each spouse could give 12000 to each child and the childs spouse over 10 years 960000 could be transferred tax free and without reducing the lifetime credit moreover the estate is further reduced by the appreciation on these assets the effective gift tax is also lower than the estate tax because it is imposed on taxexclusive basis rather than taxinclusive basis for example if the tax rate is 45 taxable gift beyond the 12000 limit of 100000 can be given with 45000 gift tax for an outofpocket total cost to the decedent of 145000 however if the transfer were made at death the estate tax on the total outlay of 145000 would be 45 of the total or 65250 despite these significant advantages especially from the annual exclusion relatively little intervivos giving occurs27 there are number of possible reasons for this failure to take advantage of the gift exclusion and one is that the donee does not wish to relinquish economic control or perhaps provide assets to children before they are deemed to have sufficient maturity to handle them there are certain trust and other devices that have been developed to allow some control to be maintained while utilizing the annual gift tax exclusion28 the annual gift exclusion can also be used to shift the ownership of insurance policies away from the pe rson whose life is insured and out of the gross estate one particular method that allows potentiall large amount of estate tax avoidance is crummey trust normally gifts placed in trust are not eligible for the 12000 exclusion unless the trust allows present interest by the beneficiary the courts have held that contributions to trust that allows the beneficiary withdrawal rights even if the individual is minor and even if withdrawal rights are available for only brief period eg 15 or 30 days can be treated as gifts eligible for the annual exclusion this rule has been used to remove insurance assets from an estate by placing them in trust and using the annual 12000 gift exclusion to pay the premiums without incurring tax under the crummey trust large number of individuals who may be children or other relatives of the primary beneficiaries can be given the right right not usually exercised to withdraw up to 12000 over the lim ited time period under lapse of power rules however this amount is sometimes limited to 6000 all of these individuals are not necessarily primary beneficiaries of the trust but they expand the gift exclusion aggregate in one case crummey trust with 35 donees was reported 29 there is however one disadvantage of inter vivos gifts these gifts do not benefit from the step up in basis at death that allows capital gains to go unrecognized so that very wealthy families with assets with large unrealized gains might prefer bequests at least after the annual exclusion is used up 30 27 see james poterba estate and gift taxes and incentives for inter vivos giving in the united states j ournal of public economics v79 n1 jan 2001 even at high income levels poterba found that only about 45 of households take advantage of lifetime giving he also found that those with illiquid assets such as family businesses and those with large unrealized capital gains are less likely to make intervivos gifts 28 for more complete discussion of this and other techniques

there is generation skipping tax there are large exemptions from the tax 20 million per decedent in 2008 the same as the general estate tax exemption amount generation skipping may be accomplished through direct skip decedent leaves assets to grandchildren rather than children or an indirect skip assets are left in trust with income rights to children and the corpus passing to the grandchildren on the childrens death the generation skipping tax rate is 45 relatively little revenue has been collected from the generation skipping tax because the tax has been successful in eliminating generation skipping transfers that are above the limit 31 charitable deductions can also be used to avoid estate and gift taxes and income taxes as well for example if charity can be given rights to an asset during fixed period through fixed annuity or fixed percentage of the assets value with the remainder going to the donors children or other heirs estate taxes can be avoided if the period of the trust is overstated by being based on particular individual life that is likely to be shorter than the actuarial life although restrictions have now been applied to limit refere nce persons to related parties in the past so called vulture trusts that recruited completely unrelated person with diminished life expectancy were used to avoid tax 32 assets can also be transferred to charity while maintaining control through private foundations private foundations allow an individual or his or he r heirs to direct the disposition of funds in the foundations for charitable purposes and continue to exercise power and control over the assets as noted earlier some estate planning techniques are used to provide maximum benefits of the marital deduction plus the exclusion and lower rates these approaches can also involve the use of trusts such as the qualified terminable interest property qtip these plans may permit the invasion of the corpus for emergency reasons finally significant way of reducing estate taxes is to reduce the valuation of assets lower valuation can be achieved by transferring assets into family partnership with many interests so that one party is not technically able to sell at market price without agreement from the other owners to sell circumstance that the courts have seen as lowering the value of even obviously marketable assets such as publicly traded stocks the minority interest discount undervaluation can also be argued through the claim that sale of large block of stock fire sale would reduce asset value or with familyowned business that the death of the owner or key man lowers the value substantially fractional interest in property such as real estate may also qualify for discount discounts may also be allowed for special use property whose market value may be higher than the value of the property in its current use estate planning techniques complicate the tax law increase the resources in the economy devoted to planning and also increase the administrative burden on the irs especially when such cases go to court some claims have been made that the administrative costs and costs to taxpayers comprise large part of the revenues however recent study set the costs of complying with the estate tax at 6 to 9 of revenues moreover an interesting argument was also made in that study that the inducement to

costly and difficult disputes among heirs33 of course the administrative and compliance costs are themselves in part consequence of the design of the tax if the estate tax were revised to mitigate some of the need for tax planning the administrative and compliance costs might be lower the high tax rates for some estates and the lack of thirdparty reporting mechanisms suggest that compliance may be problem although large fraction of returns with large estates are audited estimates of the estate tax gap or the fraction of revenues that are not collected have varied considerably recent estimate suggests about 31 of estates and gift taxes are not collected although the authors of previous estimates suggest th at this measure is very difficult to estimate34

in theory the federal credit for state death taxes iminated the incentive for states to race to the bottom of state estate tax rates and burden lower state liability simply increased federal liability by an equal amount in short the state credit was simply federal transfer to states contingent upon the states maintenance of an estate tax the credit also reduced the federal tax burden of the estate and gift tax the highest effective credit rate was of 16 of the gross estate value which reduced the highest federal rate of 55 to 39 before egtrra in 2005 the credit for state death taxes was eliminated and replaced with deduction for those taxes many states have relied on the federal credit for their estate tax and will need to modify their tax laws to continue collecting their estate and inheritance taxes under current state laws there will be 29 states that have state death tax in 200535 g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g17g153g157g146g152g151g156g561

in 2010 the estate tax will be replaced by tax on the capital gains of heirs when an inherited asset is sold the new law includes an exemption from carryover basis for capital gains of 13 million and an additional 3 million for surviving spouse there are efficiency losses to taxing capital gains of heirs on inherited assets because such taxation would increase the lockin effect the lockin effect occurs when potential taxpayers hold onto their assets because the anticipated tax on the gain if the asset value grows from generation to generation the lockin effect becomes stronger and stronger some analysts have suggested that the result of the lockin effect will be familial asset hoarding legislation that repeals the egtrra sunset would retain this treatment of capital gains both taxation of gains at death and carryover basis may be complicated by lack of information by the executor on the basis of assets some of which may have been originally inherited by the decedent indeed proposal in the 1970s to provide carryover basis was never put into place because of protests some associated with the problem of determining the basis this problem may be less serious for egtrra because of the carryover of basis exemption allowing constructive realization or carryover basis may further complicate estate planning if an exemption were allowed because it would be advantageous to pick those assets with the largest amounts of appreciation for the exclusion or carryover basis in addition since the tax arising from carryover basis would depend on the heirs income tax rates revenues could be saved by allocating appreciated assets to heirs with the lowest expected tax rates changing from the current stepup basis for inherited assets to carryover basis as enacted by egtrra will also affect the life insurance choices of taxpayers generally egtrra will likely encourage taxpayers to invest more in life insu rance than other investments under current tax law the appreciation of assets held in life insu rance policies is not subject to capital gains taxes also the payout from these policies usually in cash to heirs is not subject to income taxes and effectively receives stepped up basis the switch to carryover basis at death would then favor life insurance policies over other assets that are subject to capital gains taxes at death assuming

family businesses may be targeted for further relief by increases in the special exemptions for farm and business assets36 because of the asset distribution of estates almost all decedents with significant farm or business assets would likely not pay an estate tax while this approach would be effective at targeting family farms and businesses for relief it would exacerbate general concern with the estate and gift taxthe unfairness of differential treatment of owners of these business and farm assets compared to those with other forms of assets why should wealthy individual whose assets are in closely held corporation escape estate and gift tax on his or her assets while an individual who holds shares in publicly traded corporation pay tax larger exemptions also encourage wealthy decedents to convert other property into business or farm property to take advantage of the special exemptions an incentive already exists to shift property into this exempt form and it would have been exacerbated by an expansion of the exemption

proposals were intended to modify rather than completely repeal the estate tax some of these proposals may be revisited as the subset provision in egtrra nears the proposed revisions would have focused on eliminatin g estate tax avoidance schemes or at fixing current inconsistencies in the estate tax law the issues presented here are still relevant for the near term for two reasons one during the phaseout period the estate and gift is still part of the tax code two the gift tax is retained even after eventual repeal of the estate tax phase out of unified credit for largest estates this provision would allow for phase out of the unified credit as well as the lower rates by extending the bubble this provision would cause all assets in large estates to be taxed at the top rate of 45 impose consistent valuation rules analysts have proposed that valuation of assets be the same for income tax purposes as for estate tax purposes basically it is advantageous to overvalue assets for purposes of the income tax so as to minimize any future capital gains tax liability conversely its advantageous to undervalue assets to minimize estate tax liability in addition to requiring consistency in valuation some have proposed that donors report the basis of assets given as gifts currently assets transferred by gift and then sold do not benefit from stepup in basis even though the donor is not required to report the basis to the donee modify the rules for the allocation of basis under current law transaction that is part gift and part sale assigns basis to the asset for the donee that is the larger of the fair market value or the amount actually paid the donor pays tax on the difference between amount paid and his basis 36 for more on the estate tax and its effect on

basis proportionally to the gift and sale portions37 eliminate stepped up basis on survivor s share of community property under present law in common law states half of property held jointly by married couple is included in the first decedents gross estate and that half is thus eligible for stepup in basis for purposes of future capital gains in community property states however where all properties acquired during marriage are deemed community property step up in basis is available for all community property not just the half that is allocated to the decedent spouse the reason for this rule which is quite old was the presumption in the past that property in common law state would have been held by the husband who would have acquired it and thus would all have been eligible for step up while only one half of property in community property states would have been deemed to be held by the husband and be eligible for step up this older treatment it is argued was made obsolete by changes in 1981 that determined that only half of any jointly held property would be included in the estate regardless of how the property was acquired and thus made the step up apply to only one half of this type of property thus currently couples in community property states are being treated more favorably than those in common law states reservation with this treatment is that property that could be allocated to one spouse in common law state may not be able to escape the community property treatment in community property states and common law states may now be favored if these assets in common law states tend to be held by the first decedent however couples in community property states may be able to convert to separate property by agreement and thereby take advantage of the same planning opportunities as those in common law states modify qtip rules under present law an individual may obtain marital deduction for amounts left in trust to spouse under qualified terminable interest property qtip trust with one requirement being that the second spouse must then include the trust amounts in their own estate in some cases the second estate has argued that there is defect in the trust arrangement so that the trust amount is not included in the second spouses estate even though deduction was allowed for it in the first spouses estate this provision would require inclusion in the second spouses estate for any amount excluded in the first spouses estate eliminate nonbusiness valuation discount this provision would require that marketable assets be valued at the fair market value ie there would be valuation discounts for holding assets in family partnership or for firesale dispositions eliminate the exception for retained interest in personal residences from gift tax rules under current law when gift is made but the grantor retains an interest that retained interest is valued at zero making the size of the gift and the gift tax larger in the case of personal residence however the retained interest is valued based on actuarial tables in general retained interests are only allowed to be deducted from the fair market of the gift reducing gift taxes if 37 for example suppose an asset with basis of 50000 but market value of 100000 is sold to the donee for 50000 the donor would realize gain and the gift amount would be 50000 with the donee having basis of 50000 eventually the gain would be taxed when the donee sold the property but that tax would be delayed however if the asset were divided into gift of 50000 with basis of 25000 and sale of 50000 with basis of 50000 the donor would realize gain of 25000 the donee would now have basis of 75000 half of the gain would be subject to tax immediately

types of trusts such as those that pay an annuity disallow annual gift taxes in crummey trust as noted earlier the annual gift exclusion is not available for gifts placed in trust unless certain rules are met but crummey trust which allows some right of withdrawal is eligible this revision would allow gifts in trust to be deductible only if the only beneficiary is the individual and if the trust does not terminate before the individual dies the assets will be in the beneficiarys estate these rules are similar to generation skipping taxes reduce the annual gift tax exclusion the annual gift tax exclusion allows significant amounts to be transferred free of tax and also plays role in transferring insurance out of the estate by using the annual gift tax exclusion to pay th premium while some gift tax exclusion is probably desirable for simplification purposes the 12000 exclusions role in estate tax avoidance could be reduced by reducing its size an alternative change that would limit the use of the annual exclusion in tax avoidance approaches would be single exclusion per donor or some aggregate limit per donor to prevent the multiplication of the excluded amount by gifts to several children and those childrens spouses and the use of techniques such as the crummey trust allow inheritance of marital deductions or lower rates one of the complications of estate planning is maximizing the use of the exemption and lower rate brackets by married couple in this case while it may be economically and personally desirable to pass the entire estate or most of the estate to the surviving spouse minimizing taxes would require passing to others at least the exemption amount and perhaps more to take some advantage as well of the lower rate brackets such complex situations could be avoided by allowing the surviving spouse to inherit any unused deduction and lower rate brackets so that the couples full deductions and lower rates could be utilized regardless of how much was left to the surviving spouse allow gift tax treatment only on final and actual transfer many of the tax avoidance techniques with charitable gifts involve overvaluation of deductible interest for example gift may be made of the remainder interest after an annuity has been provided to charitable organization the larger the value of the charitable annuity the smaller the value of the gift and the gift tax one way to overvalue an annuity is to allow the annuity to extend to particular individuals lifetime when that individual has shorter life than the actuarial tables indicate similarly way to transfer income via the gift tax exclusion without the recipient having control over it is to place it in crummey trust even if the individual is able to exercise withdrawal rights the expectation of not receiving future gifts if the assets are withdrawn in violation of the donors wishes may mean that such rights will never be exercised rule that excludes all assets placed in trusts from consideration for the gift tax would eliminate this mechanism these types of valuation techniques could be addressed by only allowing the gift tax to be imposed at the time of the actual final transfer in such case actuarial valuation would be necessary and trust mechanisms would be available valuation of assets one option is to disallow discounts for property that has market value such as bonds and publicly traded stock regardless of the form the asset is held in as suggested by the administration tax proposals such change would prevent the avoidance technique of placing assets into family partnership or similar arrangement and then arguing that the property has lost market value because it would require agreement of the heirs to sell it in addition other limits on

based on fire sale arguments could be disallowed such provision might allow for an adjustment if the property is immediately sold at such lower price include life insurance proceeds in the base some tax avoidance techniques are associated with shifting life insurance proceeds out of the estate by shifting to another owner switch to an inheritance tax some authors have suggested that an inheritance tax should be substituted for the estate tax some states have inheritance taxes an estate tax applies to the total assets left by the decedent an inheritance tax would be applied separately to assets received by each of the heirs if tax rates are progressive smaller taxes would be applied the greater the number of beneficiaries of the assets one reason for such change would therefore be to encourage more dispersion of wealth among heirs since taxes would be lower assuming exemptions and graduated rates if split among more recipients in addition under an inheritance tax the tax rate can be varied according to the status of the heir vs cousin for example at the same time one can see more avoidance complications arising from an inheritance tax g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 the analysis in this report has suggested that some of the arguments used for and against maintaining the estate tax may be questioned or of lesser import than is popularly assumed for example there is little evidence that the estate tax has much effect on savings and therefore on output indeed estate taxes could easily increase rather than reduce savings similarly only tiny fraction of farms and small businesses face the estate and gift tax and it has been estimated that the majority of those who do have sufficient nonbusiness assets to pay the tax moreover only small potion of the estate tax is collected from these family owned farms and small businesses so that dramatically reducing estate tax rates or eliminating the tax for the purpose of helping these family businesses is not very target efficient although the estate tax does contribute to the progressivity of the tax system this progressivity is undermined to an undetermined degree by certain estate tax avoidance techniques of course one alternative is to broaden the estate tax base by restricting some of these estate planning techniques at the same time progressivity could be achieved by other methods on the other hand arguments that the estate tax is backup for the income escaping the capital gains tax would not support the current high rates of the estate tax which should be lowered to 20 or less to serve this purpose more intangible arguments such as the argument that inheritances are windfalls that should be taxed at higher rates on the one hand or that death is an undesirable time to levy tax and that transferred assets have already been subject to taxes are more difficult to assess but remain important issues in the determination of the desirability of estate and gift taxes httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30600g7g156g157g138g157g142g561g138g151g141g561g9g146g143g157g561g22g138 g161g142g156g497g561g7g140g152g151g152
