section 221 among other things offers two new sex trafficking offenses one aggravated sex trafficking proposed 18 usc 2429 would replace 18 usc 1591 but without the requirement that the defendant charged with persuasion enticement transportation etc of child must be shown to have known that the child was underage the other sex trafficking proposed 18 usc 2430 expands federal jurisdiction to reach persuasion inducement or enticement to engage in unlawful prostitution when it occurs in or affects interstate or foreign commerce without regard to the age of the beguiled or the absence of coercion fraud or force g3g144g144g155g138g159g138g157g142g141g561g21g142g161g561g22g155g138g143g143g146g140g148g146g151g144g561 proposed 18 usc 2429 would condemn knowingly recruiting enticing harboring transporting providing or obtaining another individual in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce or within us special maritime and territorial jurisdiction with the knowledge that the individual would be used to engage in commercial sex act either as child or through force fraud or coercion the proposed section would condemn profiting from such venture as well in either case offenders would face imprisonment for any term of years not less than 15 years or for life not less than 10 years if the child were 14 years of age or older the proposal is essentially the same as 18 usc 1591 but for knowledge of the minority of juvenile victim upon which section 1591 insists g21g142g161g561g22g155g138g143g143g146g140g148g146g151g144g561 proposed 18 usc 2430 would represent an expansion of federal authority to punish sex trafficking if the offense occurs in or affected interstate or foreign commerce it features more expansive jurisdictional base than 18 usc 1591 the proposed section would match the jurisdiction reach of section 1591 and its proposed replacement section 2429 in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce etc but unlike those sections section 2430 would cover attempted violations it would also cover persuasion inducement or enticement to commit consensual acts of prostitution involving only adults ie unlike section 1591 and proposed section 2429 it would not require that the offense involve either child under the age of 18 or the use of fraud force or coercion as means of persuasion inducement or enticement it would prohibit persuasion inducement or enticement of an adult to engage in commercial sex act when it would affect interstate commerce such conduct is only federal crime now if actual interstate or foreign travel is involved the expansion could be significant since in other contexts the courts have often held that the prosecution need show more than minimis impact on interstate or foreign commerce to satisfy the affects commerce standard

offense or 2 with the intent to commit trafficking offense or 3 to unlawfully restrict the travel of trafficking victim section 1589 prohibits providing or obtaining labor or services through physical violence the threat of physical violence or abuse or threatened abuse of the law the proposed amendment to section 1592 recasts its components in three areas first it streamlines the documentseizure prohibition second like section 1589 it outlaws obtaining labor or services through an abuse of authorit or legal process unlike section 1589 which only applies to forced labor it outlaws such abuse when used to obtain either labor or commercial sex acts third like section 1589 it outlaws obtaining labor or services using threat of harm unlike section 1589 it specifies financial harm rather than physical harm and it reaches threats to secure either labor or commercial sex acts offenders would be punished by imprisonment for not more than 5 years

federal offense arranging sex tourism proposed 18 usc 2431 the new section would outlaw knowingly and for profit arranging inducing or procuring an individuals travel in foreign commerce in order to permit the individual to engage in commercial sex act or attempting to so arrange induce or procure proposed 18 usc 2431a violations would be punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years but not more than 30 years if the commercial sex act involved child under the age of 18 proposed 18 usc 2432a b under existing law it is federal crime for an american to travel in foreign commerce for the purpose of engaging in commercial sex act with child 18 usc 2423b f it is also federal crime to arrange induce procure or facilitate such travel if done for profit 18 usc 2423d both offenses are punishable by imprisonment for not more than 30 years 18 usc 2423bd it is not federal crime for an american to travel in foreign commerce for the purpose of engaging in commercial sex act with an adult and it is not federal crime for an american to attempt to travel in foreign commerce for the purpose of engaging in commercial sex act with child subsection 221g would replicate existing law exce pt to the extent that it would prohibit 1 arranging inducing or procuring for profit the foreign travel of an american to engage in commercial sex act even though the underlying travel for such purpose is not itself federal crime 2 attempting to arrange induce or procure for profit such travel or 3 attempting to arrange induce or procure for profit the foreign travel of an american to engage in commercial sex act with child criminalizing an attempt to induce others to engage in innocent conduct eg foreign travel for the purpose of engaging in lawful commercial sex act with an adult even when done for profit may raise first amendment implications

prevent another from disclosing information concerning federal employmentrelated visa labor or employment law relating to aliens or retaliating against another for his having done so or attempting to so tamper or retaliate by operation of the existing penalty restructure offenders would face imprisonment for not more than 20 years for the use or attempted use of physical force to tamper and not more than 10 years in all other instances under existing law it is federal crime punishable by imprisonment for not more than 20 years to obstruct enforcement of the peonage prohibition the general federal witness tampering statute among other things proscribes the use of physical force threats intimidation or corrupt persuasion in order to prevent witness from in forming federal law enforcement officials of information relating to the commission of federal crime the witness retaliation statute among other things proscribes retaliating against witness for providing information relating to the commission of federal crime to federal law enforcement officials unlike the proposed amendment present law does not outlaw obstruction or retaliation relating to the investigation of noncriminal alien employment violations s ubparagraph 202g6d of section 202 would establish cause of action including reasonable attorneys fees for the victims of the proposed obstruction of justice offenses

subsection 221c would amend 1594 to require th attorney general to return to victims property seized or confiscated under the involuntar servitude and trafficking chapter it would permit the attorney general to return property conf iscated under other laws to trafficking victims as general rule restoration or remission is only possible where the claimant has or had legallyrecognized interest in the confiscated property and where the claimant played part in the offense which gave rise to the forfeiture the proposed amendments appear designed to overcome the second limitation they permit victims to recover notwithstanding their participation in the confiscationtriggering offense the courts however may find in the use of the terms restoration and remission an intent to continue in place the ownership requirement under the proposals exploited victims might be thought entitled to more than the return of property that can be shown to once have been theirs it seems possible that rather than permitting victims to recover property confiscated from them because of violations of the peonage and trafficking laws drafters intended to require or permit victim restitution to be paid out of forfeited assets of their oppressors the proposed amendments might prove inadequate for that purpose

the offender or the victim is an american or when the offender is in the united states section 222 provides statement of extraterritorial jurisdiction in some instances when it seems likely that federal courts would assume it even in the absence of such an explicit provision on the other hand the application of proposed section 1596 might prove more problematic when the only contact with the united states or its nationals or interests is the fact the offender is found or has been brought to the united states federal prosecution under 18 usc 1589 forced labor might be problematic for example when the misconduct occurs entirely within another country and neither the offender nor any of the victims of the offense are americans
