and defense policy key issues in the 106th congress summary when the 106th congress comes to work in january its first order of business will be to deal with the impeachment of the president of the united states the 1998 congressional campaigns and elections suggested that the agenda of the 106th congress also will be largely domestic in its focus social security health care and education were the order of the day in campaigns across america and on postelection news programs indeed of the issues discussed in this report only increased defense spending to address military readiness and retention of trained military personnel has been reported on recently as the president announced over new years weekend his proposal to ask for substantial increase in the fy2000 budget for military pay and hardware development most immediately the 106th congress is expected to consider supplemental appropriations bill to support the wye river memorandum including increased assistance to israel jordan and the palestinians congress likely will quickly consider new assistance and trade benefits to central american countries hit hardest by hurricane mitch development aid to countries severely affected by the global financial crisis and more humanitarian assistance to kosovo are another two issues that might find their way into supplemental appropriations bill in the first few months of the new congress the united states also stands in arrears with the united nations and the world bank but neither matter is expected to receive appropriators attention in the supplemental there are few routine foreign affairs and defense issues to be addressed by the th 106 congress albeit with less urgency than the supplemental appropriations the president will issue international narcotics control certifications before march 1st as required by law for any country found to be trafficking or producing narcotics certification could jeopardize its receipt of us foreign assistance congress might respond with legislation supporting or negating specific countries certification status new authorizations and appropriations bills will be considered for departments and agencies authorization for some foreign assistance programs expires before the end of the first session and reauthorizations are likely to be taken up the presidents authority to waive proliferation sanctions imposed on india and pakistan last may must be renewed this year or be allowed to expire which would require the reimposition of sanctions that many members of congress find counterproductive several laws remain in the united states code that were shaped during the cold war the 106th congress could turn its attention to these previous several congresses have made some effort to amend repeal or replace the foreign assistance act of 1961 and export administration act of 1979 consensus on new provisions however has not been reached congress has not enacted foreign aid authorization bill since 1985 each year waiving the requirement to do so and relying on the annual appropriations measure to express its foreign policy interests and opinions export controls in the export administration act expired in 1994 and since then have been left entirely to the executive branch to administer contents the us role in the world 1 stanley r sloan senior specialist in international security policy congressional

members of four congresses have sought to adapt us foreign and defense policies to dramatically new international environment without the unifying imperative of clear and imminent threat to us national security both branches of government have found it more difficult to produce consistent consensual approaches to plethora of international challenges in the us system of constitutionallyshared responsibility for foreign and defense policy the president plays key leadership role the congress however has precise and important responsibilities including authorization and appropriation of funds for the united states international role the requirement for senate advice and consent to us participation in international treaties the responsibility of both houses to oversee the administrations conduct of policy and declaration of war should that be necessary during the 106th congress as in the previous two congresses these responsibilities will be assumed in circumstance of divided government with the democratic party holding the presidency and the republican party controlling both houses of congress in such political setting the goal of developing consensual approaches to foreign policy will be pursued in the context of philosophical institutional and partisan differences between the two branches some of the broad questions that the congress and the president will be called on to address include how should the united states play its role as the only true global power what roles should us military forces play in defending us interests how can an effective balance be struck between unilateral us actions and those taken in concert with allies or the international community in an increasingly interdependent world is the united states effectively combining the political economic and military aspects of its international involvement to maximize benefits for us interests these issues were raised prominently when in december 1998 the united states and the united kingdom once again used force against iraq to try to bring saddam husseins regime into compliance with international prohibitions against the possession and manufacture of weapons of mass destruction other members of the security council questioned the desirability and effectiveness of the military strikes and some countries accused the united states of acting like hegemonic power and undermining the united nations the episode has revived fundamental questions about under what circumstances the united states should use force crs2 particularly in the absence of an international consensus or congressional mandate for the action in recent years such questions have come down to more specific issues in the congress with regard to the use of force the united states has played key role with other nato countries in restoring an uneasy peace to bosnia and herzegovina and in the recent kosovo crisis the congress never explicitly supported the presidents decision to send us forces to bosnia but has also continued to fund their presence the question of supporting continued us involvement the balkans will come before the 106th congress as well with regard to us diplomacy the congress and the clinton administration have jointly reorganized the us foreign policy establishment eliminating three foreign policy agencies and merging their functions within the department of state implementation of the reorganization will likely receive oversight from the 106th congress other foreign policy matters raised by preceding sessions of congress remain unresolved there are continuing differences about how to deal with the issue of back dues the united states owes to the united nations for example and us foreign assistance authorizing legislation has for several years now been blocked by differences over highly charged political issues the administration and congress have also differed over the imposition and management of export controls and the use of sanctions in us foreign policy us foreign policy increasingly is influenced by economic conditions around the world the wellbeing of the us economy is affected by weaknesses in other parts of the world as recently demonstrated by the asian and russian financial crises in an increasingly globalized world for example issues like how much the united states should contribute to the international monetary fund imf become issues of political and security as well as financial importance crs reports the us role in the world indispensable leader or hegemon by stanley r sloan crs report 971046f the clinton presidency in crisis foreign reactions and policy implications by stanley r sloan crs report 98828 congressional tools for managing foreign and defense policy although the president through his powers as commander in chief maintains formidable authority to manage and direct us foreign and defense policy congress possesses broad range of tools to oversee influence and in some cases reverse executive policies the most direct means for lawmakers is through the enactment of defense state department and foreign aid authorization and appropriations bills usually considered annually control over funding key white house defense and foreign policy initiatives such as the costs of deploying american forces to bosnia paying us obligations at the united nations and the international monetary fund procuring military weapons systems and supporting middle east peace efforts offers congress perhaps its most powerful instrument crs3 legislativeexecutive controversies have blocked passage of state department authorization bills for four years and foreign aid authorizing measures for over decade as result appropriations bills have grown increasingly important as means of influencing foreign policy placing conditions on how or when defense and foreign affairs funds can be used such as the current conditions and restrictions on paying for heavy fuel oil for north korea offers lawmakers the means to maintain close oversight of executive policy or block initiatives that require financial commitments out of favor with congress the senate also can exert influence through its powers to approve or reject treaties ambassador and highlevel administration personnel appointments congress also enacts nonbinding resolutions that do not require presidential signature holds open hearings where executive officials can be vigorously questioned or issues statements on personal views to express congressional sentiment and educate the public in ways that may influence the conduct of american foreign and defense policy whether by conducting oversight or by enacting legislation the 106th congress can have significant role in determining the direction of us foreign policy and might be particularly active in areas pertaining to the use of military force the allocation of foreign assistance the imposition strengthening or easing of foreign policy sanctions controlling exportation of sensitive goods and technology us participation in the united nations and the administration of the newly reorganized department of state its agencies and embassies each of these issues is discussed in some detail below use of military force in the years since the collapse of the soviet bloc policymakers have struggled to redefine the role of military power in an environment of numerous and diffuse threats as the united states deployed troops to bosnia southwest asia haiti and elsewhere some farreaching issues have been raised including 1 determining the circumstances in which force should be used us defense strategy calls for military forces to help shape the international security environment respond to challenges across the entire spectrum of conflict and prepare for future threats to shape the environment and respond to crises requires among other things extensive us military engagement abroad and willingness to employ force in response to wide range of challenges to security former defense secretary william perry argued that the use of force may be appropriate not only when vital interests are threatened but also when important interests are at stake and even under strictly limited conditions for humanitarian reasons the issue he said is whether costs and risks are properly calibrated to us interests many legislators remain skeptical about us involvement where less than vital us interests are at stake 2 peacekeeping as the cold war was ending some policymakers hoped that the use of multilateral forces operating under auspices in situations short of war peacekeeping would help contain and resolve local conflicts enhancing world stability with minimal commitment of us forces former presidents reagan and bush both endorsed this concept deployments during the bush and clinton administrations however generated great deal of debate about unsponsored peacekeeping operations particularly where high levels of force were and are used in may 1994 the clinton administration announced presidential decision directive crs4 pdd 25 set of guidelines to help determine when and how the united states would support peacekeeping and by implication when it might act either in an ad hoc coalition or unilaterally skeptics of this approach maintain that many peacekeeping operations whether under the united nations or other auspices cost too much and burden us armed forces while doing little to promote us interests 3 congresss role the constitution gives congress the responsibility to declare war to raise and regulate the armed forces and to provide funds for activities of the us government including military action how congress should exercise these responsibilities and how vigorously it should assert its role is matter of perennial debate since the votes on the persian gulf war in 1991 congress has not asserted direct role in deciding between war and peace efforts to use the power of the purse to limit military operations either before or after the fact have also had limited success though congress has vigorously debated the use of force in somalia haiti bosnia and elsewhere it has in the end imposed few direct constraints on presidential action the main issue in congress has been and continues to be how to pay for military operations in particular whether funds should be provided as emergency supplemental appropriations overandabove the regular defense budget or should they be offset by cuts in other defense programs crs reports the use of force key statements by weinberger shultz aspin bush powell albright and perry by stephen daggett and nina m serafino crs report 94805 f peacekeeping issues of us military involvement by nina m serafino crs issue brief 94040 foreign aid following sharp cuts in foreign aid spending during the 104th congress lawmakers increased funds for economic and military assistance in 1997 and 1998 with substantial growth for russia and other former soviet states counternarcotics programs development assistance concentrated on child survival activities and appropriations to clear us arrears at the world bank and regional international financial institutions it is likely that the administration will send to congress foreign aid budget request for fy2000 at or above the 138 billion enacted for fy1999 congress will face foreign aid legislation almost immediately in the new session in the form of 2 billionplus emergency supplemental appropriation to support the wye river israelipalestinian peace accord and to begin reconstruction for countries severely damaged by hurricane mitch about 18 billion is anticipated for support of the middle east peace process 400 million in economic aid for the palestinians for education water development and support of the rule of law 12 billion for israel to cover the costs of relocating israeli military forces from west bank territory and 200 million for jordan in security assistance the administration is also expected to seek 120 million or more for hurricanerelated reconstruction in central america the united states has already committed 300 million for emergency assistance to the region mostly for the most seriously damaged nations of nicaragua and honduras congress is likely to suggest other options senator graham for example advocates adding to hurricane mitch supplemental provisions similar to caribbean crs5 basin initiative cbi parity legislation that stalled in the 105th congress such measure would extend nafta trade benefits to cbi nations also under consideration although less certain is an additional request for development aid for countries affected by the asian financial crisis and more humanitarian aid for kosovo while the administration is likely to designate the entire supplemental as an emergency requiring equivalent reductions in existing spending some members may recommend offsets to make the supplemental appropriations budget neutral funding for the wye river accord could prove contentious because it would exceed congressionally imposed fy1999 cap of 54 billion total us assistance to the middle east while congress will consider many foreign aid issues in supplemental and foreign operations appropriations measures the balance of the foreign aid legislative agenda is less certain without enactment since 1985 of foreign assistance authorization bills the main statute foreign assistance act of 1961 is seriously out of date and reflects few of the postcold war changes in foreign aid policy priorities congress could attempt to revise the 1961 act or address individual and perhaps less controversial issues in more narrowly focused authorization bills authority for continuance of the overseas private investment corporation opic program authorized in the 1961 act for example expires on september 30 1999 and will require some legislative action for opic to continue foreign aid bills whether authorizations or appropriations frequently attract debate on broader foreign policy issues some of which are matters of significant controversy between the president and congress conditioning aid to russia on that countrys termination of nuclear cooperation with iran is likely to be raised again in the new session the submission of presidential certifications by march and june 1999 regarding north koreas suspected resumption of nuclear weapons program as required by law will be closely scrutinized and lawmakers may consider attaching further restrictions to the administrations fy2000 funding requests to supply heavy fuel oil to north korea persistent controversy in annual foreign aid debates that past two congresses have considered but reached longterm consensus concerns abortion restrictions and

issue brief 91141 us international population assistance issues for congress by kerry b dumbaugh and larry q nowels crs issue brief 96026 the imposition of sanctions to achieve foreign policy goals the 106th congress inherits from its predecessors continuing debate about how and when to use coercive economic measures to achieve us foreign policy goals both congress and the president selectively support sanctions as foreign crs6 policy tool to combat proliferation terrorism aggression drug trafficking or human rights abuses some us business representatives and others depict foreign policy sanctions as often ineffective and damaging to the us economy congress often incorporates sanctions in foreign aid authorization and appropriation bills and in bills targeting specific countries most recently cuba iran iraq libya china burma myanmar serbia russia or north korea while the congressional debate over the use of sanctions has its recent roots in cold war legislation of the 1960s antiapartheid legislation of the 1980s and us reaction to iraqs aggression toward kuwait in 1990 the debate changed dramatically in the aftermath of indias and pakistans testing of nuclear detonation devices in the spring of 1998 the president was required by law to impose sanctions against the two nations sanctions that in part prohibited american wheat growers from selling their harvest to pakistan primary market at about the same time news reports were circulating stating that sanctions against iraq were having serious impact on the civilian population in iraq congress looked anew at the practice of restricting another countrys access to american food and medical exports for foreign policy reasons the sanctions against india and pakistan were eventually modified by congress to allow for agricultural commodity sales and the president was authorized to ease or adjust those sanctions over the course of one year multilateral sanctions against iraq imposed by the security council were offset with renewal and enlargement of the uns oilforfood program the 105th congress considered the enhancement of trade security and human rights through sanctions reform act legislation that sought to constrain the use of sanctions by the executive branch and to make the cost and impact of sanctions more transparent it gained momentum throughout the second session but was not enacted version of the measure is likely to be introduced early in the 106th congress during the adjournment between the 105th and 106th congresses senator dorgan nddem and representative nethercutt warep both announced they would introduce legislation to repeal or prohibit the imposition of agricultural commodity and medical export sanctions in december 1998 more than 30 members of congress sent letter to the president asking him to authorize onetime agricultural commodities sale to iran country otherwise prohibited from such transactions by us unilateral sanctions and to generally reconsider the use of food as foreign policy weapon the 105th congress on the other hand enacted the freedom from religious persecution act which authorizes the president to impose new sanctions the 106th congress will probably provide some oversight to the acts implementation difficulties in us foreign policy visavis hot spots such as cuba china iran iraq or serbia might result in the 106th congress enacting new sanctions legislation congressional efforts to make humanitarian exemptions to the use of sanctions recent complaints before the world trade organization by the united states european trading partners about the imposition of unilateral sanctions human rights organizations reporting on the impact of sanctions all might result in serious deliberation in the 106th congress on the utility and effectiveness of sanctions crs7 crs reports economic sanctions to achieve us foreign policy goals discussion and guide to current law by dianne rennack and robert d shuey crs report 97949 f nuclear biological chemical and missile proliferation sanctions selected current law by dianne rennack crs report 98116 f export controls of sensitive goods and technology congress and the administration have tried to rewrite the export administration act of 1979 eaa1979 since it initially lapsed in 1990 different views on the value of export controls in foreign policy and national security the role and procedures of government agencies in exerting such controls and participation in international nonproliferation regimes have kept congress from approving new act or reauthorizing the eaa1979 most provisions of the eaa1979 authorizing the department of commerce to regulate exports of civil and dualuse goods and technology were extended by executive order after its initial lapse and since its final expiration in 1994 exports of defense goods and services are regulated by the department of state under the arms export control act one attempt by the 101st congress to extend and amend the eaa1979 was pocket vetoed by president bush subsequent congresses were unable to resolve numerous disputes the eaa1979 which had primary purpose of blocking exports that could help the military buildup of communist bloc countries was cold war law that some contend is longer relevant to us interests threats to us national security and foreign policy goals now stem from less powerful countries and subnational groups that seek to expand their influence or intimidate their neighbors many by acquiring weapons of mass destruction and related delivery systems and many by employing or supporting international terrorists although export controls might still restrict the military capabilities of these potential belligerents us and other western business interests are less willing to link export regulations to national security and foreign policy goals since the end of the cold war and rapid technological developments multilateral regime cocom once controlled the exports of participating countries to communist countries cocom dissolved in 1994 however and was eventually replaced by the wassenaar arrangement under which export control efforts are largely voluntary few countries such as north korea china and russia continue to defy international norms by exporting dangerous goods and technology to unstable regions and aggressive nations many members of congress have expressed concern that the administration has liberalized export controls to such an extent that us national security interests are not sufficiently protected others are concerned that some export controls are arbitrary and harmful to the us economy exports of nuclear technology satellites highperformance computers jet engines and machine tools to china have been particularly controversial and have helped prompt closer look at us export administration congress has also critiqued us policies regarding transfers of encryption stealth low radar crosssection and telecommunication technology us businesspersons and some members of congress have also criticized unilateral controls on exports to iran india pakistan and cuba particularly when other industrial countries do not restrict exports to these countries some key issues for congress are implications of us export administration for nonproliferation policy crs8 for national security and foreign policy and for us business foreign availability of goods and technology enduse controls criminal and civil penalties and judicial review revising export administration legislation to reflect the changed international environment could benefit us national security foreign policy and commerce but would require compromise or agreement on some difficult questions between the administration and congress and among members of congress and committees of diverse perspectives and conflicting interests participation in the united nations congressional use of legislative tools to influence us policy on the united nations has both negative and positive effect on the united nations its agencies and activities as well as on the ability of the united states to promote its interests more broadly withholding full funding of us contributions to international organizations including the united nations and to u n peacekeeping accounts has produced number of consequences both negative and positive c arrears in us assessed contributions to the regular budget have threatened loss of its vote in the general assembly in 1999 however congressional appropriation for fy1999 of nearly the full amount of presidential requests in current funding ensures probably that the united states will retain its vote officials and member states have launched positive changes in part in response to us congressional and administration demands for reform prior to the release of us arrears money in 1997 and 1998 however in actions directly attributed to continued us arrears the general assembly refused to elect the united states to membership in the advisory committee on administrative and budgetary questions in the past us national has always been on this body c substantial arrears to peacekeeping operations accounts in the view of some experts have damaged the ability of the united nations to set up and carry out peacekeeping operations the united nations would use most of these arrearages to reimburse states including the united states that contribute troops and lease equipment for peacekeeping operations according to june 1998 general accounting office report at the end of 1997 the united nations owed 12 billion to 71 nations including 1092 million to the united states c arrears in us payments to specialized agencies and to nonun regional organizations may have caused some programmatic changes but they have also led to reviews by these organizations of budgetary goals and spurred structural and other reforms secondly congress linkage of the release of appropriated funds for current contributions to achievement of specified actions has apparently prompted positive changes such as the establishment and effective operation of the office of internal oversight services and adherence to specific regular budget limit implementation of these congressionally initiated reforms has been viewed widely as crs9 beneficial because they have helped identify and eliminate cases of waste fraud and abuse and controlled run away spending thirdly congress has required the executive branch to report to it before supporting in the security council any new peacekeeping operation or increases in size or mandate of current operations this report is to include reprogramming request showing how additional us contributions are to be financed in at least three instances congressional committee chairpersons have rejected the reprogramming request critics have charged that this reporting process has hampered security council responses to peace and security threats thus diminishing the united nations capacity to react to breaking crises others maintain that these restraints on the us executive branch have ensured congressional access to information about and participation in decisions requiring commitment of us taxpayer funds for operations as the 105th congress ended bill authorizing substantial payment of 819 million in us arrears to the united nations was sent to the president for signature the legislation also included abortion related provisions however leading to veto of the entire bill despite presidential agreement with its united nationsrelated portions thus when the 106th congress convenes it will face issues of financing us arrears payments for assessed budgets of these organizations and the status of the congressionally proposed conditions for payment of these arrears the administration maintains that some of these conditions are now outdated and require revision some in the congress maintain that revision or reopening of negotiations on these conditions is unnecessary and unacceptable congress will continue to consider authorizations and appropriations for current us contributions to international organizations including and peacekeeping assessed accounts in the annual state department appropriations bill under contributions to international organizations and contributions to international peacekeeping activities crs reports funding payment of arrears and

state department diplomacy and embassy issues us diplomacy americas first line of defense overseas and the foreign policy agencies that contribute to those goals are in transition phase as the united states grapples with how best to address global and regional issues in the postcold war era to streamline the us foreign policy apparatus the 105th congress passed crs10 legislation to consolidate the foreign policy agencies under the aegis of the department of state in addition examination of security procedures in us facilities overseas was emphasized as top priority particularly after terrorist attacks in august 1998 razed two us embassies in africa it is likely that the 106th congress will hold oversight hearings on the role of us diplomacy in the 21st century including concerns about continually changing technologies implementation of the foreign policy agencies reorganization and the security of those carrying out us foreign policy abroad among other sources this oversight may draw on the recent recommendations of two prominent policy institutes reports concerning the need for substantive changes in the management of us foreign policy after being debated by both the 104th and 105th congress plan reorganizing the foreign policy agencies department of state us information agency usia agency for international development usaid the international development cooperation agency idca and the arms control and disarmament agency acda finally signed into law on october 21 1998 as the foreign affairs reform and restructuring act of 1998 division g of pl 105277 requires

of the secretary of state the 106th congress is likely to oversee the consolidation early in the first session with hearings perhaps coinciding with the appropriations process and continue monitoring the evolution of the new state department to ensure that the objectives of the reorganization budgetary savings streamlining and better coordination us foreign policy are attained in order to help advance american interests abroad the united states maintains 249 posts in over 180 countries around the world security of these facilities and the people that work in them became top priority in august 1998 after terrorist attacks on us embassies in tanzania and kenya as part of pl 105277 division b congress approved an fy1998 emergency supplemental appropriations of 18 billion to defray

crisis that has now taken perhaps onethird of the worlds economies into deep recessions the crisis has generated serious discussion of the ability of the current institutional structures most notably the international monetary fund imf to deal with the present crisis prevent future crises and fulfill the needs of the global economy in the 21th century in approving funding for the imf division sec 101d title vi of p l 105277 the 105th congress laid the basis for an active congressional role in these discussions and for an unprecedented degree of oversight some of the ways in which this was achieved include establishing with appointment by house and senate leadership for duration of six months an international financial institution advisory commission to advise and report to congress and the secretary of the treasury requiring an annual report by oct 1 to various congressional committees and testimony by the secretary of the treasury on international financial issues providing for annual audits of the imf by the general accounting office gao to congressional committees and requiring two reports to congressional committees in july 1999 and 2000 on the architecture of the international monetary system the 106th congress is scheduled to appoint commissioners to the advisory commission early in the first session and will oversee implementation of imf reforms enacted in the 105th congress it is likely also that the administration will send requests to congress for approval of bilateral assistance for countries most deeply afflicted by the debt crisis crs reports the

embassies in kenya and tanzania have given renewed focus to administration and congressional concern about the threat of international terrorism the administration announced new more aggressive approach to combating terrorist groups exemplified by the us missile strikes against alleged terrorist bases in afghanistan and sudan the new policy is crs12 said to involve 1 more global and proactive rather than reactive stance 2 an increasingly national security focus rather than lawenforcement orientation 3 greater willingness to use military force 4 less constraint over national

popular literature and films have also served to heighten public concern government agencies have identified shortcomings in protection detection and medical capabilities and efforts are underway to remedy them domestic wmd terrorism would present unique challenges and require the resources of governmental agencies from the local to the federal level congress has demonstrated its concern by holding extensive hearings mandating reports from the defense department and intelligence agencies and by enacting increasingly large appropriations for research defensive crs13 equipment and training major fy1999 appropriations included 529 million for the defense department 135 million for the department of justice and 216 for the department of health and human services though wmd have historically been considered the province of the armed forces civilian agencies must grapple with their potential effects emergency response personnel public health care facilities police departments along with local and state governments are all beginning to focus on this issue using the reservoir of professional military expertise in this area the department of defense has played leading role in assisting civilian authorities notably its domestic preparedness program is training emergency personnel in 120 cities around the nation recently the federal bureau of investigation assumed the role of lead agency in domestic efforts and the national security council established national coordinator for security infrastructure protection and counterterrorism nevertheless questions have arisen

housecongressional budget agreement of 1997 projected an essentially flat defense budget over the five years through fy2002 in the months since the budget agreement was reached however defense officials have warned that planned spending is not adequate both to maintain military readiness in the short term and to acquire new weapons for the future problems have grown particularly severe they have said in recruiting and retaining high quality force at the end of 1998 congress approved an additional 83 billion in emergency funding for the pentagon the level of defense spending promises to be major issue when the 106th congress considers first the annual budget resolution for fy2000 and then defense authorization and appropriations bills military readiness is likely to be particular focus of debate senior military officers now warn that shortages of personnel in key specialties gaps in weapons maintenance and high pace of operations are affecting even forwardbased military forces and units tagged for early deployment in conflict these concerns are mounting even though budgets have repeatedly been adjusted to protect readiness related activities at the expense of weapons modernization crs16 number of factors appear to be at work shortfalls in personnel recruitment and retention have aggravated problems in ensuring full manning of deployed units underfunding of real property maintenance and facility operations has often led commanders to reallocate money meant for training to meet urgent repair needs weapons maintenance costs have regularly been underestimated constant presence in the persian gulf and occasional surges to the region have stretched the air force which has recently reorganized to be more expeditionary in character even relatively small presence in bosnia has strained the army because units are not fully manned in peacetime certain units are in particularly heavy demand and the pace of regular training activities is intense the 106th congress will consider changes in military pay retirement benefits and recruitment the military services have also proposed large increases in funding both for shortterm readiness and longterm weapons modernization programs and congress may confront difficult tradeoffs among competing priorities missile defense its development and the spending it would require also remains key issue both

effort to accelerate development despite technical uncertainties crs report appropriations for fy1999 defense by stephen daggett crs report 98205f ballistic missile defense the debate over national missile defense nmd has focused on how best and how quickly to develop and deploy system to protect the united states against limited longrange missile attack such an attack might be accidental from country friendly to the united states or deliberate from nation hostile to the united states the clinton administration is pursuing 3 plus 3 strategy the goal of which is to develop an nmd system over threeyear period ending in 2000 to permit deployment of that system three years later in 2003 if decision to do so were made if deployment decision were deferred development of an increasingly effective system would continue missile defense advocates in congress however want to set firm date for deployment faced with the prospect of presidential veto congress has not set deployment date in annual defense bills instead congress has considered but not enacted freestanding bills to establish nmd policy such as the american missile protection act of 1998 s 1873 similar legislative efforts are likely in the 106th congress nmd programs receive about 1 billion in annual appropriations some key issues include how quickly rogue nations might acquire longrange missiles weighing program risk technical advances and nearterm deployment and implications for the antiballistic missile abm treaty us troops deployed abroad and us allies are increasingly threatened by enemy short and mediumrange ballistic and cruise missiles some potentially armed with biological chemical or even nuclear warheads during the gulf war 23 us troops were killed by an iraqi scud missile with conventional warhead more than 30 countries have ballistic missiles and scores of countries have various types of cruise missiles mostly antiship missiles there is considerable support in congress to crs17 develop and

its five attempted interception flight tests and meads which is joint program with germany and italy but has not been given high priority by dod ntw has received strong congressional support and is considered possible supplement to nmd as the 106th congress reviews dods tmd and nmd programs it may also explore the relationship between these programs and the abm treaty this agreement limits the united states to single site for nmd with more than 100 interceptor missiles at that site it does not limit tmd programs and several agreements that the united states and russia signed in september 1997 confirm that us tmd programs would be considered outside the constraints of the abm treaty the president has stated that he will submit these agreements to the senate for its advice and consent to ratification after the russian parliament approves the start ii treaty because the abm treaty is controversial the senate may reconsider us adherence when it debates these agreements some in congress contend that the us could develop more effective tmd systems and more robust nmd system if it were not limited by the abm treaty others however argue that this agreement is central to the us

concerned about the ability of the armed forces to recruit and retain sufficient quantities of qualified active duty military personnel plentiful jobs in the civilian economy an alleged reduction in the competitiveness of military pay and benefits and for some military personnel an exhausting frequency of overseas deployments and rapidresponse contingencies have all combined to dissuade prospective recruits from joining and prospective career members from staying on active duty in fy1998 for the first time in over 20 years the army and navy did not meet their recruiting goals the consequences have crs18 included understrength or zero strength combat infantry units and naval vessels having to sail with understrength crews particularly important is debate over whether the military retirement reform act of 1986 which reduced the retired pay for those who retire with less than 30 years of service of those personnel who first entered the military after august 1 1986 should be repealed secretary of defense cohen joint chiefs of staff chairman general h hugh shelton and the other five jcs members the four service chiefs and the vice chairman have all called for repeal partial or total of the 1986 act known as redux they and others assert that as military people whose retirement pay will be computed according to redux get close to making the key decision to leave the service or stay for full 20 years or more they are voting with their feet due to the inadequacy of reduxcomputed retired pay those opposed to repealing redux usually acknowledge the need to improve pay and benefits but think repealing redux is less effective than 1 increasing active duty pay particularly for senior noncommissioned officers and some fieldgrade officers 2 increasing bonuses and their effectiveness by relating them more to manpower requirements and 3 improving other qualityoflife benefits such as housing health care and moving costs leaders of both parties including president clinton have stated their general support for package of military benefit increases in the 106th congress the issues will be exactly what kind of benefits are to be increased and by how much in addition to debate over whether redux should be repealed compensation increases will have to compete with the desire of the uniformed leadership of the services for increased weapon system modernization and training funds and both will have to compete with broader range of uses for the projected budget surplus the issue cuts across party lines some republicans who are deficit hawks may view large pay increases skeptically some democrats who are generally opposed to defense budget increases may be supportive of people programs which do not involve expenditures on large

budgetary savings that can fund critical needs in readiness and modernization these initiatives which some describe as revolution in business affairs are aimed crs19 at reforming acquisition procedures outsourcing support functions reducing headquarter staffs and other overhead activities and reducing inventories of spare parts and munitions the congress has supported many dod measures to improve the efficiency of dod business practices but has sometimes differed with dod on some issues the 104th congress enacted major reform of dod acquisition regulations as part of the fy1996 dod authorization act pl 104106 key reform provisions included simplifying procedures to procure commercial products and services to preserve the concept of full and open competition and eliminating the requirement for certified cost and pricing data for commercial products to reduce procurement barriers for more commercial company participation congress also required dod to reduce its acquisition workforce by 25 percent over fiveyear period rate that is viewed in dod as controversial and difficult to achieve the 105th congress went further to prompt dod and other federal agencies to streamline their operations the fy1998 dod authorization act pl 10585 required dod to review opportunities for crossservice crossfunctional arrangements within the military services and defense agencies and identify overlapping and duplicating functions with an eye toward further streamlining acquisition processes in addition congress enacted the federal activities reform act pl 105270 requiring federal executive agencies to categorize agency activities as either inherently governmental or commercial activities in the latter category would be subject to managed competition possibly resulting in outsourcing or transferring some activities to the private sector the 106th congress will have an important oversight role on defense reform especially monitoring dod reports to congress on many of

defense has reduced its overall base structure by about 21 percent this figure compares to 33 percent reduction in dods force structure personnel and units during the same period secretary of defense william cohen as well as other high ranking officials has pointed to this structural imbalance as one reason for congress to authorize two more rounds of base closures in 2001 and 2005 he has also declared that significant savings would be achieved crs20 in an april 1998 report to congress the defense secretary estimated that savings from the first four base closure rounds initiated in 1988 1991 1993 and 1995 would produce net total savings of about 14 billion through 2001 annual savings thereafter were estimated at 56 billion as for the two new rounds sought by dod he projected additional savings after implementation of about 3 billion year in the 105th congress the secretary of defense was unable to persuade congress to pass legislation authorizing him to close more bases many members were opposed for reasons that included 1 the need to assess fully the outcome and consequences especially in terms of costssavings of the first four rounds of base closings 2 the concern of many local communities about the potentially disruptive economic and social impact of any new rounds and 3 the continuing anger of lawmakers over president clintons 1995 actions in the closing of mcclellan and kelly air force bases in the 106th congress secretary of defense cohen will almost certainly resume his campaign to close down more bases beginning with his submission of dods fy2000 budget to congress in january 1999 he will emphasize as he has in the past the importance of bringing dods base structure into alignment with the force structure as well as achieving much needed

programs and iran continued its nuclear program with russian help also in 1998 north korea pakistan and iran cooperated in missile development received help from china andor russia and each tested medium or longerrange missiles congress will confront the policy as flurry of legislative issues including authorizations and appropriations and as topics of oversight while considering legislation on numerous and complex issues congress has also indicated concern for the overall policy regarding foreign wmd and the us ability to combat this key threat two aspects congress has focused on are how the federal government is organized to establish and carry out us nonproliferation policies and the proper control of exports of sensitive dualuse goods and technology that can contribute to wmd programs controlling the spread of wmd multilateral nonproliferation regimes augment us policies with treaties agreements verification mechanisms and shared export policies key elements of the crs21 nuclear nonproliferation regime include the nuclear nonproliferation treaty its verification arm the international atomic energy agency the zangger committee and the nuclear suppliers group the chemical weapons convention has verification agency the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons the australia group monitors chemical exports of primary supplier countries as well the biological weapons convention has inspection or verification arms but the australia group also monitors biological exports the missile technology control regime sets export guidelines to which congress added unilateral enforcement mechanisms the export administration act which expired in 1994 but the authority contained therein is continued pursuant to the president invoking national emergency authority and congressionally mandated sanctions are primary tools in restricting proliferation several government departments are involved in these decisions and they are frequently in disagreement good intelligence on foreign wmd programs is also critical to us nonproliferation efforts arms control treaties can support nonproliferation by capping weapons development through nuclear weapon test ban halting the production of fissile material and by establishing nuclear weapons free zones such agreements will face significant opposition in congress requiring the administration to expend political and economic resources to gain their approval in several cases the united states and other countries have resorted to stopgap measures the agreed framework effort to freeze nuclear weapon development in north korea the unscom mission to block iraqi wmd programs negotiations to reduce the nuclear threat in south asia controls on sensitive exports to iran and nunnlugar cooperative threat reduction programs help prevent nuclear capabilities from leaking out of russia and other formersoviet republics success in these efforts depends on vigorous advocacy for coherent policies by the administration and support by congress an ultimate goal of us nonproliferation policy is to reduce the number of countries that possess wmd number of countries have abandoned their nuclear capabilities in recent years most recently however india and pakistan joined the ranks of those with demonstrated nuclear capability currently only us and russian nuclear inventories are being reduced in accordance with treaties and international agreements the chemical weapons convention and the biological weapons convention call for total ban on production stockpiling or use of these weapons the united states russia and other republics of the former soviet union are eliminating certain classes of missiles and most states that join the mtcr agree not to produce missiles with ranges greater than 300 km 186 miles deterring and defending against the use of wmd us conventional and nuclear military forces are the primary means of deterring wmd attacks against the united states us interests overseas and our allies although nuclear war has been avoided since 1945 some question the credibility of us deterrence policy especially as it is extended to allies and friends and particularly as it may be applied to the use of chemical or biological weapons by rogue regimes or subnational groups among some countries and subnational groups there is little stigma attached to the use of chemical or biological weapons ballistic or cruise missiles against military targets or even civilian population centers recent statements by administration officials have tried to emphasize the united states intolerance of the use of wmd and all forms of terrorism and the president has reiterated us crs22 commitment to help defend israel against missile attacks and to help defend south korea against north korean aggression in regions such as south asia where us security interests are not directly threatened the united states has used diplomacy confidence building measures sanctions and incentives rather than deterrence to prevent the use of wmd us national missile defense and theater missile defense objectives have been the subject of great congressional interest and have received large annual authorizations and appropriations congressional debate will surely continue as to whether the programs are sufficient and appropriate see ballistic missile defense above other programs to defend against wmd attacks include measures to detect chemical and biological agents and protect troops and civilian populations against them the us military is also developing special counterproliferation weapons to destroy wmd even when protected in bunkers without dispersing deadly materials faced with wmd in the hands of many potential adversaries the us military is devising new methods for projecting force while minimizing the wmd threat to us troops congress has also called on the administration to improve the coordination of military and civilian agencies with state and local

sea levels changes in agricultural production possible effects on health and other consequences in 1992 the nations of the world agreed upon the united nations framework convention on climate change

for the developed crs24 countries the terms of reference under which these negotiations were carried out limited new commitments to developed countries and excluded developing countries until the

including carbon dioxide 1995 levels for three manmade gases during commitment period between 20082012 in 1998 the parties met again in buenos aires argentina to flesh out the specifics of this

the agreed framework obligates the united states to facilitate the provision to north korea of two light water nuclear reactors and 500000 tons of heavy oil annually the oil shipments to cease when

the balance is due on june 1 1999 these restrictions were the result of two developments in the summer of 1998 1 the disclosure that us intelligence agencies had uncovered secret underground facility in north korea that had the appearance of nuclear installation and 2 north korean test of threestage rocket on august 31 1998 which us intelligence agencies reportedly believe indicates that north korea soon will have an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of striking alaska or hawaii another factor was growing congressional discontent over the clinton administrations offers of enlarged amounts of food aid 500000 tons promised in 1998 to north korea to secure its agreement to hold negotiations and meetings the certifications call for the president to show that progress is being made on number of issues between the united states and north korea these include securing access to the secret underground facility reducing and eliminating north koreas missile threat including the export

since 1991 and fears about the united states bypassing japan in favor of closer ties to an increasingly powerful and influential china japan remains strongly attached to its alliance relationship with the united states but it is also uneasily aware that american perceptions of japan are in flux although congress has paid comparatively little attention to usjapan relations in recent years several

recently appeared principal areas of contention between the two countries include irans support for terrorist groups iranian efforts to undermine the ussponsored arabisraeli peace process and irans programs to develop weapons of mass destruction during the clinton administration as part of dual containment policy directed toward iran and iraq both the president and congress have tried to tighten containment of iran in an effort to change its behavior in 1995 president clinton imposed ban on us trade with iran and the following year congress passed the iran and libya sanctions act pl 104172 which among other things prescribes sanctions against foreign firms that invest more than 20 million per year in irans oil or gas sectors european nations and japan oppose this measure as an extraterritorial application of us law irans president muhammad khatami elected in may 1997 has called for increased cultural contacts between iran and the united states but has ruled out dialogue with the us government at this time moreover khatamis more moderate policies remain circumscribed to considerable extent by irans conservative supreme religious leader ayatollah ali khamenei and other conservatives in the political and clerical establishments the foreign operations appropriations act for fy1999 division sec 101d of pl 105277 states the sense of congress that the united states
