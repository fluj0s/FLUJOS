aj ru pinr subject defense minister on gabala armavir russia classified by ambassador anne derse reasons 14 b and d 1 s summary defense minister safar abiyev on march 14 told the ambassador he did not object to exploration of joint usrussian use of the gabala radar station but was deliberately vague on whether the russians lease would be renewed on its expiration in 2012 he also shared details of his recent visit to moscow which came at the russians invitation amid the controversy over allegations of largescale arms transfers by russia to armenia end summary 2 c the immediate reason for the saturday morning meeting was to agree on procedure for the quick negotiation of the exercise support agreement for the planned aprilmay bilateral exercise regional response 09 rr09 while the mod had been planning on postponing the exercise due to interagency differences in baku later shown to be political reservations held by the foreign minister personally about the international message sent by the exercise reftel abiyev was now determined to move forward after lengthy afterhours meeting with foreign minister mammadyarov after the latters meeting with ambassador and datt abiyev offered his full support to the exercise and visit from useucom negotiator to finalize the agreement adding however that he was in full agreement with the foreign ministers desire to make the exercise appear as multilateral as possible to avoid raising the ire of russia and iran gabala issues 3 s responding to ambassadors question about azerbaijans future intentions regarding gabala abiyev replied that it was late in 2007 that russian defmin anatoly serdyukov approached him about extending russias use of the site beyond 2012 according to abiyev he responded in surprise and asked serdyukov to explain his request because thenpresident putin had said before that russia longer needed the site serdyukovs response was that was long time ago abiyev told the russians that the time to discuss the renewal of the lease or the expansion of the facilities or military contingent there was 2012 4 s asked about the armavir voronezh station russia recently put into operation in the krasnodar region abiyev said that it is relatively weak station with much less capability than gabala regardless of russian claims about its effectiveness he claimed this was obvious because russia had put almost 1 billion usd into improvements at gabala over the years and had only spent usd 70 million on armavir and furthermore the armavir radar only has range of 2500 km compared to 8500 for gabala note other sources give the cost of armavir at 285 billion rubles or usd 84 million at current rates and range of 4000 km russia built the station to replace the radars at sevastopol and mukachevo in ukraine which it lost when the gou refused to continue their leases end note conversations with serdyukov 5 s abiyev told the ambassador about his latejanuary trip to moscow to discuss azerbaijans allegations that russia had made extensive weapons transfers to armenia throughout 2008 in formal meetings abiyev said his russian counterpart stuck to the talking points and denied any involvement however after the second bottle of vodka that evening he said the russians opened up and admitted to having transferred weapons to armeniain an interesting side note abiyev quoted serdyukov as saying do you follow the orders of your presidentwell i follow the orders of two presidents derse
