as conditions warrant context appraisers provide an estimate of the value of real estate prior to the completion of mortgage transaction lenders typically rely on real estate appraisers because the property serves as collateral for the loan and the lender might seize and sell the property if the borrower defaults the regulation of both commercial and residential real estate appraisers was

state of new york that would establish rules for home appraisals that would take effect on january 1 20097 in the agreement the attorney general agreed to cease state investigations of fannie mae if fannie mae agreed to purchase mortgages only from banks that did not conduct home appraisals inhouse8 similar agreement was reached with freddie mac the other secondary mortgage market gse because the gses purchase high percentage of prime mortgages originated by banks it could be argued that the agreement is facto banking regulation because any bank that conducted in httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22953 house appraisals would lose access to the largest source of funds for prime mortgages although the agreement was negotiated with the knowledge of the federal regulator of the gses the office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo9 the ffiec and its member federal financial regulators have challenged both the substance of the agreement and the authority of state official to establish rules for federally chartered banks10 the status of the agreements is further complicated by the transformation of ofheo into the federal housing finance agency fhfa and the gse conservatorship it remains to be seen if the agreement between new york and fannie mae will survive the challenge of these federal banking regulators the home valuation code of conduct the cuomo agreement would establish new set of rules for appraising the value of homes referred to as the home valuation code of conduct hvcc the expressed intent of the agreement is to ensure appraisal independence and

valuation institute which is intended to be independent despite the agreements provision for 1 funding by fannie mae and 2 potential affiliation with an existing industry group the institute would propose amendments to the code establish consumer hotline and provide appraisers contact if they believed they were being pressured in any way automated valuation models and appraisal management companies some may be concerned about the impact of the hvcc on automated valuation models automated valuation models are computerized valuations based on available information as the name implies it is often possible to get an estimated appraisal from these models without person visiting the interior of the home being valued as rough analogy consider information to assist carbuying such as reports by carfax and similar services as long as the vehicles maintenance and accident information is publicly available computer model may provide rough estimate of the cars value however prudent car buyer might still prefer mechanic to personally inspect the car because httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22953 important information may not be in the public domain similarly automated valuation models attempt to provide rough home valuation based on public information of the home and nearby comparable properties examples of similar home valuations can be found on real estate service websites like the auto mechanic in the car example prudent home buyers and mortgage lenders might obtain an inspection of the home by qualified professional the hvcc expressly rejects preference for automated valuation models section xi states nothing in this code shall be construed to establish new requirements or obligations that 1 require lender to obtain property valuation or to use any particular method for property valuation such as appraisal or automated valuation model some have expressed concern that the hvcc provides preference for appraisal management companies as the name implies these firms specialize in providing real estate appraisals in some cases the hvcc does provide preference for appraisal management companies compared with some other professionals section iii for example states that appraisal management companies may be designated to arrange compensation for appraisers but that mortgage bankers and real estate brokers may not similarly section v expressly allows for employees of appraisal management companies to select appraisers but does not include real estate brokers
