the clearing congress lectures shoreham hotel washington dc the factors of clearing lecture given on 4 july l958 you know ive got some sort of idea that we have congress started here what do you think alright its an awfully grand crowd i dont know how many people are here but i think its one of the largest congresses weve had nobodys given report everybodys ina flap chuckle one of the things that has made this congress different than other congresses is long standing ambition of the organization was to film one of these congresses and so that is happening during this of course that sort of thing always introduces randomity in such things now here first off we have the usual lot of telegrams here of one kind or another and here we have one from frank turnbull in new zealand from the hasi staff in new zealand australia and oceania wishing you the clearest and best congress yet stop we wish we were there in body as well as spirit well as matter of fact im sorry theyre not here im sorry theyre not sitting right there but that means ill have to pick up this mockup one ofthese days you know pick up this mockup and take it down and put it down in new zealand mockups are very hard to move around have you ever noticed that and heres from the scientologists up from the pacific northwest dear ron staff and congress members congrats and have wonderful congress all the best scientology washington state and here is from the hasi staff and the organization secretary john fudge and hco secretary rona garbled best wishes for bumper clearing congress and heres one from the hasi south africa maggie skoltz down there best wishes for happy congress we have sitting right down here the secretary of south africa and his very charming lady here is jack parkhouse and allyson stand up you see they did comepartially in body chuckle and heres one from california heres wishing you the best congress ever and also we have the california office represented almost in totality here in julie and ken stand up we have here great many wellwishers from all parts of the world from oregon from every place but that part that part of the world which has gone into little bit of darkness we have part of the world thats gone slightly into darkness the russian african pardon the russian asian sector of the world which would love to sweep into africa and other places its an interesting thing to not to have any organizational offices in any of those countries i wonder if theres any parallel at all between the adoption of aclearing course lectures 4758 2 the factors of clearing2 totally materialistic viewpoint and an evident inability to be communicated with i wonder if that has any any correlations whatsoever well lets get on with the congress here weve got one how about bringing in my notes you know i always have to have notes laughing large stack of books on dolly is wheeled on to the stage there we are good good i always have to have notes you know its very hard thing to follow notes i mean to give an extemporaneous congress and i dont want to establish some new principle here being entirely extemporaneous and so forth and just giving you congress off the cuff because it would be bad precedent chuckle you know so i this time i very carefully collected some notes and some materials and so on andin view of the fact that were dealing mainly and basically with the mind why ive collected here most of the noteworthy books on the subject of mind and im very happy to to picking up book here for instance general introduction to psychoanalysis by professor sigmund freud lld whats that lld stand for well thats beside the point anyway we want to take this thing up thoroughly we want to take the mind up very thoroughly leafing through book and reading the courtyard in which the sheetmetal lies spread out is not to be considered primarily as symbolical but refers to the fathers place of business i will add arbitrarily that going down like the more usual going up is meant to describe well isnt that interesting turning pages in bookand reading i mean love rivalry with the emphasis on the sexual character the even as small child begins to develop special tenderness for his mother wouldnt it be strange if small child didnt develop tenderness for his mother laugh but here we find the oedipus complex entering in we now know why were all aberrated because were fond of our mothers chuckle leafing through book well i dont want to give you congress without great deal of learned material in it and reading to be sure there are all kinds of objections possible to the declaration that neurotic symptoms are substitute for sexual satisfaction you said it there are objections in fact i can think of quite few laughing well i just wanted to give you very authoritative i guess we better forget that one lets see if we havent got something thats much more pertinent here picking up another book oh heres something heres dictionary of psychology very good very good now obviously psychology should tell us great many things which we should be well aware of the first thing it should tell us about there should be definition this is psychology dictionary there should be some sort of definition for life reading lie detector life linen linnet linear perspective theres definition for life well thats beside the point theres undoubtedly here definition i hate to give congress off the cuff you know i like to have authoritative material here backing up mind mind mind mind mind theres definition here for mind laughing well theres theres undoubtedly definition for psychology ill look that up psychology hah reading though the very though the era of definition in terms of the tenets of the various schools of psychology is past there is acceptable single sentence definition now look i was trying to give you an authoritative congress here lets look up creativeness shall we leafing through book creation creation creativeness creativeness im sure they have definition for that the various things you know you need to make something im getting very nervous here because i expected these fellows to give hand you know creative thinkingclearing course lectures 4758 2 the factors of clearing3 creation but theres creative thinking its the achievement of new relationship among parts of an experience laugh well hah chuckle im little bit embarrassed here i expected some of these boys to back us up you know theres some books there on yogi but i know what they say they say if you sit still long enough youll have sat still laugh well im embarrassed there go all my notes you can take these away pointing to dolly with books you can take those things away i hardly know what sort of congress to give you now i mean here we got all of the former schools that were supposed to tell you all about the mind and so forth and they dont have definitions for the things that we consider the mind you know like life and beingalive whatll you do with them looking off stage i dont care what you do with them burn them muttering whatll i do with them but youd think theyd have definitions for things called the mind and definitions for things called man or woman or life youd think thered be objects the other day i had wonderful idea i was going to write bridge book between psychology and scientology and bridge book between psychoanalysis and scientology now dont you think that would be nice wed put them out in the book stores and people pick them up and theyd read all about psychoanalysis and then whatlaughing looking back stage at smoke i hope the management doesnt find out about this i didnt mean him to take literally laugh well there goes psychoanalysis laugh well in the fumes and flames of an expiring yesterday laugh we can begin new tomorrow one of the things that is quite amazing was to start from nowhere and every time i thought in dealing with the development of scientology that we were starting from somewhere i found that we were pretty well sidetracked science has to have certain patterns certain definitions certain objects of study and even if you only study thought you are still studying an object if you say it is thought you know you say we are going to study thought well you have to find out what you are studying in order to study it it sounds awfully funny but its brand new discovery i assure you chuckle as far as the field of the mind is concerned the isolation of discovery objects have not been done so right awayquick like bunny lets just sail right in and for the remainder of this congress im just gonna hit you left and right with all of the various isolated data which grouped as whole make clearing would you like that now some of you old timers will say oh not again and some of you new comers theyll say about the same subject what so well take the middle course ill talk to those two nice little girls right down there there are essentially four parts of what we are talking about when we are talking about when we are talking about the mind when we are talking about clearing there are four parts and these things are very easily isolated let assure you this first one doesnt have any mass its called thetan thetan by definition is something without masswithout wavelength and actually without finite location but thetan is our definition or symbol use for what they used to call ghost spirits anything elan vital any of these various items of yesteryear we have to call it something new because all of these things meant special things for instance somebody the other day colored person was discussing with whether or not ghosts still existed and i settled the argument rather easily i said well have you ever been ghost and feigning comm lag and shame and i said well im not ashamed of it i have well that person doesnt work for us any more laughingclearing course lectures 4758 2 the factors of clearing4 here is specialized meaning to spirit ghost is an evil spirit that is partially materialized evidently that is found in various locations where they will do the real estate the most damage chuckle thats evidently ghost so lets just take all of these things that people refer to as spirits or something of the sort and lets just cover that with this mathematical term thetan isnt an esoteric or magic term its simply mathematical it is the greek letter which stood for thought but that is not quite precise either because thought is product of thetan not the thetan thetan is potentially able to produce thoughts matter energy space time and all the rest of it so you get basic production unit and therefore we are starting with an assumption we have place of assumption in scientology this subject starts from somewhere thats brand new you dont realize it thats brand new it doesnt start fromwell the proclivities of the libido are very often introducable when you get socioeconomic libido theory it doesnt start from doubletalk it starts from definable thing we get axiom one alright we say this thing called thetan is capable of producing all sorts of things and we say this is the person so therefore we differ enormously from the christian statements on the subject they say you must save your soul the fellow says i dont have one so therefore the christian religion cannot possible be true and they lose all kinds of converts that way the fellow doesnt find his soul not there somebody saving his soul isdoing something very interesting he evidently has something set up over here that has probable mass that he says is his soul and then he goes about saving it and it turns out to be demon circuit called mama or something now he expects this to go to heaven but this cant exist without continuous creation by that pointing to thetan symbol on his board so he sends this to heaven and he goes on elsewhere laughing very very remarkable things go on youd be surprised how man gets tangled up in all these things but this tangling is called identification he begins to identify himself with things he says i am thing well thats all very well you can be thing if you want to person can be something yes thats true but he shouldnt go whole hog and say i am onlythat thing and nothing more and never will be anything else because when it perishes he loses his identity now the funny part of it is thetan has already basic personality and this is what we are trying to uncover in scientology in order to make clear now its as easy as that and people keep forgetting that they say well i got halfway through being clear and i knew who i was i knew i was nobody oh oh halfway through valence split half way through coming out from under the cloak of being somebody else you have terrible feeling of being exactly nobody because thats the way you went down you walked in one day and you said im seneschal and this knight with eight inch spurs standing there humph and say im supposed to open the doors to this castle ivebeen doing this for long time and im very trusted retainer well he says i dont know about that i married the old mans daughter and weve given him poison now and youre fired whats the fellows beingness now his beingness depended upon somebody elses saying he was something and he goes around still trying to say i am necessary somebody has to open these castle doors i am really the seneschal get that really see hes insisting hes the seneschal but nobody will pay him his wages and so forth hes become nobody see he has the feeling that he is nobody but this doesnt reveal this fact he was somebodyclearing course lectures 4758 2 the factors of clearing5 before he became the seneschal now as seneschal he became nobody until he finally went out and got begging pan on the highway and began to hold it out for fish and chips as people came along you know and people keep handing him something now he says i am something i am beggar but thats still something then the new york state police come along or somebody and they say to him im little mixed up in my periods here but they say to him do you realize you cannot beg upon the public road without licence number 603f and he says where do i get this licence and they say well that bureaus been abolished laughing so now he is again nobody so he starves to death and kicks the bucket and there he lies there now hes somebody hes corpse but hes not dead hes merely corpse andpeople come along and say they dont ever say you are now corpse they say look at that corpse which is below his level of tolerance entirely nobody is giving him any attention at all and so he jumps off and does something else get the idea but he goes through sequences of becoming nobody somebody nobody somebody nobody somebody nobody not necessarily on dwindling spiral some people get up to the point of being happy man you know the old story of happy man i wont tell it he didnt have shirt chuckle this chap in other words was somebody until he began to identify his beingness with thing in other words he had personality beingness an aliveness and particularly potentials and capabilities and then he decided to be something which had limited potentialsand capabilities dont you see well he could keep going downhill for long time or going out into other identities for very long time and he would eventually you might say find beingness which he was satisfied with and which could go on for long time but none of these beingnesses are the person the person is the thetan that is the one identification that scientology jumps off with now physics jumps off with an assumption and it has now blown the assumption sky wide and handsome and that is conservation of energy in the first place this thing called the conservation of energy is about the poorest name thing you would ever do you could have said conservation of mass if you please but conservation of energy now all somebodys gotto do is come along and demonstrate that energy is an impulse and isnt anything and therefore doesnt conserve and the one thing that isnt conserved about energy is an impulse why didnt anybody ever think of this they had this around for centuries and they keep saying conservation of energy there is conservation of energy there might be conservation of potential motion but they jump off from the point of conservation of energy and that is the stable datum on which the rest of it is built now if there is something wrong with this assumption of thetan we have lost our stable data so therefore we have to proceed to demonstrate what this stable data consists of it doesnt have length breadth and thickness and so forth in other words can it be proven ordemonstrated well years ago we started exteriorizing people we started kicking people out of their heads it wasnt necessarily good for them but it was fun laughing and we sure did have good time kicking people out of their heads as matter of fact they talked different and acted different go sailing around well that was the person i even developed some electrical gimmicks to have somebody sail out of his head and go over and settle on the gimmick and have it register and get out of the gimmick and go back in his head againclearing course lectures 4758 2 the factors of clearing6 fantastic you know and so far this basic premise has not been shaken probably because nobodys had any real opportunity to shake it because the one thing that very materialistic people cannot possibly confront is the thetan theres process in creation of human ability called conceiving static you say to somebody you say alright just get the idea theres spirit up there nothing spirit alright confront it good they get sick to their stomachs people who are having bad time isnt that interesting because its too little mass for them to confront so probably this thing is quite safe for years to come probably some time some great controversy will rage as to how many thetans there could be housed on the head of pin chuckle or something of this sort it is relatively unimportantlets just escape the truth of this for its workability and lets examine it as workable premise and we find out that as long as we use this as workable premise we win in clearing and as soon as we desert this as workable premise we lose in clearing that is all there is to it if we consider man to be mass of circuits and pictures and so on flesh blood tobacco juice 97 cents worth of chemistry the army says i think the price has gone up i heard somebody say that in the army the other day he said its odd that the army rescue teams and the air force rescue teams would go to so much work to rescue man who was only worth 97 cents in terms of chemistry i found objection to it because of inflation and so forthits now about 143 chuckle well if we say he is so many bits of chemistry we say hes just chemistry hes nothing but chemistry oh boy we cant cure him we cant do anything but assume the things which the healing sciences today have assumed which is if you shoot him with enough gook and big enough needles that are blunt enough often enough or enough electric shock and if you rearrange his chemistry somehow or another youll make him well person well it has very limited look you can do just so much with chemistry and all youve done is make the thetan happier with the chemistry he has thats all well thats one way of making thetan happy but its limited because it doesnt make all thetans happy some dont like chemistry im sure theres some people here who have flunked thesubject chuckle well the first thing we see the first thing we see here as an object or an item to study in this subject of scientology is thetan i say it doesnt matter whether you believe this or not the point is its workable much more important is the fact that result can be achieved which is desirable evidently by everybody its worked on by assuming this first assumption so we get out our next thing which is the mental image picture now this stupid little bug pointing to thetan symbol on his board makes pictures he makes pictures all the time hes just gotta make pictures gotta make pictures make some more pictures he makes some more pictures then he makes some more pictures he makes some more pictures he makessome more pictures he makes some more pictures and finally he says you know i dont know what to do with all these pictures im making ill just say theyll last forever and ill put them out of sight or ill say joe is doing them and ill put them out of sight and we have reactive mind and into that area he begins to collect every operation every difficulty everything he cant confront and he makes picture of it and shoves it behind him thats how we get get thee behind satan laughingclearing course lectures 4758 2 the factors of clearing7 now the funny part of it is everyone does this everybody does this and in psychology they said that only morons and little children did because the psychologist himself longer could but he was still doing it but he was doing it somewhere else where it was not visible and so forth and hes making these pictures pictures and we get the freudian unconscious we get the dianetic reactive mind and so forth it contained record evidently of everything that had ever happened to the person but the person was just making this record all the time he was keeping it mocked up and we had the nicest game running you ever saw he mocked up all of his experiences mocked them up all the time mocked them up any time he halfway thought about them or became into restimulation and then hed mockup the whole thing and not look at it which was pretty good and you got your unconscious mind now these mental image pictures of course are very demonstrable anybody can do this sometimes they get into valence that cant create and cant look and although they can still make pictures because obviously theyre still creating this valence picture they cant see other isolated pictures so they begin to believe they cant see pictures and you ask them what theyre looking at and they say nothing and you say come on take look what are you looking at shut your eyes what are you looking at i see nothing but blackness everywhere well what is blackness but picture did you ever see that kid stunt of the negro the portrait of negro hiding an coal cellar at midnight this black thing still picture itdoesnt have any features picture is not formed picture is simply picture which would simply be block of energy or mass existing in space and youd have this sort of thing and after you get enough of these sort of things the person is mocking up enough of them he calls it experience he wants to get experience and how does he hold on to experience he holds on to it with his ability to make stacks and stacks and stacks of pictures wonderful very very wonderful to see the capability of thetan in lousing himself up hes best at that thats the one thing hes really good at what does he do here he gets lazy about making pictures so he adapts another beingness to himself which makes pictures dont you see and he starts making pictures on avia of one kind or another we call these other selves theyre still merely collections of pictures we call these other selves circuits or valences and circuits and valences and that sort of thing is what were looking at and we get all kinds of oddities these are all visible things you know you can just take somebody and have him make picture and get him to see the thing and youll see people with pictures these valences are quite interesting if you run down somebodys havingness hes liable to have one of these valence or demon circuits move in on him and all of sudden hell say you know something said something or other but i didnt say it well he can tell the difference between himself and this circuit what is circuit circuit is picture of personality just like i was talking to you about hes got the idea that grandma was like this so he makes composite picture called grandma which then gives him the orders that grandma used to give him and he knew was necessary for survival such as wash your face put on your rubbers sit down at the table now get up and wash your hands you know so he always does that he sits down at the table then he gets up and washes his hands and then he goes back again its series of ordersclearing course lectures 4758 2 the factors of clearing8 well he doesnt have this around as long as hes got grandma but then he gets substitute grandma but its just series of pictures so you could say this mind is divisible into simple picture and complex picture the complex picture simply delineates personality and the simple picture delineates scene but theyre all pictures and they are all created and this is the one thing the world will never swallow and its secret just between ourselves and can you keep secret the one thing we must not tell people is that they are responsible for themselves personally for all the difficulties that ever occurred to them that you must not tell them i well remember in 1952 when i wrote advanced procedures and axioms i put section in it that said responsibility and people used to pick this book up with what airy confidence you know pick it up oh oh wonderful wonderful responsibility they look at the chart of attitudes that came out with handbook for preclears and it said responsibility full responsibility mmmm well i used to study yoga i think ill go back to that laughing the best trick that thetan does is to make something and then say i didnt do it he starts moving off these responsibility zones and responsibility in itself is tremendous subject all by itself but its the one thing you must not tell people bluntly quickly unless of course you sort of want to give them the shock of their lives you got bad leg youremocking up bad leg youre in grandpas valence youre mocking up grandpas valence you really hang them with it because thats what you have to assume when you clear people theres theoretically oneshot clear which is what part of existence could you be responsible for and when person has answered that and taken all parts of existence and his own mind and everything else and hes willing to be responsible for all those things within and without microcosm macrocosm he then would be clear if he could do it long road the only place we use that thing today is solving present time problem you say what part of that problem could you be responsible for and ordinarily the problem justgoes out flickety flack and solves itself up but nevertheless it is evidently true that willingness to be responsible for coordinates with sanity and total unwillingness to be responsible for coordinates with aberration so we get irresponsibility as the opposite number of aberration neuroses difficulty upset and so on well why is it then that this individual gets all of this silly stuff if hed only be well if he could be responsible for it why does he get all this stuff and become irresponsible for it well part of its content is this life and thetans in general have rigged out one that is super aberrative factor you go and you shoot somebody you know its calm night nothing much is happening you go out and shoot somebody the old days the way the west is portrayed on tv how they loved shootingsomebody quite wonderful anyway they shot somebody what happened here well they said so i shot somebody shooting people wasnt aberrative probably dying wasnt either but then somebody came along and said oh you shot him eh well were going to arrest you and were going to execute you and take your body away you took somebody elses body away were gonna take your body awayclearing course lectures 4758 2 the factors of clearing9 they invented in other words overt act mechanisms and the guy didnt dare say he was responsible for killing somebody he said garbled and bang then he had to go around and say i didnt do it i didnt do it i didnt do it clean hands hey look the gun hasnt been fired i didnt do it and we get way of life which is summed by i didnt do it you realize thats our modern way of life you know you say to somebody did you put out the milk bottles well i dont know why youre asking because you normally put them out every night and you know very well all you want to do is find out if the milk bottles got put out and youre in fight you just want to know that thats all you want to know you dont want to know anything else they got responsibility mixed up in this whos job itis im sure im sure that lot of government officials have their job mixed up dont you think possibly they have and the main thing they would tell you is this department is not responsible for that thats the main thing you hear well i couldnt report my income tax exactly last year because i hadnt received all of the income and i still owed quite few bills but i didnt know what the bills were because i didnt know how much i had incurred the internal revenue says thats none of our responsibility where is your income tax report see this gag runs everywhere i pulled funny gag on some people i dont get in many automobile accidents as matter of fact i havent been in one for years except the other dayi was running down past the state war and navy building which is now i guess the presidential annex or something and guy started up at the light and the light was red he noticed that it was red so he stopped and the car behind him started up and hit the back of that front car and i happened to be the third in line that was very embarrassing the only thing i could say to keep from being responsible for it is that there was redheaded girl crossing the street laughing now you think that is gag but it happens to be true and bonnie turner can attest to it i was actually looking in that direction for some reason or another there must have been something else over there laughing so here i was smashed into the back of this car and these drivers came around and they said who did what blahblah blah they were all nervous and shaking and trying to get out their drivers licenses and so forth i was standing there and i was trying hard to get my car started and find out how much damage had been done and i looked at all this nervousness and i looked at them and i said wow i said it was my fault i did that and they both calmed down completely put away the things got in their car and laughing so heres this wonderful factor of irresponsibility versus responsibility and thetan uses irresponsibility to keep himself individuated thoroughly enough as thoroughly as he thinks he needs to be and he over does it and you get aberration thats about all there is to that and even though his creativeness becomes very impeded so he cannot consciouslycreate he nevertheless continues to unconsciously create and evidently the more you step on his ability to create consciously the more he displays his ability to create unconsciously you can shove somebody clear on down into automatic poltergeist i remember in 1950 some of the dianeticists around there were very delighted with young boy who could get on rug and make it shoot underneath the table and make it shoot all over the room it was very amusing situation they got five or six priests in to demon exorcise him and so forth of course they meant to chop out few circuits that kid was shooting rugs everywhereclearing course lectures 4758 2 the factors of clearing10 well im sure everybody could shoot rugs everywhere if they wanted to be responsible for it or if they were so irresponsible that it happened anyway well people hang in between and so they cant shoot rugs around on floors and thats why you dont have magic carpets anymore thats why why you have to buy gulf gas laugh now here here is this factor entering into this second part and this second part is very clearly delineated part which is mind now what do we mean by mind we mean it is that product of thetan which compounds his experience personalities and the way he thinks it ought to be and the way he hopes it isnt and we get mass and that mass is actually composed of thoughts the big mistake the buddhists make is to consider themselvesthoughts they are not thoughts nobody ever thought them they are not thoughts they consider themselves masses of knowledge now i dont consider myself any mass of knowledge i dont try to remember anything much to the despair of my staff most of the time but there isnt any reason why you cant just create anything you want to know at any time you want to know it or go take look but instead of that people get on storage of knowledge basis storage of experience you cant get hired by the government unless you have just so much experience it doesnt matter if you do anything or not its how much experience youve got see they expect that to be all kind of massed up in the mind and its this plus the personalities person has known pictures of in other words they take pictures of these personalities and they add all these things together and then they may dream up some machinery and say the machinery makes these pictures only the machinery itself is just another picture you see or they say i knew this person who did this obsessively and that person now haunts nothing is haunting them except picture they are constantly making of that person you have to understand that clearly if youre going to clear anybody because the person himself is doing all of this now i give you that simply as technical factor not as factor to be told to people youre going to clear chuckle because they wont like it fellow is sitting there you know normal man chuckle hes sitting there and you say well i tell you how not to audit somebody you say when did you know somebody who waslike that the person might say and he might not say you say well just how are you making up that mockup and he says well how im making it up oh i got this way because of the terrible operations ive had the doctors all did this to oh yea well it did happen but it persists on the equation that he takes responsibility for mocking it up and then it gets persistence i was auditing pc one day it was very very wonderful example of this the pc was saying well itsa well alter the facts slightly so the pc wont jump out of his skin because hes here well i cant help it being this way i guess itsbecause of my father you know my father was like this my father did this all the time and i had headaches and he wished them off on just wished them off on and so i got this headache i said well now lets go over this again slowly where did this headache come from well my father wished them off on and sexually he did it and he kicked around and so forth and we went over this for few minutes and then all of sudden it dawned on this preclear he said well my father isnt there and ive been blaming my fatherclearing course lectures 4758 2 the factors of clearing11 for this and its my headache and ive been blaming my fa and bam the headache went and it was severe headache see interesting hey in other words you can audit somebody the rest of their lives without ever introducing any gradient scale of responsibility and you would never get clear but unfortunately you cannot simply audit them directly at responsibility and get clear say well you see that ceiling see all the flaws in it see the wall see how badly those curtains are hung look at how bad that cloth is over there in the curtain see that and get this thread thats loose here in my coat youre responsible for all that laughing youre not going to get any clears so somewhere in between these two courses you get clearing the person sooner or later has toand does by the processes we use abruptly cognite upon this magnificent fact and that is he is mocking it all up himself and has to mock it up consciously in order to have it there then the person becomes much happier because theyve forgotten they were mocking it up so we have this thing called mind as the second part that we were studying and then the next part is very very simple theres hardly anything to it except latin names and thats body and if you look over if you look over corpus look up corpus in the medical dictionary why you will see thereafter that body is very easy thing to understand it is merely tremendous number of latin names they dont have to attach themselves to anything they just are you know and you get all of these parts and theyre all latin namesas matter of fact thats unjust that was the scholastics method of teaching this subject the subject of medicine of more recent years they actually did start to cut up corpses and start looking at body to find out what body is well body is machine or it is mockup but it definitely is thing it is something it is form it has persistence it runs certain cycle of action from birth to death it does have parts it is ambulant it has various recognizable factors everybody has different fingerprints than everybody else perhaps people look different one to the next and you get this thing called body now from this we get the idea of ambulant matter or life injected or imbued matter existing in life created space running on life exchanged or created energy and we get the whole class of things that we call bodies andtoday they are interestingly enough building machines which are almost indistinguishable from bodies they depend they never noticed this utterly upon their operator they dont depend so much upon the operators body as the operators thinkingness and ability to think you take the univac the eneac some of these later thinking machines theyre quite wonderful people stand aroundall science evidently today is being conducted on the basis of these univacs and eneacs which is one of the more gorgeous things you ever saw because they never noticed that somebody has to ask the question and somebody has to read the answer the two things the machine will not do and yet this current that runs there everything is supervised by life and you have an organism which moves and we get sort ofa thing that isnt really body but is close to body you know an automobile has this characteristic its little bit further from it but its still life animated and then we have the universe which is life animated well i shouldnt have gone into that quite so quick but we get the next two parts the first of which is body which is intimately life animated biological organism as we understand it these days each part of which is steeply and deeply invisibly imbued with life and that is body now we have bodies of all kindsclearing course lectures 4758 2 the factors of clearing12 whether dinosaurs or cockroaches and they all more or less operate on the same basic principle they have to be animated every instant by thetan or they arent now we get something then that endures little more broadly and we call this thing the universe and of course it just runs and nobody gives it any attention at all does it yeah well we get up against this problem of who created the universe i say you did it and you say i did it and we get wonderful persistence chuckle its funny thing this stuff that goes along here with us in one level of time if you start to investigate it little bit youll find out that it has the most complex pieces if you look into piece of matter you find out it has various other elements than the one you thought it did you think its made out of sand andconcrete and you find out it also has iron and copper and gold and all sorts of things in it you just take little chip out of one of those columns and youll see at once that it has other things in it many other things its only complicated by the idea that its congealed chaos that is now regimented into less chaotic form now whoever made it whoevers running it we still had it now theres question about the fact that you are running your body this is demonstrable but that you are running the universe is little harder to prove matter who youre trying to prove it to its little harder to prove you try to prove it to certain class of priest in this particular society at this particular time and they throw you in the boobyhatchthe psychiatrist he knows that anybody who claims that he is making the universe he knows what that person is that person is crazy but he doesnt know what crazy is i love some of these points of assumption they announce grandly so and so is insane because he thinks so and so and so and so but then they never tell you what insane means well they say well thats easy hes not sane you say fine what is sane garbled not playing the game right to ask questions like that laugh youve done us great error here now if we look at the body we can we can claim an ownership and finite zone of control we say well we lift our hands and so on remember the old gag we used to do flop flop flop flop flop flop and you say after while after the guys flopped his hands whilewhos doing that and soon i am very happy about it he can do something with his hands well now you say flop that building over there well youve just run too steep scale thats all thats the only thing wrong with it so we have to compartment these next two parts into body or bodies and then into universe or universes anybody who says this is the only universe there is is probably lost and we have these next two classes and we actually only have four elements that were studying and any time you believe were studying more that four elements then youve gone astray and you wont clear anybody somebody comes up with new hypertension idea that he has ghost named throgmagog that gives him orders and you suddenly say well this is not part of his mental equipment there actually is ghost named throgmagog and it does so and so and so and so and that is part of his mind and i will therefore have to treat him with witchcraft in order to separate him from the ghost throgmagog youre not going to clear anybody i know because weve tried all these things what do you think weve been doing for eight years but throwing stuff out the window right alrightclearing course lectures 4758 2 the factors of clearing13 so when we get down to final analysis there are just four elements and they are thetan mind bodies universeuniverses just those four elements and i tell you today this is more important than it used to be we just did this so you people could just view these four things well there wasnt any reason to just view these youve got to be able to look at life in small packages in order to clear anybody because you say alright youre all involved in the middle of this chaos called life in this universe and it has 8762 parts and youve got to memorize them all and just take look at all those and realize youre responsible for all those thats fine youre clear thank you thats not gonna work not gonna work you have to bring it down so that he can focus his sights on it so you have these four parts now youve all heard of these four parts theyre part of fundamentals of thought but they become very important today because all you are doing is asserting control over body and demonstrating creativeness of mind to make clear thats all you have to do the rest of it is ot operating thetan way upstairs to make clear all you have to do is show fellow that hes mocking up his own mind therefore his own difficulties and that he is not completely adrift in and swamped by body and then there he is youve got clear and all the things that they learned about aberration psychosis neuroses libido scribido bibido all of these hocus pocusthe economic neural binaural oral system that never matriculatedand so forth endlessly 8762 medical terms none ofwhich relate to anything that would cure anybody you can just forget the whole works you see because you just do these two things you just take the first two items the thetan and you get him to confront the fact that he has body and wipe out that mind and youve got clear thats all there is to it as far as the universe is concerned were talking about something which person has to walk way upstairs about just as i say wave your hand okay wave that building and its quite jump but clear is finite state it does exist as finite state it is an ultimate and it is an absolute and those are very interesting things for to say because i used to say they werent when i was trying to dodge away from people saying where are all those clearswell im not dodging now clear is thing it is stable and it simply depends upon mastery of the mind in recognition of the body in universe thats all there is to it thats all the thing youre trying to do youre not trying to get person to take responsibility for everything on earth or anything of the sort clear could be said to be basic personality revealed and you have stood up and im going to sit down now thank you end of lecture
