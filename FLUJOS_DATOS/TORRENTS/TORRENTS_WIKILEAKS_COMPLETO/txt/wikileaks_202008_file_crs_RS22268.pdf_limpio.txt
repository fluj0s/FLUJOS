and the 2005 gulf of mexico hurricanes as well as the i35w bridge which collapsed in minneapolis mn on august 1 2007 are part of the federalaid highway system and are therefore eligible for assistance from the department of transportation dot through the emergency relief program er of the federal highway administration fhwa for disasterdamaged roads that are not federalaid highways states may request reimbursement for emergency road repairs and debris removal from the federal emergency management agency fema this report describes fhwa assistance for the repair and reconstruction of disaster damaged highways and bridges or catastrophic failures such as bridge collapse it begins with brief discussion of the legislative origins of federal assistance and describes the er program in its current form the report then discusses eligibility issues and program operation finally the report briefly describes the major findings of recent government accountability office report on er g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 for more than 70 years federal aid for the emergency repair and restoration of disaster damaged roads has been available the first legislation authorizing such use of federal funds was the haydencartwright act of 1934 pl 73393 this act however provided separate funds and states subject to disasters had to divert their regularly apportioned federal highway funds from other uses to disaster repairs the federal aid highway and highway revenue act of 1956 70 stat 374 and 70 stat 387 was the first act that authorized separate funds for the er program the program is codified 23 usc 125 from the passage of the 1956 act through 1978 funding for the program was drawn 40 from the treasurys general fund revenues and 60 from the highway trust fund htf the htf is supported by taxes paid by highway users starting in 1979 the program was funded 100 from the htf the er program was reauthorized on august 10 2005 through 2009 by the safe accountable flexible efficient transportation equity act legacy for users safetealu pl 10959 119 stat 1144 safetealu provided that allocations above the annual 100 million authorization could be funded from the general fund g22g145g142g561g8g10g25g3g514g156g561g7g150g142g155g144g142g151g140g162g561g20g142g149g146g142g143g561g507g7g20g508g561g18g155g152g144g155g138g150g561 the er program provides funds for the repair and reconstruction of roads on the federalaid highway system that have suffered serious damage as result of either 1 natural disaster over wide area such as flood hurricane tidal wave earthquake tornado severe storm or landslide or 2 catastrophic failure from any external cause for example the collapse of bridge that is struck by barge 1 historically however the vast majority of er funds have gone for natural disaster repair and reconstruction as is true with other fhwa programs the er program is administered through the state departments of transportation in close coordination with fhwas division offices there is one in every state most observers see this as strength of the program in that fhwa staff at the state 1 see us federal highway

counterparts and this facilitates quick coordinated response to disasters g8g158g151g141g146g151g144g561 the er program has an annual authorization of 100 million in contract authority to be derived from the highway trust fund these funds are not subject to the obligation limitation which means the entire 100 million is available each year because the costs of road repair and reconstruction in many disasters exceed the 100 million annual authorization safetealu authorizes the appropriation of additional funds on such sums as may be necessary basis generally accomplished in emergency supplemental appropriations legislation 2 g22g145g142g561g478g343g342g342g561g15g146g149g149g146g152g151g561g18g142g155g561g21g157g138g157g142g561g5g138g153g561 the er program limits the amount that fhwa ma provide under the er program to each state for each natural disaster or catastrophic failure to 100 million for large disasters whose costs exceed the 100 million per state cap congress may lift the cap legislatively for the i35w bridge collapse this limitation was waived in pl 11056 g22g145g142g561g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g21g145g138g155g142g561 emergency repairs to restore essential travel minimize the extent of damage or protect remaining facilities if accomplished within the first 180 days after the disaster may be reimbursed with 100 federal share permanent repair projects are reimbursed at the same federal share that would normally apply to the federalaid highway facility for interstate system highways the federal share would be 90 and for most other highways the share would be 80 permanent repairs done during the first 180 days are also reimbursed at the pro rata share that would normally apply to the facility the share for disaster relief for roads on federal lands is 100 in pl 109148 congress broadened the scope of the 100 federal share to encompass all er program expenses for repair and reconstruction projects related to the gulf coast hurricanes the i35w repair and reconstruction authorized in pl 11056 would also be 100 share as is true with other fhwa programs the er is reimbursable program this means that state can incur obligations begin repairs and then submit vouchers to fhwa for reimbursement for the federal share of the project g7g149g146g144g146g139g146g149g146g157g162g561g138g151g141g561g18g155g152g144g155g138g150g561g17g153g142g155g138g157g146g152g151g561 the er program divides all repair work into two categories emergency repairs and permanent repairs only repairs to roads and bridges on the federalaid highway system that have suffered damage during declared disaster or catastrophic failure are eligible for er assistance3 the 2 historically emergency supplemental er appropriations have been drawn from the highway account of the highway trust fund htf the balance in the highway account has fallen in r ecent years and it was unclear whether the htf could fund large katrina related supplemental appropriations without constraining the ability of the htf to fully fund safetealu 3 governor may declare an emergency proclamation and the fhwa division administrator may then concur that disaster occurred and substantial damage has occurred to the federalaid highway system roads over wide area or that

minimize the extent of damage or to protect the remaining facilities 4 state and local transportation agencies can begin these repairs immediately and prior approval from fhwa is not required once the fhwa division administrator finds that the disaster work is eligible properly documented costs can be reimbursed retrospectively emergency repair work is to be accomplished within the first 180 days after the disaster and as mentioned earlier is reimbursed at 100 federal share examples of emergency repairs are debris removal regrading removal of landslides construction of temporary road detours erection of temporary detour bridges and use of ferries as an interim substitute for highway or bridge service emergency repairs are meant to permit work to start immediately to restore essential traffic in the disaster area that cannot wait for finding of eligibility and programming of project this part of the program is especially designed for speed in the case of some disasters state dots have been able to let er funded debris removal and demolition contracts the same day of the disaster event 5 g18g142g155g150g138g151g142g151g157g561g20g142g153g138g146g155g156g561 these repairs go beyond the restoration of essential traffic and are intended to restore the damaged bridges and roads to predisaster conditions and capabilities where the damaged parts of the road can be repaired to predisaster conditions without replacement or reconstruction this is done where road needs to be replaced er funding is limited to the costs of building roadway designed to current standards and of comparable capacity er funds may be used for temporary or permanent repair of repairable bridge but permanent repairs may not be funded if the bridge is scheduled for replacement if bridge is destroyed or repair is not feasible then er funds may participate in building new comparable bridge to current design standards and to accommodate traffic volume projected over its design life in some cases betterments added protective features added lanes added access control etc may be eligible but they must be shown to be economically justified based on costbenefit analysis of the future savings in recurring repair costs permanent repair and reconstruction contracts not done as emergency repairs must meet competitive bidding requirements number of techniques are available to accelerate projects including designbuild contracting abbreviated plans shortened advertisement period for bids and the costplustime ab bidding 6 that includes monetary incentivedisincentive clauses continued the criteria for catastrophic failure were met and that the damage is eligible under 23 usc 125 when the president has issued major disaster declaration the division administrators concurrence is not

requirement of the national environmental policy act nepa of 1969 the impact however is generally limited since emergency repairs are normally classified as categorical exclusions under 23 cfr771117

expressed concerns on the grow ing budgetary implications of er spending10 the report points out that because of the constrained outlook for the highway trust fund the er program is now mostly funded with general fund revenues at time when the nation faces pending fiscal crisis raising concerns about future use of the general fund and the financial sustainability of the er program er funds are not intended to replace other federalaid state or local funds to increase capacity correct nondisasterrelated deficiencies or make other improvements however contributing to future financial sustainability concerns is the fact that the scope of eligible activities funded by the er program has expanded in recent years with congressional or fhwa waivers of eligibility criteria or changes in definitions as result some projects have been funded that go beyond repairing or restoring highways to predisaster conditions such as projects that grew in scope and cost to address environmental and community concerns congress has also directed that in some cases the program fully fund projects rather than requiring state match the report also noted that the 100 million annual authorization is so low that since 1990 86 of er program funds have been made availa ble though supplemental appropriations this situation has led to project backlogs that force states to delay reconstruction or use other highway dollars as they await the funds provided through the supplemental appropriations process continued contract includes disincentive for overrunning the time bid and an incentive for earlier completion 7 the davisbacon requirements can be suspended by executive order ref 40 usc 276a5 president bush did this in response to katrina he reimpose d the requirements november 8 2005 8
