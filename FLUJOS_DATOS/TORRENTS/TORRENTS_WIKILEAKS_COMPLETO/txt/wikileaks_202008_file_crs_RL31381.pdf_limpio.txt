j1 cultural exchange participants or s4 terrorist informants interest in nonimmigrant visas soared immediately following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks which were conducted by foreign nationals apparently admitted to the united states on legal visas since that time policy makers have raised series of questions about aliens in the united states and the extent that the federal government monitors their admission and presence in this country some visa categories are the focus of legislative activity eg guest workers the us department of state dos consular officer at the time of application for visa as well as the department of homeland security dhs immigration inspectors at the time of application for admission must be satisfied that the alien is entitled to nonimmigrant status the burden of proof is on the applicant to establish eligibility for nonimmigrant status and the type of nonimmigrant visa for which the application is made both dos consular officers when the alien is petitioning abroad and dhs inspectors when the alien is entering the united states must confirm that the alien is not ineligible for visa under the socalled grounds for inadmissibility of the ina which include criminal terrorist and public health grounds for exclusion nonimmigrant visas issued abroad dipped to 50 million in fy2004 after peaking at 76 million in fy2001 in fy2008 66 million nonimmigrant visas were issued over the past 12 years dos has typically issued around 6 million nonimmigrant visas annually the growth in visa issuance in the late 1990s has been largely attributable to the issuances of border crossing cards to residents of mexico and the issuances of temporary worker visas combined visitor visas issued for tourism and business comprised the largest group of nonimmigrants in fy2008 with about 47 million down from 57 million in fy2000 other notable categories were students and exchange visitors 116 and temporary workers 99 the law and regulations set terms for nonimmigrant lengths of stay in the united states typically have foreign residency requirements and often limit what aliens are permitted to do in the united states eg gain employment or enroll in school but many observers assert that the policies are not uniformly or rigorously enforced achieving an optimal balance among major policy priorities such as ensuring national security facilitating trade and commerce protecting public health and safety and fostering international cooperation remains challenge
