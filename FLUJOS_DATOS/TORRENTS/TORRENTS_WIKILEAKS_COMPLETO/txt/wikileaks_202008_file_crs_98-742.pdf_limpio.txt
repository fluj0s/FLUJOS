summary growth in us trade with developing countries is one of the more troublin g globaliz ation issues and has been part of the debate over passage of fasttrac k authority extension of the north american free trad agreement nafta and the africa trade bill central concern for many is whether this trade relationship leads to lost jobs or reduced wages for the u s labor force particularly unskilled workers over the past three decades us tr ade with developing countries has expanded markedly from 1987 to 1997 developingcountry trade rose 195 compared to 104 for trade with developed countries increasing its share from 36 to 45 of total us trade us exports to developing countries grew by 243 compared to 135 for developed countries and imports expanded re spectively by 167 and 84 imports from developing countries represent only 5 of us gross domestic product gdp the economic implications of these trends are disturbing precisely because trade theory may be seen to support the prospect that trade with developing countries can hurt unskilled us w orkers developing countries have comparative advantage in the product ion of goods using unskilled labor accordingly increased us imports from lowwage countries may lead to decline in demand for unskilled us workers reducing their wages and contributing to widening of the differential between skilled and unskilled manufacturing wages however because many assumptions of trade theory are violated in the real world and other factors affect real wages the effects of trade need to be examined carefully economists disagree on the strength of the tradewage inequality relationship with estimates ranging from those that consider trade the primary problem of unskilled workers to those that see trade as virtually blameless or overwhelmed by othe r factors chiefly technological change most studies suggest that extreme estimate s may be overstating their respective cases and that trade is only one of many factors affecting inequality consensus of estimates would put developingcountry trade responsible for between 10 and 20 of the growth in wage inequality since th 1970s ec onomists generally portray this as only modest effect suggesting that most of the inequality problem cannot be explained by trade although economists disagree on the effects of trade they tend to agree on trade policy arguing that protectionist policies d little to help unskilled workers and come at very high price to the rest of the economy alternatives involve helping unskilled workers adjust to trade by upgrading their skill levels helping them transition t higher quality jobs r perhaps providing some type of transitional income assistance or insurance in short whether one is inclined to accept the worst case scenario on the effects of developingcountry trade on the united states or dismiss it entirely in favor of technological change as the greatest threat to the american dream th consensus solution among economists lies

with fasttrack uthority and other trade policy legislation one perspective embraces freer trade as promoting productivity economic growth and highe r standards of living another argues that even if

relationships over the past decade concentrating on the growing importance of developing c ountry trade and particularly its effects on us workers following sh ort summary of major trends in us trade

changing investment and production patterns also explain much of the increased trade volume between the united states and developing countries hence it is not only the size of trade with developing countries that raises polic issues but also the effects of changing us economic relationships related to thi s trade an important aspect of trade with developing countries involves specialization below the final product level where diffe rent countries manufacture only portion of the whole good developing countries t ake on the relatively lowskill laborintensive stages of the production proce ss with developed countries such as the united states completing the relatively highskill and capitalintensive portion of the productio n process us firms have engaged in socalled production sharing for decades th most well known arrangement being the maquiladora progra m in mexico production sharing allows us firms to send materials or intermediate goods to another country for assembly or manufacture the resulting product is then imported back into th united states for further production or final sale3 lower wages provide the basis for such production differentiation and th developing

jagdish and marvin h kosters eds trade and wages leveling wage s down washington dc the aei press 1994 pp 4246 the basis for improved economic wellbeing is not intuitive for many yet most people s6 economic lives are based on specialization and trade they perform specific jobs and hir others to do things they do not have the time inclination or skills to do as well this same concept applies to countries in the global economy in addition to comparative advantage economies of scale and product differentiation encourage countr ies to trade particularly where they have similar factor endowments and production capabilities3 respectively of their us counterparts these trends partially explain why with the exception of china the developing countries with the hig hest growth in total trade with the united states malaysia thailand mexico singapore have significan t production sharing arrangements with us firms4 the implications of growing us trade with developing lowwage countries is bothersome for many because these changing economic relationships imply that as firms adjust to take advantage of specialization driven by lower costs the us economy undergoes change such change is at the heart of the trade policy debate because of economic implications for those firms and workers who compete directly with foreign lowwage producers and therefore bear the brunt of the adjustmen t process trade theory and its implications the benefit s of freer trade are being embraced by an everwidening group f countries particularly those in the developing world trade occurs because it i s5 mutually benefi cial for each trading nation and trade theory helps explain why this is so first in an open trading system specialization by comparative advantag suggests that the gains from trade arise from countries producing what they d relatively more efficiently than other countries and trading for those things that are produced relatively more efficiently abroad in other words trade comes abou t because countries do not produce all things equally well6 second economists recognize that countries export goods that use intensively their most abundant factors of production cap ital and labor and import goods that use their scarce factors intensively heckscherohlin theorem this concep t provides very useful beginning to understand trade between developed an d developing countries because they are endowed differently which provides the basis for trade eg the us has relative abundance of highskilled labor compared t developing countrieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98742crs4 us department of labor op cit p 47third as economies adjust to trade producing goods that use their relativel most abundant factors of production the prices of these products should tend t converge among trading countries to the extent that this occurs the prices f factors labor capital needed to produce these products also tend to converge fact or price equalization theorem finally it follows that as demand for th abundant factor used f or exports increases with trade so too does its price relative to the scarce factor which in turn raises the real income of owners of the abundant factor income distribution moves in favor of factors used for export stolper samuelson theorem important to the analysis of these propositions discussed in the next section is the critical and genera lly accepted relationship that trade affects wages one factors price indirectly through the mechanism of relative product prices rather than th volume of goods traded implications of trade theory trade theory it seems does not bode well for the lowskilled worker in th united states developing countries h ave comparative advantage in certain natural resources and lowskilled labor with trade liberalization they would specialize i n exporting goods that use lowskilled labor intensively because lowskilled labor i s abundant and less expensive compared to capital and highskilled labor and import from advanced economies goods that use capital and highskilled labor intensivel because capital and highskilled labor re scarce and more expensive relative to low skilled labor developing countries for example would export simple manufactures and primary products while importing relatively more sophisticated manufacture d goods in developing countries that trade with the united states the demand for low skilled manufacturing workers their relatively abundant factor should rise relativ to the unit ed states it follows that wages for lowskilled manufacturing worker s should rise in developing countries relative to comparably skilled workers in th united states in other wo rds over time the wage gap between lowskilled workers in developing and developed countries is expected to narr ow in fact data since 1975 suggest this is happening with compensation rising faster albeit from much lower base in nearly all developing economies than in the united states7 also wage differentials should widen between lowskilled and highskille d manufact uring workers in the united states because increased competition fro m imports using lowskilled workers from developing countries would cause us busines ses to shift production toward more profitable goods using highskille d workers the demand for lowskilled workers thus falls relative to the highskilled putting downward pressure on the formers wages trade theory then seems t support the prospect that trade with developing countries may hurt lowskille d workers in the united states which is at the heart of the current debatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98742crs5 few assumptions would be free markets full employment perfect competition n o8 transportation costs homogeneous factors of production constant technology these l

of us trade patterns with developing countries suggest that they do reflect rather strongly what would be expected from economic theory as stated simply in on study in trading with developing countries the united states is net exporter f skillintensive products and large net importer of nonskillintensive products9 but what d oes this mean for the us economy more specifically the ke questions are 1 how has developing country trade affected us employment and 2 is it responsible for the growth in wage inequality between low and highskilled workers the answers to these questions come from vast quantities of recen t research of which representative sample is summarized below10 analyzing the problem although lowwage workers have had real wage gains in recent years it is too early to conclude that the united stat is experiencing reversal of three trends that have been in place since the early 1970s first the demand for manufacturing labor has fallen particularly for unskilled workers second real wages of unskilled workers have declined relative to skilled workers third real wages of unskilled workers have fallen in absolute terms reducing their standard of living11 real wages are largely determined by labor productivity function of skil l levels experience education and training but of recent concern to both trade andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98742crs6

economists are two specific trends suspected of affecting the work force growth in trade with developing countries and the increased use of persona l computers and other technological innovations most economists acknowledge that both trends may affect us labor markets by increasing the demand for highskil l relative to lowskill workers theoretically technological advancement leads to an increase in demand for relatively higher educated trained and skilled workers increased developing country imports made mostly by unskilled labor by contrast decrease the deman d for unskilled labor in the united states the question remains to what extent can labor market trends be linked to trade or technology or both most studies rely on one of two basic techniq ues to evaluate the role of trade on employment and wages the first is factor content analysis which seeks to determine employment effects of trade by estimating how much skilled and unskilled labor i s used for producing countrys exports and how much would be used to produce at home the goods it imports wage effects are then estimated based on some measure assumed or esti mated of how sensitive wages are to changes in the supply of labor both skilled and unskilled 12 although widely used factor content analysis has ardent critics who believe it is inadequate to evaluate t rades effects on wages first and foremost this approach does not link goods prices with factor prices wages which critics argue is n analytical must for lowwage imports to put downwar d pressure on us wages the prices of lowskillintensive goods must fall relative to highskillintensive goods product prices are ignored however in factor content analysis13 second factor content analysis makes the assu mption that wage effects logically follow employment effects even if the employment ffects are accepted some factor content analyses point ou t that wages may not move in predictable magnitude with the employment effects this is due in part to the fact that today only 15 of th work force is employed in manufacturing and only 2 is employed in sector s confronted with serious competition fro m developing country imports further non manufacturing industries that employ unskilled workers construction retail fas t food may have stronger influence than trade in setting unskilled wages econom wide this is not to say that factor content analysis does not have its uses fo r illuminating the possible employmen t effects of trade it just does not make the direct link to wages that is inferred except perhaps under very stringent assumptions14 second method very specifically evaluates goods and factor prices t determine i f the price of lowskillintensive products has fallen relative to highskillhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98742crs7 freeman will globalization dominate us labor market outcomes pp 1242515 this discussion is taken from wood adrian how trade hurt unskilled workers journal16 of economic perspectives v 9 summer 1995 pp 5780intensive product s if this is occurring then trade with developing countries may be following the path predicted by trade theory thereby contributing to employment and wage problems suggested by labor advocates this methodology is also limited in some respect s in particular trade prices are not fully reliable in making an assessment about whether lowskillintensive impor t prices have fallen relative to highskillintensive imports among many drawbacks import price series are very incomplete and precision is lost when various products are aggregated in th trade data there is accounting for differences in quality of goods exported and imported for example or any way to assess reliably differen t labor skills employed15 keeping in mind these methodological limitations attempts by economists t pass judgement on the employment and wage effects of trade are organized belo w into three categories first there are those who argue that evidence points to trade as the primary factor causing employment and income problems for the unskille d work force at the other end of the spectrum are those convinced to the contrary that trade plays virtually role bot h of these positions may be considered minority views today in the middle are gathered many economists who acknowledge tha t trade with d eveloping counties may affect us labor markets but that it is only one of many factors and not the most important this is by far the largest group trade is the issue labor advocates argue that trade with developing countries directly affect s employment and income of lowskill ed workers although much of the public policy literatur relating trade to labor market problems reflects views that are to larg degree unsubstantiated some indepth research has raised to serious level questions over the prospect that as stated by t he first economist in this group trade is the main cause of problems of the unskilled workers wood adrian wood repre sents one end of the debate spectrum using factor content analysis he asserts that as predicted by trade theory in country wit h relatively few unskilled workers compared with the rest of the world the unite d states lowering barriers to trade w ith developing countries will cause production to shift in favor of skillintensive products and away from lessskillintensive goods this occurs because citing textile and apparel for example the relative price of the apparel falls with trade lowering the demand for unskilled labor wood shows that in crosscountry comparison from 1970 to 1990 the fall in manufacturin g employment in all developed countries is concentrated in lowskill sectors an d correlates strongly with the rise in manufactured imports from developing countries16 to test for the strength of this relationship wood evaluates the factor content of trade but makes some unconventional modifications that have called into question the magnitude of his results first he assumes that if developed economies

relatively more consistent with production in developing economy second h argues that developed eco nomies would be more labor intensive if they did not trade with lowwage countries because such trade encourag the adoption of laborsaving technologies to an even greater extent than otherwise would be the case wood therefor makes fairly high estimates regarding the employment effects in developed economies of liberalizing trade with developing countries he argue s that trade with developing countri has caused 20 decline in the relative demand for unskilled labor in developed countries as an outside estimate including implie d losses the service sector it follows that such strong influence on relativ e17 employment would have significant downward influence on th wages of lowskilled workers in developed economies many econ omists do not accept these assumptions and so find his estimates too high borja s freeman and katz this factor content analysis relies on mor conventional assumptions asserting that because the united states is net importer of lowskillintensive goods its trade deficit in these goods amounts to indirectl increasing the supp ly of unskilled labor relative to skilled labor particularly workers with less than high school education making the similar point with respect t employment and wages the authors found that trade was responsible for 1525 of the 11 percentage point increase in earnings inequality between college and hig h school graduates in t he early 1980s however in an updated version of this study18 carrying the analysis forward from 19 80 to 1995 the authors found trade responsible for only 5 of the effect on income inequality between high school and colleg graduates and slightly more 8 of the discrepancy between high school graduates and dropouts19 trade is not the issue at the other end of the debate is the position that trade has nothing to do with employment and income problems in the united states this position is the general finding of var ious studies that focus on the prices of products exchanged consistent with trade theory as mentioned above trade theory however may not hold up if many of the necessary assumptions are

323323lawrence and slaughter this study is representative of the group tha t strongly disput the hypothesis that trade is major cause of wage inequality in the united stat it argues that there is evidence during the 1980s that the prices of traded goods using lowskill labor abundantly fell relative to those produced with an abundance of highskill labor in addition the authors tested for evidence tha t technology was critical factor in growing wag inequality by skill level they found that technological progress was concentrated in the skilledlaborintensiv industries bidding up the relative wages of skilled labor20 interestingly then this study shows that there was relative increase in demand for skilled work ers even as their relative wage increased trade theory would predict counterbalancing increased use of now relatively lowerpriced unskilled labor in support of their principal finding the authors take an added step and cite othe r evidence that technological change has served to save lessskilled labor in th production process in short this study found relationship between growth i n21 productivity and the use of nonproduction highskill labor which given the increase in its relat ive wage is strong indication that technology and hence the need fo r highskil l labor is the driving force in the wage inequality story effectivel overpowering any trade effects the technology argument is summarized on page 13 trade may be the issue there is growing middle ground in the economics literature analyzing bot h trade levels and prices that is not ready either to

of developing country trade decline i n employmen t of 57 percent is divided between drop in production lowskill employment of 62 percent and drop in nonproduction highskill employment of 43 percent these authors agree with wood that trade th eory explains some of the22 labor market effects following similar logic and methodology but in using mor traditional approach to factor content analysis they come to the conclusion tha t woods implications of greater impact of trade on unskilled employment could not be established specifically developing country trade is shown to affect lowskil l

this24 conclus ion points to the difficulty in attempting to explain economywide effect s based on select sectoral analysis suggesting that there are more forces at work t explain the wage discrepancy issue the authors assert that combination of technical change and traderelated effects would explain much of the change i n relative demand for skilled workers as well as the growing wage gap25 this study has come under criticism for excluding computer prices in its trade sample becaus relative prices fell dramatically reflecting huge gains in productivity that would ov erwhelm the rest of the data with computer prices the data would not point to an i ncrease in the relative price of highskillintensive goods and so not provide the evidence that trade may have played role in the wage disparity issue many critics do not accept dropping computers from the sample and further argu even if done the result is still statistically insignificant to condemn trade26 krugman opting for different methodology but again looking at the volume of trade paul krugman argues that developing country trade has had only smal l effect at most on labor market problems in the developed world he develops computable general equilibrium model to expl ore how wages and employment in the advanced countries and trade with the third world might be simultaneousl determined the general equ ilibrium approach explores the effects of one variable27 on the economy as whole defining relationships across different markets say the tradeable goods market and the employment market krugmans model suggests that trade growth between deve loping and developed countries is consistent with 3 rise in the relative wages between skilled an d unskilled workers in the united states since the early 1970s 10 of the 30 increase the effect is larger because t he trade volume is too small relative to the us econ omy further the effects of the factorpriceequalization theorem wages convergi ng between low and highwage economies break down with complet production specialization because effectively workers are not manufacturing th same goods and so not truly competing with each other across borders krugman concludes that wages of developed country wor kers are therefore not seriously threatened by developing country trade he uses the notebook computer as case in point suggesting that although the

suggest that they are correct in looking to globalization as one reason for the relative d ecline in unskilled wages he does this by also critiquing the work of his colleagues on the international economic side suggesting they have not properly assessed the problem29 leamer argues that product prices focusing in particular on data from th apparel and textile industries have moved in the direction that is consistent with an increase in income inequality in the united states this trend occurs however only for the 1970s when prices of apparel fell by 30 as employment and wages in th industry moved in tandem in the 1960s prices employment and wages of l income groups rose and in the 1 980s the free fall in apparel and textile prices ceased consisten t with other studies finding that trade was not factor in the growth of the wage differential his assessment is that the 1970s were the stolpersamuelso n decade where wage inequality is linked with the rise of lowwage imports othe r economists find otherwise because they focused only on the 1980s leamer suggests however that technology was likely the more important factor affecting wages in the 1980s but that the issue remains unresolved30 leamers work has attracted critics s well many focused on the strict technical limitations of his model in addition broad concerns have been raised regarding facts not addressed in his story for example the fall in real wages during the 1970s also coincided with an overall decline in productivity as the us economy weathered oil shocks inflation and unemployment energy prices and unemployment may wel l have influenced real compensation in the work force particularly in textiles an d apparel31 summary and conclusions trade with developing countries is growing flagging

imports eg apparel increase the purchasing power of consumers particularly lowincom consumers who often are the ones also adversely affected by trade in these cases the two effects need to be considered to assess correctly the net effect of trade as closing point if the consensus estimate range on the wage impact f developi ng country trade is accepted then some 8090 of the issue remain s unexplained the common response to this conclusion is that the major problem of lowwage workers arises because their skills longer match the production needs brought about by technological change critics of this response point out tha t technologys effect on t he economy cannot be measured directly in statistical studies and so often is only assumed to be residual effect to the extent other factors ar accounted for this measurement problem remains an area of ongoing research for the time being32 policy implications congress has been conce rned about trade legislation in part because of concern over trades effects on lowskilled workers even if the consen is correct and trade account s for only modest portion of wage inequality in the united states it i s widely argued that helping the few hurt by trade is the socially responsible action to take giv that the economy as whole may be better off with freer trade crafting effective policy responses has been difficult because there is single easily identifiable quick fix to the predicament of lowskilled workers one option i s to support measures that restrict imports the rationale is that if competition from develop ing countries lowers the real wages of some us workers minimize th is competition interestingly although labor groups tend to support this position manifested essentially by resisting efforts to expand free trade agreements few economists agree this extends even to those who believe that developin g country trade is serious problem such as adrian wood their reasoning is tha t trade restrictions have high economywide costs in terms of consumer choice an d prices producer input prices and overall efficiencyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98742crs14 for more background see crs issue brief 98023 trade

worker pp 51416a second alternative which has been in place for over 30 years is to includ trade adjustment assistance taa as part of any trade liberalizing legislation taa has historically included both cash payments to compensate unemployed individuals who have had their inco mes directly reduced because of trade and retraining to help these disp laced workers prepare for jobs currently in demand since its inception in 1962 however taa has been criticized for being ineffective and costly jo b retraining has helped only fraction of affected workers and the program itself can delay benefits while workers go through the process of being certified33 recurring policy option within the taa framework is to offer some type f shortterm earnings subsidy or insurance this would encourage workers to tak e34 new jobs more quickly even if the new jobs pay less than those lost by providin g suppleme ntal income for stated period of time some view this as the best way to provide more complete compensation to those most hurt by trade but as an income transfer entitlement program it is also the highcost option which has limited it s appeal in the past the debate continues over how to implement the most efficien t and effective policy response as the debat on fast track and other trade issues heats up again the downside of trade liberalization will be discussed as will options to minimize it if history is any guide one response likely to be considered will be whether or how to compensate losers by enhancing or expanding taa regardless of how this facet of the debate is resolved it also seems clear that whether one is inclined to accept the worst case scenario on the effects of developing country trade on the united states or dismiss it entirely in favor of technological change as the greatest threat to the america n dream the consensus solution among economists lies with making the work force as competitive as possible
