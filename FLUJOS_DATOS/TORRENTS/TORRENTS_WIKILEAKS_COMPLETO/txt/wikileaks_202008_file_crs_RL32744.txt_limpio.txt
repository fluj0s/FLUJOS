congress mercury emissions from electric generating units review of epa analysis and mact determination summary the environmental protection agency epa has identified mercury as the hazardous air pollutant emitted from electric generating units that is of greatest public health concern as result epa proposed regulations limiting electric generating unit egu mercury emissions in december 2000 epa committed to promulgating maximum achievable control technology mact emissions limits under section 112 of the clean air act section 112 sets specific requirements for mact standards for new facilities the mact standard must be at least as stringent as the degree of emissions control achieved at the best controlled similar source for existing facilities the mact standard must generally achieve limits equal to the average performance of the best 12 of comparable sources determination of this performance is complicated by the lack of installed commercial technology specifically for capture of egu mercury emissions thereby necessitating data collection on other existing technologies and extensive analysis of potential control levels to determine the level of allowable mercury emissions epa collected data regarding coal composition and mercury emissions from an 80 egu sample analysis of these data led epa to subcategorize egus and propose mact standards for each subcategory in january 2004 the proposed mact standards have been criticized by wide range of stakeholders on several criteria including epa methodology to determine the allowable emissions threshold the epa methodology incorporates two statistical treatments the use of first 975 upper confidence limit to account for the variability in input coal and second another 975 upper confidence interval to account for variance in plant operation the result is proposed standards that are substantially less stringent than the average emissions rate of the top 12 of the 80 unit sample while epa justifies these statistical treatments others assert they unnecessarily weaken the proposed regulation indeed the proposed mact standard allows greater amount of mercury emission than most stakeholders from all viewpoints had recommended prior to the epa proposal the proposed mact standards pounds of mercury per trillion btu are shown along with the average mercury emission and the results of the first

review of epa analysis and mact determination introduction mercury is heavy metal and potent neurotoxin that bioaccumulates and concentrates as it passes through the food chain the environmental protection agency epa considers it both public health concern and concern in the environment1 these concerns have grown in recent years as research has indicated mercurys presence at significant levels in numerous species of fish analyses of human dietary intake and resulting levels of mercury in blood have pointed to potential health risks from mercury ingestion particularly for women of childbearing age2 to limit mercury exposure 45 states have issued fish consumption advisories3 at the same time epa and the states have promulgated series of regulations to reduce the amount of mercury used in products4 and limit emissions for most sources of mercury emitted to the atmosphere5 us emissions of mercury to the air come from eight principal sources of these the largest source and the only major source for which emission standards have not yet been promulgated is coalfired electric generating units coalfired 1 us epa regulatory finding on the emissions of hazardous air

rl31881 pp 24 federal regulations and p 7 state regulations crs2 electric generating units account for between onethird and onehalf of total us mercury emissions in january 2004 epa proposed regulations to limit emissions from these units positing two possible control mechanisms one is to establish maximum achievable control technology mact standards for emissions of mercury from coalfired electric power plants the other is to develop capandtrade mechanism for those same emissions this report focuses on the proposed epa mact standards including critiques thereof and does not treat the proposed cap andtrade alternative model number of controversies have arisen concerning the proposed mact standards in general critics argue that the proposed standards are not sufficiently stringent to meet the statutory requirements for mact the epa responds that technology to meet more stringent standards is not currently available and that the standards reflect the best performance achieved by currently installed control equipment6 this report examines this controversy ie whether the proposed mact standards do reflect the best emission control achieved at existing coalfired electric generating units as required by statute this report begins by describing the statutory requirements and the standards proposed by epa it then proceeds to describe the sampling methods used by epa to generate data on existing mercury control levels the methodology used by epa to determine the proposed mact standard based on the sampling data is described finally some of the comments received by epa on the proposed standards are reviewed maximum achievable control technology on january 30 2004 under section 112d of the clean air act the epa proposed the establishment of maximum achievable control technology mact standards for emissions of mercury from coalfired electric power plants7 the standards rely on the statutory requirements in section 112d3 of the clean air act which states that for new sources the degree of reduction shall be not less stringent than the emission control that is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source for existing sources the degree of reduction shall be with some qualifications not less stringent and may be more stringent than the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of the existing sources for which the administrator has emissions information or if there are fewer than 30 sources in category or subcategory it shall be not less stringent than the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 5 sources for 6 us epa proposed national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants and in the alternative proposed standards of performance for new and existing stationary sources electric utility steam generating units preamble section ivd2 69 federal register 4698 january 30 2004 7 standards were also proposed for nickel emissions from oilfired power plants but these standards have not proven as controversial and are not discussed in this report crs3 which the epa administrator has or could reasonably obtain emissions information8 the statute establishes minimum requirement mact floor but it explicitly permits the administrator to impose more stringent requirements it is unclear how often epa has used this authority to go beyond the floor although two examples of the agencys doing so involve mercury controls imposed on municipal and medical waste incinerators in the mid1990s9 this report focuses on epas calculation of the current mact floor for mercury emissions from coalfired powerplants not whether the agency should have gone beyond it10 thus this report will not discuss at any length beyondthefloor technologies or standards us power plant has as yet installed emission control technologies specifically designed to capture mercury emissions therefore the currently proposed mact floor for these sources relies on calculations of mercury removal rates cobenefits achieved by other technology that was installed to control sulfur dioxide particulates or other regulated pollutants the epas objective was to identify the technologies designed for other pollution control objectives that have the maximum level of these cobenefits for mercury emissions the proposed mact standards for mercury emissions from coalfired powerplants are shown in table 1 using the authorities provided in section 112c and d epa divided coalfired plants into five subcategories four based on coal type bituminous subbituminous lignite and coal refuse and the fifth based on combustion technology integrated gasification combined cycle also known as igcc each type of coal has differing properties and mercury contents additionally the number of facilities burning each type of coal varies with the majority of facilities burning bituminous or subbituminous coal the epa set standards that vary by as much as factor of 30 depending on the coal type the most stringent standards apply to coalrefusefired and bituminousfired facilities while the other categories have less stringent standards as shown in table 2 the size of the five subcategories also varies widely 95 of the existing units fall into 8 42 usc 7412 9 at the time these regulations were promulgated these technologies were considered beyond the floor although now they are standard controls on incinerators the most common of the technologies is activated carbon injection aci which when used with fabric filter or baghouse captures more than 90 of mercury emissions from incinerators similar technology has been the subject of successful fullscale field tests at at least four coalfired power plants but has not yet been commercially installed 10 considerable controversy has arisen over whether epa is correct in deciding not to go beyond the floor this determination is generally supported by industry groups who agree that mercuryspecific controls are not commercially available others including environmental groups and some state and local agencies contend that because technologies such as aci exist epas mact standards for mercury from electric utilities should have been more stringent by imposing standards that would be achieved by the use of aci or some other promising technology for an example see comments from state and territorial air pollution program administratorsassociation of local air pollution control officials docket id oar20020056 june 29 2004 p 3 crs4 the bituminous or subbituminous groups while the other three subcategories have relatively few units the proposed standards would apply on unitbyunit basis for each unit with capacity greater than 25 megawatts electric mw but the proposal allows facilities three forms of flexibility in achieving compliance first emissions can be averaged among all of the units at facility11 large power plant commonly has several units so this provision might allow facilities to comply by installing stringent controls on one or more of their units while leaving other units uncontrolled second compliance will be determined not by whether facility is within the standard continuously but by whether the rolling 12month average of emissions is within the standard this would allow facility to exceed the standard for days or weeks provided that it lowers emissions sufficiently at other times during the 12 months to offset peak emissions the epa states that use of an averaging period is appropriate because mercury emissions from power plants are not an acute health hazard table

used by epa to correlate the inputbased and outputbased standards would be able to burn more coal before reaching the mercury emissions limit 11 facility is defined as contiguous plant site where one or more electric utility steam generating units are located crs5 the proposed standards do not include percentage emission reduction requirement the epa estimates that the standards would result in emissions of 34 tons of mercury from the affected sources 29 reduction as compared to the 1999 emission level of 48 tons12 sampling the mact standard is based on data obtained during an information collection request icr initiated by the epa in april 1998 to gather data on mercury emissions from electric generating units13 the industry was canvassed and those data were used to determine the amount of mercury emitted with respect to the coal burned the collection of comprehensive data is key to understanding the range of possible plant configurations coal compositions and subsequent mercury emissions epa recognized that competing considerations the cost of the data collection effort versus the comprehensiveness of the data obtained were important factors in determining the final number of sites sampled14 the epa decided that due to the factors of cost and effectiveness 3 units would be selected for each combination of mechanical sulfur dioxide control coal type and particulate matter control15 this led to maximum of 135 units considered assuming that at least three units populated each combination16 in practice site existed for several of the combinations data was subsequently obtained from 80 sites and considered to establish the mact floors17 table 2 provides comparison of the number of existing coalfired power plants to the number of plants used to determine the proposed mact standard epa methodology for generating mact levels epa chose to subcategorize the mercuryemissions data by unit type because of the different mercury collection characteristics following combustion different mact floor was determined for each of these categories by examining the mercury emission rates in the case of coalrefusefired lignitefired and igcc units fewer than 30 units exist for these subcategories the mact floor was to be established by the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 5 sources in the case of subbituminousfired and bituminousfired units more than 30 units exist and 12 69 federal register 4661 january 30 2004 13 63 federal register 17406 april 9 1998 14 63 federal register 17408 april 9 1998 15 the epa

statistically treat the data received from the information collection request because the mercuryemission measurements were limited in time often described as snapshot epa determined that it was necessary to project the probable mercury emissions from coal burned at the facility over the course of year coal mercurycontent and heatingvalue data were combined with estimates of control efficiencies based on the observed data of various airpollution control equipment in some cases taking into account the effect of coal chlorine level to estimate the distribution of mercury emitted18 rather than use the directly measured mercury emissions epa chose instead to use the range of coal compositions reported by each plant to estimate an emissions value which would be exceeded more than 25 of the operating time the 975 upper confidence limit the epa considers this value to represent the operation of the unit under conditions reasonably expected to occur at each unit19 table 3 presents the average measured mercury emissions for the facilities included in the mact determination the results of the first statistical treatment and the proposed mact level for each coal subcategory 18 in cases where sufficient correlation was established between the coal chlorine content and the emitted mercury the coal chlorine content was used to predict mercury emissions from coal data in cases where this correlation was insufficient the estimated control efficiencies of the existing airpollution control equipment was used to predict mercury emissions from coal data 19 69

source crs analysis from epa data the average measured mercury emission is for those facilities directly included in the mact determination not for all facilities within the subcategory for bituminous and subbituminousfired units there are more than 30 established units thus the mact floor is established by the best performing 12 of units the epa determined that the sample obtained from the information collection request was representative of existing facilities and therefore the best performing 12 of the sample would suffice to establish the mact floor in both the bituminous and subbituminousfired cases epa took the four units which had the lowest measured mercury emissions and combined the observed collection efficiencies with coalcomposition values reported by those units over the course of year to calculate the expected mercury emission from these estimated emission rates epa determined for each unit the projected mercuryemission level that would not be exceeded more than 25 of the time these four values were averaged and their average was then statistically adjusted to level which would not be exceeded more than 25 of the operating time this second statistical adjustment is intended to reflect the possible variability in operation of different units burning the same fuel type20 this final value was assigned as the mact standard for graphical representation

mercury per trillion btu coal the vertical axis is displayed in relative frequency the number of times projected mercury emission was predicted for given value divided by all predictions for that facility the data has been normalized by crs so as to appropriately weight uneven reporting between facilities the average 975 cutoff is the average of the upper975 confidence limit determined from the calculated distributions for each set of facilities the measurement average refers to the average mercury emissions measured for the facilities included in the mact standard determination not the average mercury emissions measured for all facilities of that subcategory the incorporation of each statistical treatment serves to make the proposed mact standard less stringent similarly for lignitefired units the observed mercury emissions from the five best performing units were adjusted to reflect the coal variability being adjusted to value which would be exceeded more than 25 of the operating time and then averaged this average value was then adjusted so that it would not be exceeded more than 25 of the operating time this final value was assigned as the mact floor for igcc and coalrefusefired units epa had mercuryemissions data from only two units even though the mact floor is to be set from the five best performing units21 the epa used the same method as was used to determine the mact floor for lignitefired units except that they only used the data for the two units 21 while there are only 2 existing igcc units there are 17 existing coalrefusefired units the information collection request only gathered data from 2 coalrefusefired plants crs9 the outcome of the epa efforts to account for variations with fuel composition within the performance of single unit and between different units burning the same types of coal is to significantly increase the mact floor the resulting mact floor is higher than the average of the measured emissions and higher than the emissions average corrected for coal variability in all cases for graphical example of the effect of the statistical treatments on the mact analysis for other mact subcategories see appendix alternate interpretations epa received over 680000 public comments on its 2004 proposed mercury rule including almost 5000 unique comments22 the comments represent another phase in regulatory process that began in earnest with epas 1998 identification of mercury as the hazardous air pollutant emitted by electric utilities that was of the greatest potential concern23 many of these comments build on recommendations provided by forums and stakeholder groups that met before release of the 2004 proposal during the formulation of the proposed mercury rule process epa convened stakeholder forum called the utility mact working group consisting of industry environmental groups and state and local agencies the working group attempted to develop recommendations to assist epa in setting utility mercury

referred to recommendations developed during this process as analyzed and summarized by the northeast states for coordinated air use management nescaum in table 4 the four stakeholder groups developed recommendations considerably different from each other and from epas proposal28 the following observations are among those that can be made unlike epas proposal all the stakeholder groups determined that fluidizedbed combustion fbc units could achieve more stringent mercury mact than other facilities like epas proposal the industry groups used some form of subcategorization generally based on coal type while the environmental group and state and local agencies group did not epas variability analysis resulted in less stringent mact floors than those discussed or recommended by any of the four stakeholder groups the rationale behind these recommendations intersect in interesting ways with the rationale of epas proposals these interactions are evident in the comments various members of

epa is confident the data sample is representative of the industry29 others have raised concerns whether the method used to select both the number of sites sampled and the specific sites included in the dataset provides sample data representative of those units already employed in industry settings for example the national mining association nma states the icr emissions data represent at best limited snap shot of emissions from few units taken over very short period of time with limited number of fuels and cannot account for the wide variability of coals and process conditions encompassed by the full fleet of us utility boilers in addition the units chosen by epa for mercury emissions sampling in the icr program is sic unrepresentative of us coalfueled power plants30 based on an analysis conducted for nma by aems llc consulting firm that found inadequacies and biases in the epa 80 unit sample nma states as result of these inadequacies the icr part iii data cannot be used to identify and evaluate the emissions performance of specific units that would rank in the top 12 percent of their subcategory or among the 5 best on an annual basis31 indeed nma argues that the data and related analysis are so flawed that epa should abandon mactbased form of mercury regulation stating that if epa proceeds nma and its members reserve all potential objections to such standards arising under the data quality act and other applicable provisions of federal law32 the state of missouri department of natural resources contending that the mact standard at least with respect to subbituminous coal is too lenient states the missouri source calculations indicate that the proposed mact emission limitation for existing subbituminous coalfired units is too lenient this leniency was likely caused by sampling error resulting from basing the determinations on sample population too small to be representative of the norm in this case the sample size of 32 units used to determine the floor greatly increased the likelihood of sampling errors33 the epa determined that an appropriate experimental design for the icr was to vary three parameters coal type sulfur dioxide control

combination34 some groups have questioned whether an experimental strategy including more proportionate distribution of facilities or including technologies that are in development but not yet implemented would have provided for more stringent mercury standard for example nescaum asserts that epas attempts to treat variability in the icr data is flawed in part due to the lack of any data from mercury specific controls such as activated carbon injection35 the epa has stated that mercuryspecific control technologies are not yet commercially available for electric generating units and will likely not be commercially available prior to 2010 and therefore consideration of these technologies in determining the mact floor would be incorrect subcategories and mact floor levels primary source of disagreement about epas proposal is the use of subcategories while section 112d provides the epa administrator with the authority to subcategorize mact standards the criteria for determining these subcategories are not defined the epa used combination of coal types bituminous subbituminous lignite and firing configurations igcc boilers to develop subcategories within the utility mercury mact this decision has proven highly controversial both with respect to the subcategories chosen and the mact floor determination for each subcategory environmental groups have attacked the proposed subcategories as without rational basis arbitrary and capricious36 the groups note that many sources including some in epas data sample use blend of different coal types and that combustion technologies vary little with respect to coal type burned in addition these groups state that many boilers have some flexibility to adapt to different coal feedstocks also criticizing the use of subcategories the state of new jersey suggests in its comments that because the proposed standard for subbituminous coal is nearly three times that for bituminous coal utilities may be able to comply with the proposed mact standards by simply switching coal supplies emitting more mercury than before37 that the weaker subbituminous proposal could encourage western subbituminous coal production at the expense of eastern bituminous production has been expressed by eastern coal interests38 34 office of air quality planning and standards standard form 83i supporting statement for omb review of epa

facilities39 by eliminating coal type and epas variability adjustment the environmental groups joint comments developed mact floor of 10 106lbsmwh output basis higher than the environmental stakeholders recommended levels in table 4 but generally more stringent than epas proposal in similar vein nescaum found that if the average observed mercury emissions from the topperforming 12 of epas 80 unit data sample regardless of coal type was used as the emissions standard an emissions reduction of 911 would be achieved in comparison with the predicted 29 reduction in mercury emissions expected under epas proposed mact standard40 most industry groups agreed with epas determination that subcategories were appropriate but disagreed on their specification in particular several commenters argued that north dakota and gulf coast lignite should be regulated separately not combined stating that mercury content of gulf coast lignite was at least double that of north dakota lignite the edison electric institute eei argued that the proposed lignite standard would be unachievable for units using gulf coast lignite41 other concerns were expressed about the absence of any units burning powder river basin subbituminous coal in epa sample data42 variability and mact floor levels major source of disagreement surrounding the proposed mercury rule is epas variability analysis to determine the proposed standard epa used methodology to identify and quantify expected variability in mercury emissions because of the variability of mercury in coal the result is proposed standards that are substantially less stringent than the simple average emissions rate of the top 12 of its 80 unit sample this variability analysis has come under particular scrutiny by all parties environmental groups label the analysis as statistical gimmicks that result in mact floors that represent virtually the worst shortterm emissions from the worst performing of the best units and assumes that these pollution levels will persist through the year43 one of the more detailed analyses of epas methodology has been done by the state of new jersey in white paper by its department of

shortterm peak emissions to set standard that would be based on 12month rolling average44 stating if it were essential to identify and quantify variability in emissions the relevant measure of variability would be what was experienced over 12 months not what was experienced in any single stack testing event transient peak in emissions during the 12month period will not cause noncompliance with the standard because lower emissions during the rest of the period will average out the effect of the peak for that reason using the shortterm worstcase scenario to set an annual standard immediately makes the standard unnecessarily lax if compliance is to be based on longterm average epa should be estimating longterm averages not worst case emissions to determine the mact floor45 new jersey proceeds to argue that epas proposed standards are indeed less stringent as result of their variability analysis eliminating epas variability analysis including subcategorization would reduce the mact floor to 018 lbstbtu alternately if the data were only stratified by coal type the average of the observed mercury emissions would be 012 lbstbtu for bituminous units in contrast with the proposed mact standard of 20 lbstbtu in contrast while industry generally supported epas efforts some industry analysis found that epa insufficiently dealt with the mercury variability issue in arguing for mact floors substantially higher than epas proposal nma asserted that combination of data quality and variability concerns require an increase in mact floor estimates for new sources to 51 lbstbtu for bituminous units and 74 lbstbtu for subbituminous units46 according to analysis by aems llc the epa mact standards for new sources when converted from an output basis to an input basis are equivalent to 063 lbstbtu for bituminous units and 21 lbstbtu for subbituminous units47 as stated by nma when comparing the converted standards developed by aems llc with those standards suggested by nma these estimates of appropriate emission limits for new units are an order of magnitude higher than those estimated by epa reflecting aems more comprehensive 44 department of environmental

the emissions analysis and repeat test variability means that the mact floors for new units must admit the possibility of measured emission levels in excess of the mercury content of the coals

conclusion the proposed regulations to limit mercury emissions from electric generating units have been criticized by wide range of stakeholders based on several criteria including the method used by epa to determine the allowed emissions threshold the proposed emissions threshold incorporates two statistical treatments this serves to make the proposed mact standard less stringent than the average of the actual emission measurements and less stringent than the recommendations of stakeholders including industry and environmental groups prior to the mact proposal while epa justifies these statistical treatments as necessary to account for the variability in input coal and plant operation others assert that they represent significant unnecessary weakness of the proposed regulation whether mercury emissions from electric generating units should be controlled via the proposed regulation in its current form an alternate form or through an alternate mechanism is topic of likely congressional interest 48 nma docket number oar20020056 may 14 2004 p 35 crs17 appendix effects of statistical treatment the effect of each statistical treatment performed by epa serves to make the proposed mact standard less stringent than the average of the measured mercury emissions data the epa found it necessary to statistically treat the data received from the information collection request for several reasons first the mercuryemission measurements were limited in time often described as snapshot and may not represent the actual emissions performance of the facility as consequence epa projected the probable mercury emissions from coal burned at the facility over the course of year the epa developed these projections through one of two methods in the case of some equipment configurations it was determined that correlation between the mercury emissions and the coal chlorinecontent existed in these situations the coal chlorine content was used to predict the mercury emissions in other cases suitable correlation did not exist in these situations the mercury emissions for that facility were determined by using an empirical estimate of the control efficiency for mercury of existing emissionscontrol equipment by obtaining these projected mercury emissions epa was able to determine the expected mercury emissions level over twelvemonth period the epa took the projected mercury emissions developed from the coal compositions reported by each plant and determined the emissions value which would be exceeded more than 25 of the operating time the upper 975 confidence limit49 the epa considers this value to represent the operation of the unit under conditions reasonably expected to occur at each unit the proposed mact standard was then determined from the average of these upper 975 confidence limits once the average of the upper 975 confidence limits was determined second statistical treatment was performed to determine the variation between the units from this variation calculation was made to determine what the upper 975 confidence limit would be for these averaged units50 this value was then set as the mact standard the number of facilities averaged depended on the subcategory considered in the case of bituminous and subbituminousfired facilities 4 facilities were included in the mact standard determination for lignitefired facilities 5 facilities were included for wastecoalfired facilities and integrated gasification combined cycle igcc facilities 2 facilities were included 49 the data at the extremes of the distribution ie the highest and lowest measurements play predominant role in determining the confidence interval therefore the quality of these measurements is crucial since any inaccuracies in this data will be magnified in the calculation of the confidence interval 50 the number of facilities averaged influences the width of this confidence interval the greater the number of facilities averaged together the lower the uncertainty regarding the distribution of these values this lower uncertainty translates to narrower confidence interval crs18 the effects of epas statistical treatment of the
