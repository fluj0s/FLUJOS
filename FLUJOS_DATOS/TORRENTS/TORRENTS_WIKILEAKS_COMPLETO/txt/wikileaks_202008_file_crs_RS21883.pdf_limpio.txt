table 1 indicates in comparison foreign firms had about 5300 affiliates operating in the united states us parent companies employed nearly 22 million workers in the united states compared with the 103 million workers employed abroad by us firms and the 55 million persons employed in the united states by foreign firms although the usbased affiliates of foreig n firms employ fewer workers than do the foreign affiliates of us firms they paid almost as much in aggregate employee compensation in the united states as did the us affiliates operating abroad the foreign affiliates of us parent companies however had third higher value of gross product than did the affiliates of foreign firms operating in the united states in addition the foreign affiliates of us firms had total sales that were third higher than that of the us affiliates of foreign firms the foreign affiliates of us firms however paid three times more in taxes to foreign governments than did the affiliates of foreign firms operating in the united states the overseas affiliates of us parent companies also paid nearly twice as much in taxes relative to their sales as did us parent companies and as did foreignowned

3 2003 p 5060employment major source of contention in the unite d states regarding foreign investment focuses on the impact such investment is having on us employment7 some observers argue that recent actions by us parent companies are different from previous experiences with foreign investment because the parent companies are shifting jobs capital and technology offshore to their foreign affiliates in ways that are distinctly different from previous periods and thereb are reducing employment in the united states the department of commerces bur eau of economic analysis provides the most comprehensive set of data on us direct investment abroad and on foreign direct investment in the united states these data however were not designed to link employment gains or losses in the united st ates either for individual jobs individual companies or in the aggregate with the gains and losses of jobs abroad the data indicate though that the empl oyment trends of us pare nt companies are sensitive to economic conditions in the us economy pa rticularly during peri ods in which economic growth slows down as it did in the early 1980s 1990s and in the early 2000s foreign investment data seem to indicate that despite or perhaps because of the growing international linkages between economie s an expansion or contraction in the rate of growth in the us economy affect s employment among us parent companies more than it affects employment among the overseas affiliates of these parent companies nevertheless changes in jobs among us parent companies that are related to the overall growth rate of the economy also affect the growth in employment among the foreign affiliates though not necessarily by the same magnitude as result the number of employees in the parent companies and in the affiliates tend to rise and fall in generally similar pattern as indicated in figure 2 international linkages between us and foreign economies mean that economic conditions in the united states have an impact on economic conditions abroad there appears to be distinct pattern between the creation or loss of jobs within us multinational companies and commensurate loss or creationsource

york times june 16 2004 p c1of jobs among the foreign affiliates of those companies indeed within most of the major developed countries those economic forces that spur direct investment inflows also boost direct investment outflows as result foreign direct investment may create jobs in the foreign affiliate that substitute for jobs in the parent company but foreign investment may also positively affect job creation in both the parent company and the foreign affiliates which makes it difficult to identify an broad trend regarding outsourcing trade another aspect of foreign direct investment that causes concern is the impact foreign direct investment has on the amount of foreig n trade associated with those investments some observers argue that us direct inves tment abroad supplants us exports jobs and research and development funds thereby re ducing employment and wages in the us economy others are concerned that outward direct investment alters the industrial composition of domestic production and trade fl ows which can affect the sectoral and regional distribution of employment and the relative demand for skilled and unskilled labor8 according to this scenario as firms invest abroad they shift production abroad thereby eliminating jobs in the united states as production shifts abroad jobs are lost in the united states and goods once produced in the united states are now imported from abroad most studies indicate that on balance direct inve stment abroad increases us exports and helps sustain employment and wages at home9 there is little doubt that some firms do indeed replace domestic production with production from abroad which would shift trad patterns but the share of us trade represented by us parent companies and their affiliates during the 1990s did not increase as would be expected instead intrafirm exports and imports fell as share of total us exports and imports during the 1990s from 2000 to 2003 intrafirm trade both exports and imports increased as share of total us exports and imports respectively but since 2003 intrafirm trade in exports and imports fell as share of total us exports and imports some observers are concerned that us pa rent firms have star ted moving service jobs offshore or outsourcing in sectors th at once were thought to be immune to such activities10 as table 13 indicates us foreign aff iliates had 574 billion in services sales in 2005 of this amount 55 consisted of service sale s back to the us parent company the largest share 77 of sales of services were made in the local market this share is substantially higher than the comparable share for sales of goods and services combined and is consistent with the general view that the distinguishing feature of services is that they are consumed where they are produced httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21883crs6 conclusions data published by the bureau of economic analysis offer conclusive evidence that current investment trends are substantially different fro m those of previous periods the data also show that us direct inves tment abroad and foreign direct investment in the united states generally move in the same direction so that those forces which encourage us firms to invest abroad also encourage foreign firms to invest in the united states from the data examined it is not apparent that us parent companies are outsourcing jobs at faster p ace or in manner that is funda mentally different or distinct from previous periods there is an important caveat to these conclusions however the data published by the bea were not developed to address the issue of jobs outsourcing and it is not possible with the bea data to tr ack job losses or gains in specific industries specific companies or specific plants with changes in j obs abroad in addition the bea data lag behind current events by two years which means that assessing these activities may seem to be out of sync with the more limited anecdotal examples that appear in the popular press the data do indicate though that an increas in economic growth in the us parent companies relative to the rate of growth in the foreign affiliates likely increases pressure within the economy to complete structural changes and to shift capital and labor from declining sectors to expanding sectors such changes may also lead to greater number of jobs being outsourced but this effect likely would be muted by the overall strong demand for jobs within the economy and by new foreign investments in the economy on the other hand an economic slowdown among us parent companies relative to the rate of growth among foreign affiliates likely would lead to an overall decline in employment throughout the economy us parent companies ma or may not respond to an economic slowdown by outsourcing jobs abroad because the dominating presence of the us economy in the world economy means that an economic slowdown in the united states likely reduces economic growth abroad as well and that the foreign affiliates of those parent companies may not be positi on to add more jobs the uneven effect of an economic slowdown among us parent companies on their investment behavior abroad likely means that jobs outsourcing ma appear to be more acute during periods in which the longterm structural changes in the economy coincide with the shortterm economic adjustments that arise from slowdown in the rate of growth of the us economy for congress the data on direct investment seem to indicate th at the number of jobs created by us parent companies and by the foreign affiliates of those parent companies is tied closely to the overall performance of the us economy such economic measures as employment trade and investment will rise and fall among us parent companies and their foreign affiliates generally in tandem swings in the rate of growth in the economy that are associated with the business cycle tend to affect us parent companies more than they affect their foreign affiliates and more than those us firms that are purely domestic policies that ameliorate the business cycle pecially the downside of the cycle when the economy is experiencing slow rate of economic growth likely would do the most to help us parent companies furthermor congress may choose to address the economic plight of those workers and communities that experience disproportionate share of the adjustment costs that are associated with the business cycle by providing specialized assistance or other type s of shortterm support
