policy resources science and industry division summary at the direction of congre ss primarily through water resources development acts wrdas the us army corps of engineers an agency within the department of defense undertakes water re sources projects the agen cys civil works mission has expanded beyond its original responsibility of improving and ma intaining navigable channels the mission now includes flood c ontrol emergency and disaster response environmental restoration municipal water in frastructure and other activities the non federal sponsors and the fede ral government primarily th rough the annual energy and water development appropriati ons acts share the cost of most corps projects and activities this report outlines the agencys organization project development process civil works appropriations and volution of its responsibilities corps of engineers and its civil works program the us army corps of engineers corps is an agency in the department of defense that has military nd civilian responsibilities th military program provides engineering construction nd environmental mana gement services for department of defense agencies under its civil works prog ram at the direction of congress the corps plans constructs operates nd maintains wide range of water resources projects military chief of engineers oversees the corps civil and military operations and reports on civil works matters to an assistant secretary of the army for civil works the corps operates as military organiza tion with largely civilian workforce 34600 civilian and 650 military personnel nine di visions coordinate projects in field offices worldwidehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20866crs2 1 division and district maps available at httpwwwusacearmymildivdistmaphtml 2 sections 10 and 13 of the rive rs and harbors act of 1899 22 u sc 407 require that permit be obtained from the corps for alteration or obstruc tion of and refuse discharge in us navigable water the corps also has regulatory responsibilities under other laws notably section 404 of the clean water act 33 usc 1344 since th mid1960s court decisions and administrative actions have altered the jurisdictional reach of the corps regulatory program 3 wrc was established pursuant to the 1965 water resources planning act 42 usc 1962b2 it is currently dormant due to lack of funding 4 technical assistance and some small project s can be conducted without obtaining project specific authorization or appropriations throug h the corps programmatic authorizations known as continuing authorities programs these pr ojects of limited size that have defined scope consistent with one of the programmatic authoriz ation can be performed at the corps discretion based on the availability of program funds the authorized programs include activities for beach continuedand 41 district offices1 projects are largely planned at the district level and approved at the division and headquarters levels the corps oldest civil responsibilities are creating navigabl channels and flood control projects navigation projects include river deepening channel widening lock expansion dam operations and dredged materi disposal flood control projects are intended to reduce riverine and coastal storm damage these projects range from levees and floodwalls to dams and river channelization many navigation and flood control projects are multipurpose that is they provide water supply recreation and hydropower in addition to na vigation or flood control in recent decades congress has given the corps responsibilities in the areas of environmental restoration nd infrastructure and other non traditional activities such as disaster relief and reme diation of formerly used nuclear sites environmental restoration activities involve wetla nds restoration and environmen tal mitigation activities for corps facilities environmental infrastru cture refers to municipal water and wastewater facilities the agencys regulatory responsibility for navi gable waters extends to issuing permits for private actions that might affect wetlands and other waters of the united states2 the economic and environmental impact of corps projects and the agencys regulatory activities can be significant locally and regionally and at times are quite controversial project development process the corps currently follows twophase planning process that is intended to determine if water resources project warrants federal investment and inform congressional authorization d ecisions project developmen t is directed by agency guidance and the principles and guidelines for water and related resources implementation studies pg the pg were prepared by the water resources council wrc in 1983 to guide federal water resource development3 projects generally originate from community eg citizens or businesses or local government entity requesting assistance with water resource need that is beyond its capability to alleviate the corps generally requires two types of congressional authority to initiate study study authorization then appropriations4 study authority allows the corps tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20866crs3 4 continued erosion navigation flood control streambank and shoreline pr otection snagging and clearing modifications to existing projects for the benefit of the environment and ecosystem restoration 5 these acts are commonly distinguished from each other by including reference to the year of enactment for example wrda 1986 refers to the act passed in 1986 6 in addition to authorizing planning nd construction projects congress uses wrda to establish policies for the corps civil works projects such as costsharing requirements 7 local costsharing for the feasibility phase is not required for studies of navigation improvements to the inland waterway system see 33 usc 2215 a2investigate problem and determine if there is federal interest in proceeding further if the corps has performed study in the geographic area before new study can be authorized by resolution known commonly as survey resolution of either the house transportation and infrastructure committ ee or the senate environment and public works committee if the corps has not previously investigated the area the study needs to be authorized in an act of congress typically water resources development act wrda which often are considered biennially5 the majority of corps studies are currently authorized by survey resolutions once authorized appropriations for corps studies are sought through the annual energy and water developmen t appropriations acts the objective of corps studies is to guide the decision to authorize corps project for construction early in the study process the corps assesse s the level of interest and support of nonfederal tities that may be potential sponsors n onfederal sponsors generally ar state tribal county or local agencies eg levee district or govern ments that join the corps in the effort based on the results of the study the chief of engineers may sign final recommendation on the project known as the chie fs report in recent years congress has used favorable chiefs report as the ba sis for authorizing projects once authorized federal funds for project cons truction can be sought throug h the annual energy and water development appropriations bills for more information on the phases of the project development process see crs report rl32064 army corps of engineers water resources activities authorization and appropriations by nicole t carter project costsharing how to allocate the cost of corps projects among nonfederal sponsors and the federal government has been debated for decades wrda 1986 significantly increased local costshare requirements some subs equent wrdas made fu rther adjustments in costsharing6 under current requirements reconna issance studies are entirely federal expense local sponsors pay 50 of the co st for feasibility studies except for inland waterways 100 fe deral responsibility7 the division of fe deral and nonfederal financial responsibilities for c onstruction and operation and maintenance om vary by project purpose as shown in table 1 in mo st cases costsharing for preconstruction planning and engineering is determined using the construc tion requirements in table 1 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20866crs4 8 in addition to the activities that the corps perfo rms using appropriations that it receives through direct federal appropriations the corps performs reimbursable work for department of defense agencies other federal agencies eg u s environmental protection agency local governments tribes us territories foreign governments and international organizations in fy2002 this work totaled 953

from the mid1970s to the mid2000s the annual funding for the corps construction account fell fro m an average of 45 billion to 18 billion in 2004 dollars9 another measure of the decreased emphasis on water resources development is that the agencys civil works budget fell from more than 1 of federal discretionary spending in the mid1970s to between 06 and 05 since 200010 funding for the civil works program has of ten been contentious issue between the administration and congress w ith final appropriations typi cally providing more funding than requested regardless of which political party controls the white house and congress the corps generally maintains strong congre ssional support because of the direct water resource benefits and indirect economic and political benefits of its projects evolution of civil works mission navigation and flood control 18021950s in the 19th century the corps mission evolved into civil and military build ing for the nation in 1824 congress passed legislation using military engineers for pla nning roads and canals to move goods and people in 1850 congress directed the corps to engage in its first planning exercise flood control for the lower mississippi river the modern era of federal flood control emerged with the flood control act of 1936 pl 74738 which declared flood control as proper federal activ ity and in the national intere st during the 1920s congress expanded the corps ability to incorporate hydropower into multipurpose projects and authorized the agency to undertake compre hensive surveys to establish riverbasin development plans the 1944 flood control ac t 33 usc 708 significantly augmented the corps involvement in large multipurpos projects the flood control act of 1950 33 usc 701n began the corps emergenc operations through authorization for flood preparedness and emergency operations11 the water supply act of 1958 43 usc 390b gave the corps authority to include storage for municipal and industrial water supply in reservoir proj ects at 100 local cost changing priori ties 1960 1986 by the late 1960s cons truction of major water works had declined changing national priorities and local needs increasing construction costs and completed projects at most prime locations decreased the attractiveness of water projects water supply for trad itional offstream uses such as domestic commercial industrial and ag ricultural uses was increasingly in direct competition with instream uses such as recreation fisherie s and wildlife habitat from 1970 to 1985 congress authorized major water projects scaled back several authorized projects and passed laws that altered proj ect operations and water deliver programs to protect the environment the 1970s marked transforma tion in corps project planning the1969 national environmental policy act and the endangered sp ecies act of 1973 16 uschttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20866crs6 1531 re quired the corps to consider environmental impacts increase public participation in planning and consult with other federal agencies executive orders eo 11988 and eo 11990 united the goals of reducing flood losses and environm ental damage by recognizing the value of wetlands and require d federal agencies to evaluate potential effects of actions on flood plains and to minimize impacts on wetlands environmental mission and local responsibility 1986present congress fundamentally transformed the ground rules fo r corps water project planning and funding through wrda 1986 33 usc 2211 by establishing new costshare formulas resulting in greater financial and decisionmaking roles for local stakeholders wrda 1986 reestablished the tradition of biennial omnibus authorization bill congress has since enacted wrdas in 1988 1990 1992 1996 1999 and 2000 wrda 1986 also provided the corps with authority to determine if changes can be made in existing structures or operations to imp rove environmental quality wrda 1990 33 usc 1252 2316 explicitly expanded the co rps mission to include environmental protection and increased the corps res ponsibility for contamination cleanup dredged material disposal and zardous waste ma nagement wrda 1992 33 usc 2326 authorized the corps to use the spoils from dredging in implementing projects for protecting restoring and creating aquatic and ecologicallyrelated habitats including wetlands wrda 1996 33 usc 2330 gave the corps the authority to undertake aquatic ecosystem restoration projects while the corps has been involved with numerous environmental restoration pr ojects in recent years wrda 2000 approved restoration program for the florida everglades that represented the agencys first multiyear multi billion dollar effort of this type these legislative changes have given the corps environmental responsibility bey ond its trad itional water resources development projects
