from valmi dufour to hc volunteers checkers date wed 23 nov 2005 231758 0200 topic the website reference problem hello all i noticed today that we have little problem it seems that some checkers misunderstood decision that was only supposed to affect the forum and started to approve messages referring to cs the problem is that some seem to be relunctant to start freezing those again so im sorry for bringing this painful discussion up again but i thought this politicy needed clarifications first of all i would like to remind you that spam checking and forum moderation is very different we have always been much more liberal in the forum allowing such things as visa invitation requests and blatant website promotion in fact if you ever looked at the messages sent to spammers they usually send them to the forum to spread their spam this is because forum messages are not intrusive they are not sent directly to members email unless they requested it and nobody is obligated to read them now with private messages we are much more careful and we dont allow any kind of website promotion even if it appears in an otherwise totally valid hcrelated message website giving more information about the member etc is as far as well allow but why some ask would you host and oh you can see my profile on cs too would be considered as website promotion well two things here 1 maybe the user chose not to fill his hc profile and to use his cs profile as kind of personnal page to give more information about him some do this because they like css cute website design andor liberality but do realise that cs just doesnt work nearly as well as hc when it comes to the actual hospitality exchange well i think this is pure abuse of our service we volunteers you and i and others invest lots of our time in making hc succesful and usable those members are using what we worked hard to build and giving nothing to hc in return they wont make hc better place they wont even write comments to make it safer place i think we all agree that this is unacceptable 2 maybe the user filled both his profiles in hc and cs just as well but in that case the link to his cs profile does obviously not qualify under our definition of personal website giving more information about the person so if the person is not giving the link to provide more information about herself what is she giving it for that cs link is then totally useless unless its seen as website promotion which it clearly qualifies at under our guidelines personal website more info on member anything else promotion and thereby violates our rules do not send messages to another member that are not related to the aim of the hospitality club those are especially but not exclusively requests for help finding work appartments and visa invitations website promotions and dating spam website and business promotions messages that are sent to promote other websites or business opportunities please note that the mere mentioning is promotion suitable place for this might be the forum category links links links reminder promoting cs even above mere mentionning is now allowed in the forum i think this clarifies it for you that mentionning cs is indeed against our rules and that youll feel better about having to freeze those messages you may wonder why we make such big deal with cs and other such networks well here is quick explanation we volunteers that have been involved since years in hc believe that it would be much more beneficial for everybody and for the whole idea of free hospitality exchange if there was only one centralised site why three reasons mainly the time that members lose by filling their profiles on different networks and having to visit each website b the spreading of volunteer resources experienced because each website has its team of programmer working on the database its team of translator etc whereas those could all work together to get one big website that would hence be much better than any one small website c the possibility that abusers get to change to different network once they got many bad comments in another one and continue their actions there with blank new reputation the founder of cs and all the other networks as matter of fact doesnt recognise any of these criterions as he never tried to contact us before or after creating his website he is obviously better web designer than we were at the beginning and has many interesting ideas and we invited him to join us share his ideas and implement them in one large unique more efficient hospitality exchange network we offered him that repeatedly ever since he started his website but obviously he never agreed hopefully those explanations will prove useful to the new team members that were not with us yet when all those events and discussions took place and if you still feel any incomfort in freezing messages containing website promotion i urge you to answer my message and we can further discuss why those rules were made and have to remain cheers valmi
