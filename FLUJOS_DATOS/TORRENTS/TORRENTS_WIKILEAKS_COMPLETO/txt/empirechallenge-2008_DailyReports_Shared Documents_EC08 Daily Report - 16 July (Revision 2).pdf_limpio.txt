significant issues continue to work through compatibility issues with the different dib versions spread amongst the ddte nodes some system baseline changes are required in order to overcome some of the compatibility problems however this places the site ddte accreditation at risk working to identify window of opportunity to take down the ddte connection in order to apply the changes and run the

ie 513th and dcgsa at echo and data sharing between the ddte nodes and cfe will occur dib v13b2 patch install and testing has star ted and it has been successful with the nodes that have implemented the patch imagery products products collected several of the dcgsa nodes have been able to federate with other nodes and if those nodes have any products available dcgsa has been able to download the product summary success the number of nodes that dcgsa v30 and v31 c an federate with has increased for two reasons ddte is starting to stabilize and the external nodes are starting to implement the recommended patch where help is needed cross domain guard solution is an overall ec08 problem and if not resolved quickly it will prohibit anyone on ddte from passing data to the coalition network and vice versa the dcgsa nodes at echo range and the 513th which reside on the coalition network and without cross domain guard will not be able to pass data back and forth to ddte additional comments
