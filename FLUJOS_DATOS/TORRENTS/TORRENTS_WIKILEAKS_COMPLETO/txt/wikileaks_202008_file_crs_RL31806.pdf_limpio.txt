is integrally related to the reform and improvement of tr ust management historically the bia has been responsi ble for managing indian tribes and individuals trust funds and tr ust assets trust assets include trust lands and the lands surface and subsurface economic res ources eg timber grazing lands or minerals and cover about 45 million acres of tribal trust land and 10 million acres of individual indian trust land trust assets management includes real estate services processing of transactions eg sales and leases surveys appraisals probate functions land title records activities and other functions the bia had however historically mismanaged indian trust funds and tr ust assets especially in the areas of accounting and retention of records this led to trust reform act in 1994 and an extensive court case in 1996 see office of special trustee section below the 1994 act created the ost assigning it responsibility for oversight of trust management reform trust fund management was transf erred to the ost from the bia in 1996 but the bia still manages trust assets unsuccessful efforts at trust manage ment reform in the 1990s led doi to contract with management consultant firm the firm s recommendations included both improvements in trust management and reorganization of the doi agencies carrying out trust management and improve ment events in the court case helped push doi to act on these recommendations the current reorganization of bia as ia and ost chiefly involves trust management structures and functions under the plan the bias trust operations at regional and

with tribes through much of 2002 they did not reach agreement before doi announced the reor ganization tribes argue that the reorganization is premature because new tr ust procedures and po licies are still being developed and that it insuffici ently defines new ost duties congress has thus far supported the biaost reorganization the house appropriations committees report for fy2004 urged doi to implement the reorganization as quickly as possible and the senate defeated proposed amendment to stop biaost reorganization by transferring 793 million from ost to the indian health service the senate di d add provision to the fy2004 appropriations bill excluding from reorganization certain tribes that have been operating trust management reform pilot projects with their regional bia offices the fy2004 law retained this senate provision bia school system the bia funds 185 elementary and secondary schools and peripheral dormitories with over 2000 structures educating about 48000 students in 23 states tribes and trib organizations under selfdetermination contracts and other grants operate 120 of these institu tions the bia operates the remainder biafunded schools key pr oblems are low student achievement and especially high level of inadequate school facilities some observers feel tribal opera tion of schools w ill improve student achievement the bush administration ggested language in the fy2003 interior appropriations bill encouraging priva tization but the appropriations committees disagreed and urged additiona l funding and consultation with tribes in the fy2004 bill the house and senate approved provision creating 3 million fund to pay tribal school boards startup administrative costs to enc ourage tribal boards to take over operation of current biaoperated schools the fy2004 law retained this provision many bia school facilities are old and dilapidated with health and safety deficiencies bia education constructi on covers both construction of new school

gaming commission nigc was established by the indian gaming regulatory act igra of 1988 pl 100497 as amended to oversee i ndian tribal regulation of tribal bingo and other class ii operations as well as aspects of class iii gaming eg casinos and racing the chief issue for nigc is whether its funding is adequate for its regulatory responsibilities the nigc is authorized to receive annual appropriations of 2 million but its budget authority consists chiefly of annua l fees assessed on tr ibes class ii and iii operations igra currently caps nigc fees at 8 million per year the nigc in recent years has requested additional funding because it has experienced increased demand for its oversight resources especi ally audits and fi eld investigations congress in the fy2003 appropriations act increased the nigcs fee ceiling to 12 million but only for fy2004 in the fy2004 budget the administration proposed language amending igra to create an adjustable formulabased ceiling for fees instead of the current fixed ceiling the administration argued that formulabased fee ceiling would allow nigc funding to gr ow as the indian gaming industry grew gaming tribes did not support the increased fee ceiling or the proposed amendment of igras fee ceiling arguing that nigcs budget should first be reviewed in the context of extensive tribal and state expe nditures on regulation of indian gaming and that changes in nigcs fees should be developed in consultation with tribes the fy2004 act did not include the administra tions proposed language but did extend the temporary 12million fee ceiling through fy2005 during fy1999fy2003 all nigc activitie s were funded from fees with direct appropriations for fy2004 the ad ministration house senate and enacted bill provided

reorganization both ost and bia have recently begun reorganization see bureau of indian affairs section bove one aspect of which is the creation of ost field operations ost will have fi duciary trust officers and administrators at the level of bia agency and regional offices many indian tribes disagree with parts of the reorganization nd have asked congress to put it on hold so that ost and bia can conduct further consultati on with the tribes about 151 million of the proposed fy2004 increase was to fund the new field operations the house senate and enacted bill approved the proposed amount for reorganization the house appropriations committee report encouraged the interior department to implement the reorganization the senate did not explicitly endorse or oppose the ostbia reorganization but defeated proposed amendment to stop reorganization by transferring 793 million from ost to the indian health service historical accounting the historical accounting seeks to assign correct balances to all tribal and iim accounts pecially because of litigation because of the long historical period to be c overed some accounts may date from the 19th century the large number of iim accounts and the large number of missing account documents an historical accounting based on actual account trans actions is expected to require large and timecons uming projects the interi or department has proposed an extensive fiveyear 335million project to reconcile iim accounts most of the appropriations increase that the adminis tration proposed for the ost for fy2004 was for historical accounting which would have gone from 175 million in fy2003 to 130 million in fy2004 of this 1125 million increase for historical accounting 825 million would have been for iim acc ounts and 30 million for tribal accounts the house and senate reduced total hi storical accounting funds to 75 million or 55 million less than the administration proposal the conference report as enacted reduced historical accounting funds even further to 444 million to be used only for necessary shortterm historical accounting activities this reduction was in tandem with controvers ial provision discussed under litigation below litigation an iim trust funds classaction lawsuit cobell v norton was filed in 1996 in the federal district court for the district of columbia against thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31806crs32 4 cobell v norton civil 961285 ddc update d information is available on the websites of the plaintiffs httpwwwindiantrustcom the doi httpwwwdoigovindiantrust and the justice department httpwwwusdojgovcivilcasescobellindexhtmfederal government by iim account holders4 many ost activities are related to the cobell case including litigationsupport activities but the most significant issue for appropriations concerns the method by which the historical accounting will be conducted to estimate iim acc ounts proper balances the dois proposed method was estimated by the depar tment to cost 335 million ove r five years and produce relatively low total owed to iim accounts the plaintiffs method whose procedural cost is uncertain was estimated to pr oduce figure of 176 billion owed to iim accounts in 2003 the court conducted lengthy trial to decide which historical accounting method to use in timating the iim accounts proper balances previously in the first phase of the cobell case in 1999 the court had found that doi and the treasury department had breached trust duties regarding the necessary document retention and data gathering needed for an accounting and regarding the business systems and staffing to fix trust management the lawsuits final phase will determine the amount of money owed to the plaintiffs based on the historical accounting method chosen congress has for several years been c oncerned about the current and potential costs of the cobell lawsuit although it has defeated appropriations lang uage directing settlement of the case the appropriations committees have expressed concern that the iim lawsuit was jeopardizing doi trust reform implementation and have required reports from doi on the costs and benef its of historical accounting methods including statistical sampling congress also in the fy2003 interior appropriations act required summary for congress of full historical accounting performed for five of the plaintiffs capped the compen sation of two courtappointed officials monitoring trust reform and authorized the interior secretary to help employees pay for legal costs related to the iim suit the summary of the historical accounting for the five plaintiffs which was based on methodology closer to that pr oposed by doi was transmitted to congress in 2003 according to the house committee it indicated very low error rate in the accounts transactions in its initial re duction of the amount for fy2004 historical accounting the senate appr opriations committee noted that the funding should be adequate for statistical sampling model part of dois proposed methodology and that the reduction was not an endorsement of the plain tiffs accounting model for fy2004 congress retained the provisions cappi ng the court officials compensation and assisting federal employees in paying legal bills related to the iim litigation the courts decision on historical acc ounting was delivered on september 25 2003 the court rejected both the plai ntiffs and dois proposed historical accounting plans and instead ordered doi to account for all tr ust fund and asset transactions since 1887 without using statis tical sampling the interior department estimated that the courts choice for hist orical accounting would cost 612 billionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31806crs33 the fy2004 interior appropriations confer ence report added controversial new provision aimed at the cour ts september 25 decision the provision directed that statute or trust law principle should be construed to require the interior department to conduct the historical acc ounting until either congress has delineated the departments specific historical accounting obligations or december 31 2004 whichever is earlier the conferees asserted in the conference committee report that the courtordered historical accounting is too expensive beyond the intent of the 1994 act and likely to be app ealed and that congress needs time to resolve the historical accounting question or settle the suit opponents in the house and senate argued that the provision is of doubtful constitutionality since it directs courts interpretation of law and effectively suspe nds court order in an ongoing case and further is unjust to the plaintiffs and might undermine the in terior departments incentives to negotiate settlement the fy2004 conference report with this provision passed both the senate and narrowly the house and was enacted on november 10 2003 based on this provision the doi on the same day appealed the courts

additional 292 million for fy2004 fell on point of order that it violated provisions of the budget act senator daschle used recently published study to support claim that add itional funding was needed to combat unmet health needs and to show that the us government in 2003 spent 1914 per capita on medical care for american indian and alaska natives while spending 3803 approximately twice as much on dical care for federal prisoners7 second the senate also rejected an ame ndment that sought to strike funding for the reorganization plan for the bia and ost and transfer the funds to the ihs however the senate agreed to third am endment that sought to ensure that ihs funds are not redirected to prog rams and projects that have not been fully justified in the administrations budget request

ecommended 135 million decrease of 865000 or 6 the fy2004 law provided 134 million relocation began in 1977 and is not ye t complete onhir has backlog of relocatees who are approved for replacement homes but have not yet received them most families subject to relocation are navajo an estimate d 3477 navajo families resided on land partitioned to the hopi while 27 hopi families were on navajo partitioned land while larg majority of the navajo families have been relocated to replacement homes the house appr opriations committee estimated in 2003 that 190 navajo families still ve yet to complete relocati on most of these remaining navajo families are not currently living on hopi partitioned land but majority have not begun the process of acquiring replacem ent housing all but one of the 27 hopi families had completed re location by the end of fy2002 according to onhir onhir estimated in its strategic plan that it would complete relo cation moves by the end of fy2006 and postmove assistance by the end of fy2008 but the schedule depended on infrastructure needs and relocatees decisions congressional committees have in the past expressed impatience with the speed of relocation but at present have not criticized the current pace many navajo families have resisted relocation for years while the hopi tribe has insisted on their relocation about 16 of the 190 remainin g navajo families are still on hopi partitioned land according to the house committee and some of them refuse to relocate in 1996 congress approved accommodation agreements with 75year leases for navajo families who wished to remain on hopi partitioned land pl 104301 as means of compromise between the navajo families and the hopi tribe most navajo families then on hopi partitioned land signed the agreements but resistant navajo families remain longstanding proviso in onhir appropr iations language retained in the fy2004 act prohibits onhir from evicting any navajo family from hopi partitioned lands unless replacement home we re provided this language appears to prevent onhir from forcibly relocatin g navajo families in the near future because of onhirs backlog of approve d relocatees awaiting replacement homeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31806crs50 as the backlog is reduced however forced eviction may become an issue if any navajo families refuse relocation and if the hopi tribe were to exercise right under pl 104301 to begin legal action against th united states for failure to give the hopi quiet possession of all hopi partitioned lands smithsonian institution the smithsonian

federal ro and responsibility some opponents of federal arts funding argue that nea and neh should be abolished altogether other opponents argue that culture can and does flourish on its own through private support proponents of fede ral support for arts and humanities contend that the federal government has long tradition of support for culture and that abolishing nea and neh could curtail or

lwcf to fund some related activities that do not involve land acquisition appropriations for federal acquisitions generally are earmarked to specific management units such as national wildlife refuge while the state gr ant program rarely is earmarked funds may not be spent without an appropriation the lwcf is authorized at 900 million annually through fy2015 through fy2004 the total amount that potentially could have been appropriated from the lwcf since its inception was 272 billion actual appropriations have been 136 billion in recent years til fy2003 appropriators provided generally increasing amounts from the fund for federa l land acquisition and the state grant program the total had more than qua drupled rising from low of 138 million in fy1996 to 573 million in fy2002 howeve

fy2003 and again in fy2004 were last seen in the early and mid 1990s as part of efforts to address the federal budget deficit this time the federal budget deficit is becoming important and other priorities have become more pressing in the wake of th many components of the war on terrorism the lower fy2003 and fy 2004 appropriation re quests of 532 million and 348 m illion respectively for land acquisition contrasted with the bush administration request for full funding for fy2002 in th fy2003 legi slative process the decline continued chronologi cally with each step the house approved less funding 528 million than the admin istration requested then the senate approved less funding 464 million than the house and the conference committee agreed to total of 410 million which was 118 million less than the housepassed total and 54 million less than the senatepassed total the fy2004 appropriation did not follow this progression although th end result is large reduction from the preceding year not only did the total decline in fy2003 and again in fy2004 but each of the five component accounts also declined in fy2004 the administration requested the largest amount in the

congress has ppropriated funds for other programs as identified in the note following table 18 above for fy2004 the president sought to fund specific programs using the lwcf including forest services

million cooperative endangered species grants 866 million and north american wetlands conservation fund grants 496 million both the full house and senate agreed with this approach for fy2004 for funding other programs but provided ss total funding and funding for fewer programs from the lwcf the house provided total of 260 million and the senate provided 175 milli on while the fy2004 law

691 million for state and tribal wildlife grants and 642 million for state and private forestry programs as well as small amounts to two other programs for fy2004 the administration again sought funding for the cooperative conservation initiative to promote conservation through partnerships that match blm nps and fws funds with local contributions in fy2003 the bush administration had first proposed this in itiative and sought 100 million half this total was to come from the state grant program portion of the lwcf and the remainder would have come from the operating accounts of the three doi land management agencies congress appropriated 149 million to this in itiative for fy2003 in contrast to the fy2003 re quest the entire fy 2004 request of 1132 million was to come from the lwcf neither the house nor senate bills for fy2004 funded this initiative and funds were included in the fy2004 law conservation spending category congress created the conservation spending category csc as an amendment to the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 in the fy2001 interior appropriations law the csc which is so being called the conservation trust fund by some combines funding for more than 2 dozen resource protection programs including the lwcf it also includes some coastal and marine programs funded through commerce appr opriations this action was in response to both the clinton administration request for substan tial funding increases in these programs under its lands legacy initiative and congressional interest in increasing conservation funding through legisl ation known as the conservation and reinvestment act cara whic h passed the house in the 106th congress the csc law authorized that total spending under the category would grow each year by 160 million from 16 billion in fy2001 of which 12 billion would be through the interior appropr iations laws and the remainder through the commerce appropriations laws to 24 billion in fy2006 all funding each year is subject to the appropriations process how prog rams are categorized matters the administration and the appropriations committees disagree on whether all or portions of funding for some programs such as the cooperative conservation initiative should be credited to the csc the appropriations history through fy2004 is as followshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31806crs57 the fy2001 laws exceeded the target of 16 billion by appropriating total of 168 b illion 120 billion for interior appropriations programs and 048 billion for commerce appropriations programs provide d in title ix of pl 106522 totals for interior and commerce funding were both increases from the preceding year of 566 and 160 million respectively the fy2002 request totaled 154 billi on for this group of programs and congress appropriated 175 billi on thus almost reaching the target of 176 billion the appropr iation for the interior portion was 132 billion reaching the authorized target amount the fy2003 request totaled 167 billi on for this group of programs decrease from fy2002 funding and below the target of 192 billion congress appropriated total of 151 billion for the interior portion congress provi ded 103 billion less than the authorized target of 144 billion the administrations fy2004 request totaled 133 billion according to estimates compiled by interior and commerce appropriations subcommittee staffs this amount was below the target of 208 b illion for the interior portion the request was 100 billion and the target was 156 billion the administration had an alternative estimate that increased the total fy2004 request to 122 billion for interior programs but it was based on some different assumptions about which programs to include for fy2004 none of the bills or accompanying committee reports identified funding levels for the csc with one exception the house appropriations committee report included additional views by representatives obey and dicks in which they inserted table to documen t by program the difference between the 156 billion target and their estimate of th total funding for csc programs of 991 million during floor consideration repres entative obey offered an amendment to fund this difference by rescinding 321 of the tax cut for taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes in excess of 1 million th amendment was rejected on point of order raised by

known agencies are to sub mit some of their jobs to competition with the private sector the plan has been controversial with concerns as to whether it would save the government money and whether the
