provisions that would increase competition for head start grants by limiting the period for which grantee may receive grant funds to five years before recompetiti on may be required other similarities include increasing the percentage of the appropriation to be reserved for early head start emphasizing coordination and colla boration with other state and local early childhood programs in creasing

appropriations pro cess after unsuccessful efforts by the 108th and 109th congresses to complete the reauthorization process the 110th congress has undertaken the task1 the house and senate have each passed its own version of reauthorization bill the sena version adopting the house bills number hr 1429 and representing only slightly modified version of the bill reported by the senate health education labor and pensions committee s 556 on november 9 2007 house and nate conferees filed conference report hrept 110439 this report does not yet reflect th provisions contained in that agreement

eting proposed target percentages for indian and migrant head start programs could restrict funding for other head start programs and activities is not entirely clearoverview of provisions both reauthorization bills propose to amend head start with the purpose of improving the programs ability to promot lowincome childrens school readiness by supporting their cognitive social emo tional and physical development the means for doing so encompass wide ra nge of provisions covering issues of program funding administr ation eligibility accountability quality governance and coordination below is an overview of broad areas addressed in the proposed legislation followed by table 1 detailed sidebyside comparison of each bills provisions with current law and where re levant current regulations the areas listed below are not intended to encompass every provision included in each of the respective bills but rather major areas addressed the table does not reflect the provisions agreed to in conference funding despite the expiration of authorizing language the head start program has continued to receive its funding throug h the annual appropria tions process most recently fy2007 at vel of almost 69 billion from fy1995fy2003 the head start act authorized funding head start at an unspecified dollar amount such sums as may be necessary the reauthor ization bills propose to increase funding for head start with both bills designa ting dollar amount 7350 billion for fy2008 after fy2008 the house version of hr 1429 would authorize such sums as may be necessary for each of the remaining four years covered by the legislation whereas the senate version includes specific in creases for fy2009 and fy2010 before once again mirroring the house bill with unspecified amounts for fy2011 and fy2012 both bills propose changes with respect to the allocation of appropriated funds within the 13 currently reserved from the total appropriation for variety of purposes both bills introduce greater level of specificity assigning designated percentages of the total appropriation for allotments to indian and migrant head start programs in the case of both bills the percentages proposed reflect increases above the portion currently recei ved and not set in statute2 the allocation formula for determining state allotments is changed in both bills to update the hold harmless or base amounts assured fo r the states appropriated funds available to states after llotting the hold harmless amounts would be distributed differently by the two bills the house bill would continue to allot remaining funds based on st ates relative shares of poor children under age 5 while the senate bill introduces new provision in which portion of the remaining funds would be allocated based on the percentage of eligible children served by grantees within the state program quality is also ddressed by the funding llocation provisions the proposed legislation would ma intain current laws practi ce of reserving designatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33968crs3 percentage of the aforementioned remai nder funds for quality improvement with both bills pr oposing greater percentages for th is purpose than under current law both bills elaborate on the uses of quality impr ovement funds both bills would increase the percentage of the total appropriation reserved for funding early head start programs with caveat that these percentages may only be reached provided appropriation levels suffice to compare the specifics of these and other fundingrelated provisions see the portions of table 1 that refer to sections 639 and 640 of current law accountability provisions designed to address issues of accountability take veral forms both bills target accountability with respect to fiscal and program ma nagement as well as accountability with respect to head start ch ildrens outcomes under both the house bill and senate bill agencies would be designated as grantee for more than five years at time after which recompetition may be required under current law grantees do not have to recompete for funds only the house version would establish an application review system to be used during this process however both bills establish means for determining what constitutes highperforming grantee and those agencies not mee ting the standard would be faced with recompetition in order to be considered high perfor ming grantee under either bill head start agencies would need to demonstrate compet ent financial management as well as the ability to deliver program high in quality developmentally appropriate and based on scientificallybased research and measures both bills add new language to current law requiring programs govern ing bodies to include individuals with expertise in fiscal matters both b ills would introduce detailed definitions of deficiency into statute along with provi sions to help ensure that funding for any grantees or delegates unable or unwilling to correct deficiencies be suspended or terminated as necessary as reflected in table 1 particul arly within sec 641a the two proposals often expand on cu rrent regulations with resp ect to corrective actions both bills emphasize the use of scien tificallybased early childhood research as basis for formulating educational measures for children and veloping appropriate curricula that will lead to positive outcomes likewise both would suspend use of the national reporting system nrs in its current form pending further review and recommendations from national academy of sciences panel the importance of effective and reliable screening and assessmen ts in the head start program is stressed by both bills accompanied by an emphasis on the value of ensuring that the tools used for screening and asse ssment be scientifically s ound based on the most upto date research in the field program governance current law emphasizes shared governan ce and parent involvement within head start programs in general rms leaving the details to regulation both versions of hr 1429 would introduce into statute more detailed provisions regarding program governance clearly outlining the com position and responsibilities of both thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33968crs4 governing bodies and the policy councils the reports accompanying the legislation emphasize the committees intent that commitment be made to maintaining the structure of shared govern ance between governing bodies and policy councils with clear language that the governing bodies hold legal and fiscal accountability the responsibilities of policy councils are stat ed in both bills but using different language both bills are more specific than current regulations as in current regulations both bills make reference to the need for an impasse policy or means for dealing with internal disputes in the event that governing body disagrees with recommendations from the policy council as noted in table 1 within the two bills the provisions related to program governance do not amend the same section of current law section 8 of the house version of hr 1429 includes the provisi ons stating the required composition role and responsibilities of the governing bodies and councils as part of amendments to sec 642 whereas the senate bill include s its program governance requirements including composition roles and respons ibilities in section 7 the portion of the bill that amends sec 641 of current law quality provisions that aim to improve the quality of head start programs through variety of means permeate both reauthorization bills some of these provisions already alluded to relate to allocation of funds for qua lity and technical assistance and training designating agencies and developing standards and measures in addition both proposed bills would amend sec 648a of current law to increase staff qualifications for head start teachers but with different requirements accompanying report language makes clear both committees view that teacher quality is essential to ear ly childhood program quality professional velopment is promoted in both bills as are efforts to enhance services for children with limited english proficiency included in the senate bill is newly pr oposed section 641b to the head start act which would provide for the blishment of program under which the secretary of health and human serv ices hhs would designate up to 200 exemplary head start agen cies as centers of excellence in early childhood these agencies would receive pending appropriation of funds bonus grants of at least 200000 per year like regularly designated grantees the centers of excellence bonus grants would be design ated for up to five years at time coordination in addition to provisions aimed at improving the quality and accountability of head start programs both bills would amend current law to foster even greater program coordination between head st art and other early childhood programs including state prekindergartens prog ram coordination incl udes providing for alignment of head start goals and expect ations with those schools into which head start children will later enroll coordination is also to be enhanced by bolstering state and local relationships with head start the house version of hr 1429 proposes new section 642b specifically outlin ing the partnerships that head starthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33968crs5 agencies are to enter into with local education agencies including description of the memorandum of understanding that each head start agency would negotiate with the local entities under both bills collaboration grants are described in greater detail and the states role in collaboration is bol stered through involvement of an early learning council under the house bill or state advisory council under the senate bill eligibility under current law all children from families with income under 100 of the poverty line are eligible for head start regulations state that at least 90 of children enrolled in each program must fit th is criterion allowing for 10 to be over income both bills would allow for ex pansion of eligibility up to 130 of the poverty line with the house version of hr 1429 specifying that more than 20 of children served by head start progra m be above the poverty line in the case of both bills the intent is that programs seek to serve children under 100 of poverty before serving those from families with higher incomes homeless children would also be deemed categorically eligible unde r both bills both bills address the issue of how to confront situations of unde renrollment in head start programs recognizing that the cause of these situations may differ from program to program sometimes reflecting program weakness while in other cases demographic changes in the community another provision reflecting both committees desire for greater flexibility with respect to participation and serving the needs of communities is one that allows for regular funds to be used for serving early head start infants and toddlers doing so requires approval of written application under both bills but the possibility for this expansion of services would be written into law detailed comparison of provisions included in head start reauthorization bills with current law table 1 provides detailed comparison of the house and senatepassed versions of hr 1429 and current law where applicable current regulations are included to show whether changes proposed in the reauthorization bills would reflect practical changes to the program as stated earlier the table does not include provisions agreed to in the conference report hrept 110439 filed on november 9 2007 the table is structured in the order of current laws sections in cases where bills address the same or similar provisions by amending different sections of current law that has been noted in the table the table also notes if
