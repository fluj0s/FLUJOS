could be directed at election facilities or voters in the states just prior to or during the elections in presidential election year attention has been directed at the possibilityauthority to postpone cancel or reschedul an election for federal office the united states constitution does not provide in express language any current authority for federal official or institution to postpone an election for federal office while the constitution does expressly devolve upon the states the primary authority to administer within their respective jurisdictions elections for federal office there remains within the constitution residual and superceding authority in the congress over most aspects of congressional elections article i section 5 clause 1 and an express authority in congress over at least the timing of the selections of presidential electors in the states article ii section 1 clause 4 under this authority congress has legislated uniform date for presidential electors to be chosen in the states and uniform date for congressional elections across the country which are to be on the tuesday immediately following the first m onday in november in the particular applicable evennumbered election years in addition to the absence of an express constitutional direction there is also federal law which currently provides express au thority to postpone an election although the potential operati on of federal statutes re garding vacancies and the consequences of states failure to select on the prescribed election day see 2 usc 8 and 3 usc 2 might allow the states to hold subsequent elections in exigent circumstances it would appear that under congress express cons titutional authority over the timing of federal elections it could enact federal law setting conditions times and dates for rescheduling of elections to federal offices in the states in emergency or other exigent ci rcumstances and with the proper standards and guidelines could delegate the executi on and application of those provisions to executive branch or state officials in addition to general contest protest and challenge statutes whereby the results of elections to federal office are initially adjudicated in the states handful of states have provided in state law express authority to post pone or reschedule elections within their jurisdictions based on certain emergency contingencies the states authority within the united states constitution appears to be sufficient to enact legislation to deal with emergency and exigent circumstances concerning federal elections as long as such laws do not conflict with fede ral law enacted under congress superceding constitutional authority federal courts have thus generally interpreted federal law to permit the states to reschedule elections to congressional office when exigent circum stances have necessitated postponement there may however be different issues raised in the case of the election of presidential electors as the federal statute

presidential electors the constitution expressly gives to the congress the task of counting the electoral votes for president6 implicit within this explicit authority to count the electoral votes has been the practical necessity to determine which elect oral votes to count while congress has established procedures and rules for c ounting the electoral votes and resolving disputed lists of

the appropria evennumbered years it was not until 1845 that uniform date for electing presidential electors in the states was mandated by congress10 before then the timing for selecting presidential electors could and did vary from state to state congress in 1844 and 1845 was however concerned about the allegations of fraud and corruption in the previous election 1840 for electors for president and vice president in several states it was asserted that some of the pa rticular misconduct in that ection appeared to have been encouraged in part because the states had differing dates for the presidential election which allowed the lleged movement of populations and voters to key states having later elections described as pipelaying11 congress sought to eliminate such opportunities for fraud and corruption by establishing uniform day throughout the country for selecting the electors for pr esident and vice president while assuring that those states that required an absolute majority to elect could continue to hold runoff for presidential electors if needed in an election on subsequent date12 the uniform date for congressional electi ons in the states was not established by the congress until 187213 in first enacting this legislation the congress appeared to be concerned primarily with two factors that is the potential undue and unfair influence on elections in some states that earlier results and elections in other states may routinely have and the burden on voters who in some states would have to go to the polls twice for two different gene ral elections to choose federal officers in presidential election years14 current federal authority to postpone as noted the united states constitution does not provide any express authority to any federal official or

to arrest attention and demand the gravest consideration if this government is anything more than mere aggregation of delegated agents of other states and governments each of which is superior to the general government it must have the power to protect the elections on which its existence depends from violence and corruption23 furthermore in theory congress could also enact law delegating to the executive certain authority in this area regarding emergency rescheduling24 however as policy matter and under article i secti on 4 clause 1 and article ii section 1 clause 2 congress has traditionally allowed the states within the framework of the federal constitutional and statutory mandates to exercise the substantive control over the procedures and administrative details of elections within their own respective jurisdictions and the st ates have then generally further devolved immediate administrative and supervisory control over many election procedures to local and

may adopt contes t and recount provisions as one of the safeguards which experience shows are necessary in order to enforce the fundamental right involved33 the court noted there indiana has found along with many other states that one procedure necessary to guard against irregularity nd error in the tabulation of votes is the availability of recount recount is an integral part of the indiana electoral process and is in the ambit of the broad powers delegated to the states by art i 4 it is true that states verifica tion of the accuracy of election results pursuant to its art i 4 powers is not totally separable from the senates power to judge elections and returns but recount can be said to usurp the senates function only if it frustrates the senates ability to make an independent final judgment recount does not prevent th senate from independently evaluating the election any more than the initial count does the senate is free to accept or reject the apparent winner in either count

by the death resignation or incapacity of person elected may be prescribed by the laws of the several states and territories respectively the supreme court of the united states has found that the day established in 2 usc 7 for electing senators and repr esentatives in the states is mandatory date and that states stat utory scheme may not permissibly allow the election of such federal official at an election held prior to the first tuesday after the first monday in november date thus th louisiana election provisions which designated as elected to congress an open primary winner who received at least majority of the votes cast in that primary election held prior to the general election was found to be violation of the fede ral law setting the ge neral election date39 states that allow early voting in fede ral elections however have not been found by federal courts to be holding prior elec tion in violation of th federal statute since it was found that the election would not be consummated befo re election day or that such ballots would not be officia lly counted or tallied before election day40 federal courts interpreting the federal statutes regarding the timing of elections to congress have noted that the states sc heme for elections must be in general conformance with the date prescribed by federal law at 2 usc 7 and may not routinely allow the election on an earlier date but that certain exigent circumstances may permit the holding of an election for federal office at subsequent time under 2 usc 841 the federal court in the district of columbia in busbee v smith in case affirmed by the united states supreme c ourt found that an exigent circumstance such as the state of georgias reapportionment plan being refused preclearance by the justice depar tment under the voting rights act of 1965 because of discriminatory effects allowed for an election to federal office in two congressional districts to be held on subsequent date where exigent circumstances arising pr ior to or on the date established by 2 usc section 7 preclude holding an ection on that date state may postpone the election until the earliest practicable date in this case for example georgia will fail to elect at the time pres cribed by law because its purposefully discriminatory conduct prevented it from securing section 5 approval for constitutionally required changes in its voting procedures as result we believe that 2 usc section 8 pe rmits reasonable postponement of the elections in the fourth and fifth congressional districts42 this reasoning as noted later by anot her federal court would allow for the postponement of an election and the holding of the election for federal office in the state at later date for number of possible exigent circumstances

federal court in georgia found that the states statutory re quirement that candidate to be elected receive majority and not merely plura lity of votes in the general electi on was such an exigent circumstance that could re quire the holding of subsequent runoff election for senator to be held on november 24 after th earlier november general election mandated by 2 usc 7 resulted in candidate receiving majority of the votes the court in busbee acknowledged that 2 usc 8 allows states under certain circumstances to hold elections at times other than those prescribed by section 7 id at 52425 in addition to the circumstances it specifically enumerates death resignation personal incapacity section 8 allows states to reschedule elections where exigent circumstances arising prior to or on the date established by section 7 preclude holding an election on that date id at 525 the court offered natural disasters and the parties to the instant suit offer fraud and tie vote as examples of exigent circumstances warranting state rescheduling43 elections for presidential electors the election for presidential electors presents somewhat different issu than those elections for congressional office as the language of the federal statutes for presidential electors varies from the language governing congressional elections the statute concerning the timing and scheduling for congressional elections provi des expressly that when there is vacancy caused by death resignation or in capacity or when such vacancy is caused by failure to elect at the time prescribed by law then subsequent election may be scheduled this langua ge appears to be broad nough and as noted above has been interpreted by federa l courts to actually permit temporary postponement and rescheduling of congressional election the federal statute for presidential elections however expressly states that whenever any state has held an election for the purpose of choosing electors but fails to make choice on the day prescribed by law then the electors may be selected on subsequent day in the manner established by the legislature of the state 3 usc 2 failure to make choice on prescribed day whenever any state has held an election for the purpose of choosing electors and has failed to make choice on the day prescribed by law the electors may be appointed on subsequent day in such manner as the legislature of such state may direct does the wording of 3 usc 2 mean that the authority of the states to reschedule an election for presidential ectors is contingent upon the state actually having held an election for the purpose of choosing electors if so then under this theory prior postponement and resc heduling would be per mitted statewide even postponement for natural disasters such as an impending hurricane or the destruction shortly prior to the elections of number of polling places since it would conflict with the federally scheduled time in 3 usc

presidential electors in the state including fashioning protest or contest pr ocedures may be consonant with such an authority in the legislature itself to tempor arily postpone or to authorize by state law the postponement and reschedu ling of statewide elections by the state executive in certain emergency circumstances one of the major points made by the supreme court in both the earlier palm beach county case and the latter bush v gore decision was the primacy of th state legislatures role in the manner of the selection of presidential electors45 although clearly the concep ts of time and manner of election are not necessarily synonymous46 this constitutional provision and the supreme courts deference to the state legislatures may arguably give some credibility to the states attempts to statutorily prescribe system whereby emergency procedures may be implemented with respect to all statewide elections including the general elections for federal office which provide that such elections while certainly scheduled for the federally prescribed date because of suchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32623crs12 47 pierce and longley the peoples president the electoral college in american history and the direct vote alternative at p105 revised edition 1981 48 bush v gore supra at 7778emergency and exigent circumstances need to be rescheduled postponed or continued at subsequent time furthermore it may be noted that in addition to article ii section 1 clause 2 of the constitution the federal law at 3 u sc 5 which was part of the original electoral vote count act of 1887 provides the state legislatures with further statutory authority to finally and conclusively resolve within the state protests challenges and contests of the election of presidential electors one of the purposes of the original 1887 statute regarding counting of the electoral votes was to substantially devolve upon the states the burden for resolving conflicts over the election selection and appoin tment of those states own electors for president and vice president47 as noted by the supreme court this statute at 3 usc 5 creates safe harbor for state inso far as congressional consideration of its electoral votes are concerned if the st ate legislature has provided for final determination of contests or controvers ies by law made prior to election day that determination shall be conclusive if made at least six days prior to said time of meeting of the electors48 clearly there is an understanding that the st ates were intended to have the principal and initial responsibility for resolving the conflicts arguments controversies and difficulties involved in the processes of electing presidential electors thus it is possible to argue that to harmonize the provisions for elections to federal office that is specifically th provisions for subsequent congressional elections at 2 usc 8 and the presidential provisions at 3 usc 2 along with the authority devolved upon the states in 3 u sc 5 that it would be logical to read the federal statutes as permitting post ponement and an election on subsequent date for both congress and presidential ectors under the states current laws when necessitated by emergency and exigent circ umstances in the particular state and as long as the matter is resolved in time such resolution would be conclusive on congress in counting the presidential elect oral votes such supposition might be bolstered somewhat by the alternative that is that the federal law could work to disenfranchise the voters of particular state when that state believes it is necessary to temporarily postpone the regularly schedul ed statewide electi ons because of some extraordinary and disastrous event in the state while providing possible support for the st ate legislatures authority to develop scheme which could include postponement of elections for presidential electors in times of emergency this argument of ex panded state authority might not necessarily give any additional weight to an implied or inherent authority of the state executivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32623crs13 49 note discussion of state legislatures plenary power in this area in

weekly report at 2111 september 15 2001or the state courts to do so absent an ex press delegation in law from the legislature49 finally as policy matter there has been some consternation over allowing any state to postpone or otherwise reschedule an election for federal office the grounds for any such postponement or reschedulin g as well as any express implied or inherent authority would have to be examined initially under state law and procedure and blanket stat ement could be made with respect to the interpretation in all of the states furthermore there appears to be little lega l or factual precedent to apply to such circumstances remembering that the presidential election is not necessarily in the nature of nationa l referendum but is rather 51 simultaneous statedistrict elections for presidential ectors however it may be asked as matter of policy whether or not an event that occu rred earlier in the state or an event that occurs in different state would or s hould be enough to trigger postponement of an election in any particular state as matter of good public policy it has been argued that violent disruption of an election in manhattan new york city should not necessarily affect or at least could not predictably affect an election in manhattan kansas various commentators have noted that on the fateful day of september 11 2001 despite the events unfol ding
