preparedness efforts summary in 1997 new avian influenza flu virus emerged in asia and jumped directly from birds to humans killing six people the virus has since spread to more than 50 countries in asia europe and afri ca where it has killed millions of birds and infected more than 270 people killing more than 160 of them the virus bears some similarity to the deadly 1918 spanish fl u which caused globa l pandemic estimated to have killed more than 50 million people worldwide the current spread of avian flu raises concerns about another human flu pandemic global pandemic preparedne ss and response efforts ar coordinated by the world health organization who domes tic preparedness efforts are led by the white house homeland security council with the us partment of health and human services hhs playing major ro domestic response efforts would be carried out under the allhazards blueprint for coordinated federal state and local response laid out in the national respons plan overseen by the department of homeland security dhs hhs officials would have the lead in the public health and medical aspects of response the fe deral government s released several pandemic flu plans to govern federal state local and private preparedness activities there are concerns about how domestic public health and medical response would be managed during fl u pandemic there is precedent under the stafford act for the president to declare an infectious disease threat an emergency which provides lower level of assistance but similar precedent for major disaster declaration which provides higher level of assistance in any case many of the needs likely to result from flu pandemic could not be met with the types of assistance provided pursuant to the stafford act even if major disaster declaration applied vaccination is the best flu preventi on measure but because of continuous changes in the genes of flu viruses vaccines must be matched to specific strains to provide good protection pandemic flu strain woul d by definition be novel stockpiled vaccine would not match so stockpiling in an ticipation of pandemic is of limited value in additi on global and domestic capacity to produce flu vaccine is limited the us government primarily through hhs has launched an aggressive effort to expand domestic vaccine producti on capacity and to velop technologies to support more rapid producti on of matched vaccine at the onset of pandemic since matched vaccine would not be available at the outset of flu pandemic that occurred within the next several years planning efforts focus on measures to slow the spread of disease and mitigate its effects these include stockpiling of antiviral drugs to prevent or treat flu in fection planning for medical surge capacity and continuity planning for businesses and utilities this report discusses pande mic flu in general who and us preparedness and response plans and number of relevant policy issues the focus

health authorities of the d eadly 1918 spanish flu which is estimated to have killed up to 2 of the world s population and was substantial cause of mortality in us military personnel in worl d war i the world health organization who says if an influenza pandemic virus were to appear again similar to the one that struck in 1918 even taking into account the advances in medicine since then unparalleled tolls of illness and death could be expected4 us and world health authorities be lieve that while periodic influenza pandemics are inevitable th eir progress may be slowe d and their impacts blunted by rapid detection and local control efforts the added time would allow affected countries to better manage the situation and countries not yet affected to better prepare to realize these benefits countries affected by avian flu must be able to track the spread of the virus in birds and quickly detect and investigate suspected human cases hence countrys capabilitie s in epidemiology laboratory detection and other public health servi ces affect the welfare of the global community as well as the country itself this presents veloped nations with novel policy challenges

as condition of their federal bioterrorism preparedness grants the administration has created governmentwide public website to disseminate informa tion on pandemic flu preparedness and response

response including federal state and local governments and it will require the private sector and all of us as individuals to be ready6 1918style pandemic could be so severe that nonhealthrelated essential services would be impaired by high absenteeism or supply chai n disruptions and health services could be in such short supply that law enforcem ent protection might be required for them though who does not recommend it except in some narrow circumstances for prepandemic control countries might seal their borders or take similar measures with impacts on trade and commerce7 if flu pandemic were to occur in the next several years the us response would be affected by the limited availab ility of vaccine the best preventive measure for flu as well as by limited availability of certain drugs used to treat severe flu infections and by the general lack of surge capacity within our healthcare system the us healthcare system is largely private while the public health system is largely based in state rather than federal authority this structure creates numerous challenges in assuring the needed re sponse capacity and coordinating the various response elements planning is further complicated by th fact that while periodic influenza pandemics have been seen over the years their timing and severity have been unpredictable domestic planning efforts presume that the national response plan nrp an allhazards plan developed by the department of homeland security dhs would be activated if needed to streamline th federal response to pandemic pandemic flu is unlike most other threats though si nce flu is communicable there is scene to secure and all states might be affected nearly simultaneously thus while pandemic could cause catastrophi c levels of illness and

influenza what is pandemic influenza pandemic from the greek for all of the pe ople is an epidemic of human disease occurring over very wide area crossing international boundaries and affecting large number of people t hough it does so with some regularity influenza is not the only pathogen that can cause pandemics pandemic of the black death which affected most of europe in the 14th century is generally attributed to plague technically yersinia pestis the global spread of hivaids is often referred to as pandemic litera ture offers numerous examples of such episodes of widespread contagion influenza is virus that causes respiratory disease in humans with typical symptoms of fever coug h and muscle aches and ra rely pneumonia and death though primarily human pathogen infl uenza viruses also circulate and cause illness in swine horses mink seals and domestic poultry and may be carried without apparent illness in these species as well as number of species of waterfowl influenza is highly contagious in human s spreading through direct contact and airborne exposure the virus can also persist for several hour s on inanimate objects such as toys or doorknobs in addition in fluenza is infectious before symptoms appear in its victims which also enhances its spread9 influenza viruses have genome compos ed of eight segments of rna i n addition to random mutation flu viruses also undergo change by shuffling or reassorting these gene segments among different strains human flu viruses are of two types influenza and b influenz strains are further identified by two important surface antigens proteins that are responsible for virulence hemagglutinin h and neuraminidase n fifteen different h antigens and nine different n antigens have been identified in birds and mammals not all possiblehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33145crs5 10 who current who phase of pandemi c alert as of february 20 2007 at httpwwwwhointcsrdiseaseavian_influenzaphaseenindexhtmlcombinations of h and n antigens ve been documented and very few combinations have been shown to cause human illness the avian flu strain causing great concern at this time is design ated as h5n1 for its surface antigens new influenza strains typically circle the globe within three to six months of emergence new strains circulate each year changing slightly from prior strains called antigenic drift each year the virus its genome in constant flux typically makes healthy people sick but is generally not deadly healthy adults typically have partial immunity to new strains but newly formulated vaccine is required each year to provide full immunity now and then often several times in century the virus changes enough through mutati on or reassortment called antigenic shift that there is partial immunity in the population th is event an influenza pandemic results in severe illness and death even in healthy people the extent and severity of illness and the disabling impact on healthy young people could cause serious disruptions in services and social order pandemic phases according to who the hallmarks of an influenza pandemic are 1 the emergence of novel influenza virus strain 2 the finding that the strain can

indonesia iraq nigeria thailand turkey and vietnam the who describes pandemic influenza and the situation with h5n1 as follows16 outbreaks caused by h5n1 are of pa rticular concern because of their association with severe illness and high case fatality of even greater concern is the uniqueness of the present h5n1 situation in asia never before has an avian influenza virus with documented ability to infect humans caused such widespread outbreaks in birds in so many countries this unprecedented situation has significantly increased the risk for the emergence of an influenza pandemic the risk of pandemic remains so long as h5n1 is present in an animal reservoir thus allowing continuing opportunities for human exposure and infection most experts agree that cont rol of the present outbreaks in poultry will take several months or even years the recent detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza in wild birds adds another layer of complexity to control the world may therefore remain on the verge of pandemic for some time to come at the same time the unpredicta bility of influenza viruses and the speed with which transmissibility can improve means that the time for preparedness planning is right now such task takes on added urgency because of the prospects opened by recent research good planning and preparedness might mitigate the enormous consequences of pandemic and this opportunity must not be missed the h5n1 strain now circulating has been especially virulent in both human and avian hosts studies suggest that the virus prompts an overreaction of the inflammatory response in some human vic tims causing rapid nd severe damage to the lungs17 this primary damage cannot be re medied with antibiotics or antiviralhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33145crs9 17 continued july

rationing of vaccine and antiviral drugs to states the draft plan was superceded by the hhs pandemic influenza plan the hhs pandemic plan published in november 2005 the final plan built on elements in the draft plan and has three parts 1 strategic plan which outlines key planning assumptions and hhs agency roles 2 public health guidance for state and local partners which lays out activities on such

refers to plans for surge capacity some experts have commented that there is little surge capacity in the healthcare sector under normal circumst ances and that officials might have to resort to the use of alternate facilities eg c onvention centers to care for large numbers of flu patients the hhs pandemic plan does not address that contingency department of defense planning shortly after the

high mortality suffered by us troops during world war i as result of the 1918 pandemic the guidance notes th at 43000 uniformed soldiers more than one third of all us military casualties in the war died of pandemic influenza most of them during one 10week period in 1918 the dod guidance notes that the military w ill use the same vaccine formulation as that developed for civilian use thoug h dod will be responsible for securing its own supplies of vaccine and antiviral drugs priority for countermeasures in limited supply would be given to forwarddeploy ed troops the guid ance does not set out strict tiers of priority recipients the guidance discusses the limited utility of individual control measures such as is olation and quarantine and suggests that largerscale adjustments such as

an influenza pandemic be stopped public health experts note that vaccine the primary measure for influenza prevention will be available in very limited supply at the st art of pandemic antiviral drugs are also likely to be ava ilable in limited supply for both there is limited global surge capacity for pr oduction during pande mic conventional wisdom once held that there was an inevitability to the global wave of disease that pandemic would bring but lately this notion has been challenged who and many national experts believe that scientific adva nces in studying and detecting flu viruses may make it possible to detect the spread of the virus early and rein in localized clusters of infection while not sugges ting that pandemic could necessarily be averted they posit that if progression were slowed enough vaccine could be available by the time worldwide infection ensued while there still might not be enough vaccine for everyone if countries had at least enough fo r essential personnel it would soften the impact somewhat realizing this hope rests on two c onditions first exceptional pandemic intelligence in countries at the epicente r of developing pandemic and second an effective response in these ep icenter countries in hopes of having the best possible information in real time who along w ith the us state department cdc dod other us federal agencies and health

not just the public health and medical communities as such it is useful to consider federal efforts to meet this threat across sectors and to consider those efforts in the contexts of preparedness and

nvponvacdocumentschairletterpdfseveral additional factors complicate the healthcare burden posed by pandemic flu first it is thought that pandemic would spread across the united states in compressed timeframe similar to seasonal flu that is over six to eightweek period second while it is desirable that affected patients be kept in isolation domestic isolation capacity is limited third the healthcare workforce is likely to be affected by pandemic flu even if they are protected directly by limited vaccines or antiviral drugs their family members may be affected and require additional care at home fourth supplies of healthcare c onsumables such as gloves masks and antibiotics would be stressed by surge in global demand76 even mild flu pandemic would likely place significant and nearsimultaneous strain on the nations healthcare system rationing scar ce resources the who recommends that countries id entify priority groups for vaccination and antiviral drugs as these measures become available and recommends that countries make these decisions before pandemic occurs the national vaccine advisory committee nvac which reports to the director of the national vaccine program in

recommendations were incorporated into the hhs pandemic plan and are displayed in table 2 healthcare workers with direct patient c ontact and those involved in making the vaccine were given top priority by the co mmittees next were those at highest risk of serious complications from flu du ring seasonal flu and during the 1957 and 1968 pandemics those at highest risk we re the very old the very young and individuals with certain serious chronic diseases the committees noted that during pandemic other groups may be shown to be at higher risk and that tiers could be redefined according to the specific epidemiologic findings for example during the 1918 pandemic healthy young people were fou nd to be at increased risk of death when they became infected according to the committees estimates more than 60 of the us populati on includi ng most children would not fall into any of the designated priority groupshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33145crs26 78 for further discussion see crs

strategy does not necessarily save the most lives though to accomplish that when resources are scarce resources would be given to those most likely to survive or to have better outcomes as result to the extent that one could determine who those people were conversely treatment would be withheld from those who were unlikely to benefit so that others may the hhs proposal has prompted considerable debate about strategies for withholding resources during pandemic and shown that rationing schemes to optimize one goal eg equity and fairness may conflict with schemes to optimize another eg slowing

effective against h5n1 flu but resistance to the drug has been documented in strains of seasonal flu that circle the globe each year and in at least four cases of h5n1 avian flu in humans scientists caution that resistance to tamiflu could become problem if the drug were pressed into service during an influenza pandemic especially if it were used for prolonged periods for prophylaxis104 in march 2006 the fda issued an order prohibiting the extralabel use in poultry of all approved human an tiinfluenza drugs to help prevent the emergence of resistance preserving the effectiveness of these drugs for treating or preventing influenza infections in humans105 public health officials have cautioned against an overreliance on antiviral drugs in pandemic planning there would likely be limited availability and drug resistance could emerge as serious problem so it has not been clearly shown that treatment with tamiflu for example would actually improve survival rates in clinical settings

passed pl 94380 the national swine flu immuniza tion program of 1976 among other provisions the law shielded manufacturers distributors and public or private organizations that would administer the vaccine from claims of injury or death that might result and established that all such claims would be asserted directly against the united states more than 40 million civ ilians were vaccinated against swine flu between october 1 and december 16 the campaign was suspended at that time due to several cases of guillainbarré syndrome potentially serious neurological condition causing paralysis and sometimes death suspected to have been caused by the vaccine meanwhile flu pandemic never emerged the worrisome virus from new jersey never led to global pandemic or even to localized outbreaks the federal government ultimate ly paid out 93 million to individuals injured by the vaccine113 analysts have commented that delays in indemnifying manufacturers threatened the availability of swine flu vaccine in 1976 while delays in providing for injury compensation compromised voluntary particip ation in the civilian smallpox vaccine campaign in 2003 successful emerge ncy vaccination campaign may depend on resolving both policy concerns expediently influenza as weapon in the late 1990s congress authorized th select agent program to track the movement of certain bacteria and viruses that

di rector julie gerber ding replied we recognize that influenza has some of the important characteristics of an excellent threat agent its easily transmissible it s relatively easy to produce and its very easy to modify or engineer so it does have ch aracteristics that if person was intent on modifying it is not beyond our ima gination to consider that beyond our preparedness efforts116 dr gerberding also noted th natural behavior of the virus which constantly shuffles its genes to pr oduce new combinations saying that mother nature herself is very effective terrorist if h5n1 avian flu were to cause human pandemic it woul d be reasonable to assume it was natural event nonetheless since influenza viruses are amenable to intentional manipulation the implementation plan states that in the event of pandemic the federal bureau of investigation fbi will closely monitor events through coordination with the cdc and take appropriate action in the event that it is suspected that there was deliberate human intervention in the spread of the pandemic117
