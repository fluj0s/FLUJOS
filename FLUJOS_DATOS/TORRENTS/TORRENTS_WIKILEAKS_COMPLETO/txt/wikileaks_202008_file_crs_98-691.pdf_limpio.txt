civilian employment along with the other forms of bias covered by the earlier order the nondiscrimination and affirmative program of equal employment opportunity requirement of the executive order extends to every aspect of pers onnel policy and practice in employment development advancement and treatment of civilian employees of the federal government it applies to civilian employment by the executive branch including the military departments and sundry other agencies but does not cover the uniformed military in addition although it purports to apply to legislative and judicial branch entities having positions in the competitive service relatively few such positions exist outside the executive branch and 11478 has been judicially held not to apply to noncompetitive and excepted service personnel this re port will be updated as events warranthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs986911section 4 of eo 11478 directs the eeoc to carry out the order through the issuance after consultation with all affected departments and agencies of such rules regulations orders and instructions as it deems necessary and appropriate and the head of each employing agency is required by 5 to furnish the commission with reports and information as requested and to comply with rules regulations orders and instructions issued by itlegal analysis of eo 13087 to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation in federal employment on may 28 1998 president clinton issued an amendment to eo 11478 which states basic policy of equal employme nt opportunity in federal executive branch departments and agencies the origin order as earlier amended prohibits discrimination because of race color re ligion sex national origin handicap and age in covered employment and requires each executive department and agency to promote equal opportunity through conti nuing affirmative program the scope of the equal opportunity mandate in eo 11478 encompasses every aspect of personnel policy and practice in employme nt development advancement and treatment of civilian employees of the federal government the clinton order eo 13087 adds sexual orientation after age as protected categ ory in section 1 of the underlying document along with qualifying language in effect authorizing the expansion of coverage only to the extent permitted by law the nature of the nondiscr imination and other obliga tions imposed on federal departments and agencies by eo 11478 is spelled out in some greater detail in section 2 thus each agency head must establish and maintain an affirmative program of equal employment opportunity for all civilian employees and applicants emphasizing active outreach and recruitme nt efforts employ ee development and training designed to fully utilize and enhance employee skills and advancement opportunities to their high est potential training for managers and supervisors to promote understanding nd implementation of the policy and system for oversight and periodic evaluation of progra m effectiveness beyond these more or less inwardlooking aspects of the program federal managers are also directed to assure participation at the local level with other empl oyers schools and public or private groups in cooperative efforts to improve community conditions which affect employability the equal empl oyment opportunity commission has overall responsibility for implementing the executiv order program through the issuance of rules and regulations which are binding on federal departme nts and agencies1 when title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 was enacted federal employees were not protected since the federal gove rnment was specifically excluded from the definition of an employer covered by the act section 701 did however

further that it shall be the policy of the united states to insure equal employment opportunities for federal employees without discrimination because of race color religion sex or national orig in and the president shall utilize his existing authority to effectuate this policy2 to carry out this mandate president nixon issued eo 11478 in 1969 replacing portions of an ear lier johnson administration directive on the subject3 pursuant to the order the former civil service commission established comprehensive administrative procedures for the investigation and resolution of discrimination complaints by federal employees however the courts from an early date denied right to judicial review of discrimination claims brought pursuant to the executive order4 the lack of judi cial remedy for federal empl oyees was rectified in 1972 when congress extended title vii coverage to the federal workplace and provided for novo review in federal court of federal employee discrimination claims following completion of the administrative process explicit congressional ratification of the eo 11478 as then written was included in 717c of the 1972 amendments which authorized private civil actions for federal employees complaining of discrimination based on race color religion sex or na tional origin in addition the amendments state nothing contained in this act shall relieve any government agency or official of its or his primary responsibility to assure nondiscrimination in employment as required by the constitution and statutes or of its responsibilities under executive order 11478 relating to equal employment opportunity in the federal government 5 the civil service commissions responsib ility for enforcing title vii and the executive order was transferred to the eeoc pursuant to reorganization plan 1 of 1978 and the civil service reform ac t of 1978 the eeoc carried forward the commissions regulatory enforcement scheme which was incorporated into the eeocs overlapping statutory jurisdiction the eeoc regulations elaborate upon the responsibility of fe deral departments and agencies for maintaining an affirmative program of equal employment opportunity as required by 717 and the executive order aside from procedures for processing complaints of discrimina tion those rules focus on two major aspects of federal employers compliance with nondiscrimination requireme nts first they make clear that the equal opportunity mandate extends to all of department or agencys personnel policies practices and working conditionsincluding job advertising recruitment trai ning activities promotion di scipline and discharge etc secondly the regulations emphasize the n eed for measures to inform and educate other employees supervisors and managers in particular concerning their role inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98691629 cfr 1614102a11 742 usc 2000e16b1 8the eeoc and office of personnel management have issued rules to guide monitoring and compliance of minority recruitm ent programs adopted by individual federal agencies including the requirement of annual specific determinations of underrepresentation for each group accompanied by quantifiable indices by which progress towards eliminating underrepresentation can be measured 5 cfr 720205b1998 9eeoc regulations issued pursuant to eo 11478 and the 1972 title vii amendments require covered departments and agencies to collect and maintain accurate employment information on the race national origin sex and handicaps of its employees by means of voluntary selfidentification and to report on same to the commission in such form and continuedprogram implementation thus the govern mental employer is to enlist the cooperation of the agencys general workfo rce and labor organizations and must take appropriate disciplinary action against discriminating employees similarly managers and supervisors are to be pr ovided orientation training and advice on the program with their participation being factor in the evaluation of their job performance both executive order 11478 and the eeoc regulations desc ribed above make plain that the mandated affirmative prog ram of equal employ ment opportunity is to encompass every aspect of personnel policy and practice including recruitment activities and that systems are to be established for periodically evaluating the effectiveness of the agencys overall equal employment opportunity effort6 the scope of this legal obligati on and specific initiatives adopted by federal agencies to implement it have received scant judicial attention perhaps because the order was so soon supplanted by statutory amendmen t to title vii corollary legal requirement was incorporated into 717 of the 1972 title vii amendments which requires each federal depar tment and agency to submit for annual eeoc review an affirmative program of equal employ ment opportunity for all employees or applicants for employment7 the statute however has since 1978 been administered jointly with provision of the civil service reform act which authorized federal minority recruitment program designed to eliminate underrepresentation of racial and ethni c minorities and women in specific job categories8 that program has application to sexual orientation just as it does not extend to older workers and religious minorities who are also protected by eo 11478 on account of this statutory history minority and female recruiting practices of federal agencies provide direct guidance to interpreting eo 11478 as most recently amended eo 13087 does not exp licitly mandate affi rmative recruitment or other preference in federal employment based on sexual orie ntation but neither does it or other legal author ity preclude federal employin g departments and agencies from incorporating statisticallybased measures into an overall affirmative program of equal employment opportun ity determina tion of administrative policy in this regard would appear to be within the discretion of indivi dual departments and agencies under 2 of eo 11478 in addition under 4 and 5 of eo 11478 as amended eeoc would arguably have the au thority but not legal duty to require recordkeeping by agencies of workfor ce composition based on sexual orientation9httpwikileaksorgwikicrs986919continued at such times as the

recruitment nor data collection appear to be required by agency practice with respect other classes protected by eo 11478older workers and religious minorities for exampleleaving the prospects for future agency action on sexual orie ntation largely conjectural the effect of the clinton administration order on federal health insurance family leave and other employment benefits for federal employees that include marital status distinctions would probably be marginal definitional aspects of family relationship ie husband wife spouse etc required for pa rticipation in most such programs are set by statute10 thus any claim of sexual orientation discrimination resulting from th denial of benefits to any person not the spouse or child of an employeeor an agencys voluntary adoption of domestic partnership policies would for many fe deral purposes be contrary to law and outside the scope of eo 13087 but in light of the us supreme court ruling last term in oncale v sundowner offshore services inc11 finding that title vii prohibits samesex harassment the new order could require agencies to take actions to prevent and remedy harassment of employ ees based on their sexual orientation such anti harassment policies could include agencys ponsored training programs to foster awareness and appreciation of diversity in matters of xual orientation employees objecting to compulsory attendance at ch programs on moral or religious grounds may enjoy uncertain constitutional protection12 however objectors might in some circumstances find relief in the eeoc regulations which require agencies to reasonably accommodate the religious needs of employees when this can be done without undue hardship to agency business13 nor would the amended order necessarily preclude evenhanded applica tion to all employees regardless of sexual orientation of agency rules governing employee conduct in relation to displays of affection or other workplace behavior that could reasonably be expected to interfere with or prevent effective accomplishment by the employing agency of its duties and responsibilities14 the executive order has its most obvi ous and direct implication on federal employers and for the rights of employees and applicants for employment in the executive branch it would not immediately impact the employment practices of federal contractorswho are subject to nondiscr imination and affirmative action requirements on the basis of race ethni city and gender imposed by eo 11246or recipients of federal fi nancial assistance govern ed by host of other

technical traini ng and assistance to state commissions or alternative entities to include developing strategies which encourage mutual respect and cooperation among citizens of differe nt sexual orientations nonetheless it is possible that eo 11478 as amended could have ramifications for the private sector in addition to internal measures to avoid discrimination and affirmatively enhance employment oppor tunities within the agency federal employers are directed to engage in c ooperative efforts with employers schools and public or private groups at the local level in aid of these objectives the authority to cooperate with local entities could concei vably provide basis for requiring or encouraging the adoption of sexual orientation policies by such entities as condition to federal cooperation some pa rallel may be f ound in federal regulations unrelated to eo 11478 whic h have either manda ted nondiscrimination or required the affirmative consideration of sexual orientation as criterion by participants in other federal programs15 it appears therefore that the sexual orientation amendment to the executive or der program could have at least some policy implications outside the federal workplace the ability of federal employees or applicants to complain of and obtain administrative relief for alleged sexual or ientation discrimina tion under the amended executive order may largely depend on future rulemaking by the employing federal departments and agencies andor the eeoc current procedures for enforcing equal employment opportunity with respect to othe r classes of employees protected by eo 11478 are established by eeoc regulations briefly federal employee aggrieved by discrimination must first consult with an agency eeo counselor for advice and informal resolution of the matter which if unsuccessful may be followed by formal complaint with the employing agency an investigation and u ltimately hearing before an eeoc administrative law judge any final agency determination may be appealed to the eeoc and from there to the federal courts in racial ethnic religious or gender discrimination cases right to judicial review in sexual orientation cases would not be independe ntly available under the executive order without congressional authorization in addition an argument could be made that because eo 13087 adds sexual orientation only to the statement of policy in 1 but not the more explicit implementation language in 3 the employing departments and agencies rather than the commission may be pr imarily responsible for termining procedures for administrative enforcement signing statement issued by the president on may 28 possibly suggests such intent when it d eclares that this executive order 13087 does not and cannot create any new enforcemen t rights such as the ability to proceed before the equal employment opportunity commission clouding the issue further however is the fact that the co mmissions current authority under 4 of eohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98691165 usc 1212 17id 1216a45 185 usc 4302b1performance standards to be based on objective criteria related to the job in question for each employee or position see also federal continued11478 to issue such rules regulations or ders and instructions and request such information from the affected departments and agencies as it deems necessary and appropriate remains intact in any event while eo 13087 may not create enforcement rights and only congress can create judicial right of action by statute the employing agencies and the eeoc share residuum of rulemaking authority under eo 11478 which could argu ably be deployed to procedurally implement the order at the administrative level another enforcement avenue may exist however the office of special counsel osc was created by the civil service reform act to investigate allegations of prohibite d personnel practices within the executive branch and when appropriate to seek corrective and di sciplinary action through auspices of the merit system protection board mspb16 falling within the independent investigatory jurisdiction of the osc is any allegation of activities prohibited by any civil service law rule or regulation and involvement by an employee in any prohibited discrimina tion found by any court or appr opriate administrative authority to have occurred in the cour of any personnel action 17 allegations of sexual orientation discrimination pr ohibited by eo 13087 may come within this definition osc has independent enforcement au thority however but where it finds reasonable grounds may seek stays and corrective action from the mspb against the employing agencies and disciplinary sanctions against alleged discriminators questions have arisen as to whether any statutory basis exists for the most recent amendment to eo 11478 regarding sexual orientation disc rimination while congress has authorized and approved of the executive or der program as applied to racial minorities and women bot h before and after its imple mentation the legislative history of title vii and the 1972 amendmen ts provides negligible support for the postenactment revisions effected by eo 13087 the president does however possess executive authority under the federal ci vil service laws to make such rules as will best promote the efficiency of the service thus 5 usc 3301 provides the president may 1 prescribe such regulations for the admission of individuals into the civil service in the executive branch as will best promote the efficiency of that service 2 ascertain the fitness of applicants as to age health character knowledge and ability for the employment sought 3 appoint and prescribe the duties of individuals to make inquiries for the purpose of this section in addition while the civil service refo rm act of 1978 does not mention sexual orientation it incorporates jobba sed performance standard which has been administratively interpreted since the carter administration as barring disqualification of persons from the fede ral service based on sexual orientation alone18 by 1996 at least thirteen cabinet level agencies and 33
