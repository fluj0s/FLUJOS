established as transnational business high technology online skills are now available for rent to variety of customers possibly including nation states or individuals and groups that could secretly represent terrorist groups the increased use of automated attack tools by cybercriminals has overwhelmed some current methodologies used for tracking internet cyberattacks and vulnerabilities of the us critical infrastructure which are acknowledged openly in publications could possibly attract cyberattacks to extort money or damage the us economy to affect national security in april and may 2007

supported partly by civilian high technology services and products most often in the form of communications systems and computer software1 in future conflicts that involve cyberwarfare between nations the distinction between us military and civilian targets may be blurred and civilian computer systems may increasingly be seen as viable targets vulnerable to attack by adversaries2 computer networking technology has also blurred the boundaries between cyberwarfare cybercrime and cyberterrorism officials in government and industry now say that cybercrime and cyberattack services available for hire from criminal organizations are growing threat to national security as well as to the us economy3 new and sophisticated cybercrime tools could operate to allow nation state or terrorist group to remain unidentified while they direct cyberattacks through the internet 4 many experts point out that past incidents of conventional terrorism have already been linked with cybercrime and that computer vulnerabilities may make government and civilian critical infrastructure systems seem attractive as targets for cyberattack5 some experts argue that the government of estonia may have already experienced this type of cyberattack directed against their systems and websites in april 2007 this report explores the possible connections between cybercriminals and terrorist groups that want to damage the us economy or national security interests the report also examines the effects of coordinated cyberattack against the us critical infrastructure including use of cybercrime tools that could possibly take advantage of openlypublicized cyber vulnerabilities trends in cybercrime are described showing how malicious internet websites and other cybercrimes such as identity theft are linked to conventional terrorist activity congress may wish to explore the possible effects on the us economy and on the us military that could result from coordinated attack against civilian and military computers and communications systems whether due to cybercrime or cyberterrorism congress may also wish to explore the difficulties associated with establishing doctrine for selecting an appropriate military or law enforcement response after such an attack 1 dan kuehl professor at the national defense university school of information warfare and strategy has pointed out that high percentage of us

groups are using computers and the internet to further goals associated with spreading terrorism this can be seen in the way that extremists are creating and using numerous internet websites for recruitment and fund raising activities and for jihad training purposes several criminals who have recently been convicted of cybercrimes used their technical skills to acquire stolen credit card information in order to finance other conventional terrorist activities 6 it is possible that as criminals and terrorist groups explore more ways to work together new type of threat may emerge where extremists gain access to the powerful network tools now used by cybercriminals to steal personal information or to disrupt computer systems that support services through the internet

there are several effective methods for disrupting computer systems this report focuses on the method known as cyberattack or computer ne twork attack cna which uses malicious computer code to disrupt computer processing or steal data brief description of three different methods are shown here however as technology changes future distinctions between these methods may begin to blur an attack against computers may 1 disrupt equipment and hardware reliability 2 change processing logic or 3 steal or corrupt data 7 the methods discussed here are chosen based on the technology asset against which each attack mode is directed and the effects each method can produce the assets affected or effects produced can sometimes overlap for different attack methods conventional kinetic weapons can be directed against computer equipment computer facility or transmission lines to create physical attack that disrupts the reliability of equipment the power of electromagnetic energy most commonly in the form of an electromagnetic pulse emp can be used to create an electronic attack ea directed against computer equipment or data transmissions by overheating circuitry or jamming communications ea disrupts the reliability of equipment and the integrity of data 8 malicious code can be used to create cyberattack or computer network attack cna directed against computer processing code instruction logic or data the code can generate stream of malicious network packets that can disrupt data or logic through exploiting vulnerability in computer software or weakness in the computer security practices of an organization this type of cyberattack can 6 gregory crabb us postal service global investigations and yuval benitzhak cto finjan presentation at the gartner it security summit 2007

cybercrime or cyberterrorism is problematic because of the difficulty determining with certainty the ident ity intent or the political motivations of an attacker9 cybercrime can be very broad in scope and may sometimes involve more factors than just computer hack cyberterrorism is often equated with the use of malicious code however cyberterrorism event may also sometimes depend on the presence of other factors beyond just cyberattack g6g142g143g146g151g146g157g146g152g151g156g561g143g152g155g561g5g162g139g142g155g157g142g155g155g152g155g146g156g150g561 various definitions exist for the term cyberterrorism just as various definitions exist for the term terrorism 10 security expert dorothy denning defines cyberterrorism as politically motivated hacking operations intended to cause grave harm such as loss of life or severe economic damage11 the federal emergency management agency fema defines cyberterrorism as unlawful attacks and threats of attack against computers networks and the information stored therein when done to intimidate or coerce government or its people in furtherance of political or social objectives12 others indicate that physical attack that destroys computerized nodes for critical infrastructures such as the internet telecommunications or the electric power grid without ever touching keyboard can also contribute to or be labeled as cyberterrorism13 thus it is possible that if computer facility were deliberately attacked for political purposes all three methods described above physical attack ea and cyberattack might contribute to or be labeled as cyberterrorism g6g142g143g146g151g146g157g146g152g151g156g561g143g152g155g561g5g162g139g142g155g140g155g146g150g142g561 cybercrime is crime that is enabled by or that targets computers some argue

cybercrime also includes attacks against computers to deliberately disrupt processing or may include espionage to make unauthorized copies of classified data if terrorist group were to launch cyberattack to cause harm such an act also fits within the definitio n of cybercrime the primary difference between cyberattack to commit crime or to commit terror is found in the intent of the attacker and it is possible for actions under both labels to overlap g4g152g157g151g142g157g156g561 botnets are becoming major tool for cybercrime partly because they can be designed to very effectively disrupt targeted computer systems in different ways and because malicious user without possessing strong technical skills can initiate these disruptive effects in cyberspace by simply renting botnet services from cybercriminal 14 botnets or bot networks are made up of vast numbers of compromised computers that have been infected with malicious code and can be remotelycontrolled through commands sent via the internet hundreds or thousands of these infected computers can operate in concert to disrupt or block internet traffic for targeted victims harvest information or to distribute spam viruses or other malicious code botnets have been described as the swiss army knives of the underground economy because they are so versatile botnet designers or botmasters can reportedly make large sums of money by marketing their technical services for example jeanson ancheta 21yearold hacker and member of group called the botmaster underground reportedly made more than 100000 from different internet advertising companies who paid him to download speciallydesigned malicious adware code onto more than 400000 vulnerable pcs he had secretly infected and taken over he also made tens of thousands more dollars renting his 400000unit botnet herd to other companies that used them to send out spam viruses and other malicious code on the internet in 2006 ancheta was sentenced to five years in prison 15 botnet code was originally distributed as infected email attachments but as users have grown more cautious cybercriminals have turned to other methods when users click to view spam message botnet code can be secretly installed on the users pc website may be unknowingly infected with malicious code in the form of an ordinarylooking advertisement banner or may include link to an infected website clicking on any of these may install botnet code or botnet code can be silently uploaded even if the user takes action while viewing the website merely through some unpatched vulnerability that may exist in the browser firewalls and antivirus software do not necessarily inspect all data that is downloaded through browsers some bot software can even disable antivirus security before infecting the pc once pc has been infected the malicious software establishes secret communications link to remote botmaster in preparation to receive new commands to attack specific target meanwhile the malicious code may also automatically probe the infected pc for personal data or may log keystrokes and transmit the information to the botmaster the shadowserver foundation is an organization that monitors the number of command and control servers on the internet which indicates the number of bot networks that are being 14 jeanne meserve official international

2007 approximately 1400 command and control servers were found to be active on the internet the number of individual infected drones that are controlled by these 1400 servers reportedly grew from half million to more than 3 million from march to may 2007 symantec another security organization reported that it detected 6 million botinfected computers in the second half of 200616 some botnet owners reportedly rent their huge networks for us200 to 300 an hour and botnets are becoming the weapon of choice for fraud and extortion17 newer methods are evolving for distributing bot software that may make it even more difficult in the future for law enforcement to identify and locate the originating botmaster some studies show that authors of software for botnets are increasingly using modern opensource techniques for software development including the collaboration of multiple authors for the initial design new releases to fix bugs in the malicious code and development of software modules that make portions of the code reusable for newer versions of malicious software designed for different purposes this increase in collaboration among hackers mirrors the professional code development techniques now used to create commercial software products and is expected to make future botnets even more robust and reliable this in turn is expected to help increase the demand for malware services in future years 18 traditionally botnets organize themselves in an hierarchical manner with central command and control location sometimes dynamic for the botmaster this central command location is useful to security professionals because it offers possible central point of failure for the botnet however in the near future security experts believe that attackers may use new botnet architectures that are more sophisticated and more difficult to detect and trace one class of botnet architecture that is beginning to emerge uses peertopeer protocol19 which because of its decentralized control design is expected to be more resistant to strategies for countering its disruptive effects20 for example some experts reportedly argue that welldesigned peertopeer botnet may be nearly impossible to shut down as whole because it may provide anonymity to the controller who can appear as just another node in the bot network21 16 julie bort attack of the killer bots network

spring of 2007 government computer systems in estonia experienced sustained cyberattack that has been labeled by various observers as cyberwarfare or cyberterror or cybercrime on april 27 officials in estonia mo ved sovietera war memorial commemorating an unknown russian who died fighting the nazis the move stirred emotions and led to rioting by ethnic russians and the blockading of the estonian embassy in moscow the event also marked the beginning of series of large and sustained distributed denialofservice ddos attacks launched against several estonian national websites including government ministries and the prime ministers reform party 22 in the early days of the cyberattack government websites that normally receive around 1000 visits day reportedly were receiving 2000 visits every second this caused the repeated shut down of some websites for several hours at time or longer according to estonian officials 23 the attacks which flooded computers and servers and blocked legitimate users were described as crippling owing to estonias high dependence on information technology but limited resources for managing their infrastructure security experts say that the cyberattacks against estonia were unusual because the rate of the packet attack was very high and the series of attacks lasted weeks rather than hour or days which is more commonly seen for denial of service attack24 eventually nato and the united states sent computer security experts to estonia to help recover from the attacks and to analyze the methods used and attempt to determine the source of the attacks this event can serve to illustrate how computer network technology has blurred the boundaries between crime warfare and terrorism persistent problem during and after any cyberattack is accurate identification of the attacker by finding out whether it was sponsored by nation or was the independent work of few unc onnected individuals or was initiated by group to instill frustration and fear by damaging the computerized infrastructure and economy the uncertainty of not knowing the initiator also affects the decision about whom should ultimately become target for retaliation and whether the response s hould come from law enforcement or the military initially the russian government was blamed by estonian officials for the cyberattacks and there were charges of cyberwarfare other observers argued that the cyberattack involved collusion between the russian government and transnational cybercriminals who made their large botnets available for shortterm rent either to individuals or to larger groups they argue that as the rented time expired the intensity of the persistent cyberattacks against estonia also began to fall off 25 however not all security experts agree and it remains unclear at this time whether the cyberattacks were sanctioned or initiated by the russian government or if criminal botnet was actually involved 22 robert vamosi cyberattack in estoniawhat it

cyberattacks targeting estonia were not concerted attack but instead were the product of spontaneous anger from loose federation of separate attackers technical data s howed that sources of the attack were worldwide rather than concentrated in few locations the computer code that caused the ddos attack was posted and shared in many russian language chat rooms where the moving of the war memorial was very emotional topic for discussion these analysts state that although access to various estonian government agencies was blocked by the malicious code there was apparent attempt to target national critical infrastructure other than internet resources and extortion demands were made their analysis thus far concluded that there was russian government connection to the attacks against estonia 26 however investigation into the incident continues and officials from the united states view some aspects of the event as possible model for future cyberwarfare or cyberterrorism directed against nation state in january 2008 court in estonia convicted and fined local man for bringing down government website as part of the extended cyberattack in 2007 the 20yearold who is apparently an ethnic russian estonian used his home pc to carry out the attack the investigation continues and so far he is the only person convicted for participating in the cyberattack against estonia 27

unauthorized viewing and copying of data files however should terrorist group nation or other organization use computer hacking techniques for political or economic motives their deliberate intrusions may also qualify them additionally as cybercriminals if there is disagreement about this it is likely because technology has outpaced policy for labeling actions in cyberspace in fact industrial cyber espionage may now be considered necessary part of global economic competition and secretly monitoring the computerized functions and capabilities of potential adversary countries may also be

against dod systems and the computers belonging to dod contractors the cyber espionage attack apparently went undetected for many months this series of cyberattacks was labeled titan rain and was suspected by dod investigators to have originated in china the attacks were directed against the us defense information systems agency disa the us redstone arsenal the army space and strategic defense installation and several computer systems critical to military logistics although classified systems reportedly were breached many files were copied containing information that is sensitive and subject to us exportcontrol laws in 2006 an extended cyberattack against the us naval war college in newport rhode island prompted officials to disconnect the entire campus from the internet 48 similar attack against the pentagon in 2007 led officials to temporarily disconn ect part of the unclassified network from the internet dod officials acknowledge that the global information grid which is the main network for the us military experiences more than three million daily scans by unknown potential intruders49 accurate attribution is important when considering whether to retaliate using military force or police action some dod officials have indicated that the majority of cyber attacks against dod and us civilian agency systems are suspected to originate in china and these attacks are consistently more numerous and sophisticated than cyberattacks from other malicious actors the motives appear to be primarily cyber espionage against civilian agencies dod contractors and dod

with 36 million attacks financial services ranked third with approximately 34 million and healthcare received more than 17 million attacks the most frequent targets for these attacks all occurring in the first half of 2005 were government agencies and industries in the united states 12 million followed by new zealand 12 million and china 1 million these figures likely represent an underestimation

regions with major narcotics markets such as western europe and north america also possess optimal technology infrastructure and open commercial nodes that increasingly serve the transnational trafficking needs of both criminal and terrorist groups55 officials of the us drug enforcement agency dea reported in 2003 that 14 of the 36 groups found on the us state departments list of foreign terrorist organizations were also involved in drug trafficking 2002 report by the federal research division at the library of congress revealed growing involvement of islamic terrorist and extremists groups in drug trafficking and limited evidence of cooperation between different terrorist groups involving both drug trafficking and trafficking in arms56 consequently dea officials reportedly argued that the war on drugs and the war against terrorism are and should be linked57 state department officials at senate hearing in march 2002 also indicated that some terrorist groups may be using drug trafficking as way to gain financing while simultaneously weakening their enemies in the west through exploiting their desire for addictive drugs58 the poppy crop in afghanistan reportedly supplies resin to produce over 90 percent of the worlds heroin supporting drug trade estimated at 31 billion reports indicate that money from drug trafficking in afghanistan is used to help fund terrorist and

levels and may now be in better position to strike western countries 59 drug traffickers have the financial clout to hire computer specialists with skills for using technologies which make internet

nations will be used by terrorist groups simply to supplement the more traditional physical terrorist attacks63 some observers have stated that qaeda does not see cyberattack as important for achieving its goals preferring attacks which inflict human casualties64 other observers believe that the groups most likely to consider and employ cyberattack and cyberterrorism are the terrorist groups operating in postindustrial societies such as europe and the united states rather than international terrorist groups that operate in developing regions where there is limited access to high technology however other sources report that qaeda has taken steps to improve organizational secrecy through more active and sophisticated use of technology and evidence suggests that qaeda terrorists used the internet extensively to plan their operations for september 11 2001 65 in past years qaeda groups reportedly used new internetbased telephone services to communicate with other terrorist cells overseas khalid shaikh mohammed one of the masterminds of the attack against the world trade center reportedly used special internet chat software to communicate with at least two airline hijacker s ramzi yousef who was sentenced to life imprisonment for the previous bombing of the world trade center had trained as an electrical engineer and had planned to use sophisticated electronics to detonate bombs on 12 us airliners departing from asia for the united states he also used sophisticated encryption to protect his data and to prevent law enforcement from reading his plans should he be captured 66 tighter physical security measures now widely in place throughout the united states may encourage terrorist groups in the future to explore cyberattack as way to lower the risk of detection for their operations67 however other security observers believe that terrorist organizations might be reluctant to launch cyberattack because it would result in less immediate drama and have

computer systems that are part of the financial infrastructure 70 it was also determined that attempts to cripple the us telecommunications infrastructure would be unsuccessful because builtin system redundancy would prevent damage from becoming too widespread the conclusion of the exercise was that digital pearl harbor in the united states was only slight possibility 71 however in 2002 major

problems such as bringing down widespread telephone networks nd also halting control information exchanged between ground and aircraft flight control systems73 security experts agree that coordinated

critical infrastructure some observers have stated that because of us dependency on computer technology such attacks may have the potential to create economic damage on large scale while other observers have stated that us infrastructure systems are resilient and would possibly recover easily thus avoiding any severe or catastrophic effects while describing possible offensive tactics for military cyber opera tions dod officials reportedly stated that the us could confuse enemies by using cyberattack to open floodgates control traffic lights or scramble the banking systems in other countries74 likewise some of chinas military journals speculate that cyberattacks could disable american financial markets china however is almost as dependent on these us markets as the united states and might possibly suffer even more from such disruption to finances as to using cyberattack against other us critical infrastructures the amount of potential damage that could be inflicted might be relatively trivial compared to the costs of discovery if engaged in by nation state however this constraint does not apply to nonstate actors like qaeda thus making cyberattack potentially useful tool for those groups who reject the global market economy 75 g21g5g3g6g3g561g24g158g149g151g142g155g138g139g146g149g146g157g146g142g156g561 supervisory control and data acquisition scada systems are the computers that monitor and regulate the operations of most critical infrastructure industries such as the companies that manage the power grid these scada computers automatically monitor and adjust switching manufacturing and other process control activities based on digitized feedback data gathered by sensors these control systems are often placed in remote locations are frequently unmanned and are accessed only periodically by engineers or technical staff via telecommunications links however for more efficiency these communication links are increasingly connected to corporate administrative local area networks or directly to the internet some experts believe that the importance of scada systems for controlling the critical infrastructure may make them an attractive target for terrorists 76 many scada systems also now operate using commercialofftheshelf cots software which some observers believe are inadequately protected against cyberattack these scada systems are thought to remain persistently vulnerable to cyberattack because many organizations that operate them have not paid proper attention to these systems unique computer security needs 77 74 sebastian sprenger majgen lord

target for hackers they are less attractive because finding security vulnerability takes time and hacker may usuall not consider it worth their while to invest the pre operative surveillance and research needed to attack proprietary system on single computer widely used commercialofftheshelf cots software products on the other hand are more attractive to hackers because single security

vulnerability of control systems and highlight cybersecurity issues that could arise for infrastructure computers when scada controls are interconnected with office networks in au gust 2003 the slammerinternet computer worm was able to corrupt for five hours the computer control systems at the davisbesse nuclear power plant located in ohio fortunately the power plant was closed and offline when the cyberattack occurred the computer worm was able to successfully penetrate systems in the davisbesse power plant control room largely because the busin ess network for its corporate offices was found to have multiple connections to the internet that bypassed the control room firewall 78 other observers however suggest that scada systems and the critical infrastructure are more robust and resilient than early theorists of cyberterror have stated and that the infrastructure would likely recover rapidly from cyberterrorism attack they cite for example that water system failures power outages air traffic di sruptions and other scenarios resembling possible cyberterrorism often occur as routine events and rarely affect national security even marginally system failures due to storms routinely occur at the regional level where service may often be denied to customers for hours or days technical experts who understand the systems would work to restore functions as quickly as possible cyberterrorists would need to attack multiple targets simultaneously for long periods of time to gradually create terror achieve strategic goals or to have any noticeable effects on national security 79 for more information about scada systems see crs report rl31534 critical infrastructure control systems and the terrorist threat by dana shea

in its new products however ma ny software industry representatives reportedly agree that matter what investment is made to improve software security there will continue to be vulnerabilities in future software because products are becoming increasingly more complex92 g11g151g138g141g142g154g158g138g157g142g561g20g142g156g152g158g155g140g142g156g561 although software vendors periodically release fixes or upgrades to solve newly discovered security problems an important software security patch might not get scheduled for installation on an organizations computers until several weeks or months after the patch is available 93 the job may be too timeconsuming too complex or too low priority for the system administration staff with increased software complexity come s the introduction of more vulnerabilities so system maintenance is neverending sometimes the security patch itself may disrupt the computer when installed forcing the system administrator to take additional time to adjust the computer to accept the new patch to avoid such disruption security patch may first require testing on separate isolated network before it is distributed for installation on all other regular networked computers because of such delays the computer security patches installed in many organizations may lag considerably behind the current cyberthreat situation whenever delays are allowed to persist in private organizations in government agencies or among pc users at home computer vulnerabilities that are widely reported may remain unprotected leaving networks open to possible attack for long periods of time continued systems software security experts predicted that computer hackers may possibly exploit these new vulnerabilities by releasing more attack programs such as the

there has yet been published evidence showing widespread focus by cybercriminals on attacking the control systems that operate the us civilian critical infrastructure disabling infrastructure controls for communications electrical distribution or other infrastructure systems is often described as likely scenario to amplify the effects of simultaneous conventional terrorist attack involving explosives however in 2006 at security discussion in williamsburg virginia government analyst reportedly stated that criminal extortion schemes may have already occurred where cyberattackers have exploited control system vulnerabilities for economic gain and in december 2006 malicious software that automatically scans for control system vulnerabilities reportedly was made available on the internet for use by cybercriminals this scanner software reportedly can enable individuals with little knowledge about infrastructure control systems to locate scada computer connected to the internet and quickly identify its security vulnerabilities the idaho national laboratory is tasked to study and report on technology risks associated with infrastructure control systems past studies have shown that many if not most automated control systems are connected to the internet or connected to corporate administrative systems that are connected to the internet and are currently vulnerable to cyberattack and because many of these infrastructure scada systems were not originally designed with security as priority in many cases new security controls cannot now be easily implemented to reduce the known security vulnerabilities 94 following past trends where hackers and cybercriminals have taken advantage of easy vulnerabilities some analysts now predict that we may gradually see new instances where cybercriminals exploit vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure control systems95 g15g142g138g156g158g155g146g151g144g561g5g162g139g142g155g140g155g146g150g142g561 new automated attack methods have outpaced current methods for tracking the number and severity of cyberattacks and cybercrime intrusions for example according to study by the cooperative association for internet data analysis caida on january 25 2003 the sql slammer worm also known as sapphire automatically spread to infect more than 90 of vulnerable computers worldwide within 10 minutes of its release on the internet making it the fastestspreading computer worm in history as the study reports the slammer worm doubled in size every 85 seconds and achieved its full scanning rate 55 million scans per second after about 3 minutes it caused considerable harm through network outages which led to numerous canceled airline flights and automated teller machine atm failures 96 94 testimony of aaron turner house

affect on the computer emergency response team coordinating center certcc in 2004 certcc announced that it had abandoned its traditional practice of producing an annual report tracking the number of cyber intrusions recorded for each year for many years prior to 2004 certcc had maintained database of statistics about security incidents that were reported to it anonymously by businesses and individuals worldwide the reason given for abandoning its annual tracking report was because the widespread use of new automated cyberattack tools had escalated the number of network attacks to such high level that the certcc organization determined that traditional methods for counting security incidents had become meaningless as metric for assessing the scope and effects of attacks against internetconnected systems 97 the certcc website currently states given the widespread use of au tomated attack tools attacks against internet connected systems have become so commonplace that counts of the number of incidents reported provide little information with regard to assess ing the scope and impact of attacks therefore beginning in 2004 we stopped publishing the number of incidents reported98 the fbi estimates that all types of computer crime in the us now costs industry about 400 billion while officials in the department of trad and industry in britain say computer crime has risen by 50 percent from 2005 to 2006 as one example of costs associated with recent computer security breach tjx the parent compan of tj maxx took 12 million charge in its fiscal first quarter of 2008 due to the theft of more than 45 million credit and debit card numbers starting in 2006 the money reportedly went to investigating and containing the intrusion improving computer security communicating with customers and other fees tjx estimates that adding damages from future lawsuits the breach may eventually cost 100 per lost record or total of 45 billion99 it is estimated that only five per cent of cybercriminals are ever arrested or convicted because the anonymity associated with web activity makes them hard to catch and the trail of evidence needed to link them to cybercrime is hard to unravel studies also show that cybercrime incidents are rarely reported especially by companies that wish to avoid negative publicity leading to possible loss of confidence by its customers however law enforcement officials argue that maintaining code of silence wont benefit company in the longrun steven martinez deputy assistant director for the fbis cyber divisi on reportedly stated at the 2006 rsi computer security conference that partnerships between law enforcement the academic community and the private sector are key to understanding and reducing cybercrime 100 each year the computer security institute csi with help from the fbi conducts survey of thousands of security practitioners from us corporations government agencies financial institutions and universities the

csifbi survey may be questionable because the survey methodology is not statistically valid101 this is because the survey is limited only to csi members which reduces the likelihood that respondents are representative sample of all security practitioners or that their employers are representative of employers in general in addition the 2006 csifbi survey points out that most companies are continuing to sweep security incidents under the rug with the apparent absence of statistically valid survey results concerning the financial costs of computer crime and with an accompanying lack of clear data about the number and types of computer security incidents reported it appears that there may be valid way to currently understand the real scope and intensity of cybercrime the growing use of botnets and sophisticated malicious code also suggests that the percentage of unreported cybercrime plus the percentage undetected may both be going up

commercial enterprises to report attacks owing to potential liability concerns certcc estimates that as much as 80 of all actual computer security incidents still remain unreported102 law enforcement officials concede they are making little progress in tracing the profits and finances of cybercriminals online payment services such as paypal and egold enable criminals to launder their profits and

pcs however some adware and spyware purveyors reportedly can still make millions of dollars per year in profits many companies who distribute spyware are difficult to pursue legally because they

acquire more of the skills needed to commit hightech crime on massive scale105 in the future we may see new and different modes of criminal organization evolve in cyberspace cyberspace frees individuals from many of the constraints that apply to activities in the physical world and current forms of criminal organization may not transition well to online crime cybercrime requires less personal contact less need for formal organization and need for control over geographical territory therefore some researchers argue that the classical hierarchical structures of organized crime groups may be unsuitable for organized crime on the internet consequently online criminal activity may emphasize lateral relationships and networks instead of hierarchies 106 instead of assuming stable personnel configurations that can persist for years online criminal organization may incorporate the swarming model in which individuals coalesce for limited period of time in order to conduct specific task or set of tasks and afterwards go their separate ways the task of law enforcement could therefore become much more difficult if cybercriminals evolve into the mafia of the moment or the cartel of the day police will lose the advantage of identifying permanent group of participants who engage in set of routine illicit activities and this will only contribute to the future success of

threat of cyber attack is less likely to appear than conventional physical attack it could actually prove more damaging because it could involve disruptive technology that might generate unpredictable consequences that give an adversary unexpected advantages117 the homeland security presidential directive 7 required that the department of homeland security dhs coordinate efforts to protect the cybersecurity for the nations critical infrastructure this resulted in two reports in 2005 titled interim national infrastructure protection plan and the national plan for research and development in support of critical infrastruct ure protection where dhs provided framework for identifying and prioritizing and protecting each infrastructure sector however some observers question why in light of the many such reports describing an urgent need to reduce cybersecurity vulnerabilities there is not an apparent perceived sense of national urgency to close the gap between cybersecurity and the threat of cyberattack for example despite federal information security management act of 2002 fisma some experts argue that security remains low priority or is treated almost as an afterthought at some domestic federal agencies 118 in 2007 the government accountability office issued report titled critical infrastructure protection multiple efforts to secure control systems are under way but challenges remain which states that cybersecurity risks have actually increased for infrastructure control systems because of the persistence of interconnections with the internet and continued open availability of detailed information on the technology and configuration of the control systems the report states that overa ll strategy yet exists to coordinate activities to improve computer security across federal agencies and the private sector which owns the critical infrastructure 119 some observers argue that as businesses gradually strengthen their security policies for headquarters and administrative systems the remote systems that control critical infrastructure and manufacturing may soon be seen as easier targets of opportunity for cybercrime cybercrime is obviously one of the risks of doing business in the age of the internet but observers argue that many decisionmakers may currently view it as lowprobability threat 116 for more information about the convention on

describing the need to improve cybersecurity have not been compelling enough to make the case for dramatic and urgent action by decisionmakers others suggest that even though relevant information is available future possibilities are still discounted which reduces the apparent need for presentday action in addition the costs of current inaction are not borne by the current decisionmakers these researchers argue that it vendors must be willing to regard security as product attribute that is coequal with performance and cost it researchers must be willing to value cybersecurity research as much as they value research for high performance or costeffective computing and finally it purchasers must be willing to incur presentday costs in order to obtain future benefits 120
