conventional weapons export controls the wassenaar arrangement richard f grimmett specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division summary this report provides background on the wassenaar arrangement which was formally established in july 1996 as multilateral arrangement aimed at controlling exports of conventional weapons and related dualuse goods and military technology it is the successor to the expired coordinating committee for multilateral export controls cocom this report focuses on the current status features and issues raised by the establishment and functioning of the wassenaar arrangement it will be updated only if warranted by notable events related to the arrangement background for some 45 years the primary international organization for coordinating restrictions on dualuse exports was cocom the coordinating committee for multilateral export controls1 cocom was formed in 1949 to limit militaryrelated transfers to communist countries at the time of its termination at the end of march 1994 it consisted of 17 industrial countries including all members of nato except iceland and japan and australia cocom operated on the basis of consensus and functioned without the existence of treaty or specific international legal authorization in reality cocom consensus gave any member and that member was most likely to be the united states veto over the export by any other member of controlled good or technology the daytoday operations of cocom involved meetings of secretariat in paris at which the members agreed upon the technical specifications of the dualuse items that were being considered for export to eastern europe the former soviet union and the peoples republic of china the secretariat also decided whether to allow exceptions to 1 dualuse exports are those commodities processes or technologies created primarily for civilian purposes which can also be used to develop or enhance the capabilities of military equipment congressional research service the library of congress crs2 agreedupon restrictions irregular cocom high level meetings set or enunciated overall policy for the members to provide guidance cocom created three lists of controlled items an international industrial list an international atomic energy list and an international munitions list the export control organizations of the member countries then incorporated some variant of the listed items in the united states the export administration regulations contained the us version of the items on the cocom lists since cocom had independent legal existence implementation of cocom decisions depended upon the effectiveness of the export control laws and bureaucracies of each of the individual members it was the responsibility of cocom member countries to pass and enforce adequate laws and regulations to control exports the comprehensiveness of the member countries export control regimes the degree of high level attention given to export controls and the effectiveness of the export control bureaucracies varied considerably in almost every instance the united states was the most active in pursuing cocom limitations on exports while its major trading partners especially france the united kingdom and west germany often seemed more concerned about facilitating exports after the dissolution of the soviet union cocom members agreed in november 1993 to disband cocom replace it with new entity and to move to national discretion in export licensing decisions as of january 1994 national discretion meant that each country not cocom as an entity would determine what should be exported and country could veto the export decisions of another the wassenaar arrangement2 beginning in november 1993 clinton administration representatives undertook major effort to create broadly based replacement accord for cocom which as initially conceived would include the formerly cocomproscribed countries it was initially hoped that this successor accord would be in place by the time that cocom was disbanded on march 31 1994 that deadline was not met this effort resulted in the establishment of initial elements of the wassenaar arrangement by 28 nations at the hague on december 19 1995 subject to the approval of their governments after meetings in early april and midjuly 1996 the secretariat of the arrangement was established in vienna in 19963 initially called the new forum the wassenaar arrangement has as its primary focus two basic areas 1 conventional weapons exports and 2 sensitive dualuse items 2 this section is based on testimony of clinton administration witnesses before the senate banking subcommittee on international finance and monetary policy on feb 24 1994 and sept 21 1995

new accord as the centerpiece of its efforts to promote multilateral restraint in conventional arms sales and transfers of sensitive military technologies4 the clinton conventional arms transfer policy set out in february 1995 was restatement of policy approach that has guided us arms transfers since the reagan administration the wassenaar arrangement formally titled the wassenaar arrangement on export controls for conventional arms and dualuse goods and technologies does not appear to break any new ground in the multilateral conventional arms control area previous attempts to achieve regional conventional arms sales agreements most notably the effort in 19911992 by the george hw bush administration aimed at securing restraint on middle east arms sales by the five permanent members of the security council failed due to the lack of consensus among the parties regarding which weapons could be sold and to whom elements of the wassenaar arrangement dealing with conventional weapons transfers depend for their success on securing the agreement of other weapons suppliers to forego activities that might otherwise be to their political or financial benefit there are four major areas of policy concern within the wassenaar arrangement these areas are membership target countries materials to be controlled and organizationoperational procedures membership the initial negotiations on the successor accord among the 17 cocom members were expanded to include in addition to the original members several new european countries and new zealand as participants then at the january 1994 moscow summit secretary of state christopher and russian foreign minister kozyrev issued joint statement welcoming the decision to establish new multilateral regime and indicating russias wish to join in the spring of 1994 state department officials stated that they would oppose the accession of russia to the new regime as long as it continued weapons sales to iran the russian decision to sell nuclear power reactors to iran further complicated matters by early 1995 the united states still was unwilling to agree to russian participation in the formation of the new regime while other members of cocom were unwilling to start the new regime without the russians the matter was resolved in june 1995 at gorechernomyrdin meeting when the russians agreed not to make any new weapons contracts with iran or to sell nuclear reprocessing equipment the agreed membership criteria under the wassenaar arrangement are that participants have adequate export controls adhere to the major existing nonproliferation regimes the missile technology control regime australia group and nuclear suppliers group and have responsible export control policies toward the socalled pariah countries iran iraq libya and north korea according to clinton administration officials china has not been invited to join the new regime because of concerns by the united states and its allies regarding chinese weapons exports to iran pakistan and other shortcomings in meeting membership criteria5 4 see white house statement made on february 17 1995 in crs report 95639 conventional arms transfers president clintons policy directive by richard f grimmett pp 810 5 statement of thomas mcnamara assistant secretary of state for politicalmilitary affairs in us congress senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs subcommittee on continued crs4 closely related to the question of russian participation has been the participation of the other members of the former soviet union the export control system that existed in the soviet union was centralized in moscow the countries that had been part of the soviet union had few responsibilities for controlling exports since 1991 the amount of attention paid by these newly independent countries to developing adequate export controls has varied greatly even now high level of uncertainty continues to exist as to the export control capabilities and the willingness of leaders of these countries to support export controls generally and an association such as the wassenaar arrangement specifically6 target countries second major area of policy concern relates to countries against which the new arrangement is to be targeted from the outset the united states has wanted to target countries of concern specifically identified as iran iraq libya and north korea however most of the countries participating in the negotiations have preferred setting general objective of promoting security and stability and then letting each member country determine its export control policies and target countries as currently constructed wassenaar will not however be directed against any state or group of states impede bona fide civil transactions nor interfere with the rights of states to acquire legitimate means with which to defend themselves france germany and russia in particular are opposed to us proposal to require advance notification of arms sales to regions of concern however former under secretary of state lynn davis noted that participants in the wassenaar arrangement have national policies banning arms and related exports to iran libya iraq and north korea secretary davis also noted the us will continue to insist that prospective new members adhere to such policies7 based on discussions at the december 1996 plenary session secretary davis said that participating country was currently transferring arms or ammunition to afghanistan in keeping with recent security council resolution materials to be controlled under the wassenaar arrangement member states have agreed to control exports or retransfers of items and technologies contained on an agreed basic list of dualuse goods and technologies and separate munitions list information on transfers of more than 100 sensitive dualuse goods and technologies on the agreed list are to be shared by members of the arrangement arms transfer reporting is currently confined to the categories of major weapons systems used for the cfe conventional forces europe treaty and the united nations arms register 5 continued international finance and monetary policy sept 21 1995 and washington post sept 20 1995 p a15 lynn davis carnegie statement reuters transcript jan 23 1996 6 the 28 states that signed the final declaration establishing the wassenaar arrangement on december 19 1996 were australia austria belgium canada the czech republic denmark finland france germany greece hungary ireland italy japan luxembourg the netherlands new zealand norway poland portugal the russian federation the slovak republic spain sweden switzerland turkey the united kingdom and the united states at the july 1112 1996 meeting argentina bulgaria romania south korea and ukraine joined the arrangement bringing its membership to 33 states at that point after the december 1314 2005 plenary meeting the membership had grown to 40 states 7 mcnamara statement washington post and lynn davis statement op cit crs5 regime organization and operations related to the questions concerning which items should be controlled is the issue of regime organization and operations none of the participants in the process appears to favor the types of strong controls and us dominance that existed under cocom national discretion with coordination is the most rigorous procedural option that emerged from the negotiations indeed american officials have publicly acknowledged that only the united states favors prior notification of transfers and this procedure is not part of the new regime during plenary sessions and working group discussions under wassenaar member governments are to share information on potential threats to peace and stability they are to examine closely dubious weapons or technology acquisition trends specific information regarding global transfers to nonparticipating countries of arms in the seven categories including model and type and technology is to be made available in this manner as are notices of denials of transfers of specific items on the lists established by the wassenaar arrangement members will regularly review the dualuse and munitions list to reflect technological advancements and experience gained8 the arrangement envisions more intensive consultations and more intrusive information sharing among 6 major weapons suppliers the united kingdom the us france russia germany and italy through transparency of national activities involving weapons and technology transfers it is hoped that dangerous acquisition patterns can be detected and halted before they become problematic at the july 1112 1996 meeting in vienna the 33 wassenaar states approved the initial elements to govern the arrangement and set november 1 1996 as the date to launch both the control aspects of the agreement and the information exchange under the arrangement twice year participating states report all transfers or licenses issued for sensitive dualuse goods or technology items in annex 1 which is subset of the dual use list currently for transfers in the seven categories in the case of conventional arms transfers biannual data exchange among participants gives details of arms deliveries twice year participating states also report denials of licenses to transfer items on the dualuse list to nonmember states when participating state denies an export license for sensitive dualuse items it is to notify other participants on an early and timely basis preferably within 30 days but definitely within 60 days the arrangement does not prohibit participating country from making an export to particular destination that has been denied by another participant this practice is called undercutting but participants are required to notify other participants within 60 days and preferably within 30 days after they approve license for an export of sensitive dual use goods that are essentially identical to those that have been denied by another participant during the previous three years9 8 lynn davis carnegie statement jan 23 1996 9 details relating to the initial elements of the wassenaar arrangement setting out the procedures and other undertakings agreed to by member states may be found in two unclassified documents available from the us state department the wassenaar arrangement on export controls for conventional arms and dualuse goods and technologies initial elements as adopted by the plenary of 1112 july 1996 and final version of the initial elements list of dualuse goods and technologies and munitions list the latter dated august 1 1996 is 194page document detailing all dualuse and munitions items covered by the arrangement these key documents which are updated as changes occur in the lists can also be found at the continued crs6 at the december 1999 plenary session of wassenaar arrangement members the us team proposed reporting on specific exports rather than aggregated reporting reporting on exports of all listed items not just the sensitive and very sensitive items extensive preexport reporting and undercut rule which would ban exports by wassenaar partner of goods already denied by another partner russian and ukrainian delegates reportedly blocked these reforms and the primary accomplishment was joint statement of the importance of strong enforcement based on national laws10 beginning with the december 2000 plenary meeting member states continued to reaffirm their concern regarding the threats posed by the illicit possession and use of man portable airdefence systems manpads and agreed on elements of export controls on such weapons in subsequent december plenary meetings of the wassenaar arrangement through 2005 member states have also reaffirmed their commitment to prevent the acquisition of conventional arms and dualuse goods and technologies by terrorist groups and organizations and by individual terrorists agreed to document setting out detailed best practice guidelines and criteria for small arms and light weapons salw exports and agreed to impose strict controls on the activities of those who engage in the brokering of conventional arms by introducing and implementing adequate laws and regulations based on agreed elements for effective legislation on arms brokering issues for congress compliance with membership criteria the agreed membership criteria of the wassenaar arrangement basically rely upon statements by members that they will abide by fairly general standards since the russian export control system and those of other nis countries lack substantial transparency what steps can be taken to ensure that the membership criteria will be complied with by these states and others with traditions of weak export control systems mechanisms to induce higher standards of evaluation is there an effective means by which the united states can induce acceptance of higher standards for evaluating sensitive technology transfers by other participating states is legislation sanctioning nations that continue to transfer weapons and technology to aggressive nations in regions of tension such mechanism would greater emphasis on use of oversight mechanisms in us law such as the arms export control act or the reauthorization of the export administration act provide the united states with more effective means of achieving some of the fundamental goals it has been pursuing through the wassenaar arrangement 9 continued internet site for the wassenaar arrangement which provides current official news releases and
