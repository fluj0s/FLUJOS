would amend the government performance and results act of 1993 pl 10362 known as gpra to create statutory process resembling the program assessment rating tool part first used by omb during

report 108768 and to s 2898 companion bill in the 108th congress hr 185 would amend gpra to require the omb dir ector to review to the maximum extent practicable each federal program as defined by omb at least once every five years in conducting each assessment omb would coordinate with the relevant agency head to determine the programs to be re viewed and to evaluate the purpose design strategic plan management nd results of the program in developing criteria for identifying programs to be assessed each year the director would consider the advantages of reviewing programs with similar purposes or functions the same year at least 90 days prior to completing th annual assessments listing of programs under review and the criteria being used w ould be available on the omb website and omb would also provide mechanism for public comment on the programs and criteria the assessments would be perfo rmed only by federal employees and the results would be transmitted to congress along with the next budget submission of the president would further ame nd gpra to require submission of strategic plans covering four years to be submitted by september 30 following year when there is presidential election various subjects are of potential interest in considering hr 185 one issue is its relationship with gpra and part some suggest that builds and improves upon the gpra framework and is needed to ensure that coordinated program reviews continue others point out that the part process which resembles is not well integrated with gpra and that unlike gpra does not require consultation with congress and other stakehol ders additional concerns include avoiding partisanship in the re view process and protecting the role of congress finally frameworks for systematic review

potential intere st and relevance in conjunction with continuing consideration of the bills some issues that may garner attention in this regard are identified in the discussion that follows relationship of with gpra and part the house reports accompanying hr 185 and hr 3826 in the 108th declare that the bill builds on the gpra framework and is necessary to ensure the continuation of systematic program assessments in the future according to the committee majority in developing and using part omb has improved upon the gp ra framework with the addition of tool for evaluating the results of discrete fe deral programs the next logical step is to codify th requirement for coordinated evidence based review of programs as such the par act is necessary to ensure that program assessments be required for this and future administrations requiring omb to be responsible for overseeing program assessment data will be great step forward in realizing the reforms envisioned by gpra and will make the federal government more efficient and results oriented23 on its website omb has characterized the connection between part and gpra as follows the part reinfo rces the ambitious outcomeoriented performance measurement fra mework developed under gpra also the part builds on gpra by encouraging agencies to integrate operational decisions with strategic and performance planning pe rformance measures in gpra plans and reports and those developed or revise d through the part process must be consistent24 as noted previously omb has also testified in support of statutory requirement for program assessment similar to part as compatible and desirable addition to gpra25 while part is not specifically mandated in the provisions in the bill are modeled on part on the other

goals and measures will compete with agencies long term strategic gpra goals and objectives that were established in consultation with congress and other stakeholders27 minority views included in the house report in the 108th congress to accompany hr 3826 also pointed to differe nces between the gpra requirement for input from stakeholders the provision for public comment in the towns amendment that was accepted in subcommittee and the much weaker language in the managers amendment at the full committee which leaves to omb the determination what is an appropriate mechanism for public input according to the minority views the towns amendment would have created forum for public comment akin to the process frequently employed in federal rulemaking activities and an appropriate parallel to the government performance and results acts re quirement for input from stakeholders when deve loping strategic plans28 discussion in the minority views of the report accompanying hr 185 in the 109th congress reiterated this position29 statutory program review by omb and the role of congress gpra requires agencies to set performance goals and evaluate programs results whereas under the white house th rough omb would determine assessment criteria and then take the lead in conducting the program reviews albeit in coordination with the relevant agency head the minority views in the report accompanying hr 3826 raised concern about possible partisanship in the arrangement for assessment noting we already have seen the problems that occur when omb reviews programs the part process has led to questionable ratings for number of programs in addition the statutory mandate in arguably might affect the constitutional separation of powers shifting power from congress to the executive by directing omb to ev aluate programs without requiring any involvement by congress according to the minority views such program review process might not give ade quate weight to congressional intent as reflected in authorization and appropria tions laws along with guidance provided in report language30 minority views in the report accompanying hr 185 further noted congress should not authorize omb to ffectively overrule c ongress and set the goals for federal agency activities31httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32671crs10 32 omb watch is nonprofit watchdog organizati on that says its mission is to

respect both to politicization and congressional prerogatives the article contended just as there has been concern that president bushs part evaluation is way of using program eval uation as justification for cutting funding from government par evaluation also suffe rs from seriously lopsided balance of powers the executive branch basically ge ts to decide what government should or should not be doing and how each prog ram should best accomplish its goals33 in contrast to these views the reports accompanying hr 185 and hr 3826 reflecting the perspective of the ma jority do not envision such potential consequences in defending the need for the legislation the report accompanying hr 185 maintains information gleaned from these program reviews will be useful across the board to all stakeholders includi ng members of congress taxpayers and agency officials the 2005 report contends in particular that program reviews under will provide cong ressional policy make rs with the information needed to conduct more effective ove rsight to make betterinformed authorization decisions and to make more evidencebased spending decisions that achieve positive results for the american people34 meanwhile omb has recognized congre ss as an important partner in the part process the administration is inviting members of congress and other stakeholders to review the part deta ils and provide feedback to omb on the conclusions omb and agencies have made in answers to part questions omb moreover avers the objectivity and transparency of the part review process and holds in general that because part is an evidencebased objective analysis the administration believes it is useful tool in budget and policy formulation for all branches of government35 since the review process in is modeled on part one might arguably associate ombs defense of part with the process as well previous review frameworks in sunset legislation the sunset label has been characterized as the popular name for statute which provides for the periodic termination of government agencies unless they are able to justify their existence36 sunset measures typically cont ain two basic components an

of requirement for system atic review and evaluation of federal programs in considering congress may want to examine how previous bills requiring reviews of federal programs have been structur ed for example provisions in the sunset act of 1978 as passed by the senate s 2 95th congress differed from those in hr 185 and hr 3826 in several respects as detailed below38 designation of review agent in the sunset act the entity charged with conducting the reviews was congress in hr 185 the reviewer is omb in coordination with agency heads despite this fundamental diffe rence other features of the sunset review process may pr ove relevant in considering timetable for review the sunset act of 1978 would have required that virtually all federal programs be reviewed at least once every 10 years with 20 of the programs reviewed in each biennium hr 185 provides that virtually all programs be reviewed at least once every five years with 20 of the programs reviewed each year both measures similarly would divide the universe of federal programs into five groups but the sunset act provided two years for review of each group whereas hr 185 would see group reviewed every year exemptions from review the sunset act specifically exempted from review certain types of programs interest on the federal debt social security and federal retirement and disability programs medicare civil rights programs and enforcement judicial administration vetera ns benefits and income tax refunds the intent arguably was to protect essentia l programs from termination not to exempt them necessarily from program evaluation pe rhaps the concept if not the legislative content of provisions for exemptions from review in the 1978 legislation may be of continuing interest in devising st atutory requirement for program review hr 185 contains such categorical exemptions but the provision indicating that all federal programs should be reviewed to the maximum extent practicable gives omb measure of discretion to exclude certain programs from the analysis according to the house report accompanying hr 185 this clause was intended to give minimum flexibility to the director should special circ

why the review is deemed unneeded39 with the house committee report expressing such concern regarding the discretion given omb to waive program reviews unilaterally previous language in proposed sunset bills may be relevant to further consideration of earlier sunset bills contained provisions creating statutory parameters for possible exem ptions from program review rationale for devising groups the sunset act specifically delineated the programs to be reviewed each biennium by budget function and subfunction as set forth in the fy1979 budget grouping similar programs in the same review period while balancing the workloads of congressional authorizing committees who would be conducting the reviews in contrast hr 185 gives omb discretion to decide which 20 of federal pr ograms are to be reviewed in given year the approach of referencing budget functions and subfunctions in statutor language might offer an alternative framework for review of federal programs that would allow less latitude for omb in deciding which programs to re view in given year and concurrently help ensure the review of related programs with similar functions in the same cycle impact of reviews the sunset act contained an automatic termination feature with programs expiring unless they were specifically re newed by law hr 185 contains similar prog ram termination provision40 instead as is the case currently with part the information rived from the reviews conducted pursuant to the requirements in hr 185 is expected to be used by omb in preparing the presidents budget omb has substantial discretion in how the part scores are used and has emphasized that the program evaluation data will never be the only consideration in budget deliberations for example the documentation accompanying the fy2007 budget provided the following ex planation of how part scores affect budget decisions part ratings do not result in automatic decisions about fundi ng clearly over time funding should be targeted to pr ograms that can prove they achieve measurable results but part rating of ineffective or results not demonstrated may suggest that greater funding is necessary to overcome identified shortcomings while funding decrease may be proposed for program rated effectiveif it is not priority or has completed its mission however most of the time an effec tive rating is an indication that the program is using its funding well and that major changes are not needed41 with or without input from part or pa ra omb retains subs tantial discretion regarding the use of program performance

budget though use of performance information has been limited most in congress are aware of the part omb and agencies are also actively soliciting the view of the congress in part assessments on improvement plans and oversight efforts42 congress may determine the extent to which performance data from part or are taken into account in the authoriz ations and appropria tions processes in february 2006 meanwhile omb launched new website expectmoregov to provide easier access and public visi bility to results of part reviews43 the site contains summary for each program assessed to date as characterized in the presidents budget submission for fy2007 each assessment at expectmoregov includes brief description of the programs purpose its overall rating some highlights about its performance and the steps it will take to improve in th future for those interested in more information there are links to the deta iled program assessment as well as that programs website and the assessment summaries of other similar programs the detailed part assessment includes the answer to each part question with an explanation and supporting evidence it also includes the performance measures for the program along with current perfo rmance information in addition there is an update on the status of followup actions to improve program performance44 among the potential benefits of the website omb anticipates increased public attention to program performance and citizen demand for improvement in quality and timeliness of performance data
