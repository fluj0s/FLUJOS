federal agency responsible for observation and research of the earths oceans and atmosphere assessments of marine resources long and shortterm environmental predictions and public forecast and warn ing about weather and climate noaas two overarching missions are 1 envir onmental assessment nd prediction and 2 environmental stewardship noaa was cr eated in 1970 under president nixons executive reorganization plan 4 and is the largest agency in the us department of commerce doc noaa is funded in the annual commerce justice and state the judiciary and related agencies cjs appropriations bill the noaa request accounted for about 56 of the presidents request for the entire department of commerce doc for fy2003 noaa receives the largest amount of doc funding authorized for fe deral research and development number of potential budget issues for congress came out of president bushs fy2003 budget request for noaa see fy2003 presidents budget request for noaa below these include proposals 1 to transfer the national sea grant program to the national sc ience foundation 2 to accel erate deployment of the national polar orbiting environmental sate llite system program 3 to transfer to noaa and other federal agencies res ponsibilities for managing and funding retirement benefits for their employees who are currently under the older civil service retirement system csrs 4 to enhance security at noaas satellite facilities and to create redunda ncy in the agencys major telecommunications and computing systems and 5 to implement the presidents clear skies climate change research initiative in noaa national sea gran t college program many view the presidents proposal to transfer the national sea grant college programcurrently under noaas ocean coas tal great lakes research programs ocglrpto the national science founda tion nsf as the primary issue for congress in the fy2003 noaa budget this proposal would reduce ocglrp funding by 652 million the proposal was prompted by the administrations concerns about whether federal formula grants given by noaa to state sea grant programs were being distri buted fairly competitively nd meritoriously in fy2002httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31567crs2 nsf received the administrations distinction as being one of the best managed agencies in the federal government it appeared to the administration that nsf was already funding grants for similar res earch as that performed under noaas sea grant program thus the president with the support of the newlyappointed administrator of noaa decided the s ea grant program might operate more effectively and fairly within an agency whose statutory mission was managing federal funding for basic research and ther efore the transfer was proposed resistance to the transfer was soon met by some members of congress state sea grant program representatives and univers ity and industry participants in the sea grant program many of these challenged the presidents decision to transfer sea grant because it did not take into consideration the intrinsic nature of the noaa program which is marine resourcesbased and tied to us commerce such as the fishing recreation and touris m industries others cite d the hidden cost to nsf of maintaining research infrastructure including managing marine research vessels and laboratories and pr oviding the oceanographic expertise noaa provides officials at noaa have long pointed out the synergy and trust developed between state sea grant programs and noaa wh ich opponents of the transfer say has benefitted local economies that are marine resourcesbase d still others argued that unlike nsf the nature of much of the research being performed with sea grant funding has tended to be more applied than basic in nature in recent legislation to reauthoriz noaas sea grant college program for fy2003 through fy2007 hr3389s 2428 attemp ts have been made to address the administrations primary concerns bout fair competitive and meritbased allotment of sea grant funding authoriz ing language contained in both house and senate bills stipulates that portions of funding extended to state sea grant programs in excess of fy2003 levels is to be set aside solely for competitive meritbased grants and not be used for administration of the national sea grant college program further the bill encourages coordinated grant program planning between the noaa sea grant and coastal ocean programs and nsf which may be conducting related res earch activities supporters of this legisla tion believe the sea grant program would operate most effectively in its current status under ocean coastal and great lakes research programs in noaa there appears to be strong opposition to the presidents transfer proposal and strong support for the sea gr ant authorizing legislation among the academic research community and commercial fishing industries which currently operate in the pacific atlantic gulf of mexico and the great lakes where there are active state sea grant programs marine environmental research sponsored under sea grant programs in part underpin s many local marine resourcesbased economies for example these grants fund research on nonindigenous species marine diseases and health and the impact of such phenomenon on local fishing and shell fish industries sport and recreational fishing and coastal recrea tional activities for some state sea grant program administrators however language in both the presidents budget and in pending reaut horization bills might be construed as undermining their authority as to how they decide federal grants should be awarded however proponents of the reauthorization bills who also agree with administration concerns have pointed out that congressi onal direction would ttempt to distributehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31567crs3 more equitably both formula and competitive research grants to participating state sea grant programs further there are pr ovisions in the reauthorization legislation to review the progress in expanding the pr ogram to new eligible sea grant consortia such as the pacific us territories many who suppor t keeping the national sea grant college in noaa have posited that it w ill not be transferred out of the agency because of corrective actions taken by congressional authorizing committees to address many of the adminis trations concerns about fa irness in grant allocations the national polar orbiting environmental satellite system president bush requested 2373 milli on for the npoess program under nesdis which is now scheduled to be operating by fy2008 when the last of the poes satellites is pl anned to be launched noaa says the goal of npoess is two fold 1 it will merge noaas polar orbitin g satellite program and the dod defense meteorological sate llite program dmsp for the sa ke of economic and operational efficiency and 2 it will put in place st ateoftheart environmental monitoring technology and incorporate da ta processing and manage ment systems for improving weather forecasting and producing other nvironmental data products nasa the third partner in npoess would provide launch and maintenance services for the program officials at nesdis claim that full ployment of npoess is of importance to noaas national weather service so that it can continue to provide nearreal time weather forecasting nesdis also claims it will aid in the development of future climaterelated services such as regional climate assessments and extended range climate forecasts while noaa official s have testified in congress as to the exigency of fully implementing this prog ram ever since plans were unveiled during the clinton administration recent events which have challeng ed homeland security have led bush administration officials to state that fullydeployed npoess would also play critical role in national defense although many members of the 107th congress support the concept of npoess some have questioned the 62 b illion spent to date on this program visa vis its progress and achieveme nts to date hr 4775 p l 107206 which provided supplemental emergency ppropriations to noaa for fy 2002 originally contained directions to rescind 81 million provide d for npoess in fy2002 because of slow implementation of the program the ac t instead rescinded that same amount of funding from other noaa appropriations other congressional concer ns have been raised about the ability of noaa to collect process and manage future data that will be n eeded to support the national weather service as well as nesdiss capacity to provide environmental data products many noaa data users rely on noaa has reported that it is already challenged trying to manage the earth observing system eos data it had agreed to for nasa in addition the agency has id entified significant s hortfalls in delivery of environmental data products it provides to the na tional weather service many noaa data users have expr essed discontent about pe rceived deficiencies in processing and distribution of environm ental satellite data products for which nesdis is responsible httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31567crs4 the presidents fy2003 budget reque st for npoess would increase funding for various agency efforts aimed at expediting the compilation assimilation and processing of its environmental data noaa has pr omised to honor its data management responsibilities to nasa and reports that significant part of the funding request for npoess would help to prepare the agency for the deluge of data expected within the next decad from the npoess mission and other satellite data programs noaa is currently demonstr ating dedicated data integration unit for npoess which would aid in compiling and processing data streams from number and variety of future environm ental satellite missions in addition noaa has been demonstrating prototype satellite command and control system developed as part of the npoess preparatory project npp part of these activities include testing telecommunications systems sighting antennae which support npoesss data acquisition system and groundtruthing npp f unctions and operations in preliminary testing phases with existing satellites npoess system architects and engineer s seem confident that the funding currently proposed by the president for many of these propos ed data management efforts would appear to be adequate at the present time and can go long way to stimulate further development of the infrastructure necessary to meet the future data management and distribution needs of ne sdis successful operation however may depend on the performance of contractors w ho are currently building the systems and hardware for the program and their ability to keep to noaas timetable for npoess deployment noaa asserts that thos components of npp currently in demonstration phase includi ng the command and control and data integration units for npoess will have to become fully operational by fy2005 when the first npp satellite is scheduled to be launched if this goal can be met then noaa will be able to give the goahead order to shift from research to deployme nt implementation and fullscale operation of npoess by fy2008 the civil service retirement system under the presidents fy2003 budget noaa like many other federal agencies is faced with funding and ma naging mandatory benefits for its employees and retirees under the old civil service retirement syst em csrs number of federal agency officials have charged that these proposed obligations come at time when many of them are hard pressed to fund tr aditional discretionary programs the fy2003 noaa budget requested by the president contains adjustments to base funding to accommodate 129 milli on in proposed csrs and noaa corps retirement funding csrs funding w ould be apportioned across all noaa budget line offices for noaa providing for ne w mandatory funding has come at the expense of rolling some programs that were previously funded as line items into base funding which results in even greater comp etition for discretionary funding for those programs at this stage of the fy2003 budget process it appears that the csrs proposal is under active consideration by congress the administration has urged federal agencies to consider that there are relatively few remaining federal employees who are covered by csrs and to consider the minimal adjustments to base funding as percentage of total budget au thority in the annual request httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31567crs5 that may be the reason why federal agencies seem to be putting up little if any resistance to opms divestiture of those financial responsibilities as an example noaas obligations would account for less th an 13 of 1 percent of the total budget authority requested for the agency for fy2003 in addition noaa has administered health benef its and mandatory retiremen t funding for retired noaa corps officers for number of years and for fy2003 noaa would obligate some 37 million of mandatory funding of late however those entitlements have been transferred to the us coast guard for di sbursement to retirees as consequence financial officers at noaa foresee little hardship in taking on additional responsibilities for administering anot her 90 million in csrs retirement pay homeland security in the current heightened state of alert for possible future terrorist attacks on the united states congress c ould determine that funding for homeland security initiatives needs to assume higher priority than that for some traditional scientific research programs in noaa many who pe rform scientific research in the agency are concerned about possible changes in budg et priorities and redirection of human and fiscal resources to proposed depa rtment of homeland security see crs current legislative issues creating department of homeland security website at httpwwwcongressgoverplegissueshtmlisdhs2html for many federal agencies the fy2003 budget brings with it dditional financial responsibilities for improving homeland s ecurity and reducing vulnerability to possible terrorists attack s in noaas case this means funding redundant operational systems so that critical agency functions would not be interrupted during and after possible terrorist attack on its federal facilities the president has requested 264 million for noaa for critical infrastructure protection initiative being coordinated by the partment of commerce this funding would provide backup for noaas telecommunications satellites systems and command and control centers and weathe r climate supercomputing facilities noaa identifies those infrastructure component s as possible critical points of failure and in the case of potential disruption of sa tellite products and services to noaas data users single point of failure in some cases dded physical security has elicited need for improving structural in tegrity of noaa facilities another national securityrelated concern of the president is ensuring that energy continues to be provided by pow er utilities in times of crisis for fy 2003 the president has requested 61 million for pilot program aimed at longterm protection of the nations energy supp lies the president has charged noaa to become more involved in national energy pl anning to ensure that plans are sensitive to possible climatic change and fluctu ating average weather conditions over extended periods of time for example long term regional drought could potentially diminish or even interrupt services at some hydropower facilities moreover particularly severe winter could tax reserves of heating fuels as well as increase demands on the nations electricity supply other concerns that would be addressed in noaas energy initiative are ec onomic ones and relate to development of intelligent energy conservati on technologies and systems httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31567crs6 1 under the terms of the 1997 kyoto pr otocol on climate change the united states would be committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions consisting primarily of carbon dioxide 8 below 1990 levels by the year 2003 the united states has signed but has not ratified the treaty see crs report rl30692 global climate change the kyoto protocol climate change r esearch initiative some members of congress and bush ad ministration officials are concerned about the united states becoming party to the 1997 kyoto protocol that would regulate some internati onal greenhouse gas emissions to slow climate change1 in response president bush proposed domes tic climate change research initiative ccri is aimed at providing incentives for us industry to reduce greenhouse gases on voluntary basis this initiative is pa rt of wider administration effort known as clear skies intended to set out to reduce suite of atmospheric pollutants but which stops short of identifying atmospheric emissions of co2 as pollutant also as the name suggests ccri would fund number of climaterelated scientific research activities and in effect supersede federal climate change research activities currently organized under the us global change research program created in 1989 by pl 101606 for fy2003 the president requested 18 million for noaas part of the ccri and one of the agencys major charges would be to establish weather climate supercomputer modeling cente r of excellence housed at noaas geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory in princeton nj number of climate scientists are applauding the effort of the administration to provide the technological capability needed to assess further th scientific basis of global climate change tmospheric scientists in noaa claim that investing in better computing powers and capabilities may be exactly what is needed to resolve many of the uncertainties about the scientific evidence of global climate change that have been plaguing policymakers for many years now this initiative is also aimed at criticism about the effec tiveness of the us global change research program in coordinating interagency activities and setting research priorities for more information on science in the global climate change debate see crs issue brief ib89005 global climate change other information on us domestic regulatory policy and

hydrographic marine mapping and charting data marine scie nce and fisheries this split jurisdiction has occasionally d to confusion and debate about which committee has legal authority over the budget

committee has claimed jurisdiction over ocean coastal and great lakes research oar the two committees have shared jurisdiction over the national sea grant college program the commerce science and transportation committee of the senate has jurisdiction over legislation authorizing both noaa wet and dry progra ms however legislation is considered by different subcommittees along the same lines as the house as consequence of not having single organic act governing the entire agency several different pub lic laws authorize funding fo r noaa programs and they may be reauthorized in different years tabl 8 below lists those public laws whose authorizations and appropria tions for noaa programs are due to expire at the end of fy2002 or have already expired however the original law which

new accounting method for rd expend itures included in the fy2003 request changes former practices as follows operations and maintenance at rd facilities is funded by the orf facilities account planning and constructing new facilities at which rd may beconducted is funded by th pac construction account procurement of major quipment and instrumentation that may be used in rd programs is funded under pac systems acquisitions instrumentation and equipment used by individuals performing rd is funded by individual or f research programs and new aircraft and marine vessels used for noaa research are procured with pac funding under omao program support the rationale behind these accounting changes stems from the noaa budget offices determination that noaa facilities equipment and
