stalemate in the israelipalestinian peace process the memorandum culminated nine days of negotiations at the wye river conference center which were intended to resolve differences over implementation of prior agreements thereby enabling the parties to engage in final status talks on what are expected to be even more contentious issues jerusalem refugees settlements water borders and the nature of palestinian political entity the memorandum lists parallel incremental steps to be taken by each side over 12 weeks to facilitate completion of the implementation of the interim agreement on the west bank and gaza strip of september 28 1995 and agreements specified in notes for the record that accompanied the hebron protocol of january 17 1997 unfinished business from these earlier accords

elected in may 1996 does not accept the pncs vote as satisfying the commitment on january 22 1998 arafat attempted to be more precise by giving president clinton letter listing charter articles that the pncs april 1996 action had repealed however netanyahu insists that the pnc itself meet again to complete its work by being more specific security measures the interim agreement mandated palestinian police force of 30000 but that strength has been exceeded perhaps by as much as 10000 the agreement called for palestinian cooperation with israel to fight terrorism which israel has found deficient other provisions required israel to release palestinian prisoners in stages about 3000 palestinian prisoners remain in israeli custody the 1997 notes for the record reaffirmed israels

highlighted 2 see next section potential problems crs5 the continuing determination of opponents of the peace process to derail it implementation of security measures envisaged in the wye memorandum would mean 100 effort on the part of the palestinian authority to combat terrorism as israel and the united states have demanded it cannot however ensure complete effectiveness the parties reactions to terrorist incidents may indicate the extent to which they will let opponents of the peace process influence its progress and test their dedication to pursuing the process furthermore as with many diplomatic documents the wye memorandum itself contains potential pitfalls for example the statement about unilateral actions may not impede such behavior unilateral actions has been understood to refer especially to israeli settlement activity and to palestinian declaration of statehood shortly after signing the memorandum prime minister netanyahu declared that nothing in the memorandum affects israels right to expand settlements in the west bank he said we are building throughout the land of israel and in jerusalem and he specifically promised to build 2000 homes on the disputed har homajabal abu ghneim site in south east jerusalem work has begun to expand jewish settlement near hebron will israels action provoke palestinian protests and if so how will the palestinian authority react to them and to the construction meanwhile chairman arafat reiterated his right to declare palestinian state on may 4 1999 when the interim period expires how will israel react if he does the answers to these questions may pose problems for the peace process most deadlines included in earlier israelipalestinian agreements have not been met the time line attached to the memorandum is tight it codifies israels insistence on reciprocity whereby one partys act triggers the other partys act at each stage the process could break down the effective date of the memorandum already has been postponed to allow the israeli cabinet and knesset parliament time for ratification and because of israels doubts about the palestinians performance moreover the accord expects the rapid resolution of safe passage and seaport issues that have not been settled for three years and apparently could not be achieved during intensive talks at wye the memorandum defers to committee the issue of third israeli redeployment from the west bank but gives the committee deadline for its work netanyahu would like to limit the redeployment to 1 of territory but the palestinians expect much more finally by inserting an active us role in security matters the memorandum may produce only limited direct contacts between the parties and fail to rebuild trust issues for congress role of the cia president clinton personally mediated over 70 hours of the talks to achieve the wye memorandum because of the parties mutual distrust the united states agreed to undertake very active unprecedented role the united states is mentioned repeatedly in the security section of the memorandum central intelligence agency director george tenet was among its negotiators and most references to the united states are understood to create an unusually visible role for the cia some members of congress have expressed concern about this development and the senate select committee on intelligence will be holding hearings others assert that the agreement could not have been reached without the cia involvement and believe that the crs6 importance of the accord warrants it3 tenet argues that the cias role is consistent with its traditional mission4 the possible diversion of us intelligence resources from other important assignments to oversight of wye memorandum security measures also may generate concerns about the cias role us assurances us officials provided letters of assurance to the israeli government and reportedly to the palestinian authority affirming us policy to israel they pledged inter alia that the us commitment to israels security is ironclad that only israel can determine its own security needs and decide on satisfactory solutions that third israeli redeployment is for israel to implement not negotiate and that the us maintains that acceptable solutions can be found only through negotiations not unilateral acts5 the united states government appears to be responsible for the implementation of much of the wye memorandum if the administration is so committed to the success of its policy might it gloss over noncompliance possible us failure to perform to the satisfaction of either party may lead unintentionally to troubled relations aid at the signing ceremony president clinton said that he would consult with congress to design package of aid to help israel meet the security costs of redeployment and help the palestinian authority meet the economic costs of development this is in addition to technical and other assistance to the palestinians specified in the memorandum to help enable the palestinians to fulfill their security commitments secretary of state albright clarified that the united states would lead major donor effort to help develop the palestinian economy as well as seek to increase its own assistance6 heretofore congress has made aid to the palestinians conditional on their compliance with agreements with israel7 3

that the administration had papered over palestinian shortcomings for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98911
