0531107 executive summary in march to june 2005 oios conducted an audit of u nog mobility and hardship allowance the audit covered activities with total expenditure f us 48 million in 2003 and 2004 overall assessment oios assessed that the systems and procedures relat ing to the administration of the mobility hardship and nonremoval allowance as average act ivities by the human resources management service hrms and unog payroll unit were adequatel run and although the majority of key controls were being applied the application of cer tain important controls lacked consistency or effectiveness in order not to compromise the overa ll system of internal control timely corrective action by management is required mobility element the mobility allowance was paid to 44 staff in the years 2003 and 2004 due to the small number of cases all of them were reviewed and it was dete rmined that the computation was correct oios found several cases were staff members obtaine d mobility count even though they were assigned to duty station for less than one year in one case it was less than one month good reason or justification was on file as to why the s taff member was entitled to this such incorrect mobility counts may result in future overpayments on the other hand two cases were identified where staff members appeared to be eligible for bu t did not receive mobility element of mobility and hardship allowance oios recommended that by xception reporting from imis hrms review staff members for which mobility count was granted for an assignment of less than one year b staff members not granted mobility coun t for post incumbency of more than one year and c where eligible staff members meeting the cr iteria have not been granted mobility ensure compliance and make the appropriate corrections wh ere necessary hrms stated that they would request imis to provide exception reports but high lighted that the complexity of the features would require substantial development effort 3 hardship element the hardship allowance was paid to 234 staff in the years 2003 and 2004 the sample selected and reviewed for accuracy of computation was found to be correct imis currently does not initiate reliable correctio ns to payments for hardship allowance resulting from retroactive category changes of duty station as result the payroll unit needs to manually initiate the recalculation in the system this is timeconsuming exercise and open to the risk of error oios is pleased to note that this regression in imis will be automated unog confirmed that this is scheduled for implementation at unog i n august 2005 nonremoval element the nonremoval allowance was paid to 851 staff in the years 2003 and 2004 the sample selected and reviewed for accuracy of computation was found to be correct however problems were found in entering basic data on which the calculations we re based on number of errors and inconsistencies were noted w ith regard to the entry date to imis for reduction of the allowance after five years of serv ice at one duty station in 32 cases the non removal reduction date was absent creating risk t hat nonremoval allowance could continue beyond the fiveyear limit for further 58 cases the nonremoval reduction date entered was not clear andor obviously erroneous requiring further followup moreover oios found 31 cases totalling us 32000 for which recoveries may be re quired from staff members these cases need to be reviewed and appropriate action taken oios was pleased to note that unog payroll had alre ady conducted review based on snapshot of payments in september 2004 the work performed r esulted in request to hrms to review many cases where payments continued beyond five yea rs oios commends this initiative which mitigates the risks associated with internal contro l deficiencies in imis nonetheless the snapshot approach did not identify all the errors and misunderstandings with regard to the allowance and the system unog indicated that the payroll unit was undertakin g periodic reviews of nonremoval allowance payments internal control systems oios assessed that internal controls needed to be s trengthened in two cases oios found that the appropriate level of authority unog director of ad ministration had not been observed to approve extensions to the mobility and hardship all owance in oios view appropriate criteria had not been applied and we question the validity of th exception oios recommends that clear criteria be established consistent with other duty stations oios found almost 50 personnel actions where human resources officers approved their own entitlements this is serious weakness in intern controls and needs to be stopped with immediate affect approval should be assigned to an other officer oios recommends that imis be enhanced to ensure that individuals are prevented f rom approving their own personnel actions unog agreed and will seek the support of the imis t eam

annex 1 list of staff members without nonremoval reduction date annex 2 list of staff members with nonevident or erroneous nonremoval reduction date annex 3 list of possible recovery cases i introduction 1 from march to june 2005 oios conducted an audit of unog mobility and hardship allowance mha the audit was conducted in accorda nce with the international standards for the professional practice of internal auditing 2 the mobility and hardship allowance is an i ncentive to mobility and to compensate for hardship and nonremoval of personal effects and ho usehold goods staff rules 10322 and 20311 as well as stai20002 mobility hardship and nonremoval as amended by stai20019 govern the administration of the allow ance 3 the amount of mha payable to each eligible staff member is function of his or her placement on threedimension matrix where the har dship element increases in order of difficulty the mobility element varies according t the number of assignments and the length of service at one duty station the nonremoval elemen t varies according to whether the staff member is entitled to and opts for full removal of household goods the hardship element depends on the assigned duty station category as fined by international civil service commission 4 the unog human resources management service hrms as part of the unog division of administration is responsible for admi nistering staff members of several entities in geneva as well as staff members of these organi zations in the field imis as the administrative support system is also handling mha entitlement in hrpayroll modules 5 the findings and recommendations contained in this draft audit report have been discussed with the officials responsible for the au dited activities during discussions and briefings held throughout the audit ii audit objectives 6 the main objective of the audit was to asse ss the administration of the mobility hardship and nonremoval allowance at unog and more specifi cally to evaluate the adequacy effectiveness and efficiency of internal controls evaluate whether adequate guidance and procedures re in place determine the reliability and integrity of the data available from imis ensure compliance with regulations rules polic ies and administrative procedures iii audit scope and methodology 7 the review focused on the administration an d payment of mobility hardship and non removal elements of the allowance covering the peri od of 1 january 2003 to 31 december 2004 with disbursements of us 48 million paid to appro ximately 900 staff members from information made available oios analysed all payme nts made to staff and followedup on unusual or unexpected trends in payments that were identified oios took assurance from the work done by the payroll unit in unog financial res ources management service frms 2 where review had already been conducted of some lements of the allowance this enabled oios to reduce the size of the sample to be tested and focus on the higher risk areas 8 the audit activities included review and assessment of internal control systems interviews with staff analysis of applicable data and review of the available documents and other relevant records iv audit findings and recommendations mobility element accuracy of mobility element calculation 9 about us 03 million was paid under the mo bility element of the allowance to 44 staff in the years 2003 and 2004 due to the small number f staff in receipt of the allowance all cases were reviewed for accuracy of computation of the mo bility element the amounts were correct in all cases b assignment length qualifying for mobility count in imis 10 the integrated management information syst em imis does not automatically record whether an assignment is included in the mobility c ount each post incumbency has to be flagged as eligible for mobility or not by the responsible human resources assistantofficer 11 oios found seven cases were staff members index numbers 411708 516029 544698 573034 687059 816935 and 912158 obtained mobi lity count even though they were assigned to duty station for less than one year in one ca it was less than one month although they were not yet eligible for mobility this count affe cts future mobility calculations oios appreciates with reference to stai20002 dated 1 0 march 2000 that if staff member is assigned to duty station for period of one year or longer which is subsequently reduced at the initiative of the organization to less than one yea r this service may be counted as an assignment for mobility count on an exceptional basis nonethe less for the above cases oios found good reason or justification on file why they were entit led to mobility for these assignments 12 in addition oios found two cases index n umbers 106770 and 550037 where the staff members met the mobility requirement ie were rving in duty station classified to in their second assignment and had the requirement of five years continuing service and should therefore be eligible for mobility in imis mobil ity count was granted for these assignments yet the staff members did not receive the mobility elem ent of mha the staff member with index number 106770 had served in geneva for almost three years and this had not been recognized in the mobility count recommendation head2right the unog human resources management service should obtain exception reports from imis and review cases where the mobility count was granted for staff member assigned to du ty station for less than one year b the mobility count was not grant ed for post 3 incumbency of more than one year and c the mobil ity element had not been granted to staff members meeting the condition s outlined in section 22 of stai200022 to ensure compliance and make appropriate corrections if mobility count has be exceptionally granted this should be documented and file accordin gly ae2005311001 13 the unog division of administration has accepted th recommendation and indicated that it would submit formal request to imis devel opment team in new york to add such reporting functionality in imis hrms highlighted t hat the complexity of the features would require substantial development effort in oios opinion if the imis team in new york does not give priority to the request such reports can also be produced locally from imis data using the professional help of the imis team at unog b hardship element accuracy of hardship element calculation 14 about us 24 million was paid under the h ardship element of the allowance to 234 staff in the years 2003 and 2004 in addition to staff m embers in receipt of both the mobility and hardship elements of the allowance oios reviewed 1 7 staff members to whom waiver an exception in imis had been granted by hrms from the sample selected oios reviewed the accuracy of the computations and the amounts paid f or the hardship element the amounts were correct b changes in duty station category and retroactiv hardship element calculation 15 imis currently does not initiate reliable corrections to payments for hardship allowance resulting from retroactive category changes to the duty station for example when duty station changes retroactively from b to c the payroll unit needs to manually initiate the recalculation in the system of the amount payable this is time co nsuming exercise and open to the risk of error oios understands from discussions with hrms and frm s that this regression in imis has been fixed and the recalculation will be automated the enhancement to the system is scheduled be rolled out to unog in august 2005 c nonremoval element accuracy of nonremoval element calculation 16 about us 22 million was paid under the n onremoval element of the allowance to 851 staff for the years 2003 and 2004 in addition to cases receiving mobility andor hardship elements together with nonremoval element oios sa mpled 24 staff members under the responsibility of hrms from the sample selected oi reviewed the accuracy of computations of the nonremoval element the amounts were correc t 4 b date entry to imis for reduction after five yea rs of service at one duty station 17 oios received report on changes made in imis to staff members nonremoval reduction dates this report covered 923 staff memb ers recorded in unogs imis database oios noted several errors in the input of the nonr emoval reduction date oios found 32 cases where the field in imis was empty the list is incl uded as annex 1 18 previously the reduction date was not ma ndatory data field but since 2005 oios was informed that the system has been enhanced in 2005 and that the nonremoval reduction date is now mandatory in imis and if not entered it gives an error message the system however does not validate the date so mistakes are not detected oios noted that the system had accepted dates ranging from 1 january 1800 to 1 june 3005 19 based on review of sample of transacti ons the application of fiveyear limit is not fully clear stai200022 states that the payment of the nonremoval element shall be limited to period of five years at one duty station in some cases the reduction date was calculated as five years from each reappointment in others it was cou nted from the initial appointment although the eligibility and payments of the nonremoval element started at later date in few cases the nonremoval reduction date was the same as the elig ibility date for the nonremoval element in total oios found 58 cases where the nonremoval red uction date entered was not clear or the date was erroneous these 58 cases identified are listed in annex 2 20 although the amounts involved are insignif icant oios found that the reduction date was not consistently applied some staff members dealin g with imis data entry if the entry date was 1 january 2000 recorded the reduction date which should be five years from entry date as 31 december 2004 others as 1 january 2005 to ensure consistency hrms should give clear instructions to staff dealing with mha on what is t he appropriate date and how to correctly complete the information required in imis oios wou ld suggest that the guidance prepared by the secretariat of the economic commission for afri ca eca could serve as good practice 21 oios found 31 cases where the nonremoval element appeared to have been paid beyond five years of service without an exception being gr anted recoveries of the apparent overpayment with reference to the nonremoval element totalling some us 32000 should be considered the list of these cases is attached as annex 3 22 for the nonremoval element oios was conc erned to find such large number of questionable cases 13 per cent of the 923 cases ios appreciates that unog payroll had conducted check of the nonremoval allowance base d on snapshot of payments in september 2004 the work performed resulted in request to h rms to review many cases where the payments were continued beyond five years of the in itial appointment to the duty station oios commends this initiative which mitigates the risks associated with internal control deficiencies in imis however oios observed snapshot approac h did not identify all the errors and misunderstandings with regard to the allowance the unog division of administration indicated that the payroll unit was undertaking periodic revi ews of nonremoval allowance payments 5 recommendations head2right the unog division of administration should submit t he nonremoval element cases listed in annexes 1 to 3 to the respo nsible human resource officers for review and appropriate action if necessary division of administration should initiate recoveri of about us 32000 relating to overpayments made ae200531100 2 head2right the unog division of administration should conduct periodic reviews of nonremoval and mobility element reducti on dates as recorded in imis using for example exception repor ts generated from imis to reduce the risk of erroneous payments with regard to the allowance ae2005311003 23 the unog division of administration agreed with rec ommendation 2 and hrms has initiated review of the listed cases unog accept ed recommendation 3 and human resources officers have been requested to periodically check reduction dates using reports from imis as such exception reports are not readily available in imis oios recommends using the help of the imis team at unog in generating them d exceptions for reduction of entitlement after fi ve years of service at one duty station 24 according to stai20002 after five years of service at one duty station the mobility allowance will be reduced and the payment of the nremoval element will be discontinued exceptionally payment of the mobility element may continue at the same rate for further one year and nonremoval may be extended for further two years upon certification by the unog director of administration oios found two cases wh ere the certification process was not properly applied in one case the officerincharge of hrms approved an exception via email for staff member with index number 919716 and in another human resources officer approved the exception to mobility element by writi ng request approved and signing printout of the staff members index number 724768 email r equest to ensure consistency in the administration of entitlements the unog director f administration should ensure that exceptions be only granted by the correct authority 25 oios was not fully satisfied with the crit eria applied by unog for these two cases in granting an exception it was simply on the basis t hat the staff members had tried to be mobile by applying for posts outside their current duty stati on while oios appreciates that the limitation of five years is intended to encourage mobility parag raphs 28 and 43 of stai20002 of 10 march 2000 on mobility and hardship clearly spell out the circumstances for which the maximum five years could be extended the principle is to grant an exception when it is the organization that requires the staff member to remain longer at dut station the fact that staff members may have tried to move but were unsuccessful is not v alid criterion on which to grant an exception these two cases should be reviewed by the unog dire ctor of administration and if not properly justified action should be taken to recov er the amounts incorrectly paid estimated some us 7300 26 for the future to ensure consistency in t he application of exceptions hrms after discussion and clarification with the office of hum an resources management should establish 6 clear criteria in compliance with stai20002 for granting exceptions to mobility and non removal element payments beyond five years moreove r to improve the service provided to staff members oios would suggest that reminder be issu ed to staff of the reduction or discontinuation of mobility and nonremoval element s of mha similar to the present practice with rental subsidy entitlement recommendations head2right the unog division of administration should review t he exceptions granted to staff members index numbers 919716 and 724768 to determine whether they were in compliance with sta i20002 if found not in compliance the allowance incorrectly paid estimated some us 7300 should be recovered ae2005311004 head2right the unog division of administration should ensure t hat in the future any exceptions for time limits set for mobility and nonremoval elements of mobility and hardship allowance are bas ed on consistent written criteria and approved by the correct author ity in compliance with stai20002 ae2005311005 head2right the unog division of administration should inform ll staff members of the forthcoming discontinuation of their nonrem oval element and reduction of mobility element of the mobility and h ardship allowance so that those eligible for extension can apply for an exception ae2005311006 27 the unog division of administration has agreed with recommendation 4 and indicated that corrective action will be initiated hrms conc urred with recommendation 5 and will ensure that in future all exception cases will be presente d for approval to the director division of administration 28 the unog division of administration did not agree w ith recommendation 6 stating that it is not logical to inform staff inconsistently on the discontinuation of entitlements and that the associated workload cannot be easily absorbed oios appreciates unogs comments but would highlight that process of informing staff f the discontinuation of entitlements has already been initiated for rental subsidy oios wou ld therefore encourage unog to continue to enhance its service to staff members to include oth er entitlements such as mobility and hardship as well as dependency allowances in oios opinion the additional workload would be minimal if the present procedure used for rental subsidy be adopted whereby this information is emailed with electronic payslip with regards to the discon tinuationreduction of nonremoval and mobility elements such information if standard pra ctise in several other duty stations internal controls 29 during the audit oios noted that personn action pa to grant mobility was approved by the beneficiary as result oios ran query i n imis and found 46 cases where human resources staff members had approved their own pas this is serious weakness in internal controls and should be stopped with immediate effe ct the approval of human resources officers pas should be delegated to another office r with the same authority to approve 7 documents in imis beneficiary should not approve hisher own pa 30 oios would also suggest that unog request an enhancement to imis that prevents individuals from certifying or approving their own entitlements recommendations head2right the unog division of administration should ensure t hat strong internal controls are established over the approvin g of human resources officers personnel actions this respons ibility should be delegated to another officer ae2005311007 head2right the unog division of administration should request an enhancement to the integrated management informatio n system to ensure that individuals are prevented from certifyi ng and approving their own personnel actions ae2005311008 31 hrms agrees with recommendation 7 and stated that i t is actually one of the basic principles of the functioning of hrms that hrms sta ff should not review process or approve their own entitlements or perform any other actions relating to their own cases hrms states that the 46 cases cited were related to the initial inpu t of data to imis oios reviewed the cases mentioned above and would like to highlight that t least 17 of the pas in question were entered in 2002 or later and imis release 2 for staff entit lements was implemented at unog in october 1998 32 hrms also agreed with recommendation 8 and stated t hat the imis team would formulate request to the imis team at unhq unog brought up valid concern that it would be necessary to take account of the situation of small departments which have only one approving officer oios appreciates unogs concerns but such cases re exceptions and it is the responsibility of user departments to ensure adequa procedures and internal controls are in place which should not allow individuals to approv their own entitlements v acknowledgement 33 i wish to express my appreciation for the assistance and cooperation extended to the
