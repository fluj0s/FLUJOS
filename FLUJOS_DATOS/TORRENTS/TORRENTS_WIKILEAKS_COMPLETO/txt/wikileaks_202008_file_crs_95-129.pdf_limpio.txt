being cigarette tobacco types these crops are particularly important to the agriculture of north carolina where fluecured is grown and kentucky where burley is grown together these two states produce 66 of the total us tobacco crop the federal tobacco price support program was designed to support and stabilize prices for farmers it operated through combination of mandatory marketing quotas and nonrecourse loans marketing quotas limit the amount of tob acco each farmer could sell which indirectly raised market prices the loan program established guaranteed minimum prices the law required that the loan pr ogram operate at net cost to the federal government apart from yeartoyear budget impacts nonetcost provisions of the law were intended to assure that all loan pr incipal plus interest would be recovered1 the 2004 tobacco crop was the last crop eligible for federal support as the program was terminated by pl 108357 title vi the fa ir and equitable tobacco reform act of 2004 this

first created in the 1930s along with other commodity support programs existed only for th economic benefit of farmers it was created for the purpose of supporting the in come and stabilizing the price of tobacco received by farmers by law the choice of whether or not federal support would be provided was determined by growers in referendum held every three years when producers approved federal price s upport for tobacco they became subject to marketing quotas marketing quota was supply control mechanism that indirectlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95129crs3 2 the term nonrecourse means that in cases of default additional recourse is taken against borrowers beyond taking ownership of the collate ral the collateral is accepted as full settlement of the debtincreased market prices at the same time the federal government was required to guarantee prices at least as high as the level specified in the law legislative authority the first commodity price support legisla tion was the agricultural adjustment act of 1933 various problems with this and subse quent legislation ultima tely led to adoption of the agricultural adjustment act of 1938 pl 75430 this permanent law established supply control and price support program for tobacco that even as amended remained much the same the legal authority and requirements for the federal tobacco program were contained in 7 usc 13111316 and 7 usc 1445 administering agency program administrative operations were carried out by the us department of agricultures usda farm service agency fsa annual administrative costs were estimated at about 24 million in fy2004 for tob acco price support operations this cost covered primarily salaries for some headquarters pers onnel and staff time devoted to the tobacco program in about 600 county offi ces price support operations nonrecourse loans were financed by usdas commodity credit corporation ccc the ccc obtained needed money by borrowing from th us treasury which had to be repaid with interest program operation the federal tobacco price support program limited and stab ilized the quantity of tobacco produced and marketed by farmers this was achieved through marketing quotas in addition minimum market prices were guaranteed to farmers through ccc nonrecourse loans2 marketing quotas when tobacco quota owners vot ed in favor of price supports they were at the same time agreeing to accept government restrictions on the amount of tobacco they could market the nati onal marketing quota was the amount judged sufficient to meet domestic and export mand but at price above the government support price each farms quota was assigned to the land so the right to produce and market specified quantity of tobacco resided with the owner of the land farmer could only begin to grow tobacco by purchasing or renting land that had quota by limiting the supply of tobacco the market price was increased total farm revenue was raised because consumption did not decline enough to offset the price incr ease in this way farm income was supposed to be supported thr ough artificially high market prices rather than through direct government payments this differed from other commodity support programs that utilized direct payments rath er than marketing quotas as the principal subsidy mechanismhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95129crs4 loans marketing quotas were not always totally effective at supporting market prices given the numerous variables th at affect tobacco supply and demand consequently federal suppor t prices were guaranteed through the mechanism of nonrecourse loans available on each farmers ma rketed crop the loan price for each type of tobacco was announced each year by the us da using the formula specified in the law to calculate loan levels the national loan price on 2004 crops fluecured tobacco was 169 per pound the burley loan price was 1873 at the auction sale barn each lot of tobacco went to the highest bidder unless that bid did not exceed the governments loan price in such cases the farmer was paid the loan price by cooperative with mone borrowed from the ccc the tobacco was consigned to the cooperative known as pr ice stabilization coopera tive which redried packed and stored the tobacco as collateral for ccc the cooperative acting as an agent for the ccc later sold the tobacco with the proceeds going to repay the loan plus interest by 2004 about 80 of tobacco was sold under contract but leaf that did not meet specifications could be taken to auction where it might go into the loan program nonetcost and marketing assessments under the threat of legislative dissolution of the program by its opponents congress passed the nonetcost tobacco program act in 1982 pl 97218 this gislation imposed an assessment on every pound of tobacco marketed including impor ted tobacco since 1994 the nonetcost assessment on 2004 crop fluec ured was 10 per pound the burley assessment was 2 growers and buyers each paid half of th nonetcost assessment the nonetcost assessment funds were deposited in an escrow account that was held to reimburse the government for any financia l losses resulting from tobacco loan operations losses occurred when cooperative sold loan collatera l tobacco at price insufficient to cover the loan principal plus interest until its gal authority expired budget deficit reduction assessment called ma rketing assessment of 1 of the support price was collected on every pound of tobacco marketed from 1990 through 1997 market loss payments and disaster assistance in response to low commodity prices in 1999 2000 and 2001 cong ress authorized market loss payments to producers of grains cotton oilseeds tob acco dairy and severa l other crops pl 106 78 pl 106224 and pl 10725 tobacco growers were paid about 1 per pound for diminished quotas receiving direct pa yments of 328 in fy2000 and 340 million plus and 129 million in fy2001 agricultural disast er assistance legislation in 2003 pl 1087 provided another 51 million to tobacco producers these payments were not constrained by the nonetcost provisions of the tobacco loan program additionally 28 million was approved for tobacco on warehouse auction floors damaged by flooding from hurricane floyd in 1999 experience passage of the nonetcost tobacco program act made significant change in federal price support policy shifting the financial burden for tobacco program losses from the federal government to growers enc ouraged reduction in support prices which was done by legislation in 1985 initially this stopped the decline in us tobacco leaf exports however the growing competitiveness of foreign tobacco continued to erode the us share of export markets foreign tobacco had captured 45 of the domestic cigarette manufacturing market when congress enacted domestic content requirement thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95129crs5 domestic content requirement took effect in 1994 and limited cigarettes to 25 foreign content under new international trading rules the domestic content requirement was replaced in september 1995 with tariffrate quota which was less restrictive than the previous domestic content requirement in 2004

iticism that the tobacco loan program was taxpayer subsidy for tob acco farmers the budgetary impact of the tobacco loan program was determined primarily by loan outlays new loans made and loan recoveries repayment of old loans in any given year new loan outlays might be more or less than recoveries from the repayment of old loans since tobacco is typically stored for extended periods it could be several ears before the loan inventor was sold the law required that any losses of loan princi pal and interest be repaid from the nonetcost account which was funded from assessments on growers and buyers of leaf tobacco this requirement did not apply to 1999 crop loan inventories that congress authorized be transferred to the ccc without the action being charged against the

outlays brought criticism there were other critics of the tobacco pr ogram free market advocates pointed to the competitive disadvantages caused by the program economists believed that without marketing quotas and price support loans farmers would produce more tobacco which would be sold at lower prices the lower prices would lead to increased exports and more domestic production would be used in usmanufactured cigarettes displacing some of the imported tobacco some health advocates said the federal government should not be supporting tobacco farm income nd should get out of the
