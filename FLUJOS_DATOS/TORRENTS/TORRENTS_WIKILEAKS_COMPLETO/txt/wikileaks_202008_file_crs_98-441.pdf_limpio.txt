12 2001 is globalization the force behind recent poor us wage performance an analysis craig k elwell specialist in econometrics government and finance division summary the last 25 years have seen rapid expansion of trade in goods and assets and general rise of economic interdependence across the world economy globalization is the popular term given to this ongoing process concurrent with this rising level of trade has been significant slowdown in the pace of us real wage growth and substantial increase in wage inequality between skilled and lessskilled workers are the trade and wage trends linked this report suggests that there is likely little causality running from rising level of trade to poor domestic wage performance slow average wage growth is fully and credibly linked to poor productivity growth small share of rising wage inequality can be linked to trade but the great bulk of this trend is probably more soundly rooted in rising relative demand for skill growing out of changed pattern of technological change this report will not be updated introduction the world economy in the postwar era has become increasingly globalized with vast expansion of trade in goods and assets and increased interdependen ce among trading nations the pace of this process has clearly accelerated in the last twentyfive years in the united states the real volume of trade has grown twice as fast as real output bringing total trade exports plus imports from about 10 to over 27 of gdp in 1999 the united states has been much involved in this process of globalization both as leader securing successive rounds of trade liberalization and as an active participant in world trade as adam smith first made clear in 1776 and as reiterated by successive generations of economists since then expansion of the level of trade and increased interdependence is an enriching process whereby an enlarged scope for realizing gains from trade raises economic efficiency and elevates the living standard of the average citizen however the free market as the econ omist joseph schumpeter noted is force for creative destruction markets create wealth by continually reallocating resources to more efficienthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98441crs2 1 for further discussion of these trends see murphy kevin m changes in wage structure in the 1980s how can we explain them memo university of chicago 1992 and

reallocation must also destroy inefficient uses of resources deteriorating the economic circumstances of those whose job or business is eliminated or downgraded critical dimension of successful market economy is how well it manages the achievement of higher efficiency and the adjustment of those hurt by these dynamic wealthcreating forces much popular and political debate about globalization however is heavily shaded with the image of rising international trade particularly with lowwage developing economies as threat to the us workers economic wellbeing threat that such expansion may be more destructive than creative there is concern that expanding trade erodes the wages of american workers two recent trends in us wage behavior coincident with rising globalization reinforce this suspicion one there has been significant slowdown in the rate of advance of worker real wages for example between 1979 and 1999 real hourly compensation in the business sector had relatively slow commutative increase of 183 two there has been marked increase in the inequality of the distribution of wages between skilled and lessskilled workers as measured by education levels for example the difference between the earnings of the college educated and those with high school education was estimated in 1995 to have risen 18 between 1973 and 19941 trade can have strong effects good and bad on worker wages the plight of the worker adversely affected by imports comes quickly to mind on the other hand workers in industries that export benefit from expanding trade what is perhaps less well understood is that becaus all workers are also consumers they will benefit from the expanded market choices and lower product prices that trade provides there is necessary reason to assume that the overall effect of trade on workers is bad but sound economic analysis also suggests that trade even as it raises overall wellbeing can also sharply alter the distribution of income among the several factors of production including labor the rest of this report attempts to evaluate critically whether an increasing level of trade and interdep endence has played role in the slow growth of the real wages of american workers and whether that process of globalization has made the distribution of worker wages more unequal globalization and average us wages effect of relative labor abundance we consider first whether an expanding level of trade is responsible for slow average real wage growth economic theory suggests that increased trade while making the overall economy better off can have strong effects on the distribution of income among factors of production that theory points to the possibility that if labor is relatively more abundant in the rest of the world than at home an expansion of trade with the rest of the world could increase the effective supply of workers to the us economy and reduce worker wages relative to rewards paid to other factors of production most importantly capital since trade has clearly raised the real living standard of the overall economy general decline in the real wage of us workershttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98441crs3 2 see us department of

small hiccup brookings papers on economic activity vol 2 washington brookings institution 1993would have to mean that labors share of the economic pie has shrunk this has not occurred however labors share of national income shows significant trend up or down in the postwar era the share of worker compensation in national income was 712 in 1973 and 711 in 1999 effect of the terms of trade real living standards depend not only on workers share of domestic production but also on their ability to exchange that output for foreign output ie to realize gains from trade that gain can be eroded if import prices rise faster than home prices causing fall in the real purchasing power of any given level or share of national income the ratio of us export prices to import prices the terms of trade is measure of changes in the home economys share of the gains from trade it is plausible that expanding trade in world economy increasingly populated with technologically capable foreign producers could have put downward pressure on us export prices reduced the terms of trade and lowered the real wages of workers the data do not support that scenario however the terms of trade did fall in the 1970s but the commutative effect on real income was relatively small less than 2 decline over the decade through the 1980s and the 1990s the us terms of trade have slowly risen tending to increase worker real wages rather than erode them2 effect of the trade deficit what about our persistent large trade deficits over the last 16 years have they dampened worker wage growth first trade deficits are not symptom of globalization and rising level of trade rather they are mainly consequence of domestic macroeconomic behavior such as high rate of domestic investment relative to domestic saving that have pushed domestic spending beyond domestic production requiring net inflow of goods trade deficit to sustain the excess domestic spending as such these trade deficits do not represent reduction in domestic output nor reduction in the demand for labor second even if the trade deficits had reduced domestic output the size of those trade deficits and the potential scale of the effect on domestic labor markets is far too small to explain the deterioration of americ an real wages3 evidence from us multinationals the recent behavior of us multinational manufacturing companies gives some added confirmation that there has not been any sharp swing in the demand for labor away from domestic sources and toward foreign sources it is estimated that us multinational firms account for about half of all domestic manufacturing employment making them good barometers of trends in the tradable goods sector particularly if those trends are reflective of changing economic attractiveness of different countries as locations for production if lowwage countries provide significant cost advantage then we would expect to see shift of employmen t from the domestic parent to these foreign affiliates the data reveal however that multinational manufacturing employment has fallen both at home and abroad between 1977 and 1993 domestic employment in these firms fell about 21 or about 26 million jobs while employment in their plants in the rest of the world fell 17 or about 830000 jobs if wehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98441crs4 4 for these data and discussion of this phenomenon see lawrencerobert z

brookings institution washington 1998 6 see cline william r trade and wage inequality institute for international economics continuedlook at manufacturing affiliates in only developing countries employment did increase about 5 or about 85000 jobs but if mexico is excluded from this group employment in affiliates in developing countries declined about 8 or about 100000 jobs this implies that the multinationals us workers have maintained their relative productivity consequently there is great out rush of us multinational firms to increase employment in their lowwage affiliates at the expense of their domestic counterparts4 slow productivity growth if rising level of trade is not the culprit behind slight real wage growth what is we know that wages are basically function of how productive workers are high levels of productivity output per worker are associated with high wages and rapid productivity growth is associated with rapid wage growth therefore it is highly credible that the sharp slowdown in average productivity growth since the early 1970s in the united states is the cause of slow wage growth over the same period measures of us worker compensation appropriately deflated using price index for the goods workers produce gives measure of real compensation that moves in step with the trend path for productivity over the last 25 years in other words workers share of the economic pie is not getting smaller the pie is just not growing as fast as it once did undersco ring the importance of productivity growth for wage growth more rapid productivity advance evident since 1997 has been associated with more rapid growth of real compensation5 globalization and wage inequality the effect of relative supplies of labor on wage inequality even if expanding international trade has not adversely affected the average level of wages it can still have distorting effect on the distribution of wages among workers labor is not homogeneous resource and market forces including trade can help one class of worker while hurting another in recent years wages have been steadily skewed in favor of high skilled workers relative to lowskilled workers it is conceptually possible that expanding trade particularly with countries that have relative abundance of lowskilled workers will tend to increase the effective supply of lowskilled workers available to the us economy working to put downward pressure on the wages of lowskilled workers in america other forces unrelated to trade could give the same outcome however for example strong general increase in the demand for skilled workers presumably growing out of the evolving pattern of final demand increased demand for skill intensive products and the nature of technological change the productive process requires higher and higher inputs of skill what does the evidence show this remains an area of some contention yet the weight of evidence from most careful studies suggests that trade has been minor factor contributing to rising wage inequality causing perhaps 5 to 15 of the observed rise in wage inequality6httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98441crs5 6 continued washington dc 1997 and borjas george

issue critical bit of evidence regarding trades effect on the distribution of wages is the behavior of the prices at which goods trade foreign workers do not compete with home workers directly but indirectly through the price of the goods they produce if foreign lowwage workers provide an efficiency advantage over domestic workers then that advantage must through trade manifest itself as lower price of the foreign goods in the home market reduced profitability of the domestic industry that competes with the low price import induces reallocation of resources toward more profitable skillintensive applications and general decrease in the demand for and wage of domestic lowskil led workers in this chain of causation the critical factor is not the volume of trade but rather traded goods prices this leaves us with the empirical question have the prices of import competing goods that use lows killed workers intensively fallen relative to the price of goods that use high skilled workers intensively with appropriate deference to data problems relative prices have not moved in pattern consistent with the conjecture that trade has adversely affected lowskilled domestic workers7 in some cases there is evidence that this critical price ratio has moved in the opposite direction in direction consistent with trade helping lowskilled workers relative to highskilled workers reasons for trades limited effect on wage inequality that globalization has so far had relatively minor effect on the level and distribution of us worker wages is perhaps less surprising if one considers that despite the sizable growth of trade with low wage developing countries such trade still remains relatively minor component of total us trade and particularly small when compared to the total size of the us economy imports from countries where wages are less than 50 of us wages was equal to 26 of gdp in 1990 up only slightly from 18 in 19608 by and large for the united states the great bulk of trade in manufactures is with other highwage economies it has been estimated that in 1990 the tradeweighted average hourly manufacturing wage of us trade partners was 88 of that in the united states not large enough difference to cause the observed change in wage inequality9 thus trades impact on the domestic labor market can also be expected to be small we should also note that the data on us multinationals employment changes in recent years discussed in the previous section are also consistent with the notion that there has been differential shift of employment toward lowskilled foreign workers and away from lowskilled domestic workers an upper bound for trades effect on wage inequality of course as trade with developing countries grows so might its contribution to wage inequality economic analysis suggests however that there may be an upper bound to this potential effect andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98441crs6 10 see krugman paul growing world trade causes and consequences brookings papers on economic activity 1 1995 11 seegrilliches zvi capitalskill complementarity review of economics and statistics no465 1967 p51that it could be reached fairly quickly as the cost differences between home and foreign production widen it is credible that condition of complete specialization might be reached after only relatively small price disadvantage appears that is the united states would find it most efficient to stop producing the import competing goods as increased specialization leads to trade in noncompeting sectors if there is domestic industry that uses lowskilled labor intensively in the production of tradeable goods there can be downward pressure on us wages caused by trade with developing countries10 it is also important to be mindful that trade can also set in motion other forces that can have favorable effect on all domestic workers for example economies of scale can be more fully realized through expanding trade further trade may heighten competition and raise efficiency such forces may be strong enough to allow all factors of production to see their real return rise what is causing wage inequality many economists argue that biased technological change likely is the primary cause of rising us wage inequality modern production techniques have generally raised the demand for skill in the labor market in effect skill is suspected of becoming more complementary to capital and lessskill more of substitute for capital thus the process of capital accumulation and technological change will tend to lower the wage of lowskilled labor11 other minor causes might be immigration deunionization and falling real minimum wage so far the evidence does not give full picture of the nature and extent of this process conclusion and policy implications the analysis and evidence presented in this report suggest that globaliz ation is unlikely to have played substantial role in causing recent slow real wage growth and increased wage inequality in the us economy the implication for the congressional policymaker is that these negative wage trends might now be seen as less of an encumbrance to the pursuit of trade liberalization measures that offer significant economic benefit to the american and world economies the argument made here is not that some domestic workers have not or will not be hurt by globalization the complete story is that expanding trade creates and destroys jobs just as other market forces do ie technological change shifting consumer tastes trade will tend to create jobs in industries that are relatively more efficient and destroy jobs in industries that are relatively less efficient this analysis suggests that the policy challenge as with other disruptive market forces is facilitating the quick and equitable adjustment of workers hurt by trade such as compensation for lost earnings and incentives for retraining and relocation the total gains are large enough to make everyone better off
