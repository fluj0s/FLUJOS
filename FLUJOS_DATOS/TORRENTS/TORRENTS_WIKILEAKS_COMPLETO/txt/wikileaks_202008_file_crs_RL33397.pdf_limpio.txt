senate bill would cover cer tain earmarks in appropria tions authorization and revenue measures but the definition of earmark provided in the bill might limit its coverage the house bill would focus on certain earmarks as defined by the bill associated with only general appropriations bills most of the appropriations bills considered by the congress are general appropriations bills the senate bill also provides procedure designed to facilitate the removal of new provisions added in conf erence reports under curre nt rules and practices the senate must reject or recommit to conference

measures are under the jurisdiction of the senate and house committees on appropriations whereas authorization meas ures are under the jurisdiction of various legislative committees most congressional committees such as the senate committees on environment and public works and armed services and the house committees on transportation and infrastructure and armed services have one or more authoriz ation measures under their ju risdiction revenue measures are under the jurisdiction of the sena committee on finance and the house committee on ways and means earmarks are not currently defined in w or congressional rule nor is there single common understanding of the term earmark accepted by all prac titioners and observers of the federal budget process likewise there is universal standard earmarking practice among revenue bills aut horization bills and appropriations bills or even among individual appropriations bills for some appropriations billshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33397crs2 2

refer in pa rt to funding allocations at level of specificity below certain spending level in contrast special tax relief in revenue bills for selected beneficiaries may establish narrow eligibility criteria that will apply only to the selected beneficiaries referred to in this report as limited tax benefit earmarks associated with appropriations bills however defined generally set aside funds within specific account in regular or s upplemental appropriations bill funding for departments and large agencies is distri buted among several accounts each account is typically provi ded in single unnum bered paragraph of an appropriations bill and in cludes funding for similar prog rams projects or items such as research and development account or salaries and expenses account for smaller agencies single account may fund all of the agencys activities the appropriations bills genera lly provide lumpsum appropriation for each account and earmarks are distributed within some of the accounts although the appropriations bill provides the funding in most cases in few cases they do not in these instances the appropriations bill allocates previously enacted funding for specifi c earmarks eg funding fo r federal facilities under the general services administration2 certain authorization bills provide funding for specified earmarks for example pl 109593 reauthorizing federal surface transportation programs provided funding for numerous specified highwa and mass transit projects authorization bills may also authoriz subsequent funding in appropriations bills for specified earmarks in such cases the appropriations committees generally select the previously authorized projects to be funded and provi the funding level4 for example water resources deve lopment acts authorize subsequent appropriations for specific civilian water pr ojects conducted by the us army corps of engineers5 funding is then provided for lected projects in the annual energy and water development regular appropriations billshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33397crs3 6 us government accountability office principles of federal appropriations law vol ii second edition gaoogc9213 washi ngton

include businesses corporations institutions or organizations earmarks may be provided in the form of bill language or report language bill language refers to the text of bills amendments and bills included in conference reports conference report provides the text of the bill as agreed to in conference if enacted this text become s law and has statutory force report language refers to congressional committee reports explaining measure as reported and joint explanatory statements these statements explain the agreements reached in conference and are attached to the conference reports report language does not become w and has direct statutor force unless required by law it explains congressional intent for the enacted bill most earmarks associated with appropriations measures are in the form of report language appropriators provide lumps um appropriations ge nerally with the understanding that the agencies will follo w their detailed budget plans submitted to congress referred to as justification ma terials regarding each account as well as any changes to the plans included in the congressional committee reports such as earmarks as the government accountability office explains an agency that fails to keep faith with the congress may find its next appropriation reduced or limited by lineitem restrictions6 such restrictions limit the flexibility of an agency to reallocate funds within an account to respond to changing or unforeseen circumstances earmarks may be initiated by congress as well as the ad ministration for example the administrations fy2006 budg et requests included some earmarks under programs that were funde d in the department of the interior environment and related agencies appropriations act 2006 administration funding requests for

adopted committee amendment in the na ture of substitute combining the provisions in s 2349 and s 2128 the lobbying transparency and accountability act of 2005 which had been reported by the senate

on house administration rules government reform and standards of offici conduct all of which completed action on their portions of the bill the first four committees reported portions of the bill under their jurisdicti on in some cases with amendments the committee on standards of official conduct was discharged from consideration of its portion of the bill the earmark and ssociated provisions of the bill are under the jurisdiction of the house committee on rules which ordered reported its portion of the bill with amendments on april 5 2006 and reported its portion on april 25 2006 during

in the nature of substitute to hr 4975 as or dered reported that would change certain provisions in the bill the substitute amendment included the modified version9 on may 3 2006 the house passed hr 4975 which included the substitute amendment plus several additional amendmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33397crs5 10 this would include managers amendments in the nature of substitute senate amendments to housepassed bills floor amendments and senate amendments between the houses it would not include house bills or house amendments between the housesanalysis both s 2349 and hr 4975 would change senate and house parliamentary procedures respectively governing cons ideration of certain measures including earmarks in addition the house bill would amend the federal criminal code specifically 18 usc 201 regarding bribery of public officials regarding parliamentary procedures both s 2349 and hr 4975 would require public disclosure of congre ssional sponsors of certain ear marks as well as list of those earmarks the senate measure also provides new procedure to prohibit new matter from being added in c onference reports and 48hour layover requirement for conference reports the house bill does not include similar conference report provisions public disclosure s 2349 and h r 4975 w ould require both the identification of the senators or representatives respectively who request certain approved earmarks and list of the approved earmarks the enforcement mechanism for each would be prohibition of considera tion of applicable legislation on the floor the senate bill also requires 48hour layover requirement neither proposal is self enforcing however member of congress would need to raise point of order to enforce it in current practice cong ressional public documents s uch as senate and house measures and accompanying committee re ports conference reports and joint explanatory statements generally do not id entify earmark sponsors information on earmarks and the amounts provided are gene rally available in these documents but single list of earmarks by bill is not frequently provided s 2349 section 103 would add new senate standing rule prohib iting senate consideration of any senate bill senate amendment10 or conference report unless list of all earmark s provided in the applicable document the senate sponsors of each earmark and essentia l governmental purpose of each earmark have been made available to each senator and also made available to the public on the internet for at least 48 hours prior to consideration existing senate rules and practices rega rding the disposition of points of order against the consideration of legislation would apply to the new rule the senate typically brings up measure by unanimous consent or on motion to proceed requiring majority vote if moti on is used point of order against its consideration could be raised the chair would rule on the point of order although the ruling would be subject to appeal staining the chairs ruling would require majority vote for purposes of enforcing this public disclosure requi rement section 103 defines earmark as provisi on that specifically identifies nonfederal entity suchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33397crs6 11 it also may not be provided in comm ittee report or joint explanatory statement 12 examples of such beneficiary would in clude business corporation institution or organization presumably these would be cons idered entities it should be noted that special tax relief for an individual would pr obably not be included under this definition because an individual may not be considered an entity 13 in the house general appropriations bill refers to all 11 annual regular appropriations bills and most supplemental appropriations measures it does not include continuing resolutions appropriations earmarks are genera lly associated general appropriations billsas nonfederal government organizati on institution or business to receive assistance the assistance is in the form of budget authority contract authority loan authority other expenditures tax ex penditures or ot her revenue items although section 103 specifically states th at the disclosure requirement applies to appropriations authoriz ation and revenue measures the proposed earmark definition may limit this coverage under current earmarking practices the identity of an entity receiving an earmark is not always provided in measure or conference report11 special tax relief in revenue bills for selected beneficiaries typically does not identify the beneficiary instead the bills establish narrow eligibility criteria that could apply only to the selected beneficiary12 certain earmarks in appropriations or authorization bills may not specify the receiving entity for example certain earmarks provided in pl 10959 reaut horizing federal surface transportation programs were not identified by recipient but by project focusing the earmark definition on nonfederal entities may exclude other funding setasides that some might consid er earmarks for example funding set asides for individual military construction projects under the depa rtment of defense federal buildings projects under the genera l services administr ation or federally funded research conducted by the national institutes of health would not be included this distinction may be importa nt for persons or groups that are more concerned about funding of nonfederal or ganizations institutions and businesses than about funding setasides for federal government projects section 103 applies only to earmarks in cluded in measures amendments or conference reports bill language it does not apply to earmarks in committee reports or joint explanatory statements report language most earmarks associated with appropriations measures are included in re port language as opposed to bill language hr 4975 section 501 provides special order of the house that would prohibit house consideration of any general appropriations bill13 reported by the house committee on appropriations unless the accompanying committee report includes list of earmarks provided in the reported bill or in the committee report the list must also identify the represen tative who requested earmarks in the list the section also prohibits house consider ation of conference report for general appropriations bill unless the attached joint explanatory statement contains list of new earmarks and the representative who requested the earmarks on the list that originated at the conference stage point of order against consideration of bill could be made only against the failure to in clude list of earmarks in contrast ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33397crs7 14 the bill as reported by the house committee on rules required list for both bills and conference reports not complete list for either chairman dreiers substitute amendment added the requirement of complete list of earmarks originating in conference 15 the new procedure is similar to certain h ouse procedures regarding the consideration of unfunded mandates see crs report rs20058 unfunded mandates reform act summarized by keith bea and richard s beth 16 the substitute amendment increased the amount of debate time in the reported bill from 20 minutes to 30 minutes 17 for an explanation of action on conference reports see new matter in conference reports below 18 generally house procedures do not prohibit an order or rule waiving one of its standing rules however similar exception would be house parliamentary rules regarding unfunded mandates see crs report rs20058 unfunded mandates refo rm act summarized by keith bea and richard s bethpoint of order against consideration of conference report could be made against the failure to include complete list of earmarks14 unlike typical house procedures the chai r would not resolve the issue by ruling on point of order raised under section 50115 the house bill would provide that the house decide by majority vote whether to consider the bill or conference report section 501 would not prohibit the house from considering bills or conference reports in cases in which the public disc losure requirements ar not met instead it would allow the house to decide on casebycase basis whether to consider the bill or conference report the house bill provides 30 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled by the member initiating the point of or der and an opponent probably the floor manager16 other intervening motion would be allowed except one motion that the house adjourn in current practice the house typically adopts special rule waiving all points of order against consideration of general appropriations bill as well as conference report for such bill due in part to some representatives particular concern about new earmarks added in conference reports or joint explanatory statements the house bill would provide an additional proce dural hurdle to consideration of conference reports members opposed to new earmarks in conf erence reports do not have an opportunity to remove them because both the house and senate must vote on conference report in its entirety17 while maintaining the public disclosure focus of the house bill section 501b would provide new hurdle by prohibiting the house from considering an order or rule waiving the new public disclosure rule regarding conference reports18 if point of order were raised against such rule or order the house would decide by majority vote whet her to consider the special rule following the same procedures above under this new procedure affected c onference reports could be brought up by fourstage processhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33397crs8 19 the definition also describes the treatm ent of federal facilities federal lands governmentsponsored enterprises states territories indian tribes foreign governments and intergovernmental international organizations1 as under current practice the house committee on rules reports special rule in the form of house resolution waiving all points of order ag ainst consideration of the conference report and the conference report itself 2 representative raises point of order that the special rule waives section 501b 3 the chair submits the following question which is provided in the house bill to the house shall the house now consid er the resolution notwithstanding the assertion of the maker of the point of order that the object of the resolution introduces new earmark or new earmarks 4 if the house votes to consider the sp ecial rule the house considers and votes on adoption of the special rule if the house adopts the special rule th it may consider the conference report for purposes of enforcing these public disclosure requirements section 501 provides definition of earmark designed to capture two ty pes of funding set asides under section 501 an earmark is defined as provision in general appropriations measure or accompanying committee report c onference report or joint explanatory statement that provides or recommends specific amount of discretionary budget authority that 1 is for nonfederal entity specifically identified in these documents or 2 is allocated outside of normal formuladriven or competitive bidding process and is targeted or directed to specific state or congressional district or identifiable person for example it might affect an instance in which under existing law or regulations funds for partic ular program would be distri buted by an agency based on formula but instead the appropriations bill set aside those f unds for specified activities within specific state19 the specific question included in the house bill shall the house now consider the resolution notwithstanding the assertion of the maker of the point of order that the object of the resolution introduces new earmark or new earmarks does not have direct impact on earmarks instead the procedural issue before the house would be whether the house will vote to consider special rule waiving section 501b this provision prohibits consideration of special rule that waives the rule requiring public disclosure of new earmarks and sponsor s added in conference not prohibiting new earmarks the question provided in the house bill may have the effect of discouraging some representatives from voting to consider the special rule some may argue that if sufficient number of representatives would potentially vote against consideration of the special rule members of the conference committee may decide to reduce or eliminate new earmarks the lack of threshold burden on the in itiator of point of order under section 501 may allow points of order for dilatory purposes by requiring an additional votehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33397crs9 20 if the house has not already acted on th conference report the report would be recommitted to the conference committee conference committees are automatically dissolved after one chamber adopts the conferen ce report if the house has adopted the conference report the conferen ce report would be rejected under the house bill the initiator of point of order is not required to demonstrate that the public disclosure requirements have not been met and the chair does not make threshold determination on whether the point of order has merit instead the house votes on the question of considerati on theoretically point of order may be raised against conference report that complies with the public disclosure requirement but the house would still be required to vote conference reports the senate bill would provide new mechanism to eliminate new subjects added in confer ence report and require 48hour layover requirement for conference reports the house bill did not include provisions on these issues new matter in conference reports section 102 of s 2349 would add new freestanding rule that pr ovides procedures designed to allow senators to more easily strike new subjects added in conference to conference report under existing rules conference reports cannot be ame nded because doing so would undermine the ability of conferees to ne gotiate with their counterparts from the other chamber in good faith each chamber is required to vote on conference report in its entirety the new rule is designed to provide better opportunity for senators to strike provisions in conference report that neither chamber had considered during initial floor action on the bill when it could have been more thoroughly debated and possibly amendments considered the bill prohibits consideration on the senate floor of any conference report that includes matter that is not included in the house or senatepassed versions of the bill referred to as new matter if point of order unde r section 102 were sustained the new matter would be stricken and the senate would consider whether to send an amendment containing the remaining provi sions in the conference report to the house point of order could be raised against each provision that violates this rule and the senate would consider the ame ndment after all points of order had been disposed of this question would be debatable although further amendments would be allowed under the existing senate rule prohibiting new matter senate rule xxviii if point of order against new matter is sustained the conference report is rejected or recommitted to the conference committee20 s n t r s r generally presumed to be reluctant to re ject conference report but they might be more willing to remove new matter if the remaining portions of the conference report could still be sent to the house for action the senate bill would also require threefifths vote of all senators usually 60 votes to waive or suspend section 102 or on appeal overrule the chairs ruling under the existing rule there is mechanism for waiver and majority vote is required to appeal the chairs rulinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33397crs10 21 in addition the effective date of section 104 would be 60 days after enactment not later than this date the secretary of the senate would be required to develop website capable of meeting the above requirement after c onsulting with the clerk of the house of representatives the government printing office and the senate committee on rules and administrationsection 102 would probably not have ma jor impact on most earmarks the section is proposed as freestanding rule that does not specifically amend or repeal the existing senate rule xxviii regarding conference reports senate pr ecedents provide that this rule allows that in cases in which conferees are negotiating over bill and complete substitute amendment from the other chamber conferees may include in the conference report new s ubstitute on the same subject although conferees may not include new matter they may include matter that is germane modification of provisions in either the bill or the original substitute amendment earmarks tend to be german modifications or part of larger provision that is considered new matter 48hour layover requirement senate rule xxviii allows motion to proceed to consider conference report at any time if copies of the conference report are available to each senator section 104 of s 2349 woul d amend senate rule xxv iii to increase the time available for senators to review conference report and the accompanying joint explanatory statement before floor consideration the senate bill w ould provide point of order to prohibit c onsideration of conference report unless the report were available to all senators and available on internet fo r at least 48 hours before its consideration21 as under existing practices the chair woul d rule on the point of order although the ruling would be subject to appeal an appeal of the chairs ruling would require majority vote quorum being present bribery under 18 usc 201 it is fede ral crime in part to offer things of value to members of congress and congressional staff as bribes or as illegal gratuities in connection with any official act of such members or staff section 201 also prohibits all public officials from accepting such bribes or illegal gratuities those violating this statute shall be fine d or imprisoned for not more than 15 years or both new section in hr 4975 specifies that the prohibitions in 18 usc 201 would apply to bribery and illegal grat uities in connection with earmarks as defined in hr 4975 for desc ription of the definition see hr 4975 above the senate bill did not include similar provision comparison of selected senate and house provisions both s 2349 and hr 4975 primarily fo cus on public disclosure of certain earmarks and earmark sponsors coverage the senate bill covers certain earmarks in appropriations authorization and revenue bills but the ear mark definition provided in the bill mayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33397crs11 22 more specifically it focuses on earmarks in senate bills and amendments as well as conference reports 23 more specifically it focuses on earmarks in reported bills committee reports conference reports and joint explanatory statementslimit this coverage see s 2349 above in contrast the house bill focuses only on certain earmarks associated with general appropriations bills the senate bill only addresses earmarks provided in bill language22 whereas the house bill affects earmarks in report language as well23 enforcement mechanism in the senate version the chair would determine whether the public disclosure requirements are met and would rule on any points of order raised under the new rule the ruling would be subject to appeal requiring majority vote to overturn the presiding officer if the chairs ruling were sustained the bill could not be considered by the senate in contrast upon point of order raised under the house amendment the chair would not rule on whether committee report or joint explanatory statement included list of earmarks as defined by section 501 and their sponsors instead the house would vote to decide whether to consider the bill or conference report
