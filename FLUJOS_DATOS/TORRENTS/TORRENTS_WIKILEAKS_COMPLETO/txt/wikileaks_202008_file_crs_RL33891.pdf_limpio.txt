industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33891airport improvement program issues for congress summary the airport improvement program aip s been providing federal grants for airport development and planning since the passage of the airport and airway improvement act of 1982 pl 97248 ai p funding is usually spent on projects that support aircraft operations such as r unways taxiways aprons noise abatement land purchase and safety or emergency equipment the funds obligated for the aip are drawn from the airport and airway trus t fund hereafter referred to as the trust fund which is supported by variety of user fees and fuel taxes the aip is one of five major sources of air port capital development funding the other sources are tax exempt bonds passenger facility charges p fcs local tax levied on each boarding passenger state and local grants and ai rport operating revenue different airports use different combinations of these sour ces depending on the individual airports financial situation and the ty pe of project being consider ed small airports are more dependent on aip grants than large or medi umsized airports the larger airports whose projects tend to be much more costly are more likely to participate in the tax exempt bond market or finance capita l development projects with pfc the multiyear authorization of the aip under visi on 100 century of aviation reauthorization act pl 108 176 ended on september 30 2007 series of shortterm extensions authorized nd provided funding for aip most recently through june 30 2008 pl 110190 the program was in abeyance from january 1 2008 until the enactment of pl 110 190 on february 28 2008 during this period new grants could not be awarded but faa could honor payment requests for existing grants the aip and pfc issues that have been considered during the ongoing debate regarding the reauthorization of the federal aviation administration faa include the national level of need for airport developmen t and the appropriate aip funding level the appropria federal role in airport development the criteria for the distribution of funding across airports of different types and sizes the sufficiency of aip discretionary funding especially for major capacity enhancing projects accommodating new system users such as the airbus a380 superjumbo jet and very light jets vljs airport privatization federalization of large airports raising or eliminating the 450 ceiling now imposed on pfcs the use and tax treatment of airport bonds and noise mitiga tion funding and eligibility during the faa reauthorization debate virtually all of the policy issues and options concerning aip will be influenced by the broader budget issues of the adequacy of trust fund revenues and the availability of money for the faa from the treasury general fund should ample revenue s be available the reauthorization of aip could maintain the programs structure and perhaps even increase aip spending constrainedbudget scenario would probabl increase interest in such issues as defederalization or tighten ing of program formula fundi ng and eligibility criteria which could provide cost savings it c ould also increase interest in raising or eliminating the pfc ceiling which could help airports fund more projects this report is not the crs tracking report for faa reauthorization to track proposed

issues for congress introduction the airport improvement program aip pr ovides federal grants to airports for airport development and planning the air ports participating in the aip range from very large publiclyowned commercial primary airports to small public use general aviation airports that may be privatelyowned1 aip funding is usually limited to construction or improve ments related to aircraft ope rations typically for planning and construction of projects such as runway s taxiways aprons noise abatement land purchase and safety emergency or snow removal equipment commercial revenue producing portions of ter minals such as shop cessions or commercial maintenance hangars automob ile parking garages and road construction outside the airport boundry are examples of improvements that generally are not eligible for aip funding airports smaller than medium hub however have broader eligibility on terminal projects under certain conditions2 aip money cannot be used for an airports operational expenses3 the passenger facility charge pfc is local tax imposed with federal approval by an airport on each boarding pa ssenger the spending of pfc program revenues is meant to complement aip grants pfc funds can be used for broader range of projects than aip grants and are more likely to be used for landside projects such as passenger terminal and ground access improvements that arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33891crs2 4 the terms airside and landside are terms of art often used in discussions of airport development and planning although their anings may vary depending on the user and context airside generally refers to parts of an airport that directly involve the arrival and departure of aircraft ie r unway taxiway and ramp areas etc landside generally refers to other areas of the airport ie buildings ch as terminals hangars firehouses and other facilities and infrastructure such as fuel farms roads perimeter facilities etc although most would describe aip as primarily an airside program its eligibility criteria allow for some projects that are landside as well as for noise and environmental mitigation projects which do not fit neatly into

to an airport sponsor such as an ai rport authority to subsidize an faa approved airport project 11 see crs report rs21321 aviation taxes and fees major issues by john w fischerbackground and selected legislative history7 prior to world war ii the federal government limited its role in aviation to maintaining the airway system viewing airports as local responsibility some federal monies were spen t on airports during the 1930s about 150 million but only as part of federal work relief activities such as works progress administration wpa projects the national defense need for strong system of airports during world war ii led to the first major federal support for airport cons truction after the war the federal airport act of 1946 pl 79377 the 1946 act continued federal aid under the federal aid to airports progra m although at lower levels than during the war years under the 1946 act f unds were appropriate d annually from the general fund of the us treasury initially much of this spending supported policy of conversion of military airpor ts to civilian use in the 1960s substantial funding also was used to upgrade and extend runways for use by commercial jets8 increasing congestion during the 1960s both in the air and on the ground at us airports was seen as evidence by some that past federa l support for airports had not been sufficient to maintain adequate airport capacity9 airport and airway development and revenue acts of 1970 pl 91258 in 1970 congress responded to the cong estion problems and capacity concerns at airports by passing two acts the fi rst the airport and airway development act dealt with the spending side of federal aid to airports it established the forerunner programs of aip the airport developm ent aid program adap and the planning grant program pgp and set forth the programs grant criteria distribution guidelines and authorization of grantinaid funding for the first five years of the program10 the second act the airport and ai rway revenue ac t of 1970 dealt with the revenue side of airport development this act blished the airport and airway trust fund aatf also referred to as the aviation trust fund and in this report simply the trust fund revenues from levies on aviation users and fuel were dedicated to the fund11 since enactment of the 1970 act the trust fund has been the principal source of federal aid to airpor ts first under adap and then under the aip starting in fy1982httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33891crs4 12 for detailed discussion of the history of th various cap and penalty provisions and other spending guarantees see crs report rl33654 aviation spending guarantee mechanisms by robert s kirk 13 airport aid for those years was appropriate d at 450 million per year certain aviation fee revenues went into the treasurys general fund and the highway trust fund the defederalization debate centered around proposal s to withdraw federal aid from major air carrier airports on the grounds that the federal government was overly involved in airport development finance and that large airpor ts could finance any needed development themselves 14 see the discussion in appendix at the end of this

airports of th 19847 airports existing in the united states are listed in the npias unless otherwise stated the disc ussion in this paper refers to the npias or national system airportsin 1976 the airport and airway devel opment amendments act of 1976 pl 94353 responding to concerns over the amounts made availabl in appropriations bills for adap included cap and penalty provisions which placed an annual cap on spending for costs of air navigation syst ems and penalty that reduced these caps if airport grants were not funded each ear at the airport programs authorized levels12 some form of cap and penalty m echanisms were in effect until fy1998 adap grants totaled about 41 billion from 1971 through 1980 in part because of debate over proposed defed eralization provisi ons congress did not pass authorizing legislation for the taxes that supported the trust fund or for the funds operation during fy1981 and fy1982 wh ich meant that the aviation trust fund lapsed during those two years althoug h spending for airport grants continued13 airport and airway improvement act of 1982 pl 97248 the 1982 act the 1982 act created the current aip and reactivated the trust fund although the aip maintained the adaps approach of using grantsinaid as opposed to providing loans to support an integrated national system of airports it did make some significant changes in the operation of the program the program differences included altering the funding distributi on among the newly defined categories of airports and extending aid eligibility to privately owned general aviation airports14 the act also required the secretary of tr ansportation to publish national plan for the development of publicuse airports in the united states this biannual publication is called the national plan of integrated airport systems npias the npias identifies airports that are consid ered important to national transportation for an airport to receive aip funds it must be listed in the npias15 in reauthorizing the aviation trust fund the act also adjust ed the schedule of aviation user feeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33891crs5 16 authority to collect taxes for the trust fund expired on january 1 1996 and the trust fund received revenues for nearly eight months until it was extended to the end of the calendar year tax authority then expired for another two months spending from the trust fund continued during these lapses however 17 during the debate aip underwent four sepa rate authorization extensions pl 105227 extended aip through march 31 1999 pl 1066 through may 31 1999 pl 10631

continuedalthough the act was amended often in the 1980s and early 1990s the general structure of the program remained the same16 the wendell h ford aviation investment and reform act for the 21st century of 2000 air21 pl 106181 air21s enactment was the culmination of two years of legislative effort to pass multiyear faa reauthorization bill17 the length of the effort was reflection of the difficult issues faced major issues that had to be resolved included the budgetary treatment of the aviation trust fund raising or elimin ating the ceiling on the passenger facility charge pfc and the spending amounts and their distribution rather than enacting further modifications of the cap and penalty provisions air21instead included socalled guarantee that all of each years receipts and interest credited to the tr ust fund will be made ava ilable annually for aviation purposes the guarantee is enforced by ch anges made in house and senate pointof order rules one rule makes it outoforder to consider legislation that does not spend all trust fund revenues for aviation purposes the second rule makes it outoforder to consider legislation for funding f aas operations and maintenance om or research engineering and development red budgets if aip and the facilities and equipment fe budgets are funded below authorized levels as is discussed later in this report the funding guarantees have not been enforced in recent years because pointsoforder have either b een waived by the house rules committee or have not been raised by members on the floor of the house or senate air21 did not however make any majo r changes in the overall structure or functioning of aip it did make ma jor change in the amount of money made available for airport development projects from funding vel of approximately 19 billion for fy2000 aips authorization increased funding by nearly 70 to 32 billion for fy2001 then to 33 billion for fy2002 and to 34 billion for fy2003 the bill also made changes in fundi ng distribution to facilitate the larger amounts authorized the formula funding and minimums for primary airports were doubled starting in fy2001 the state apporti onment

funding for airports the aip is one of five major sources of funding for airport development and improvement19 airports also fund capital projects using taxexempt bonds passenger facility charges pfcs local ta x levied on each boarding passenger state and local grants and airport revenue20 different airports us different combinations of these sources depending on the individual airports financial situation and the type of project being considered small airports are more lik ely to be dependent on aip grants than large or mediumsized airports the larger airports are also much more likely to participate in the taxexempt bond market or finance capital development projects with the proceeds generated from pfcs each of these funding sources places differing legislative regulatory or contractual constraints on airports that use them bonds aip and pfcs are the primary sources of funding for airport capital projects based on 19992001 data the us general accountin g office now the government accountability office gao found in 2003 that the airport system received an average of 12 billion per year from all sources for capital development of this amount bonds accounted for 59 aip for 21 pfcs for 13 state and local contributions for 4 and airport revenue for 421 the average amounts madehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33891crs7 21 continued development washington gao gao03497t 2003 7 22 the 20072011 npias estimates that aip nd pfcs together account for about 40 of capital spending needs 23 because pfcs are often used to make debt payments this use reduces the total of pfc revenues used to directly pay for airport pr ojects this means that the amounts actually available for airport projects will be somewhat less that the grand total of aip pfcs bonds local grants and airport revenues dedicated to capital improvements 24 see appendix b for airport definitions 25 based on fy2003 data see faa airports data package for stakeholders available at httpwwwfaagovaboutoffice_orghea dquarters_officesaepaatfmediaairports20 data20packagepdfavailable for aip and the average annual pfc collections have been significantly higher since fy2001 because of the air21 increase in aip funding and the raised pfc ceiling so the aip and pfc percentages of total capital spending are probably now higher than was the case in da range covered in the gao study22 bonds however doubtless remain the largest source of funding for airport capital projects23 of the 3364 airports in the national air port system all but 113 are public sector enterprises that usually opera under city county or st ate department or specially contrived organization such as an airport or port authority ge nerally airports can do little to influence their fina ncial relationship to their governmental sponsors on the other hand airports that handle commercia l service aircraft are able to negotiate the terms and conditions of their agreements with their major users and creditors the source of airport development f unds sets the different limitations and obligations that influence how project money can be raised and spent the availability and conditions of one source of funding may also influence the availability and terms of ot her sources of funding the two financing sources for airports with the most significant federa l involvement are the aip and pfc programs as mentioned above the dependence on aip to pay for capital needs varies greatly according to airport size categories with the smaller airports being more dependent on aip funding24 large and mediumhub airpor ts finance much of their capital expenditures by using bonding and pfcs and rely on aip for only 16 and 29 respectively of their total capital spending for smallhub airports the dependence on aip grants rises to 51 for nonhub commercial service airports aip dependence rises to 89 and for other nonhub airports to 9425 airport improvement program aip the aip provides federal grants to ai rports for airport development and planning the airports participating in the aip range from very large publiclyowned primary commercial service airports to small public use general aviation airports that may be privatelyowned but are required under aip to be available for public use as mentioned earlier aip funding is usua lly limited to construc tion or improvementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33891crs8 26 for detailed guidance on allowable costs see chapter 3 of the aip handbook at httpwwwfaagovairports_airtrafficairportsresourcespublicationsordersmediaaip_ 5100_38cpdf 27 although the airway and airport trust f und was modeled after the highway trust fund there are differences in the way funds are dist ributed one major difference is that highway spending is funneled through the states wherea s most

set national priorities and objectives of assuring air port safety and security stimulating capacity building reducing congestion helping fund noise and envi ronmental mitigation costs and financing small state and comm unity airports there is less federal involvement in the four other sour ces of airport development funds the main financial advantage of aip to ai rports is that as grant program

these revenues plus interest on the trust funds unexpended balances of ten brought more revenue in to the fund than was being paid out this led to the growth in the endofyear unexpended balance in the

unexpended trust fund balance that grows substantially larger each year ended in fy2001 most observers believe th drop in demand for air travel that began during 2001 due at fi rst to recessionary

supporters that the program s traditional priorities of nhancing capacity safety and noise mitigation were in da nger of being underfunded66 vision 100 made two major changes regard ing the funding of airport security projects first the act incl uded provision that repealed the language of the federal aviation reauthorization act of 1996 pl 104264 that permitted the use of aip and pfc funds for securityrelated impr ovement of facilities and the purchase or deployment of equipment for security purposes second vision 100 established the aviation security capital fund to fund airport security re lated projects together these provisions were expected to relieve the aip of the demands on its funds for most security projects the aviation curity fee revenues credited to the fund however have been insufficient to fully fund security costs67 consequently despite the vision 100 prohibition some still view ai p as potential source of funding for certain securityrelated airport improvements in

extent minimizing noise impacts and encouraging efficient service to state and local communities ie support for general aviation airports th priorities along with the assessment of airport capital needs and the availability of budgetary resources for aip all influence the scope and structure of the program during the faa reauthorization debate in the 110th congress virtually all of the policy issues and options concerning aip will be influenced by the broader budget issues of the adequacy of aviation trust fund revenues and the av ailability of money from the treasury general fund if aip funding is increased significantly the program may well remain basically as it is if aip s funding is reduced the funding formulas and project eligibility requirements might be altered to assure that the aips statutory priorities can still be t at the lower funding levels because this report is about an existin g program the analysis of the program necessarily discusses the ex isting programmatic structure and the historical funding levels of the periods being discussed advocates of aip view the fully authorized funding of the program as good thing over time however there has also been an alternative view that too much was being spent on aip particularly at smaller airports that do not play significant role in commercial aviati on these critics often view the breadth of aip spending decreasing local share requirements and ever widening project eligibilities as allowing for spending that is increasingly inefficient unfocused and of ques tionable federal purpose airport capital needs assessments the debate over the scope of airport cap ital needs is of concern to congress because reliable assessment of needs can help facilitate deter mining the appropriate federal support needed to foster safe and efficient national airport system70 the federal governments interest in the needs debate is broader than just dealing with capacity constrained airports it also deals with implementing federal safety and noise policieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33891crs27 71 as of this writing the air transport associ ation which represents the major air carriers has not done an estimate

different longterm airport financial needs in the most recent npias report the faa has estimated that the national systems capital needs for 20072011 will total 412 billion an annua l average of 824

including difference in coll ections periods and an infla tion adjustment in the aci na study although these differences ma somewhat limit the comparability of the two estimates the main reason for the widely differing estimates is the differing views on what kinds of airport projects were appropriate to include in the estimates the npias report was based on planned project inform ation taken from airport master plans and state system plans f aa planners screened out projects that were not justified by aviation activity forecasts or that were not eligible for aip grants only designated

enhancements could net of 3 to 880 the june 2004 faa study of airport capacity capacity needs in the national airspace system an analysis of ai rport and metropolitan area demand and operational capacity in the future first examined which of the 35 oep airports would and would not be able to meet fu ture demand and then examined whether other areas of the united states might be unable to accommodate the demand for air transportation in the future the study ex amined airports that would need capacity increases mostly new or reconfigured r unways from base year of 2003 and also projected which airports would need capacity increases in 2013 and 2020 it identified five airports plus the atlanta metropolitan area that needed additional capacity in 2003 the study projected that assuming that planned oep improvements for 20032013 were comp leted capacity impr ovements would be needed at 15 airports for 2013 for the year 2020 assuming implementation of runway construction project not included in the oep as well as improvements in technologies and procedures an ambitious assumption the study notes the study still identifies 18 airports as likely needing additional capacity some not currently part of the oep81 interestingly the airports identifie d for 2013 and especially for 2020 show increased needs at some medium hub airports that are considered secondary to large hub airports in major metropolitan airports part of this trend may be that some major metropo litan airports are appr oaching the point that they may have limited room to add new runway capacity but could also result from the expansion of secondary metropolitan area airports that ve found favor with low cost air carriershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33891crs30 82 some have argued that because some of the large airports included in the oep 35 have been losing market share to lowcost seconda ry airports in their urban areas it might make more sense in these cases to consider incr easing aip funding to these secondary airports rather than supporting major capacity enhancem ent projects or airside reconfigurations at legacy airports discussed during session effects of airline re structuring on airport systems at the 2007 trans portation research board 86th annual meeting washington january 23 2007in recent years this also could reflect shift to more pointtopoint service and somewhat diminished reliance on the huba ndspoke model by the legacy carriers82 if valid the study has implications for aip within the context of reauthorization to begin with although the life cycles of faa authorization bills are usually only for two to four years large runway projects that are the focus of the oep can require long lead times 10 or more years from cept to initial construc tion is not unusual because of this some costs from proj ects needed by 2013 and even 2020 may need to be funded in the next few years at large and medium hub airports runway projects are usually paid for in part by aip funds there is 75 maximum participation at large airports the par ticipation however is generally significantly below this maximum these funds are ge nerally used in combination with other sources of funding such as pfcs taxfr ee airport bonds often paid for using pfc revenues airport revenues and some times state funds as mentioned earlier most large and medium airports impose pfcs on each boarding passenger in return for permissi on to levy the pfc these airports forgo either 50 or 75 of their aip formula titlement funds this means that federal funding for major runway projects at rge and medium hub airports will probably need to be for the most part funded with aip discretionary funds the pool of discretionary funds is prima rily the remainder of provi ded annual funding after the entitlement formula requirement s are satisfied of the forgone pfc funds 875 are reserved for small airport fund and ar also not available for oep airports if there is confluence of policy of overall federal budget deficit reduction with an inability to either increase trust fund revenues or to in crease the general fund share for the faa budget there could be meaningful reduction in the amount of funding available for discretionary grants once the entitlement ie formula funding requirements are satisfied in other words if the aip budget is constrained either under reauthorization bill or during th annual appropriation process and the entitlement formulas remain as they are the squeezedown effect will be likely on the discretionary portion of the aip budget within this context it is important to so keep in mind that significant portion of aip discretionary funds have in r ecent years been earmarked to hundreds of airports based primarily on local needs and wants rather than in accordance with national capacity plan this situation could also limit or reduce aip participation in some of the capacity increasing projects at oep airports caveats predicting the future is difficult and although the faa has reasonably good record for accuracy in its activity forecasts the faa itself has pointed out that since the events of 9 11 the instability of the industry has led

potential impact of very light jets vljs discussed later may also influence the accuracy of forecasts aips financial future under an uncertain budgetary outlook the aip is good example of how broa der budget issues can have implications for not only programs funding level but also the program s scope and benefit distribution should ample re venues be available the r eauthorization of aip could likely maintain the programmatic status quo with relatively few changes to the programs structure although project elig ibility criteria could be broadened given however the recent decline in the unco mmitted balance of the aviation trust fund for the aip to grow substantially some observers expect that something will have to change in the budgetary environment in creased tax revenues either through new taxes higher fares or fa ster economic growth or an increase in the general fund share would be needed to provide for an aip increase on the order of the increases initiated by air21and maintained in vision 10084 otherwise any aip increase would have to come at the ex pense of other faa programs for variety reasons some within the transportation community expect budgetary constraints will restrict the size of the aip budget as mentioned earlier the uncommitted balance in the trust fund is much smaller than it was during the last authorization cycle more money may be needed to fund the fe component of the faa budget to support the modernization of the air traffic control system under the next generation air tran sportation system ngats and in constrained budgetary environment this could exer t downward pressure on the aip component of the faa budget the enforcement of payasyougo rules and renewed commitment to reduce the federal budget ficit could also make it difficult to increase aip funding85 in recent years the george w bush administration and the faa itself have consistently proposed aip budgets significantly below the programs authorized levels most r ecently the president s fy2009 budg et proposed 275 b illion for aip this is 765 million below the estimated amount made available for fy2007 and nearly 1 billion below the fy2007 funding authorized in vision 100 within constrainedbudget scenario in terest would probably increase in such issues as defederalization of the larger ai rports which by allowing them to opt out of the aip program could reduce aip sp ending on large hub airports another possibility would be to make the aip formulas more restrictive project eligibility criteria could also be tightened perhaps the greatest concern at the federal levelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33891crs32 86 for detailed discussion of the history of funding guarantees see crs report rl33654 aviation spending guarantee mechanisms by robert s kirk the spending guarantee issues are also summarized in crs report rl33698 reauthorization of the federal aviation administration backg round and issues for congress coordinated by bart elias 87 the cap set ceiling on the amount of aviation trust fund money that could be used to fund faa operations the penalty would reduce this cap by formula linked to faa capital program appropriations shortfall below their authorizations for the fiscal year 88 cbo status of the airport and airway trust fund 1988 p 1011may be the availability of aip discretionary funds fo r major capacity enhancing projects as those set forth in the oep aip spending guarantees86 as discussed earlier cong ressional concerns especia lly among transportation authorizing committee members that aviati on trust fund revenues first be used to fund faas two capital programs aip and fe before being drawn down to pay for the agencys operations activities have led to the enactment of series of cap and penalty and other so called spending guarantee mechanisms although the various cap and penalty mechanisms that were in place prior to passage of air21 in 2000 succeeded in restricting spending from the aviation trust fund on operations they did not consistently succeed in forcing full appropriation of authorized aip and fe funding levels87 this situation led to the growth of the trust funds uncommitted balance as congressional budget office cbo report explained in 1988 but still applicable today88 primarily because of program constraints these provisions have merely altered the accounting for aviation spending forcing the general fund to finance more of these expenditures in addition th ere still remains an incentive to limit capital spending for aviation programs given the annual level of excise tax revenue from aviation each dollar of aviation spending greater than these tax revenues must be funded by general revenues therefore regardless of the actual accounting for aviation spending each dollar reduction in spending on aviation either reduces the need for the genera l fund to finance aviation spending or produces trust fund surplus from which the treasury can borrow to cover non aviation expenditures in effect within the context of the unitary federal budget appropriators and budgeteers were more concerned about the overall budget level or the size of the federal budget deficit than whether belowauthorized spending on aip and fe caused reduction of trust fund spending for om broader budget concerns trumped the cap and penalty provisions current law pointoforder enforced spending guarantees there are two existing spending guarantees which are different than the previously discussed cap and penalty provisions on makes it outoforder in the house or senate to consider legisla tion that failed to use all av iation trust fund receipts and interest annually the second makes it outoforder to cons ider any bill that provided any funding for red or om if it fa iled to fully fund the faa s two capitalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33891crs33 89 in part this may have been because if point of order were uphel d the entire aip or fe financing provision would be stricken from the bill that senate conferees would take to conference this absence of funding prov ision could put the senate conferees at disadvantage in negotiating with house conferees over the contents of the bill to be voted out of conferenceprograms aip and fe at their authorized levels as penalty of sorts any failure to fully fund fe would lead to an incr eased appropriation re ferred to as popup budget authority for aip equal to th appropriations shortfall for fe during the first years of the air21 guarantees fy2001fy2003 these measures appear to have successfully ssured that both aip and fe were funded at or very near their authorized levels in the annual appropria tions acts however congressional support in th annual appropriation bills for adherence to the guarantees during the last three years has been mixed on the one hand the obligation limitations for aip for fy2004 fy2007 have been reasonably close to their authorized levels for these years on the other hand fe spending has been cut significantly in each of these years fes annual appropriation fell below its authorization as follows 320 million for fy2004 468 million for fy2005 498 million for fy2006 and 595 million for fy2007 these fe funding levels were out of conformance with the guarantees and should have made the funding of the om and red components of faas budget out of order during these years it also should have led to add itional popup budget authority for the aip equal to the annual underfunding of fe there are number of reasons that th guarantee provisions have not been adhered to specific to fe spending has been the lack of confidence in congress in the ability of the faa to oversee the national air system modernization the hesitance to fully fund fe ma have more to do with this than with resistance to adherence to the funding guarantees ho wever some other weaknesses in the current guarantee mechanism have manifested themselves in recent years spending guarantees that are enforced by pointofo rder actions only work if the pointoforder is raised by member and if they have not been waived by rule in the house recent annual appropriations bills have had all pointsofo rder waived by the rules committee senators have also chosen not to raise pointsoforder against violations of the aip and fe funding guarantees89 pointsoforder have not been allowed on appropriations bill conference reports also the popup aip budget authority which some viewed as part of the m echanism for preventing appropriators from spending any fe shortfall for noncap ital aviation spending can and has been rescinded in recent appropria tions legislation these re scissions allow appropriators to bring down the nominal total cost of the transportation treasury appropriations bills generally in the following budget year as was true during the cap and penalty era fy1977fy 1998 the current spe nding guarantees can still be trumped by broader budget policy goals such as defic it reduction or at time s by the spending priorities of appropriators spending guarantee options aviation funding gu arantees are expected to be considered in the faa reauthorization debate during the 110th congress and could include

penalty provi sions reconsidering taking the trust fund offbudget or erec ting budgetary fire walls as was done for the highway and transit programs in 1998 some would argue that there should be guarantees and that the normal congre ssional budget process should be allowed to progress unfettered the absence of large uncommitted trus t fund balance could also have an impact on the support for new or continued aviation spending guarantee mechanisms during faa reauthorization in the 110th congress partial defederalization one way to reduce the amount of trust fund revenue needed for aip would be to allow large and medium hub airports to opt out of the aip program in favor of unrestricted or higher pfc financing th is would in the view of some airport executives also give them the flexibility they would prefer to have in managing their airports these airports would longer be bound by all of the grant assurances that are currently required of participants if the large and medium hub airports ar able to defederalize there would be implications for the degree of policy influe nce the federal government could wield in airport development some argue that because the threat of withdrawal of federal aip funds provides the federal government with substantial leverage to enforce grant assurances that implement federal policy for example the fair and reasonable rates requirement or airport reve nue diversion assurances other means of maintaining federal influence might be considered dur ing reauthorization s hould defederalization gain significant legislative attention privatization for congress the privatiza tion debate is both about saving money on airports that can be less dependent on federal assistance and so in the broader sense whether federal involvement in airport infrastructure is excessive airport privatization differs from defederalization in that privatization denotes change in ownership from public entity to private one airport privatization in the united states has for the most part been limited to what some would refer to as commercialization of airport management or services the use of private companies to provide airport

infrastructure94 supporters of privatiz ation generally take the view that if lease revenues or profits from air port sales can only be used for airport purposes there is incentive for an airport authority to ll or forprofit company to purchase an airport or airport lease as mentioned earlier the pilot progra m provides for exemptions on the aip grant assurance restrictions on use of re venues the airport privatization pilot program however requires that the air port sponsor may only recover from the sale or lease the amount that may be approved by at least 65 of the air carriers serving the airport and air carriers that account fo r 65 of the total landed weight at the airport for the year proponent s of privatization argue that this requirement of air carrier approval air carriers

modify replace or eliminate the program95 there is certainty that any aip cost savings from either privatization or defederalization would be retained as aip funds for use by the remaining airports aip spending is determined by the author ization and appropriati ons process and there is guarantee that the savings would be made available to the remaining eligible airports any savings could also be used to lower the program size to marginally assist in deficit reduction to lower the needed general fund payment or to make money available for spending elsewhere apportionment and eligibility changes apportioned funds sometime s referred to as entitleme nts were substantially increased in air21 and the range of landsi projects eligible for aip grants was increased somewhat in both air21 and vision 100 most of the eligibility changes benefitted airports smaller than mediumhub size although the increase in apportioned funding and the br oadening of eligibility crite ria could continue in the next reauthorization bill if the budget nvironment is constrai ned the opposite could happen in particular the pportioned funds may have to be reduced to assure that sufficient funds remain to fund discretiona ry grants in particular for operational evolution plan projects the acina suppor ts the maintenance of aip funding for smaller airports and argues further for giving these airports increased flexibility in the use of their entitlements the case can be made that over the years the broadening of aip eligibility at small airports has made it increasingly difficult to identify the federal interest that has been met by such spending as mentioned earlier air carriers are skeptical of the benefit to the nationa l airport system of some proposals seeking to broaden project eligibility in part because they feel it shifts spending away from airside projects at large airports and to projects at small airports that do not play key role in commercial aviation general aviation and sma ll airport supporters defend the distribution of aip funds to small air ports noting that smaller airports are more dependant on aip and do not often have the access to the bond market that larger airports have in addition they stress th importance of small airports to broad regions of the united states and their role in fulfilling the national goal of having an extensive national airport system96 federal share vision 100 raised the federal share from 90 to 95 for smaller than large and mediumhub airports and for airports in stat participating in the state block grant program but included sunset clause that returns the federal share back to 90 afterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33891crs37 97 for example against cargo or commuter aircraft or night time flight operators 98 49 usc sec 47107fy2007 should the federal or faa budget be constrained or held at current levels congress may wish to consider adjusting the federal share as either cost cutting measure or to encourage more local financ ial participation th federal share for most projects at large and mediumhub airports is 75 those who favor significant local matching share in federal transportation projects generally argue that it helps prevent the construction of project s of questionable value that may be built only because federal funds may be obtaine d at little cost to local governments or airport authorities some also argue that high federal share discourages local government financial participation and makes smaller airports less interested in seeking funds through the bond market discretionary fund setasides the discretionary funds which are the remainder funds after the apportionments are satisfied are subject to setasides for noise mitigation the military airports program map reliever airports and the capacitysafetysecuritynoise setaside any of these could be modified during r eauthorization however the greater the total of all the setasides the smaller the remaining amounts that are truly unrestricted discretionary funds some observers argue that this could li mit the ability of the faa to respond to national aviation priorities such as the oep minimum discretionary fund 49 usc 47115 requires that minimum amount 148 million plus any outstanding prejanuary 1 1997 letters of intent remains available for the discretionary fund after all pportionments and setasides ar satisfied if less money remains the apportionments are reduced pr rata to bring the discretionary funding up to the required level because aip s been funded since fy2001 at historically high levels the minimum disc retionary fund provision has not been factor in aip funding if however aips budget is reduced substantially or if the entitlements are increased substantially th appropriate minimum discre tionary fund level may need to be reconsidered grant assurances as mentioned earlier along with the acceptance of aip funds come certain obligations generally referred to as assurances that airports must agree to these assurances include the obligation to maintain and operate their facilities safely and efficiently as well as more specific obligations such as not to discriminate against any class of air system users97 to adhere to davisbacon prevailing wage requirements and to use air port revenue solely for spendi ng on airport operations and capital costs98 proposals to alter the aip grant assurances can be expected to arise during the reauthorization debate for example the acina is seeking bill that simplifies airport grant assurances including reforms

of the issues related to the advent of vljs see the vlj discussion in the chapter accommodating future airspace users in crs report rl33698 reauthorization of the federal aviati on administration background and issues for congress coordinated by bart eliascommunities99 supporters of maintaining the gr ant assurances generally argue that the assurances not only help establish and enforce federal policy priorities but also insulate airports from local efforts to limit or shut down airport operations for example because of noise concerns or for land development noise mitigation historically the basic funding issue is whether to change the existing discretionary fund noise setaside the noi setaside however has been raised in each of the last two reauthorization acts and is now 35 of di scretionary funding although some support for another incr ease could develop it would likely face resistance from proponents of spending on capacity and safety enhancing projects that also rely on aip discretionary spending this scenario would change should the aviation trust fund revenue outlook improve enough to allow for significant increase in aip funding other noise issues that may arise are funding eligibility issues one issue is whether faa should be granted the flexib ility to fund some noi mitigation projects that are outside the 65 decibel noise impact area supporters argue that at some airports expanding noise mitigation to areas subject to slightly lower than 65 decibel impact could significantly lower local resistance to airport projects some air carriers and airports however are concerned that any lowering would eventually in effect be applied nationwide and the resu lting demand for aip funds would divert resources from capacity and safety projects another issue is whether or not to make the planning for noise mitigating arrival and departure operational air traffic control procedures eligible for aip funding in what was major expansion of aip noise funding eligibility vision 100 authorized the faa to make grants for land use compatibility planning and projects around rge and medium hub airports that have not submitted part 150 noise

specific dollar amounts designated in the language of the appropriations bills instead of earmarking aip funds are subject to place naming under place naming the appropriations committees direct faa

fy2006 transportationtreasury appr opriations conference report hrept 109307 place named 124 airport for proj ects totaling just under 196 million one of the issues related to this form of earmarking

passenger facility charge increase statement on behalf of the air transport association of america before the house of representatives aviation subcommittee march 12 1998 6 pfor elimination of the cap but would also be pleased with an increase of some sort the overall historical arguments for and against raising or eliminating the 450 cap on passenger facility charges are similar to the current arguments and are similar to the arguments for and against the pfc in general most air carriers and some passenger advocates will probably oppose an in crease in the pfc the pros and cons of increasing or eliminating the pfc cap are discussed below pro pfc supporters feel that the pfc is more reliable than aip funding they also argue that pfcs are procompetitive helping airports build gates and facilities that both encourage new entrant carriers and allow incumbent carriers to expand airports also argue that the pfc has proven an appropriate user fee that has travelers pay for airport improvements and capacity expansion at the airport where the fee is collected in addition supporters argue that over time the value of the pfc has been eroded by inflation and an adjustment is therefore necessary airport interests also want even fewer restrictions on the use of pfc revenue the airlines object to increasing the pfc cap they argue that the pfc is just another head tax102 they also argue that it is anti consumer because it increases passenger costs and that by raising these travel costs it could at some point lead to reduction in passenger traffic airline interests object to what pfcs have been spent on arguing that airports have learned to game the system to provide money for marginal proposal s of debatable value instead of high priority projects that offe r meaningful safety or capacity enhancements the major air carri ers are also unhappy with the less influential decision making role th ey have in project decisions under pfcs airports only have to cons ult with resident air carriers under the pfc rules they do not have to get air carrier agreement on pfc funded projects although pfc revenues can be used for broader range of projects than aip some airport advocates argue there is still room for more flexibility in pfc eligibility requirements for example some would like more freedom to use pfc funds on off airport projects such as transportation access projects airports would also like the application process to be streamlined additionally they would also to eliminate the competition plan requirement that is placed on large and medium hub airports that charge pfcs at the 450 level as men tioned earlier supporters of the competition plan provision hoped the requirement would help assure that the major airports would be available on reasonable basis to all air carriers wishing to serve those airports air carrier advocates have expressed concerns about the expansion of project eligibility under the pfc program they ar especially concerned about the use ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33891crs41 103 faa report of the airport capacity funding advisory committee washington faa p 3 104 for description of the federal highway administration program see httpwwwfhwa dotgovpppprivate_activity_bondshtmpfcs to fund certain airport access projects such as rail mass transit projects that would spend pfc revenues beyond the air port boundary they view the broadening of pfc project eligibility as shifting re sources away from airport infrastructure projects that support the operation of aircraft at the airport in their view this creates situation where the airside projects generally favored by air carriers are more likely to be funded by aip grants bonds and air port revenues and less likely to be funded with pfcs part of this concern is driven by air carrier belief that the broadening of pfc project eligibility in effect makes some large airports more likely to raise the rates and fees such as landing fees charged to air carriers that use the airport if the aip budget faces period of c onstraint which could limit the availability of aip discretionary funding for national priorities such as the oep congress may wish to revisit the distribution of the ai p apportionments that are foregone by the large and mediumhub airports that impose pfc currently 875 of the foregone funds are directed to small airport fund and 125 to the discretionary fund adjusting these percentages could be one way of increasing the money available to support oep projects in 1990 the airpor t capacity funding advisory committee recommended that all foregone funds should be shifted to the discretionary fund and allocated proportionally across all categor ies of the discretionary category103 this original recommendation c ould be reconsidered airport bonding issues recently there has been interest in increased use of private activity bonds pabs for transportation development private activity airport bonds could allow private entity to enter the taxexempt bond market to raise funding for capital project at public use airport as possible precedent the recently passed surface transportation act the safe accountable flexible effi cient transportation equity act legacy for users pl 10959 safetealu allowed for up to 15 billion in private facility bond funding for high ways or freight transfer facilities104 airport bonds however have long been major source of funding for capital projects at primary airports because most airports are owned by public authorities they can seek funds in the taxexempt bond market the majority of these bonds are already treated by the internal revenue rvice as private activity bonds because they fund projects that benefit th activities of privat entities usually airlines at the airport and because they directly or i ndirectly through fees depend on revenue from such private entities to make the bond paym ents income from pabs are subject to the alternative minimum tax the current use by airport sponsors of airport bonding differs somewhat from the use of pabs envisioned in safetea lu many of the supporters of the safetealu provisions envisioned pabs as means of facilitating publicprivate partnerships between the public author ity and an outside investor see thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33891crs42 105 see also the discussion of privatiza tion of airports earlier in this report 106 the amt was originally enacted to make sure that all taxpayers pay at least minimum amount of federal taxes on their income so th at individual taxpayers could not take

washington gao 2006 p 1617privatization issue discussion earlier in this report within the airports context this would be analogous to an airport authority agreeing to long term lease with an outside private investor who would have the ability to enter the market for tax exempt bonds to finance improvements at the airport and perhaps also to finance the purchasing costs of the lease itself105 alternative minimum tax amt issues as mentioned above income from pabs is subject to the amt106 income from taxexempt governmental purpose bonds is not subject to the amt the majority of airport bonds are pabs one change sought by acina would be to broaden the definition of governmental purpose airport bonds to in effect include ither all airport bonds or at least those bonds issued for public use projects that meet aip or pfc ligibility requirements107 opponents of such changes express cerns that these changes could reduce us treasury revenues some also argue it would make more sense to change the amt as part of tax bill rather than as specific exemption provided for income on airport bonds in an faa reauthorization bill in either case such change would not be under the jurisdiction of the congressi onal committees that will have jurisdiction over most reauthorization provisions changes to the amt would be under the jurisdiction of the congressional taxwriting committees the house committee on ways and means and the senate committee on finance the congressional budget office cbo the office of management and budget omb and the treasury department how ever have generally opposed

viewing airports as local responsibility some federal monies were spen t on airports during the 1930s about 150 million but only as part of federal work relief activities such as works progress administration wpa projects the national defense need for strong system of airports during world war ii led to the first major federal support for airport cons truction after the war the federal airport act of 1946 pl 79377 hereafter referred to as the 1946 act continued federal aid under the federal aid to airports program although at lower levels than during the war years under the 1946 act funds were appropriated annually from the general fund of the us tr easury initially much of this spending supported policy of conversion of military airports to civilian use in the 1960s substantial funding also went to upgrade and extend runways for use by commercial jets109 by the end of the 1960s congestion both in the air and on the ground at us airports was seen as evidence by some th at
