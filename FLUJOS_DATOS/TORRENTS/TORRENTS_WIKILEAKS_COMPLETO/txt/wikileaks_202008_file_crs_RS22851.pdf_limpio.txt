previously introduced legislation it would also provide tax credit as an optio nal alternative to th current annual rental payments this credit would be subject to neither income tax nor selfemployment tax background the conservation reserve pr ogram began in 1985 as program designed to remove highly erodible croplands from current crop production it was established by the food security act of 19851 and has been expanded and exte nded by subsequent legislation2 the program provides for annua l rental payments to land owners or operators who agree to enroll their qualifying land in the program enrollment requires them to remove land from production and genera lly refrain from using the land commercially they must also follow an approved conservation pla n in return they receive annual paymentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22851crs2 3 see crs report rl34457 for more information about the irss positions regarding including crp payments as selfemployment income 4 irs notice

marginal tax rate of 35 for the entire amount and state marginal tax of 6 7 some individuals would have an effective tax rate that was lower for others it could be higher expenses to offset income would lower the taxes paid other income would affect the extent to which the income was taxed at the marginal rate phaseouts of itemized deductions and exemption amounts can result in more tax being paid because more is subject to higher marginal rates 8 see eg hr 4073 hr 5169 s 665 s 1316 108th congress hr 923 hr 2347 s 312 s 315 107th congress hr 4064 s 2344 hr 4212 s 2422 106th congress these

treated this income as selfemployment income for those who tinued to farm other land connected to the crp land although the irs initially treated th payments as rental income for those not otherwise engaged in farming and therefore not subject to selfemployment tax that treatment has changed over the years3 in 2006 the irs issued proposed revenue ruling that would treat virtually all crp annua l payments as selfemployment income4 net selfemployment income is subject to 153 selfemployment tax since crp annual payments are also subject to income tax the total tax an individual must pay on crp payments is gene rally between about 255 and 566 of the total received if the crp payments are subject to selfemployment tax7 congressional response several bills have been introduced in r ecent congresses to completely exclude crp payments from selfemployment income8 most were simply referred to committee and hearings were held9 during the first session of the 110th congress two simila r

bill provides two alternatives that would provide some relief to taxpayers the first offers an optional tax credit in lieu of crp payments the second explicitly exempts crp paymen ts from selfemployment tax for certain taxpayers crp annual payments would remain subject to in come tax for all recipients the credit would be subject to neither income nor selfemployment taxes tax credit as proposed in the farm bill participants in the crp could elect to receive an annual tax credit12 rather than receiving the annual rental payments13 this credit would be subject to neither income nor selfemployment tax14 those who did not elect to receive the credit would continue to receive the annual rental payments the amount of the cr edit would be the same as the amount of the annual rental payment each electing participant would otherwise have received15 the credit could be used to offset current years ta xes but would not be refundable16 however any excess could be carried forward and used against tax in future years17 the credit would not be allowed as either an original credit or as carryforward in any fiscal year after fy201218 early termination of crp contract generally involves repayment of all payments received from the program since the beginning of the contract19 the proposed credit would be treated differently it would be recaptured only on prorated basis for the fiscal year in which the contract was terminated and the credit allowed20 exclusion from selfemployment income for certain taxpayers the farm bill would exclude crp payments from selfemployment income for those receiving regular retirement benefits from social security as well as those receiving social security disability benefits21 it is silent as to the treatment of crp payments received by all others given the current position of the irs it seems likely that this silence would result in these payments being considered selfemployment income for allhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22851crs4 22

payments after federal income tax but before either selfemployment or state income taxes on the other hand an individual whose marginal rate is 10 would net 90 of the crp payments after federal income

adding 26 usc 30dc2bothers22 the committee report for the heartland hab itat harvest and horticulture act of 2007 in addressing that acts identi cal provision stated the treatment of conservation reserve progra m payments received by other entities is not changed23 analysis of the taxrelated crp proposals in the farm bill tax credit tax credit reduces taxes dollarfo rdollar most tax credits are not refundable and current tax credit is subject to federal income ta x or selfemployment tax24 in this regard the proposed credit is di fferent it is different than most credits however because it can be carried forward to subsequent tax year if not used in full in the current one25 those opposing the proposed credit may argue th at it is regressive in nature in that it will provide the most benefit to those whos income is highest this benefit could occur in two different ways since the cred it would not be subject to either income or selfemployment taxes those in the higher tax brackets would receive greater tax benefit from nontaxability than would those in lower tax brackets26 additionally those with higher income would be more likely to have tax liabilities that equa l or exceed the credit amount27 because of the time value of money t hose who are able to fully use the credit will receive greater value from the credit than those who must carry part of the credit forward to subsequent year those in favor of the credit may point out th at one is forced to take the credit and one is prevented from doing so this allows all parties to examine their own situations and determine whether the credit is more beneficial to them than is the direct annual payment arguably even those who cannot use the credit in full in the first year may still derive more net benefit from the credit than they would from the direct payment since they would have to pay income tax on that direct payment and in many cases would also have to pay selfemployment tax thus even those in the 10 marginal tax bracket couldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22851crs5 28 this assumes that the crp annual payment woul d be subject to both federal income and self employment taxes but not state taxes 29 srept

security act 42 usc 402 33 these benefits are received under 223 of th social security act 42 usc 423 34 the proposed bill would not exclude crp payments from selfemployment income for other retirees such as military civil service and state retirees or those receiving disability benefits from veterans affairs or some other source unless they were concurrently receiving either social security retirement benefits or ssi benefits 35 earned income is income such as wages and net selfemployment income unearned income is other income interest dividends rent s royalties pensions etc unearned income has effect on the amount received as regular so cial security retirement benefits though it can affect the degree to which such benefits are subject to income taxrealize greater benefit from the credit than direct payment if they were able to use at least 75 of the credit in the initial year28 other arguments in favor of the credit may come from those who believe that the irss treatment of crp payments as selfemployment income is wrong or has been expanded too far they may also argue that the credit provides an incentive needed to encourage enrollment in the crp the committee report indicates that the reason for the change in the law is to provide additional incentives to encourage eligible producers to establish longterm resource conser ving covers on ligible farmland29 on the other hand the effect on the credit if contract is terminated early is rather mild when compared to the total repayment requirement for regular crp payments so it is arguable that the credit might encourage people to enroll but might not encourage them to remain enrolled long term some may argue that there is need for further incentives since there has been competitive bidding process under which appli cants have tried to assure acceptance of their bids by offering their land in return for annual payments below the allowed rental values30 however rising commodity prices may reduce interest in participating in the crp31 exclusion from selfemploymen t tax for certain individuals unlike earlier proposed legislation that would ve excluded all crp payments from self employment income the farm bill would exclude only those payments received by retirees and the disabled even these would be limited to those individuals who were receiving benefits from either regular retirement32 or disability33 under the social security act34 both regular retirement benefits nd disability benefits received from social security have links to other earned income35 received in the case of regular retirement benefits received prior to reaching full retirement age the benefits are reduced by 1httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22851crs6 36 for 2008 that limit is 13560 how work affects your

pursuant to your participation in the crp are not includible in computing net earnings from selfemployment 39 srept 110206 at 9 40 since credits cannot be carried forwar d beyond fy2012 some credit amount could be permanently lostfor every 2 by which the recipients ear ned income exceeds statutory annual limit36 receipt of disability benefits from social s ecurity is predicated on disability that prevents the recipient from any work that would result in earned income37 if crp payments were excluded from the definition of income subject to self employment tax for those receiving regular social security retirement benefits some might argue that many recipients would receive double benefit they would not be required to pay selfemployment tax on the income and the income would not reduce their benefits further argument might be made that those receiving social security disability benefits would also be receiving double benefit they would not be required to pay selfemployment tax on the income and the income could not be considered evidence of an ability to engage in substantial gainful activity in each case social security beneficiaries would be exempt from funding the program under which they receive benefits others may argue that excluding crp payments from selfemployment income for social security beneficiaries complies with the rationale behind the irss position in an early private letter ruling38 those who are retired are not in the trade or business of farming simply by virtue of having land enrolled in the crp the committee report sheds light on the considerations behind this provision in the farm bill it says only that the committee believes that the correct measurement of income for selfemployment tax purposes in the cases of retired or disa bled individuals does not include conservation reserve program payments39 the report does not explain why the payments are specifically excluded only for retirees and the disabled nor does it explain why they are specifically excluded only for those receiving benefits from social security conclusion for fy2008 through fy2012 this provision if enacted would assure crp participants of choice in the taxation of their crp benefits they could choose the nonrefundable credit and shield their benefits from both inco and selfemployment tax but potentially postpone or even eliminate40 some of the benefit if their tax liability does not equal or exceed their credit they coul d choose to receive full payment benefits each year pay income and selfemployment tax on those benefits and po ssibly generate future social security benefits the bill does not however assure participants similar choice beyond 2012 nor does it clarify whether crp annual payments generally should be treated as selfemployment income an issue that has not yet been addressed by congress
