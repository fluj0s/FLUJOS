federally insured credit unions5 after six years of experience with this congressionally mandated system the ncua is seeking adjustments that provide supervisory flexibility and incorporate more riskbased approach the objective of pca is to minimize the probability of credit union insolvency through early intervention by the federal regulator pca establishes net worth ratio framework that requires pr ogressively more stringent mandatory and discretionary regulatory actions for credit unions with low or declining net worth levels net worth is all of the cr edit unions retained earnings6 curia would provide more flexibility to the current statutory requirements of the pca system the bill would reduce the standard net worth ratio requirement for credit unions to level comparable to

the financial accoun ting standards board title ii economic growth this title amends the authority of federal credit unions to make member business loans many of the financial services provided by credit unions are similar to those offered by banks and thrifts but credit unions are distinguishable because of their cooperative framework and unique charter re quirements individual cred it unions are owned by their membership credit unions can make loans only to their members to other credit unions and to credit union organizations this title would enhance credit union member service and help to maintain credit union competitiveness by making adjustments to the statutory restrictions on member business loans currently the aggregate limit on credit unions net member business loan balances is the lesser of 175 times the credit unions ne t worth or 1225 of the credit unions total assets curia would replace this limitation with flat rate of 20 of the total assets of credit union in

that are equal to or less than 50000 curia would amend the definition to exclude loans of 100000 or lesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22212crs4 7 individual credit unions are owned by their memb ership
