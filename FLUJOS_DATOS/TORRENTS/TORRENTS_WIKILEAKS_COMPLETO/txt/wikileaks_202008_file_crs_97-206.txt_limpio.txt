the interior see its world wide web site at httpwwwdoigov bureau of land management the bureau of land management blm manages approximately 264 million acres of public land primarily in the west additionally the agency manages 300 million acres of minerals underlying federal and private lands throughout the country the management of public lands has been very controversial in recent years particularly with respect to proposals to change the way it manages grazing mining and logging as well as recreation access across public lands and wild horses and burros the administration requested 1122 billion in fy1998 current budget authority for the blm 32 million more than enacted for fy1997 excluding 106 million of emergency fy1997 appropriations the largest increases were for management of land and resources 15 million and wildland fire management 28 million the request also included decrease of 12 million in payments in lieu of taxes payments to local governments on july 15 1997 the house approved 1129 billion in fy1998 current budget authority an increase of nearly 7 million over the presidents budget request and 67 million less than enacted for fy1997 including the 106 million emergency fy1997 appropriation this provides 6 million less for management of land and resources than requested by the administration and 72 million less than enacted for fy1997 for wildland fire management however the house restored the 12 million in payments in lieu of taxes resulting in the same funding as in fy1997 the senate approved 1138 billion in fy1998 current budget authority for the blm an increase of 10 million over the house allowance and 17 million more than requested this includes 9 million less than requested for management of lands and resources 3 million more than enacted for fy1997 and 3 million more than the administrations request and house allowance for wildland fire management 69 million less than enacted for fy1997 the senate also approved 124 million for pilt payments 225 million more than requested and 105 million more than both the house allowance and the fy1997 funding level the conference committee agreed to nearly as much funding 1136 billion as the senate had approved the agreement included more for management of lands and resources than either the house or senate versions but less than was requested wildland fire management was reduced to the level requested that was approved by the house pilt was funded at 120 million 4 million less than the senate but 65 million more than the house and 185 million more than the request as with last year several blm policy issues are addressed in general provisions of the interior and related agencies appropriations act for fy1998 first section 107 of the house bill would have prohibited implementation of final rule or regulation concerning highway rightsofway across federal land pursuant to section 2477 of the revised statutes rs 2477 unless expressly authorized by an act of congress the rs 2477 issue has been contentious since the current administration changes the interpretation of the statute from prior administrations interpretations this prohibition was included in the fy1996 and fy1997 interior appropriations act section 110 of pl 104134 and section 108 pf pl 104208 respectively the senate struck the rs 2477 language in section 107 of the fy1998 interior appropriations bill arguing that section 108 of the fy1997 act was intended as permanent law this interpretation was upheld by recent opinion from the comptroller general opinion b277719 aug 20 1997 the conference agreement excluded the provision with the managers noting that this was to be construed as contradicting or diminishing the permanence of section 108 of the fy1997 interior appropriations act second the issue of whether to continue mineral patents under the mining law of 1872 and at what price title to the land may be transferred to the claimant for 250 or 500 per acre has been subject in the debate over mining law reform in recent years moratorium on accepting and processing patent applications for minerals was included in the fy1996 interior appropriations act only after the house had twice recommitted the conference report because the moratorium did not cover the entire year section 314 of the fy1997 interior appropriation act extended the moratorium enacted in the fy1996 act for all of fy1997 section 314 of the fy1998 interior appropriations act as passed the house and senate and as agreed to by the conference continues this moratorium for further information on the blm

information about the blm on the world wide web see blms media alert at httpwwwblmgovnhpnewsalertshtml fish and wildlife service the conference committee approved 7454 million for fwsan increase of 748 million over fy1997 and 575 million over the presidents request the house had passed 7251 million and the senate 7287 million the proposed increase falls primarily within resource management which includes the endangered species program fisheries and refuge management among other things which would go from 5250 to 5948 million offset by decreases in other programs the conference proposes significant decrease for construction down 142 million though not as large as the decrease proposed in the presidents budget down 147 million the committee approved 108 million the fy1997 level for the national wildlife refuge fund which provides payments to local governments in recognition of reduction of the local tax base due to the presence of federal land both the president and the house had proposed 7 decrease the payment levels have been controversial since the small additions of land to the national wildlife refuge system over the last several years mean that reduced dollars must be spread still further the situation has produced pressure on congress to increase the appropriation especially since local governments often incorrectly view the payments as entitlements even though they are actually subject to annual appropriations the endangered species act program remains the most controversial program within fws for fy1998 the committee proposes to increase candidate conservation to 570 million 21 listing to 519 million 38 consultation to 238 million 327 and recovery to 425 million 717 the conference committee accepted the house figure of 519 million for the listing function which includes designation of critical habitat and included its specific cap at this figure in the bill itself the effect would be to limit the discretion of the agency to transfer funds for additional listings eg if lawsuits mandate agency action on listing certain species without cap either funding would have to be transferred away from ongoing listing activities to meet the additional requirements of the lawsuit or from other programs within the agencys resources management function with the cap court order to carry forward listing decision on particular species will turn listing into zero sum game at least at fiscal level the listing of some species or designation of their critical habitat would preclude the listing of others fws will welcome this change as protection of other programs whose budgets it wishes to protect the administration and the conference committee both supported 060 decrease from 14085 million to 14000 million for the grants to states under the endangered species act the administration has been trying to improve the participation of states in certain aspects of the and this reduction in grants may make any increase in participation problematic in the committee bill land acquisition is slated to increase to 626 million an increase of 182 million over fy1997 and 181 million over the presidents request for further information on

see its world wide web site at httpwwwfwsgov national park service the national park service nps oversees the 374 units that comprise the national park system including 5 new units created by the 104th congress the total fy1998 nps budget request was 159 billion 163 million more than the fy1997 appropriation the house approved fy1998 nps appropriation of 156 billion and the senate approved 160 billion the conferees upped the total to 165 billion the budget proposal would increase spending for nps operations by 657 million from 1155 billion in fy1997 to 1220 billion in fy1998 to cover number of the 113 provisions of the omnibus parks and public lands act pl 104333 passed at the end of the 104th congress the budget proposal also includes 100 million to help restore the everglades 25 million for the presidio trust fund in san francisco 10 million for matching grants to restore historic buildings at african american schools and 218 million appropriation for elwha dam acquisition in washington state there is broad bipartisan agreement that nps operations be funded commensurate with the budget request park service operations received substantial increase of 79 million more than in fy1997 for total of 1234 billion these increases in operations funding demonstrate the administrations and the congress priority for supporting the parks the money would be used for among other things 1 acrosstheboard increase at all park units for maintenance resource stewardship and for visitor services the house had approved major change in the ongoing demonstration entrance and user fee program to allow participating federal land management agencies to retain all revenues that they collect both from demonstration program fees and from base fees that formerly were sent to the us treasury this change would result in potentially millions of dollars that could help reduce maintenance backlogs and operational shortfalls the committee report states the intent is to supplement appropriations and that it would not offset the additional dollars with appropriations reductions in future years the senate omitted this language from its version of the bill however the conferees agreed with the house and adjusted the fee program to provide significant supplemental revenue the administration requested 520 million for heritage partnerships program the program is in response to the designation of 10 new heritage areas in last years omnibus parks bill provision to create comprehensive federal heritage area program that would prioritize and standardize the designation process was removed from that bill at the last minute the heritage partnership initiative in the current appropriations bill somewhat resembles previous legislation opposed by property rights advocates to create heritage area program the conferees approved 540 million for the partnerships program initiative park service construction allocations would have been reduced by 18 under the administration budget request from 183 million in fy1997 to 150 million in fy1998 the conferees who also viewed construction to include necessary maintenance items restored nps construction to 183 million or 33 million more than the

sites significant to the cultural heritage of the us although private nonprofit corporation the national trust receives federal funding through the authority of the national historic preservation act

information through expansion of the usgs national waterquality assessment program with new initiative to protect 75 key metropolitan areas from toxic pollution in their water supply the usgs will collaborate with the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and the us environmental protection agency in collecting and analyzing data to provide information upon which management regulatory and monitoring decisions can be made an increase of 9 million is requested to support this effort another increase is for 3 million to support continuing and expanded work carried out by the global seismographic network gsn the increase will provide better operation of the usgs portion of the gsn including collection and distribution of data much of the global seismographic network has been designated as part of the international monitoring system being developed to verify compliance with the recently signed comprehensive test ban treaty the administration has also requested an increase of 75 million for biological research to assist land managers within bureaus of the doi the increase will improve longterm monitoring of biological resources and make information available electronically research will address weeds in the west exotic species in the east chemical contaminants affecting fish and wildlife and restoration of degraded land and fisheries these proposed increases are to be partly offset by program decreases including expected savings from reinventing government ii initiatives 68 million decreases in the hazards resources and processes program 17 million 40 million from water resources investigations and reductions of 05 million in facilities and general administration in response to congressional directives the usgs has undertaken several actions the usgs is reserving 20 of funds within the national cooperative geologic mapping program for the competitive matchingfund statemap component of the program in response to another directive the usgs has undertaken thorough review of nonfuel mineral resource data collection and storage in alaska in response to directive to investigate consolidation of federal mapping activities contract has been awarded and final report is expected by september 30 1997 the usgs will also initiate review by the national academy of sciences and report on the biological research activity of the usgs the usgs is also working to augment and further develop the usgs strategic plan 19962005 to reflect the merger of the national biological service with the usgs the plan development schedule calls for consultation with congress and others in order to meet the september 1997 deadline for the 1999 implementation of the government performance and results act the house passed an appropriation increase of 157 million over the fy 1997 enacted for the us geological survey which is 104 million above the administrations request this amount would bring the funding total to 7558 million compared to the request nearly half of the increase 49 million would be in the national mapping program other major increases would be for biological research 28 million and geologic hazards resource and processes 15 million the senate recommended an increase of 128 million over the request bringing the total to 7582 million this is 24 million over the house allowance among the major differences the senate recommendation would increase the national mapping program by 19 million 3 million less than the house increase geologic hazards resource and processes would be increased 75 million over the budget estimate and biological research would be increased 22 million the conference agreed to an appropriation of 7592 million for the usgs which is 191 million increase over fy 1997 this is 34 million higher than the house and 1 million higher than the senate recommendations the largest increase over last years funding is in the area of biological research which increased 77 million geologic

onshore leases are distributed to states in which they were collected the general fund of the us treasury and various designated programs revenues from the offshore leases are allocated among the

same level of funding for fy1997 but about 20 million less than funding in fy1996 increased revenues from the recent leases in the gulf of mexico are expected to compensate for this recent reduction in funding the house approved 1458 million the major difference coming from the use of offshore revenue receipts the senate approved 1418 million agreeing with the house on the use of ocs receipts but

mms carries out its functions and whether some of its responsibilities should be vested with the states critics of the agency pointing to reported discrepancies between posted prices and fair market value prices that are the basis for royalty valuation argue that the us treasury is being underpaid mms has proposed rule change for crude oil valuation that would rely less on posted price and more on futures contracts traded on the new york mercantile exchange nymex to better reflect fair market value oil industry officials have criticized using the nymex as benchmark and have offered number of other options for benchmarks further they would like the mms to use the royalty in kind rik approach that would allow mms to receive royalties in the form of oil produced then resell the oil for cash report language accompanying the interior appropriations for fy1997 directs mms to collect underpaid royalties separate legislation enacted pl 104185 in the 104th congress authorized interested states that demonstrate competence to collect royalties from federal oil and gas leases the mms is scheduled to adopt final rules by august 1997 that would allow certain states to assume one or more royalty functions of the mms the mms functions that could be delegated to the states include reporting of production and royalties error correction and automated verification ocs moratoria during fy1996 as the 104th congress revisited many regulatory programs the ocs outer continental shelf moratorium on leasing activity was debated in some depth in the house interior appropriations subcommittee which voted to repeal the leasing bans in previous appropriations since the early 1980s the moratoria had been approved annually without extensive discussion each year congress banned the expenditure of appropriated funds for any leasing activity on environmentally sensitive areas of the ocs in 1990 president bush issued directive which parallels the moratoria essentially banning ocs leasing activity in places other than the texas louisiana and alabama offshore the executive branch ban remains in effect with the fy1996 appropriation the full house appropriations committee kept the ban in place the house approved the moratoria and the senate appropriations committee concurred with the moratoria language in the fy1996 interior appropriations bill for fy1997 both the house and senate appropriations bills and the omnibus consolidated appropriations act included language to continue the leasing moratoria the fy1998 legislation continues them following well established legislative pattern that has been included in the administrations leasing plans as well the moratoria apply only to environmentally sensitive areas with the exception of the california ocs little hydrocarbon production has occurred in these regions leasing continues in the central and western gulf of mexico where recent lease sales have been quite robust during 1996 the spring central gulf sale resulted in 606 tracts leased for total bonuses of 352 million the fall western gulf sale resulted in 902 tracts leased for 512 million and the central gulf auction held march 5 1997 set an all time record attracting 1790 bids for 1032 tracts high bids totaled 824 million this was the last sale under the 19921997 leasing plan the ocs leasing plan for the 1997 to 2002 period includes central gulf auction to take place in august 1997 the new plan embodies the congressional moratoria but envisions continued annual lease sales in gulf coast planning areas where lease sales have attracted great interest during 1996 and 1997 as the nations oil imports rise to half of total consumption in addition to the central and western gulf sales are planned in the beaufort sea chukchi sea hope basin cook inletshelikof straight and the gulf of alaska the timing of these lease sales is several years off and the level of interest and the amount of revenues that might accrue to the government are

abandoned mine lands aml fund with fees levied on coal production to reclaim abandoned sites that posed serious health or safety hazards congress intention was that individual states and indian tribes would develop their own regulatory programs to enforce uniform minimum standards established by law and regulations as reliance upon the state agencies has increased the regulatory part of osms budget has decreased and the agency has been downsized osm is required to maintain oversight of state regulatory programs the administration request for fy1998 at 2711 million was virtually the same with the 2718 million provided to osm for fy1997 of this total 937 million was for regulation and technology programs reduction of 09 million from fy1997 the administrations aml request for fy1998 was 1773 million which owing to boost to 5 million for the appalachian clean streams initiative would net out to reduction of nearly 670000 in grants to states and tribes for reclamation appropriations for aml activities are based on states current and historic coal production minimum program states are states with lower coal production that nevertheless have sites needing reclamation the minimum funding level for these states was increased to 2 million in 1992 however over the objection of these states congress appro priated 15 million to minimum program states in fy1996 and fy1997 both the house and

affairs the key issues for the bureau of indian affairs bia are the reorganization and downsizing of the agency and the movement toward greater tribal influence on the agencys programs and expenditures the bia is under intense pressure to reorganize from the tribes the administration and congress but the proposals from the three sources have not always been in agreement additional issues raised by proposed provisions of the fy1998 interior appropriations bill include taxation of certain indian businesses equitable distribution of bia funding among tribes and tribal sovereign immunity from suit greater tribal control over federal indian programs has been the goal of indian policy since the 1970s in the bia this policy has taken three forms tribal contracting to run individual bia programs under the indian selfdetermination act pl 93638 as amended tribal compacting with the bia to manage all or most of tribes bia programs under the selfgovernance program pl 103413 and shifting programs into portion of the bia budget called tribal priority allocations tpa where the tribes have more influence on allocations through tribal consultation with the bia on its budget proposals and through tribes option to request the bia to reprogram budgeted amounts based on the tribes priorities tpa accounts for about 47 of the bia operating budget in fy1997 including most of the bia funding for tribal governments operations human services courts and law enforcement and community development under the administrations national performance review reinventing government initiative the bia is currently pursuing restructuring and downsizing through the tribal shares process whereby tribes and the bia negotiate procedure for determining those bia functions that are inherently federal and those functions that are available for tribal management including each tribes share of funds for the latter functions provision in the bia administrative provisions of the omnibus consolidated appropriations act for fy1997 made bia central office and certain other funds unavailable for tribal shares distribution in fy1997 and the house retained the administrative provision for fy1998 congress in fy1997 appropriations committee report language had directed the bia to proceed with reorganization and consolidation of central area and agency offices and to develop reorganization plan but the house report on fy1998 interior appropriations hrept 105163 expressed disappointment in the bias response to that directive and ordered the bia to consolidate small downsized agencies into area or other agency offices during the congressional debate over fy1997 interior appropriations congress considered but ultimately did not approve number of proposals affecting the bia among such unsuccessful proposals were provision requiring the secretary of the interior to propose and put into effect where tribe agreed formula distributing most bia appropriated funds directly to tribes provision making tribes subject to suit in state or federal court for actions impacting private property provision preventing any new interior department regulations on indian gaming compacts and provision prohibiting the secretary from using his general authority to take land into trust for tribe unless the tribe had agreed with state and local governments on the collection of state and local retail sales taxes from nonmembers of the tribe some of these proposals have also been put forward in the 105th congress in separate legislation congress did add provision to the omnibus consolidated appropriations act for fy1997 that amended the rhode island narragansett land settlement act of 1978 pl 95 395 to make the indian gaming regulatory act inapplicable to narragansett lands this provision was opposed by tribes while the issue has arisen in the 105th congress in hearing before the house resources committee and in separate legislation hr 1983 it has not appeared during consideration of fy1998 interior appropriations in the 105th congress consideration of the fy1998 interior appropriations bill number of the same proposals have been put forward as were proposed for the fy1997 bill the house again considered proviso that would prohibit the secretary from using his general authority to take land into trust for tribe unless the tribe had agreed with state and local governments on the collection of state and local retail sales taxes from nonmembers of the tribe the house defeated the proposed floor amendment 216208 the senate appropriations committee did not offer such an amendment nor did the conference committee consider it in their report the senate appropriations committee did add provisions to the fy1998 interior appropriations bill that would 1 waive tribal governments sovereign immunity to civil suit in federal court if tribe accepted tpa funding and 2 require bia to develop several alternate formulas to distribute tpa funding on the basis of need taking into account tribal business revenues including gaming the committee proposed implementing the needsbased formula in fy1999 and would require tribes to provide information on their business revenues annually to receive tpa funding in the following fiscal year proponents of the waiver of tribal sovereign immunity argue that tribal immunity to suit denies due process to nonindians and that the provision would help state and local governments collect excise taxes on tribal sales to nonmembers while opponents argue that federal indian selfdetermination policy would be ruined by the immunity waiver that tribes accepting tpa funds would be bankrupted by such suits and that tribes refusing the immunity waiver and losing tpa would not have enough funding to operate the tribal immunity waiver provision was withdrawn on the floor of the senate although the leadership of the senate indian affairs committee promised hearings and committee vote on promised bill regarding tribal sovereign immunity the conference committee did not touch on the issue in its report proponents of tpa funding distribution based on need claim that bia funding is inequitably distributed that poorer tribes do not receive adequate funding that tribal tpa funds received percapita do not correspond with indicators of tribal need and that only 30 of tpa funding is based on formulas opponents respond that almost all tribes are in poverty that meanstesting of tpa funds violates the federal trust responsibility to tribes and that the impacts of meanstesting tpa funding have not been fully analyzed the senate amended the meanstesting provision as reported by the committee to drop the requirements for formula and tribal income data and to distribute fy1998 tpa funds in excess of fy1997 levels after certain adjustments in such way that each tribe receives the minimum funding recommended by the 1994 report of the joint tribalbiadoi task force on bia reorganization 160000 with allocation of any remaining tpa funds based on recommendation of tribal task force in addition report on tpa distribution issues was requested from the general accounting office by several senators the conference committee agreed to the senates amended provision modifying only the makeup of the task force its deadline and procedures if it cannot reach agreement the senate also added other indianrelated provisions to hr 2107 including approving land claim settlement between florida and the miccosukee tribe restricting uses of an indian cemetery in kansas and prohibiting the secretary of the interior from reviewing or approving any tribalstate gaming compacts unless the compacts were approved by the state the conference committee agreed to these provisions with amendments to the miccosukee settlement relating to its effects on taxes and services bias fy1997 direct appropriations enacted to date are 164 billion for fy1998 the administration

the interior departments fy1998 budget justifications indicate that in past years american samoa has received about 5 million on average in annual construction grants the fy1997 appropriation was 61 million according to the justifications however over the years american samoa has fallen further and further behind in keeping up with the infrastructure needs of rapidly growing population both the house and senate appropriations committees recommended the same reallocation of the cnmis 277 million payment and the same levels of funding for american samoa as contained in the presidents request while requesting an increase in funding for american samoa the interior department justifications also express concerns about financial problems in the territory very little progress has been made in the last year to improve the governments financial condition or the general control environment the justifications note that congress with the departments support withheld 2 million in construction funding for fy1997 in response to american samoas failure to implement the recommendations in an agreedupon financial recovery plan both the house and senate appropriations committee reports make

green sales from 2751 bbf to 2505 bbf the house and senate modestly increased new green sales to 2525 bbf the administration had also proposed to limit the use of the salvage sale fund and to establish new forest ecosystem restoration and maintenance ferm fund for watershed and wildlife habitat improvement stand density reduction and ecosystem restoration but legislation to enact these changes has not yet been introduced forest roads road construction in the national forests continues to be controversial some interests oppose new roads because roads increase access to areas they believe should be preserved in pristine condition because roads are major source of erosion stream sedimentation and other environmental degradation and because road funding is asserted to be corporate subsidy for the timber industry supporters argue that access roads are needed for forest protection eg from wildfire and for timber harvesting and other onsite uses and maintain that roads can be built without causing significant environmental problems the administration proposed to end the use of purchaser road credits to finance road construction this system authorized in section 42 of the 1964 national forest roads and trails act pl 88657 78 stat 1089 16 usc 532538 allows the forest service to build forest development roads through requirements on timber purchasers and to compensate those purchasers with credits that can generally be used to pay for timber1 over the past decade this funding system has provided more than third of road construction funding and more than 90 of the mileage built the administration proposed to simply make the specified road construction contract requirement to be paid like any other cost the purchaser must incur and the approach used for road building on bureau of land management timber sales rather than grant credits the house interior appropriations committee included provision limiting the program to small businesses with 50 million ceiling on the amount that could be obligated in fy1998 this matches the ceiling that has been included in previous bills on the house floor the small business provision was removed by point of order then an amendment to reduce road appropriations by 415 million 48 and to limit road credits to 1 was amended by vote of 211209 to reduce road appropriations by 56 million 7 and to cap road credits at 25 million the modified amendment passed the house 246179 the senate increased road funding by 2 million above the requested level and directed the forest service to continue the purchaser

in the petroleum acquisition account when this was longer practical source for funding the administration and congress approved sales of spr oil to finance some program costs in fy1996 and all of them in fy1997 in its fy1998 budget request the administration asked for conventional appropriation of 209 million to operate and maintain the spr during fy1998 some members of congress have supported past sales of spr oil in the interests of reducing federal spending critics of spr sales have argued that spr oil was not intended and should not be used to generate offsetting revenues they further argued that with the spr inventory reduced from nearly 591 million barrels to 565 additional sales would be imprudent from an energy security perspective as well on june 17 1997 the interior subcommittee of the house appropriations committee approved language to require sale of spr to fund the program at the level requested by the administration for fy1998 leadership of the commerce committee and its subcommittee on energy and power expressed their opposition to the sale in letter to representative livingston the chair of the appropriations committee however the house appropriations committee retained the sale in the version reported to the floor noting in its report that the committee expects this to be the final year in which oil will be sold to pay for spr operations on september 18

that is made available to the indian health service to be used to restructure indian health care delivery systems to alaskan natives the senate appropriations committee approved 3 million for grants to tribes and indian organizations to support efforts to reduce the incidence of diabetes among american indians and alaskan natives the senate committee considers it imperative that scarce funds available to meet the health needs of alaska natives be professionally and prudently managed to provide the maximum amount of high quality health services to alaska natives the senate bill replaced the house language prohibiting ihs funds from being used to restructure indian health care delivery systems to alaskan natives with language relating to consortium for the provision of health services

93531 as amended was the end result of dispute between the hopi and navajo tribes involving land originally set aside by the federal government for reservation in 1882 pursuant to the 1974 act lands were partitioned between the two tribes and members of one tribe who ended up on the other tribes land were to be relocated most relocatees are navajo large majority of the estimated 3402 navajo families formerly on the land partitioned to the hopi have already relocated under the act but the house appropriations committee in 1997 estimates that 534 navajo families have yet to be relocated including 84 families still on hopi partitioned land many of whom refuse to relocate negotiations had gone forward among the two tribes the navajo families on hopi partitioned land and the federal government especially regarding hopi tribe claims against the united states proposed settlement agreement was reached on december 14 1995 between the united states and the hopi tribe attached to the settlement agreement was separate accommodation agreement between the hopi tribe and the navajo families which provided for 75year leases for navajo families on hopi partitioned land the navajohopi land dispute settlement act of 1996 pl 104301 approved the settlement agreement between the united states and the hopi tribe not all issues have been resolved by these agreements however and opposition to the agreements and the leases is strong among some of the navajo families navajo families with homesites on hopi partitioned land faced march 31 1997 deadline for signing leases an initial hopi report said 60 of the 80 homesites affected had signed the leases the hopi tribe has called for enforcement of relocation against navajo families without leases like the fy1997 interior appropriations act the fy1998 interior appropriations bill passed by the house and senate contains proviso forbidding onhir from evicting any navajo family from hopi partitioned lands unless replacement home is provided this language appears to prevent onhir from forcibly relocating navajo families since onhir has large backlog of other families that need homes the settlement agreement approved by pl 104301 however allows the hopi tribe under certain circumstances to begin quiet possession actions against the united states in the year 2000 if navajo families on hopi partitioned land have not entered into leases with the hopi tribe congress has for long time been concerned by the slow pace of relocation and by relocatees apparent low level of interest in moving to the new lands acquired for the navajo reservation for relocatee use appropriations committee reports in 1995 and 1996 called on onhir to explore termination of the relocation program and the senate considered bill phasing out onhir the house fy1998 committee report hrept 105163 repeats the direction to prepare for termination of the program and also directs onhir to stop further development work on the new lands beyond that required to meet relocatee demand for fy1997 onhir received appropriations of 19345 million for fy1998 the administration proposed the same amount the house provided 18345 million and the senate provided 15 million the conference committee agreed with the senate amount other related agencies one of the pervasive issues for the programs and agencies delineated below is whether federal government support for the arts and culture is an appropriate federal role and if it is what should be the shape of that support if the continued federal role is not appropriate might the federal commitment be scaled back such that greater private support or state support would be encouraged each program has its own unique relationship to this overarching issue smithsonian the smithsonian institution si is museum education and research complex of 16 museums and galleries and the national zoo nine of its museums and galleries are located on the mall between the us capitol and the washington monument the smithsonian is estimated to be 70 percent federally funded federal commitment was established by initial legislation in 1846 in addition to receiving federal appropriations the smithsonian has private trust funds which include endowments donations and other revenues from its sales stores and magazine the fy1998 clinton administration budget would allow the smithsonian total of 4284 million and 3346 million of that amount would be for salaries and expenses of the total for the smithsonian 58 million is proposed for the national museum of the american indian nmai on the mall in view of current budget constraints in congress opponents of the new museum argue that the current si museums need renovation and repair and maintenance of the collection with over 139 million items more than the public needs another museum on the mall proponents feel that there has been too long delay in providing museum in washington to house the indian collection private donations to the smithsonian and fundraising campaign have brought cash and pledges worth 37 million required to meet the nonappropriated portion of project funding of this amount 15 million came from the indian community directly however the total cost of the american indian museum was estimated at 110 million the smithsonians final appropriation for fy1996 restored 15 million for the national museum of the american indian cultural resources center and the fy1997 appropriations allowed 4 million for planning and design of the american indian museum on the mall the house appropriations committee has mentioned in the fy1998 appropriations report h rept 105163 that federal funding should end at this point for the nmai because it had asked previously that the construction project be scaled down in cost and design the final fy1997 appropriation pl 104208 for the smithsonian included 371342 million funding level 317557 million for salaries and expenses for fy1997 plus 935000 to cover antiterrorist requirements the administrations fy1998 budget request for the smithsonian would be an increase of 57 million over the final fy1997 appropriation difference primarily for construction of the american indian museum the house interior appropriations subcommittee reported to the full committee bill that would increase the smithsonians salaries and expenses to 3346 million for fy1998 16 million increase over the fy1997 appropriation 3185 million and the same as the fy1998 budget for salaries and expenses however the total amount for the smithsonian including construction and repair would be 3884 million 17 million more than in fy1997 3713 million but less than the administrations fy1998 budget request 4284 million part of the house subcommittees reported increase in the smithsonian budget 50 million would be for repair and restoration of buildings the house interior appropriations subcommittee indicated that it was one of its priorities to address the backlog for maintenance and repairs in number of department of interior and related agencies programs the house reported hrept 105163 bill and the housepassed fy1998 department of interior appropriations bill s 2107 would provide the same amounts for the smithsonian as recommended by the house subcommittee on interior appropriations the senate subcommittee on interior appropriations approved 71897 and the senate appropriations committee concurred 72297 with allowing total of 3337 million for salaries and expenses slight decrease from the house allowance but 15 million increase above the fy1997 level the senate appropriations committee recommended 32 million for repair and restoration of buildings to help with the maintenance backlog in addition for construction the senate appropriations committee would allow 29 million for the first phase of construction of the american indian museum on the mall and 4 million for the design of the dulles extension of the national air and space museum the senate passed hr2107 on september 18th 1997 providing 3337 million for salaries and expenses and 402558 million for the total appropriation for the smithsonian for fy1998 on september 30 1997 the conferees adopted the conference report hrept 105337 to accompany the interior appropriations bill that would appropriate 333408 million for salaries and expenses and 402258 million for the total appropriation for the smithsonian the smithsonian marked its 150th anniversary in fy1997 and generated public programs associated with it including americas smithsonian traveling exhibit the smithsonian has indicated that the traveling exhibit free to the public was too costly for the smithsonian given the current budget and it announced that it would have to curtail it and would institute an admission charge for certain special exhibits in the smithsonian buildings on the mall in view of the trend toward diminished federal support the smithsonian has also begun to use bond issues for some construction projects including the national air and space museum extension and the renovation of the national museum of natural history for further information on the smithsonian

support for arts humanities and museums is the national foundation on the arts and the humanities composed of the national endowment for the arts nea the national endowment for the humanities neh and ims the institute of museum services now newly constituted institute of museum and library services imls the authorizing act the national foundation on the arts and the humanities act has expired but has been operating on temporary authority through appropriations law the last reauthorization for the national foundation on the arts and the humanities occurred in 1990 the 104th congress established the new institute of museum and library services under pl 104208 among the questions congress is considering is whether funding for the arts humanities and museums is an appropriate federal role and responsibility the current climate of budget constraints raises questions about the need for such support some argue that nea and neh should be abolished altogether contending that the federal government should not be in the business of supporting culture they also argue that culture can and does flourish on its own through private support proponents of federal support for arts and humanities argue that the federal government has long tradition of such support beginning with congressional appropriation of funds for works of art to adorn the us capitol in 1817 spokesmen for the private sector say that they are unable to make up the gap that would be left by the loss of federal funds for the arts some argue that abolishing or any significant reduction to nea neh and imls will curtail or eliminate the programs that have national purposes such as touring theater and dance companies radio and television shows etc the controversy involving charges of obscenity concerning small number of nea grants still remains an issue despite attempts to resolve these problems through statutory provisions to date nea projects have been judged obscene by the courts in addition federal appeals court november 5 1996 upheld an earlier decision ruling that applying the general standards of decency clause to nea grants was unconstitutional prior to this decision congress eliminated funding for most grants to individual artists in anticipation of this outcome nea had already eliminated grants to individuals by arts discipline except to maintain literature fellowships jazz masters and national heritage fellowships in the folk and traditional arts the 104th congress considered but did not enact legislation to reauthorize the national foundation on the arts and the humanities the house proposal hr 1557 and the senate bill s 856 were reported by committee but further action was taken however newly created institute of museum and library services imls was authorized through the omnibus consolidated appropriations act of 1997 merging the previous institute of museum services with library resources programs an agreement among some members of congress was made at the time of house passage of the fy1997 interior appropriations bill with the assumption that nea would be terminated in two years however the senate appropriations committee reported hr 3662 and expressed continued support for nea and neh provisions of hr 3662 became part of the omnibus consolidated appropriations act of 1997 pl 104208 allowing 99494 million for nea 110 million for neh and 22 million for ims the administrations fy1998 budget would provide 136 million for nea and neh and 26 million for the office of museum services within the institute of museum and library services the presidents committee on the arts recently released publication creative america that recommends that federal funding be restored for nea neh and imls to levels adequate to fulfill their national roles the goal expressed was for appropriations to equal 200 per person by the year 2000 for all three agencies on june 17th 1997 the house interior appropriations subcommittee reported out bill to the full appropriations committee that would appropriate 10 million to the nea for fy1998 decrease of 89494 million from the fy1997 appropriation however language was deleted that would have brought about an orderly closure of the nea the full house appropriations committee retained 10 million for nea an amendment to restore funding to the fy1997 level for nea failed for neh the subcommittee would maintain the fy1997 funding level for fy1998 of 110 million and for the office of museum services the subcommittee would provide 23390 million for fy1998 an increase of 1390 million over the fy1997 appropriation the full house appropriations committee hrept 105163 concurred in these amounts on july 10th 1997 the house agreed to rule by vote of 217 to 216 that restricted any amendment from being

percentage of funding to states for basic state arts grants and for grants to underserved populations from the current 35 to 40 in addition language emphasizing arts education was included there would be 15 cap on funds allocated to each state exempting only those grants with national impact it was recommended that there be three members of the house and three members of the senate serving on the national council on the arts and that the size of the national council be reduced to 20 both nea and neh would be given specific authority to solicit funding and to invest those funds note on

agreement between the administration and the congressional leadership provides 700 million for priority land acquisitions and exchanges from the land and water conservation fund lwcf of this amount 315 million would be available for the purchase of the headwaters forest 3500 acres of redwood forest in california 250 million and the new world mine near yellowstone national park 65 million in fy1998 and fy1999 the balance of the 385 million would be available in fiscal years 19992001 the lwcf is special account that accumulates revenues from federal outdoor recreation user fees the federal motorboat fuel tax surplus property sales and oil and gas leases on the outer continental shelf the oil and gas leases provide most of the revenues however the lwcf is not true trust fund in the way trust fund is generally understood in the private sector the fund is credited with revenues up to the established annual ceiling2 but congress must appropriate the money before it can be spent if appropriations are not made the revenues are spent on other federal programs deposits to the lwcf are in effect only an authorization of expenditures that accumulates if the funds are not appropriated the current accumulated unappropriated authorized balance in the lwcf exceeds 10 billion the house decided not to provide funding for these priority land acquisitions and exchanges because these proposals have not been authorized chairman regula of the interior subcommittee of the house appropriations committee indicated that he favored using any additional funding to address some of the 14 billion of identified backlogged maintenance in parks wildlife refuges and forest roads before acquiring additional federal land while the senate bill included the 700 million as provided for in the budget agreement the senate appropriations committee report language questioned the need for additional funds for land acquisition given significant maintenance backlogs and operational shortfalls the senate bill included language to acquire the headwaters forest and the new world mine but made the acquisitions subject to enactment of authorizing legislation the allocation of the balance of the 700 million would be determined through written approval by the house and senate appropriations committees from project list to be submitted by the administration the senate also allocated 100 million from the balance to the lwcf stateside grant program the conference committee provided 699 million of this amount up to 250 million will be available to acquire the headwaters forest and an additional 10 million to humboldt county to offset lost tax revenue and other costs and up to 65 million to acquire the new world mine and 12 million to maintain the nearby beartooth highway the conference committee added several conditions such as requiring public appraisals and adherence to the national environmental policy act both acquisitions will be delayed for 180 days after appraisals are completed to allow for further consideration by authorizing committees the balance of these funds goes to the department of the interior 272 million and the us forest service 90 million to spend on critical repair and restoration needs based on requests submitted for approval to both appropriations committees for further discussion on the land and water conservation fund see crs report 97792 enr land and water conservation fund current funding and other issues by jeff zinn 6 p title vi forest resources conservation and shortage relief the senate appropriations committee added substantial title amending the forest resources conservation and shortage relief act of 1990 title iv of the customs and trade act of 1990 pl 101382 16 usc 620 proponents of the amendments argue that the implementing rules issued and made effective on september 8 1995 60 federal register 4689046934 would have allowed the forest service to prevent domestic log transportation in certain situations and would have substantially increased the burden for identifying marking and branding and reporting on the origin of harvested timber 2 this ceiling was 200 million in fy1970 300 million annually for fy1971fy1977 and 900 million annually since fy1978 the amendments would alter the original act in several ways some of which are related to the concerns over the implementing regulations new subsection would be added to indicate that none of the restrictions intended to prevent substitution simultaneously purchasing and processing federal timber while exporting private timber from the same geographic area are intended to restrict domestic transportation and processing of timber from private lands including logs imported for domestic processing the secretary is also directed to impose reasonable requirements for identifying and tracking unprocessed timber if the benefits outweigh the compliance costs the timber is likely to be exported or substituted for federal timber and the timber is smaller than 7 inches in diameter or 8 feet in length the requirements may also be waived the amendments would make permanent the ban on log exports from state lands in washington the current ban is to be replaced by an order from the secretary of commerce on january 1 1998 requiring that 400 million board feet of timber from state lands must be processed domestically however the presidents authority to modify the secretarys order remains and has been used at least once to establish the initial ban on log exports from washington state lands in 1992 the amendments would also establish the northwestern private timber open market area defined as the state of washington within this area the restrictions on substitution of federal timber for private timber are eliminated for timber buyers and brokers ie nonlandowners without exclusive timber cutting rights also within this open market area companies are allowed to establish their sourcing areas without public comment or agency determination this contrasts with the current requirements where the agency determines sourcing areas based on timber purchasing patterns and public comment sourcing areas are authorized and established to allow timber exporters to buy federal timber in geographically and economically separate areas where they also buy nonfederal timber to supply their domestic mills the amendments would narrow the definition of unprocessed timber that cannot be exported and must therefore be tracked by excluding lowgrade sawlogs to be processed into wood chips or pulp finally the amendments would define each violation and minor infraction for determining penalties if the act is violated for additional reading crs products crs report 96563 enr department of the interior and related agencies
