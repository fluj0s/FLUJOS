to control utilization by making covered individuals aware of the cost of care in addition patients cost sharin g payments offset plan costs currently home health care is the only medicarecovered service except for clinical laboratory tests for which beneficiar ies have cost sharing medicares home health benefit has been subject to criticisms of inappropriate and overutilization partic ularly since home health spending began to rise rapidly in the late 1980s moreover some questione d if rising utilization was due to the programs financing substa ntial amount of longterm personal care by home health aides rather than medically necessary care by skilled practitioners as the law intends utilization and spending dropped dramati cally as result of 1997 change to medicares home health payment system but volatility in the pr ogram has evoked the suggestion that beneficiary cost sharing should be implemented as an additional tool for controlling program utilization utilization control through implementation of cost sharing for medicare home health services may be stymied by two factors third party insurance that would insulate some beneficiaries from actually ving to pay cost sharing arguably those who are financially better off and implementation in fy2001 of home health prospective payment system pps one objective of which was to curtail provision of unnecessary services by home health aide s arguments in favor of cost sharing include consistency within the medicare program consistency with private health insurance policies and generation of re venues to offset taxpayers costs for medicare opponents of cost sharing poi nt out that beneficiaries who use home health services are atypically low income elderly with chronic health problems and limited

nursing care and therapies and has never been intended to cover long term personal care and assistance for frail elderly or disabled individuals after st roke injury or illness some beneficiaries do not regain full independence in performing activities of daily living and require personal assistance and care on long term basis in these kinds of situations it may be difficult to determine when the need for skilled care ends and long term personal care begins although program guidelines try to clarify the distinc tion between the need for skilled care and lower levels of care 2 medicare covers snf care only if it follows hospitalization of at least 3 days medicares home health benefit cost sharing issues and options background medicare beneficiaries who are homebound are eligible for home

occupational therapy nd the services of home health aides and medical social workers beneficiaries may continue to receive occupational therapy after they longer need other skilled car or therapies and may receive home health aide or social worker services as long as they receive occupational therapy the services provided must be medically nece ssary and carried out under plan of care prescribed

1985 medicare spending for home health more than doubled over that period however tight administrative rules regarding eligibility for home health care constrained continued expansion of spending for the benefit utilization and costs did not increase significantly until settlement of class action suit in 1987 led to loosening of home health eligibility and benefit guidelines5 home health aide services controversial co mponent of medicares home health benefit is coverage of home health aide servi ces aides carry out routine medical tasks and procedures but they may also provide personal care such as bathing dressing and certa in household chores medicar coverage of home health aide services ends when patient longer qualifies for inhome skilled nursing care or therapy it is alleged that home bound beneficiaries some times continue to be certified as needing minimal intermittent skilled nursing care say two skilled nurse visits month in order to continue thei r qualification for regular visits by home health aide some say that such beneficiaries are actually receiving at charge to them long term assistance with activities of daily living which is not medically necessary and therefore outside the sc ope of medicares hom health benefit medicare payment for home health care in the early years of the program medicare reimbursed home health agencies hhas for their reasonable co sts the 1972 legislation eliminating coinsurance for part bcovered home health services also provided authority for medicare to limit its payments for services starting in 1979 medicare implemented limitations on cost reimbursements to hhas and th at general system remained in effect until october 1 2000 when medicare implemented prospective payment system pps for hhas under the pps agencies receive predetermin ed fixed amounts per 60day episode of home health care for each individua l beneficiary served beneficiaries are categorized into one of 80 different paym ent groups known as home health resourcehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31628crs3 groups or hhrgs depending on the type and intensity of care to be furnished payments are adjusted for relative differences in area wages beneficiary cost shari ng for medicare services home health care is the only medicarecovered service except for clinical laboratory tests for which beneficiaries cu rrently have cost sharing inpatient hospital stays are covered by medicare afte r the beneficiary pays deductible of 812 in 2002 but coinsurance is charged until the hospitalization exceeds 60 days most inpatient stays are shorter than 60 da ys beneficiary coinsurance per day of inpatient care is 203 for day 61 and conti nuing through day 90 after which the daily amount doubles to 406 in 2002 for days 91 through 150 days 91 through 150 are referred to as lifetime reserve days and are available only once in lifetime snf care is often the second step in the continuum of beneficiarys recuperation from an acute illness or injury patients needing daily skilled nursing care or therapy but who do not need to remain in full service acute care hospital may receive care in snf with cost sharing for the first 20 days provided the prior hospitalization lasted at least 3 days thus under current law beneficiaries have financial reason to object to moving from hospital to snf starting with day 21 in snf however beneficiarie s pay 112 per day in 2002 through day 100 but medicare covers snf care after 100 days most snf stays end before 20 days the average stay in 1999 was 23 days once beneficiary longer requires ither hospitalization or daily snf care he or she may be discharged to home wher as long as the beneficiary is homebound medicare covers medically necessary intermittent or part time skilled nursing care or restorative therapies as well as occupationa l therapy nurse aide and medical social services because there is cost shar ing for home health services under current law beneficiaries have financial reason to object to being discharged from an inpatient facility to receive home health services the ba sis for the requirement that beneficiaries be homebound in or der to qualify for home health care is to restrict the benefit to individuals who ar unable to travel to physicians or therapists office or to an outpatient facility for ongoing care once beneficiary can leave home regularly ongoing care is covered only in outpatient facilities in which services are generally less costly than when deliv ered oneonone in patients home home health costs and the cost sharing issue the costsharing features of health insurance plans include beneficiary deductibles specified amount which the patient must pay for covered care before plan payments begin coinsurance pe rcentage of plans approved amount for care or services or copayments speci fied dollar amount an enrollee must pay per unit of service such as 15 per doctor visit cost sharing is key element in the design of any health insurance plan and is used primarily to control utilization by making covered individuals aware of the cost of care patients payments also offset plan costs in the past medicares home health benefit has been subject to critic isms of inappropriate and overutilizationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31628crs4 6 ibid health care financing administration 1999 p 51 7 crs report rl31085 medicare structural re form background and options by jennifer osullivan hinda ripps chaikind and sibyl tilson july 24 2001 p 8 these concerns intensified as home health sp ending began to grow rapidly in the late 1980s rising from 20 billion in 1988 to 18 billion in 1996 an average annual increase of 31 this spending grow th reflected both increasing numbers of beneficiaries served and more than threefold increase in the average number of visits per user the causes for the increases are generally attributed to 1987 lawsuit settlement that led to liberalizations in the definition of intermittent and parttime used to determine covered services to payment system that inherently motivated hhas to provide increasing numbers of vis its per eligible be neficiary hhas were paid for each visit made to beneficiary and to lack of incentives for beneficiaries to be judicious about the amount of rvices they consumed in addition some questioned whether medicares home health be nefit was being used to cover care for those whose real need was longterm personal care and assistance rather than acute care pointing to the growing proportions of all visits that home health aide visits accounted for onethird in 1987 and 48 in 19976 in the balanced budget act of 1997 congress sought to curtail the upward trend in home health spending by im posing new limit on payments to hhas the socalled per beneficiary limit this change removed the incentives for hhas to maximize the number of visits to individual beneficiaries and reversed the increasing rate of utilization spendi ng dropped by about half by 1999 the average number of visits per home health user dropped fro m 74 in 1996 to 42 in 1999 many observers note that the dramatic decline caused by the 1997 law was much larger than had been anticipated this situation of uncont rolled spending increases followed by unanticipated decreases caused some to speculate that home health utilization and spending cannot be controlle d appropriately and effectively by rely manipulating the payment system thus they suggest dding financial incentive for beneficiaries to participate in the decision bout the quantity of care they use the first consideration regarding cost sharing for medicare home health services is whether to impose such requirement or not if on balance congress determines that new cost sharing requirement for home health care is appropriate the second consideration is how to set the amount the home health cost sharing debate arguments in favor of beneficiary cost sharing are predicated on the assumption that beneficiaries would use less care if th ey had financial incentive to do so this assertion about beneficiary behavior is difficult to ev aluate because about 24 of beneficiaries have indivi dually purchased supplemental plans commonly referred to as medigap policies about 36 have coverage obtained through current or former employer which might or might not pay home health care cost sharing depending on the plans design and about 13 are low income beneficiaries also covered by medicaid which ge nerally pays medicare cost sharing for the beneficiary 1998 data7 if new beneficiary cost sharing requirement for home health care were covered by supplemental insurance it would probably add to the cost of thosehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31628crs5 policies and some say these policies are already overly costly furthermore it might have little impact on utilization because be neficiaries with s upplemental coverage would remain insulated from the cost of care advocates of cost sharing point out that all other medicarecovered services require cost sharing except clinical laboratory tests and that cost sharing for home health services would create consistency w ithin the program however frequently heard objection to this rationale is that medicare data show that home health users are different from medicare beneficiaries in ge neral in that they tend to be older to be lower income to live alone and to have more impairments in their ability to perform activities of daily living such as bathing dressing and toileting cost sharing opponents say that these benefici aries are less able than othe rs to afford the premium for medigap policy and are unlikely to have thirdparty insurance from former employer thus it is said that home hea lth cost sharing could increase outofpocket costs for those least able to afford it thereby reducing access to needed services or hastening move to institutional longterm care cost sharing proponents respond that dicare is not welfare benefit b very low income beneficiaries receive assistance with their cost sharing through medicaid c cost sharing for other dicarecovered services does not apply differently depending on the socioeconomic status of beneficiaries and d cost sharing would deter beneficiaries from seeking to prolong minimal use of skilled care in order to use home health aides for costfree personal assistance with activities of daily living again long term care fo r those needing personal assistance is not covered by medicare another argument supporting home health cost sharing is that private health insurance plans generally require it for enrollees using home health services implementation of cost sharing for medicare home health care would move toward replication of the design features of private health insurance this factor is particularly cogent for those who advocate restructuring medicare along the lines of private insurance including doing away with the situation in which most beneficiaries have first do llar coverage meaning thir dparty insurance plan picks up the first dollars worth of health care used an issue raised in opposition to home health cost sharing focuses on the disincentives it might create for beneficiaries to agree to move down in the level of care they are receiving for instance beneficiaries who might be discharged from hospital when home health care is availabl would have financial reason to object to discharge if they would be required immediately to make another outofpocket payment once the inpatient hospital deduc tible is paid there is additional cost sharing for staying longer in the hospital at least up to the first 60 days similarly patients who might be discharged from sn f within the first 20 days while there is cost sharing would have financia l reason to object to being discharged to home health services if it implied an immediate outofpocket expenditure unless the beneficiarys other coverage would pick up the cost sharing as result hospital costs might rise if certain patients stayed longer leading to pressure to increase payments to hospitals because medicare pays snfs for each day beneficiary is in care delaying discharge to home health care could result in increased medicare snfhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31628crs6 8 medicare home health care payments to home health agencies are considerable higher than costs gao02663 may 2002payments however the disincentives are likely to apply only to beneficiaries without supplemental insurance that woul d pick up the home health cost sharing arguments made in the past about the need for beneficiary cost sharing as way to curtail overfurnishing of visits by hhas may longer be salient since implementation of the home health pps on october 1 2000 hhas do not have financial incentive to provide unnecessary home visits because medicare pays agencies one amount per 60day episode of care the only possibility for oversupply of care under the new payment system might be that agencies could stint on care during an initial 60day episode and seek certification for second episode of care for some patients thereby triggering anot her payment beneficiaries who feel they dont really need care after the first episode might object to second episode if they had financial reason to do so if data eventually indicate that the number of beneficiaries certified for multiple episodes of care is too high requirement for cost sharing for second and subsequent episodes might be appropriate finally some opponents note that impleme ntation of cost sharing would add new administrative burdens and costs to the program and to the respons ibilities of hhas overall it may be too early to know how home health utilization dynamics are working under the pps although ppss in general are designed to create incentives for providers to furnish care efficiently new medicare payment systems usually need some fine tuning as the medicare program and providers gain experience with them it is not yet clear how the new home health pps has affected utilization or spending because of problems with collection of spending data th general accounting office gao timated that in the first 6 months of the pps payments to hhas were about 35 higher on average than estimated agency costs for providing care and preliminary data also suggest that home health patients are receiving fewer visits on average than had been foreseen8 in summary beneficiary cost sharing mig ht cause more judicious use of home health if beneficiaries had financial interest in the amount of care they consumed applying cost sharing to home health woul d be consistent with beneficiary payment requirements in other components of the program and would be consistent with private health insurance design the major drawbacks are that as long as some beneficiaries have third party coverage their utilization patterns and thus the goal of controlling utilization and medicare costs might not be achieved to any significant degree moreover higher medigap policy premiums might result increasing beneficiary outofpocket co sts and perhaps forcing some to drop their medigap policies finally the new home health pps may to great extent obviate the need for beneficiarybased utiliza tion controls because the payment system longer has strong financial incentives for hhas to oversupply services although beneficiary cost sharing might be appr opriate if conti nuous and multiple 60day episodes emerge as patternhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31628crs7 9 one of the best sources of information on the effect of cost sharing on health care utilization is the rand corporations health insurance experiment carried out in the 1980s under contract with the us department of health and human services the rand health insurance experiment carried out in the 1980s concluded generally that people use fewer services when they are required to pay for them the research found that coinsurance reduces the amount of care individuals seek but once care is sought the amount received appeared to be controlled by the treating physi cian rather than the patients cost sharing however elderly individuals and medicare bene ficiaries were not included in the population studied see benefit design in health care reform patient costsharing office of technology assessment otabph112 september 1993alternative approaches to dete rmination of be neficiary cost sharing amounts some say that cost sharing is important in order to contain costs others say those savings come at the expense of deterrence of use of needed and preventive services some say cost sharing is needed to curtail use of marginal or ineffective care others that beneficiaries need protection from cost sharing that would increase their outofpocket costs any of these statements could be true depending on how the cost sharing is designed unfortunately there are data to inform the debate on the effects on elderly people of cost sh aring or alternativ designs or amounts9 applicability of cost sharing to postinstitutional care and community beneficiaries if it were to be decided that cost sharing should be implemented for home health care an initia l decision would be whether there should be distinction between care that follows hospitalization or covered snf stay and care that does not cost sharing unde r the original medicare program had such distinction if cost sharing were requi red for all patients including those with prior hospitalization there could be disincen tives for patients to agree to discharge from hospital or snf to home health car if they would be required to make an immediate outofpocket payment if cost sharing were applicable only to care not following hospitalization some community beneficiaries defined as those without prior hospitalization might seek hospitalization to avoid home health cost sharing when they have insurance that pays the hospital inpatient deductible if supplemental insurance were to pay home h ealth care cost sharing also the effects of home health cost sharing for all benefi ciaries with supplemental insurance would be neutralized home health care is intended for those whose primary need is for skilled care and the services are required to be reas onable and medically necessary in many community beneficiary cases medical necessity is hard to establish with certainty although program guidelines try to dis tinguish between the need for skilled care versus unskilled care there is little information on what the norms are for covered home health care some favoring home health cost sharing say that community beneficiaries are often actually seeking coverage of care for ongoing chronic conditions and long term car and personal assistance depending on the structure of the cost sharing and how it is covere d under supplemental insurance policies cost sharing might weed out such use by community beneficiarieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31628crs8 10 ibid general accounting officedesign and amount of costsharing beneficiaries might be required to meet deductible at the start of an episode of home health care b pay flat dollar copayment per episode similar to deductible or c pay coinsurance determined as percentage of the pplicable hhrg or some other amount combination of these cost shar ing features could be used deductibles and copayments onetime annual deductible might be based on some concept of the average medicare payment for unit of home health care for example the inpatient hospital deductible was set initially to equal the average cost of day in hospital updated over time alt hough updating the amount and keeping it affordable have been problematic according to the gaos preliminary estimates average hhrg payments for 60day home health episodes during january through june of 2001 we re about 2691 the gao found that home health patients received an average of 22 vi sits during this time period for an average cost of about 122 per visit10 this method for establishing deductib is roughly mode led on the inpatient deductible but it has several drawbacks the number will chan ge over time and could change dramatically as the new pps is refined it is also higher than the 100 annual deductible pplicable to all outpatient servi ces and thus appears out of line although some argue that the 100 pa rt b deductible is out of date alternatively deductible or copayment could be established that is not based on home health costs it could be set at say half of the part b deductible which would be 50 per year or some other propor tion this amount is also less than the current daily copayment for stay in snf after 20 days 112 and thus there would be little financial incentive for patient to continue to stay in snf past 20 days if the hypothetical payment of 50 were to be characterized as copayment rather than deductible it might be charge d at the start of every 60day home health episode in order to deter th programs being used as long term care however to protect beneficiaries outof pocket costs the copayment could decline after the first episode andor be subject to an annual cap an advantage to this approach is that straightforward updating proce dure could be applied such as the home health market basket index increase or the most recent costofliving adjustment applicable to social security cash benefits coinsurance coinsurance generally is percentage of the recognized cost of care used medicare part bcovered serv ices usually require beneficiaries to pay 20 of medicares approved amount and medicare pays 80 if applied to home health care beneficiary could be charged 20 of the medicare payment for the hhrg into which he or she is classified for home health care according to the gaos preliminary estimates in 2001 ep isode payments ranged from 1114 to 5947 at 20 cost sharing for thos 60day episodes would be 223 and 1189 respectively lthough using this method to establish coinsurance would have to await better data on care used under the new pps the amounts appear high in relationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31628crs9 to other deductibles and cost sharing in the program the amounts could be adjusted by for example dividing them by 60 for the total days in an episode or by the number of visits planned for the patient during 60day episode dividing by 60 days would result in total coinsurance amount of 371 for the lowest cost episode 20 of 1114 divided by 60 and 1982 fo r the higher cost episode 20 of 5947 divided by 60 dividing by the numbe r of visits beneficiary is scheduled to receive rather than by 60 days woul d yield larger cost sharing amount but within one hhrg beneficiaries with w number of visits would pay more than those with higher number of visits although some might argue that met hodology such as this is appropriate because it produces coinsurance amount th at is tied to medicares costs for the beneficiarys care critics might say it penalizes those who are the most ill and need the most or the costliest care moreover it appears to be overly contrived and in future years as utilization patterns and costs change the numbers could lose credibility nevertheless there is preced ent in the medicare program for charging the very ill who receive substantial care more than those who use less ie beneficiaries pay more if they are so ill that they remain hospitalized for more than 60 days or are cared for in snf for more than 20 days alternatively cost sharing could apply to second or subsequent episodes of care only such policy would not create incentiv for beneficiaries to object to moving to home health care from hospital or snf stay and could deter inappropriate use of extended episodes of care concluding considerations the reasons for and against implementing cost sharing for medicare home health services may be stymied by the availability of third party insurance that would insulate some beneficiarie s allegedly those who are fi nancially better off from the very reasons for implementing cost sharing that is to provide financial incentives for beneficiaries to use services more judiciously although congress could change the law to disallow coverage of home h ealth care cost sharing under supplemental policies it could be argued that such an arrangement would discriminate unfairly against home health users unless it were also to disallow coverage of most or all other medicare cost sharing modifyin g the coverage rules for supplemental insurance in this way would be policy change of substantial proportion and it would be likely to take bate on the issue far bey ond the home health benefit the design of the new home health pps should curtail the overutilization problems that plagued the program in the pa st some believe it obviates the need for cost sharing although coverage of cost sharing by supplemental insurance policies and implementation of the pps may take the edge off some arguments for cost sharing as utilization and cost control vice other reasons supporting cost sharing include consistency within the medicare program consistency with private health insurance and generation of revenues to help offset ta xpayers costs for medicare
