luckmansscluwoca subject re climate of the last millennia date tue oct 6 133833 1998 hi peck et little late but id like to put in my twopence worth regarding your original message and phils reply i have been tied up with load of stuff so dont interpret my lack of speedy response as lack of interest in these matters my first comment is that i agree with all of your general remarks and with your implied rebuke to phil that we should be very wary of seeming to dam certain proxies and over hype others when we all know that there are real strengths and weaknesses associted with them all the truth is that all of this group are well aware of this and of the associated fact that even within each of these subdisciplines eg dendro coral etc there is large range of value or concern with the external usage of our data however my own and phils concerns are motivated like yourself by the outside worlds inability to appreciate these points and the danger that we will all be seen as uncritical or niave about the real value of proxy data the rationale for the recent jones et paper and some things that i have written in the past is to inform would be users particularly the modellers that there are critical questions to be addressed about how the palaeodata are best used in detection or model validation context many in the palaeocommunity understand these issues but perhaps there has been some reluctance to air them in sufficient depth or in the right situations where they will be heardseen by those people who now seek to use the data i believe that many of the modellers having been blissfully unaware for years of the need to work with the palaeocommunity are now expecting too much this carries the danger of backlash as they undertake simple assessments of the palaeoseries and conclude that they are all of very little use the problem is that as we try to inform them we may get the balance between valueable self criticism and scientific flagellation wrong the more so when the whip is seemingly aimed at others there is doubt though that many palaeo types are not concerned with the bigger issues of climate change so it is up to those who do such as this group to try to sort out some sensible approach to how we do explore the good and bad fairly in our collective data and how we present this to the outside world the meeting you propose is good way forwardif he is already not included i also urge you to invite ed cook i hate cold feet and i dont ski so i vote for anywhere away from snow to answer the question about the degradation in treering chronology confidence back in time yes we that is several of us in tree rings and rising out of them in average temperature or rainfall series have suggested basis for quantifying chronology error as function of series replication and timedependent chages in the correlations of the series that go to form the mean chronology the problem is tricky because the error is timescale ie frequency dependent also this is just the chronology calculating confidence limits on reconstructions derived from one or more chronologies must take account of the regression error again likely to be timescale dependent while incorporating the additional uncertainty associated with the chronology when the reconstructions are derived using spatial transfer function such as in canonical correlation or our similar orthogonal spatial regression technique the reconstruction at each point in the predictand network has some different uncertainty relating to the error in each predictor series and the magnitude of its influence in the specific regression equation relating to that point finally as regards this issue if you have detrended or highpass filtered the original predictor series in some way ie treering standardisation you have some potential longtimescale uncertainty around the final reconstruction which can not be represented by any analyses of the remaining prdictors or their association with relatively short instrumental predictand series i have half drafted paper on this which i intended to submit to treering bulletin perhaps one day your question about jasper the sample depth in my opinion is responsible for the early high values so dont put much faith in the early warmth we have devised simple method of scaling down the variance in average series to take account of the inflated variance that occurs when reduced number of series are averaged such as at the start of this chronology we used this in our recent nature paper looking at possible volcanic signal in the density data averaged over the northern network ed has incorporated this in the latest version of his super treering standardisationchronolgy construction program but it was not used in the jasper work i agree that we must be careful not to appear to be knocking other proxies even if this is not intended we must also be explicit about where problems lie and in suggesting the ways to overcome them i for one do not think the world revolves only around trees the only sensible way forward is through interpretation of multiple proxies and we need much more work comparing and reconciling the different evidence they hold lets have more balance in the literature and more constructive dialogue debate between ourselves keith at 0238 pm 91498 0700 jonathan t overpeck wrote hi phil et just read the jones et holocene paper v 8 p 456471 and had couple commentsquestions 1 nice paper 2 would you like to archive the reconstructions at the wdca for paleo it would be great to add them to existing recent ones cook et drought mann et nh temp briffa et nh temp overpeck et arctic temp it would be ideal to get each of the 17 proxy records plus the hemispheric recons 3 regarding proxies i wonder how much of the quality issue regarding ice cores and some other remote proxy records is due to there not being any instrumental stations near them and at the same altitude also with respect to coral records i get the feeling most in the coral community now think there is something funny about long galapagos record age model maybe more i think new record is being generated also many coral 18o records eg new caledonia are influenced by both temp and salinity variations this is solid reason why the fit of such record to temp wont be as good as youd like or as good as buffo dendro record i think terry quinn is generating the trace metal data to sort temp out lastly ive now seen number of coral records most not published but tarawa is an example i think where the proxy does as well as local instrumental data in this case ppt in getting the regional signal and the local instrumental record only go back to the war im guessing just between us that enso recons based on proxies will soon be better than instrumental ones before 1950 not just before 1850 in fact id bet on it using some of the money ray still owes julie thus i worry that it might not be wise to dismiss reconstructions on proxy basis particularly since trees lack one important trait they dont work for all parts of the globe 4 about trees keith are you still reading i sent this to ed and brian too since they might have insights has anyone examined how treering recon degrades as function of sample size back in time i always see the quality of dendro recons cast as great vsother proxies and they are based on comparison with instrumental records but the dendro records usually have the best sample replication in this same instrumental period and then tail off back in time for example brians jasper recon has sample depth of ca 28 trees in the last century but drops off to ca 5 in the 12th century and 1 in the 11th century the quality of the recon must degrade too in contrast some nondendro reconstructions may not verify as well as dendro vs the instrumental record but they might not degrade with time either since the sample density doesnt change with time thus could it be that at some point back in time the dendro records degrade to the same quality or worse than other proxies 5 talking specifically about jasper it is interesting that the 20th century is as warm or warmer than everything in the last 1000 years except before ca 1110 ad since the sample depth before this time is 5 or less how much faith should we put in those warmer than modern temps 6 i went to the trouble of all this mainly to get some feedback and data into the wdc and also b to highlight that we need to extra careful in judging the quality of one proxy over or under another if well known group of paleo scientists suggest that for example corals are not that useful then it might mean more years before we have mutlicentury record of tropical climate variability i think it is clear that each proxy has limitations and i like the table 2 idea of jones et but the real need is to understand that each record not just each proxy has pros and cons and that wise use requires knowing these proscons some coral ice core and sediment records are doubt better than some dendro records also for example with respect to reconstructing low frequency variations in climate im not trying to dis treerings but rather to suggest more balance in what we all say in the literature 7 lastly i think there is need to have small workshop to put together an expanded version of jones et table 2 and more importantly to set some guidelines for data generators in terms of the kinds of data and meta data that need to be archived to ensure best use of the data for example information of the nature of the climate signal and what might bias it like the salinity effect on coral record or method of standardization on dendro record also we need guidelines on what info should be archived with climate reconstruction for example are error bars available if not why not there are often good reasons but the interdisicplinary user might not get it it might be best if the database could be upgreaded so that users would know for example that proxy record or recon they want to use has some recently discovered problem or verification ive asked mike mann if hed like to help put together such workshop with and i think i have some us funding for it it would be small with just couple folks from each proxy plus some folks like phil and mike who are wellknow users of paleo data like the idea thx for
