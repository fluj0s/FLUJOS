price index cpi policymakers intended that the real value or purchasing power of those payments not be eroded by increases in the general level of prices poverty thresholds are also updated annually based on changes in the cpi but while such indexing provisions compensate for changing economic conditions over time there is allowance for substantial differences in the cost of living at any given time depending on geographic location simply put some places are more expensive than others in which to live some measure of the geographic variation in the cost of living might be useful for number of reasons it would make possible the adjustment of variety of income support payments for local living costs it would also make possible an adjustment to existing measures of income to provide clearer view of variations in living standards across the country the federal government produces several different measures of change in the cost of living the cpi measures change in the prices paid for goods and services by households there are number of price indexes associated with the goods and services that make up gross domestic product gdp and the producer price i ndex measures price change at the wholesale level and for raw materials although each of these indicators measures changes in prices over time they are useless when it comes to measuring variations in the cost of living in different parts of the country at any one time separate cpi is published for each of number of metropolitan areas but those figures only allow comparison of inflation rates experienced by residents of those areas for each of the individual city price indexes the value of the index is set equal to 100 for the years 1982 to 1984 the base period thus even if the cost of living in one city is substantially higher than it is in another the index numbers for those two cities are equal in the base year subsequent index numbers can only indicate if there is any difference in the inflation rates experienced by residents of those cities the cpi does not allow interarea costofliving comparisons the federal government makes annual adjustments to whitecollar pay and localitybased comparability payment although the localitybased payment is sometimes referred to as cost ofliving adjustment it is not based on any measure of the cost of living rather it is based on the employment cost index eci which is measure of the rate of change in private sector wages and salaries 1 from theoretical standpoint goods that are sold nationwide and are easily transported might be expected to exhibit little geographic variation in price the main reason for prices to vary for such goods would be transportation costs and variations in the rents and salaries paid by the stores in which they are sold otherwise there would be tendency for the prices of those goods to converge if there were premium for given good in one area of the country there would be an incentive to producers of that good to make more of it available in that area either through increased production or redistribution of current production any increase in the supply of that good in an area where there is premium would tend to reduce that premium and bring the goods price closer in line with its price elsewhere in contrast geographic differences in the cost of land are likely to persist since the supply of land in given area is fixed the local supply of land may vary somewhat in sense due to changes 1 see crs report rl33732 federal whitecollar pay fy2008 salary adjustments by barbara l schwemle b

an increase in its supply differences in land values and thus rents might therefore be expected to account for significant share of any geographic variation in the cost of living variation in rents may affect relative living costs directly through its effect on housing costs or indirectly through its effect on the costs of doing business

the federal government does not currently publish any statistics allowing comparison of differences in the overall cost of living in different areas of the country 2 but there are some regularly available data from private source which can be useful in getting an idea how much the cost of living varies across the country perhaps the most widely used data are the accra indexes formerly the american chamber of commerce researchers association these are published by the council for community and economic research c2er the data in the accra costofliving index were originally collected by participating chambers of commerce but may be collected by any organization the data are put in the form of set of index numbers that compare the cost of living in more than 300 urban areas across the country3 the accra data are intended to measure the relative cost in different areas of the country of the standard of living appropriate for professional and managerial households in the top income quintile 4 the actual market basket is smaller than the one for which bls collects price data to calculate the cpi and many of the items priced tend to be name brands sold at large chain stores for the goods and services priced in the accra index considerable effort is expended to maintain consistency in the market basket considerable detail for example goes into the selection of the house to be priced in each area5 the missouri economic research and informati on center meric has taken the accra index numbers for the first quarter of 2007 and averaged the data for all of the cities represented in each state an examination of those data reveals considerable variation in the cost of living across the states6 according to the meric indexes hawaii wa s the most expensive state at 1653 of the national average and oklahoma was the least expensive state at 894 of the national average table 1 presents the aggregate meric costofliving indexes as well as the ranking for each state for each state the index is relative to the national average which equals 100 2 there has been some work done by bls towards the development of an interarea costofliving index using data collected for the cpi see bettina h aten interarea price levels an experimental methodology monthly labor review september 2006 pp 4761 3 only cities with populations larger than 50000 are eligible to participate in the accra index program rather than surveying what households purchase in each area the accra index tracks the prices of g oods that are representative of larger categories those prices are then aggregated using weights based on the survey of consumer expenditures published by bls the effects of taxes are not included 4 from the c2er website httpwwwc2erorg 5 the house selected is supposed to be one convenient to schools and shopping with three bedrooms and roughly 2400 square feet of living space and utilities typical of similar houses in the area in contrast to the cpi the cost of housing is based on the cost of home purchase and thus is affected by the level of interest rates 6 new hampshire is not represented in the first quarter 2007 survey

geographic differences in the cost of living are limited if policymakers want to make adjustments to income support payments or the official poverty thresholds there is currently official measure on which to base them those data that are available are from private sources and there is way to ensure thei r consistency or continued availability even the accra indexes may not be ideal for adjusting income support payments because they are limited to urban areas and only track the cost of living for fairly welltodo households moreover participation in the survey is entirely voluntary and there is guarantee that an area that is currently part of the survey will continue to be the areas for which data are collected for the accra indexes were not selected to be representative of the overall distribution of the population if the purpose of an official interarea costofliving measure were to adjust benefits for those who are relatively less well off it would be important for it to reflect the areas in which that population tended to live whether there is as much geographic variation in the cost of living of that population as there is in the accra data is an open question the accra indexes also show that the variation in cost depends on what goods and services are under consideration there appears to be much less variation in medical care costs than there is in housing costs for example if that is true there might be less compelling case for geographic adjustments to medical care subsidies than for housing subsidies it may be that measure could be constructed making use of data already collected for the calculation of the cpi but like the accra index cpi data are only collected in urban areas although there is considerable variance in the cost of living across urban areas there may also be substantial differences between urban and rural areas and among rural areas there may be considerable practical obstacles to any effort to adjust benefits automatically to compensate for variations in the cost of living an important question is how would the different areas be defined it is conceivable that such small areas would be needed to account for all the significant differences in living costs that the data collection required would be immense one way of reducing the cost of constructing an interarea costofliving index might be to limit the range of items that are included the income level that defines the poverty population was based entirely on food prices an interarea measure that focused on just the price of food and housing for example would be much less complicated than one that reflected all the items that currently make up the marketbasket for the cpi possible alternative to the use of measure that tracked price differences in different areas might be measure based on income differences the most important reason for geographic differences in the cost of living is variation in the cost of housing housing costs are considerably httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20942g3g141g147g158g156g157g146g151g144g561g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g4g142g151g142g143g146g157g156g561g143g152g155g561
