years there have been federal programs directly or indirectly related to climate change direct programs have focused largely on scientific research to improve the capability to understand climate systems andor predict climatic change and variability energy use has been one major focus of efforts related to possible climate change because carbon dioxide the major greenhouse gas is added to the atmosphere when fossil fuels are burned all those efforts which sought to reduce oil imports manage electricity needs and address environmental concerns including climate change involve many parts of the government climate science efforts in various agencies have sought to expand scientific understanding of the dynamics of climate and its societal consequences as basis for policy decisions that rely on improved predictions of future climate conditions and climate impact assessments this report identifies and discusses direct climatefocused scientific and research programs of the federal

institute of standards and technology which looked at climate change technology issues such as supporting advances in instrument calibrations and measurement relevant to climate change the fy2006 request for docnists climatechangerelated technology programs is 7 million down 73 relative to fy2005 the decrease is principally due to the proposed termination of nists advanced technology program which aimed to foster publicprivate partnerships to help develop early stage innovative highrisk technologies according to the nist website7 environmental protection agency the fy2006 request for epas climate change science programs is up 5 to 21 million relative to the level enacted for fy2005 the fy2006 request of 110 million for epas climate changerelated technology programs is up approximately 1 relative to fy2005s enacted level those programs are embedded in two main budget categories used in the environmental protection agency budget presentation science and technology st which includes rd and technology development and diffusion efforts and environmental programs and management epm which are the costs to run programs epa has had six main climate change research and technology areas briefly described below buildings transportation industry carbon removal state and local governments and international capacity building partnerships and cooperation some of these activities focus heavily on rd while others involve information dissemination and other activities the buildings component of epas climate change research and technology activities includes housing and commercial structures epa and others including doe argue that efforts by individual and organizational consumers to secure the most energy efficient process or commodity are hampered by lack of objective information on which to make comparisons for details see crs issue brief ib10020 energy efficiency budget oil conservation and electricity conservation issues by fred sissine through the agencys energy star program and energy star buildings and green lights partnership epa evaluates and certifies energy saving buildingrelated products including such items as televisions appliances residential lighting and whole houses and makes that information available so that consumers and businesses can choose energysaving and pollutionreducing products more easily transportation activities of epa include the following 7 climate change science program our changing planet pp 125127 and httpwwwatpnistgovatpcharterhtm crs8 expanded support for programs such as the best workplaces for commuters program which provide information and incentives for commuters to consider transit ridesharing or other alternatives to driving continued support of state and local efforts toward livable and healthy communities eg through epas smart growth program which collects and disseminates information useful in enhancing clean neighborhoods and transportation choices continued funding and coordination activities in various partnerships such as epas smartway transport partnership which links hundreds of local governments community organizations and companies in order to produce knowledge that is designed to reduce vehicle miles traveled contributions to the former partnership for new generation of vehicles and current freedom car governmentdomestic autoindustry partnerships described previously under doe industry efforts include working with industries especially energyintensive industries such as cement chemicals steel petroleum airlines and food processing commonly through technical assistance to audit and identify greenhouse gas emission sources and to help in formulating appropriate reduction goals and strategies including removal of regulatory and other barriers this includes working with ongoing privately funded energy efficiency programs at private companies carbon removal efforts at epa were planned in coordination with the departments of agriculture and energy the epausdadoe funds for this activity are for studying ways to increase environmental storage of carbon as well as the kinds and sizes of incentives that could be given to land owners and crop growers to increase the quantity of carbon stored on agricultural and forest lands and at the same time improve soil quality reduce soil erosion and enhance other environmental and conservation goals epa works with state and local governments to help find ways to reduce energy use and pollution sometimes by supporting existing state and local programs the cities for climate protection program for example involves more than 54 local governments in implementing building transportation waste and renewable energy projects to eliminate about 3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide statelevel example is new jerseys state carbon bank program established to help achieve new jerseys greenhouse gas emissions reduction goal for the state of 35 below 1990 levels by the end of 2005 epa and other agencies are working together via international capacity building partnerships and cooperation programs to crs9 research and develop ways to provide technical and other assistance to developing countries to aid in reducing their emissions developing countries currently emit more than half the global total of greenhouse gases and such emissions are growing rapidly8 department of agriculture the fy2006 request for usdas science programs is up 21 to 88 million relative to fy2005 the increase is principally for the cooperative state research education and extension service which has as one goal to create and disseminate knowledge about changes in regional and global climate and how food fiber and forestry production can be affected according to its website9 the fy2006 request of 40 million for usdas technology programs is down 20 relative to fy2005 the decrease is principally in the budget for the rural utilities services activities in pursuing options for eligible organizations such as nonprofit electric cooperatives to develop renewable energy projects such as photovoltaic and wind systems according to its website10 climatechangerelated research includes efforts to improve measurements of carbon inventories at the national level and to develop methods to manage crops soils and grazing systems to optimize agricultural productivity resource conservation and greenhouse gas emissions and carbon sequestration technology efforts include developing agriculturecentered technologies to better manage the carbon cycle from sources to sequestration11 department of health and human services national institutes of health the fy2006 request for hhsnihs science programs is unchanged at 65 million relative to fy2005 there are climate change technology programs at hhsnih within

been efforts in hud to increase the use of technologies to make houses more energy efficient these efforts were part of the ccti from fy1999 through fy2001 the fy2006 budget again contains specific climaterelated funds or programs for hud19 conclusions possible climate change linked to greenhouse gas emissions has been addressed by various us government policies since the early1980s with an emphasis on energy rd and on climate research and services20 us efforts in the george h w bush and clinton administrations toward rd in energy efficiency and renewable energy and research into climate and global change were mandated by the energy policy act of 1992 which implemented the united states voluntary commitments under the 1992 united nations framework convention on climate change and by the global change research act of 1990 president clintons 1993 climate change action plan linked or created partnerships among various federal agencies business state and local governments and other entities with the goal of reducing us greenhouse gas emissions 16 httpusinfostategovgiarchive2003jun04247145html 17 the united nations environment programme and the world meteorological organization established the ipcc in 1988 main activity of ipcc is to provide in regular intervals an assessment of the state of knowledge on climate change these assessments serve as decision support resource for policymaking related to climate change see httpwww ipccchaboutabouthtm 18 climate change science program our changing planet p 138 19 ibid p 122 20 climate services are activities relating to the collection management and dissemination of climate data and information crs12 the current bush administration has implemented climate change science program guided by climate change science program strategic plan21 and climate change technology program the climate change science program strategic plan released in july 2003 describes five major research goals improve knowledge of past and present climates improve understanding of climate change forces reduce uncertainty in climate change projections understand sensitivity and adaptability of ecosystems to climate change and explore uses and limits of knowledge to manage risks and opportunities the climate change technology program released two reports in december 2003 that presented portfolio of federal rd investments in climate change technology development and highlighted president bushs initiatives in technology and international cooperation the reports were titled respectively technology options for the near and long term22 and research and current activities23 as complement to the climate change science program strategic plan the fy2006 budget justification anticipated the release sometime in 2005 of strategic plan to guide rd in the climate change technology program draft for public comment was released in september 200524 funding levels requested for both climate change scientific research and technologies for fy2006
