being amajor security breach thematter wasreported tothe central bank ofkenya thebanking fraud investigations department butnoonewasapprehended 9 atthesame time thebank discovered thatitsbackup data and software were missing thistime areport wasmade atthecentral police station butnoaction wastaken themanagement thencalled andinterrogated mrlameck wangumba whowasincharge ofthe information technology andcomputer systems atthebank from his response andbehaviour itbecame apparent thatheknew andor was responsible forthetheftofthebanks backup dataandthesoftware 10 assoon asmrwangumba knew thatthepolice hadbeen involved he quickly leftthebankjustbefore christmas ofdecember 2003611 with thisinformation andexperience themanagement became alert anddiscovered thatalthough lameck wangumba hadlefthewasin constant touch withpeter odhiambo 12 sometimes inmid2004 thebank received information thatsomeone wasstealing andremoving documents fromthebank themanagement directed peter odhiambo toinvestigate audit andtoestablish theextent ofthetheft andwhat documents hadbeen stolen andwhether itwas trueornothewasrequired toputintoplace measures toensure that confidential documents were notstolen orinterfered withandifhehad any difficulties hewas supposed toreport andor make recommendations tothemanagement 13 atalltimes peter odhiambo confirmed tothemanagement thathehad perused andexamined allthedocuments andtransactions andthatall were incompliance andthattheallegations oftheftandor remov1 of documents fromcharterhouse bank wasfalse 14 being theinternal auditor thebanks documents custodian anda member ofthesenior management team thebank hadnoreason notto believe him 15however theinformation about documents being stolen andremoved from thebank increased whatever wasstolen wasallegedly being taken tothecentral bank ofkenya andtothekenya revenue authority thebank engaged theservices ofaprivate investigator who discovered thatthedocuments were actually being stolen andremoved from charterhouse bank bypeter odhiambo andanother officer called chege fromtheforeign exchange department andwere being delivered tocertain people bothatkenya revenue authority thecentral bank of kenya andatvarious hotels within thecity 16 after receiving theinvestigators report thebank called inthepolice and peter odhiambo leftthebank inahuffwhen hediscovered thatthe police hadbeen called inrespect ofthestolen documents andhehad been identified astheculprit 17 theprivate investigator ascertained thatpeter odhiambo andchege were frequent visitors atthecentral bank andthekraoffices718 on31st august 2004 acontingent ofofficials from cbk accompanied bythegovernors sonmrsillamullei mrmelville smith andothers including officers from thekenya anticorruption commission kacc and police officers raided charterhouse bank demanding certain specific documents inrespect ofcertain specific accounts running upto andapproximately 260accounts 19 atthebank itwasdiscovered thatduring theactivities ofthese raids theraiders were constantly receiving directions ontheirmobile phones which seemed unusual theraiders were looking forspecific documents which strangely enough were found tobemissing asthey hadbeen stolen 20 themanagement summoned onejoseph maina gachari being the person incharge ofthebanks archives toexplain whythedocuments thatwere being sought were notbeing made available mrgachari wasordered toensure thatthedocuments were found andhanded over tothecbkteam astheyhadrequested 21 mrgachari informed themanagement thatthedocuments thatwere being sought were among those thathadbeen transferred temporarily tothebanks archives during thebanks expansion hewasdirected to gotothearchives andbring thedocuments andthemanagement gave himuntil1stnovember 2004 toproduce allthedocuments when asked whythedocuments hadstillnotbeen availed hesaidhewasunable to locate them andsuggested thatpeter odhiambo would know where the documents were since theywere notinthearchives andhewasthe onlyother person whohadaccess tothearchives given thatpeter odhiambo hadalready quitemployment mrgachari wassuspended fromwork buthenever returned 22 immediately aftergachari wassuspended onzoseptember 2004 in some rather inexplicable circumstances thebanks archives caught fire andeverything inthearchives burnt down itisinstructive thatthe location ofthearchives wasonlyknown topeter odhiambo maina gachari themanaging director andoneother manager thematter wasreported tothepolice butthecause offirewasnever established although arson wassuspected 23 from thedescription ofthedocuments thathadbeen stolen fromthe bank itisthebanks viewthatthishadbeen acalculated conspiracy to8remove account opening documents ofcertain accounts filesofcertain clients andtopluck outvitaldocuments fromthefilesthatcould laterbe used asaweakness toportray charterhouse bank asbeing inviolation oftheknow your customer which canonlycome about bywayof missing documents 24 after theraidtheinvestigation andtheinspection thebank wasnot abletoproduce themissing filesnoranyofthemissing documents that were being demanded bythecbkteam butwewere tolaterlearn that allthedocuments thatwere specifically being requested hadbeen downloaded plucked outdiscriminatively from various files andfor these unfortunate events thebank wasfound tobeinviolation and fined kshs 1000000 25 uptothispoint intime thebank management hadputtheunpleasant issues attheback oftheirminds andmoved onandthebank continued with itsnormal operations andenhanced itssecurity management systems orsotheythought 26 unfortunately towards theendoftheyear2005 itwasdiscovered that onejames muia acurrent employee ofcharterhouse bank was constantly being seen inthecompany ofpeter odhiambo andmaina gachari thebank management suspected thathemight trytosteal documents again fromthebank butdecided nottosack himbuttoput himunder surveillance since thepolice officers fromthecentral police station hadinformed themanagement thatunless they hadproof or caught himredhanded withthedocuments there wasnothing thatthe police could doheisstillanemployee ofcharterhouse bank even as wewrite toyou 27 from thebeginning oftheyear itwas discovered thatsuspicious activities were taking place between james muia andyetanother employee onedavid okinda whowasnowincharge oftheitsystems the management started investigating their activities and itwas discovered thatsome accounts anddatawasbeing tampered withand thatatcertain times there was alogging ofthebanks data for inordinate periods oftimeanditwasunclear whyforexample david okinda would dwell oncertain accounts forinexcess ofthree hours when thebank called inanexpert itwasconfirmed thatthere was external intrusion intothebanks system where data was being9tampered withandlorbeing transferred elsewhere andafter hewas discovered mrokinda leftemployment 28 from theyear 2004 todate andatallmaterial times thebank considered alltheunfortunate incidents asactivities ofsome disloyal andgreedy employees whowere doing allthisfortheir ownpersonal gainanditnever occurred toustheywere doing ittoinjure thebank 29 from 2nd april2006 thebank started being portrayed negatively inthe media andon24th may2006 certain copies ofletters were delivered by courier tocharterhouse bank theletters turned outtohave been sent byanonymous people whohadcirculated thesaidletters tovarious people including ourbank they were letters thathadbeen removed fromourarchives andlor stolen fromthegovernment registry 30 thebanks management looked attheletters anddecided thatitwas proper thatthematter bereported tothepolice andthattheoriginal set handed overforinvestigations 31 themanaging director mrsanjay shah personally reported thematter tothepolice andwassubsequently asked torecord apolice statement 32 upon further perusal ofthesaid numerous letters arather serious discovery wasmade which made itveryclear thatwhat
