inconsistency between simulated and observed northern hemisphere circulation changes nathan p gillett climatic research unit school of environmental sciences university of east anglia norwich nr4 7tj uk in recent decades winter sea level pressure has decreased over the arctic and increased in the northern hemisphere subtropics with an associated strengthening of midlatitude westerly winds1 this trend has previously been shown to be inconsistent with simulated internal climate variability and with the simulated response to greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosol changes23 but other climate influences have been suggested as possible reason for the discrepancy3 here for the first time we compare observed northern hemisphere sea level pressure trends with those simulated in response to all the major climate forcings in eight stateoftheart coupled climate models over the past 50 years and find that the observed trend is inconsistent both with simulated internal variability and with the simulated response to combined human and natural climate influences we derive an index of the zonal circulation from decemberfebruary mean ncep reanalysis data by subtracting mean sea level pressure northward of 45n from mean sea level pressure between the equator and 45n the trend in this index over the period 19552005 is shown in fig 1 we compare the observed trend with output from eight coupled climate models prepared for the ipcc fourth assessment report ukmohadcm3 ccsm3 pcm gfdlcm20 gfdlcm21 miroc32medres gisseh and gisser in order to assess whether the observed trend could be due to internal climate variability we calculate equivalent zonal index trends in 3853 overlapping 50year segments from the models control integrations shown by the black histogram in fig 1 the observed trend is greater than any 50yr zonal index trend in any of the model control simulations indicating that the observed trend is inconsistent with simulated internal variability at the 2 significance level in order to assess the possible role of external forcing in the zonal index trends we also calculate zonal indices for the period 19452005 in historical simulations of the climate models which include greenhouse gas sulphate aerosol stratospheric ozone volcanic aerosol and solar irradiance changes in cases where the historical simulations ended before february 2005 output from scenario integrations with only anthropogenic forcings was used for those years not included in the historical simulation the resulting zonal index trends in each of the 39 ensemble members are shown by the red histogram in fig 1 although the mean trend in these simulations is significantly positive 041 hpa 50 yr all the simulated trends are less than the observed trend indicating that the simulated and observed trends are inconsistent at the 5 level overall we find that the observed northern hemisphere circulation trend is inconsistent with simulated internal variability and that it is also inconsistent with the simulated response to anthropogenic and natural forcing in eight coupled climate models this is therefore an aspect of large scale climate change for which current climate models are demonstrably inconsistent with observations if we can understand and correct this bias this will lead to improvements in predictions of future climate change 1 thompson d w j wallace j m hegerl g c j clim 13 10181036 2000 2 gillett n p zwiers f w weaver j stott p nature 422 292294 2003 3 osborn t j clim dyn 22 605623 2004 correspondence and requests for materials should be addressed to npg mail ngillettueaacuk pic figure 1 simulated and observed zonal index trends the green line denotes the 19552005 trend in northern hemisphere decemberfebruary mean sea level pressure southward of 45n minus mean sea level pressure northward of 45n from the ncep reanalysis in hpa the black line is normalized histogram of 50yr zonal index trends from 3853 overlapping periods from control simulations of all the models the red line is normalized histogram of 19552005 zonal index trends from 39 historical simulations of the eight models with anthropogenic and natural forcings
