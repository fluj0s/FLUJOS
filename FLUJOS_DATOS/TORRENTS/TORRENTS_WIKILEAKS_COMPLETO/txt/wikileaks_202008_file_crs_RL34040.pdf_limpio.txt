benefits has long been practice in the united states by the federal government such fees have usually been charged as service cost recovery only to those individuals who have used the service or benefitso called user fees more recently this question has focused on the department of homeland securitys dhs citizenship and immigration service uscis which adjudicates immigration benefit applications as immigration services grow in complexity questions have emerged concerning what users of fee based services should be obligated to pay for as related to immigration the current debate tends to produce two answers to the funding question 1 an agency should either recover all of its costs through user fees or 2 an agency should only charge user fees that recover the costs directly associated with providing services or benefits on may 30 2007 uscis published new fee sche dule for immigration and naturalization adjudications and benefits these adjustments would increase fees by an average of 88 for each benefit uscis officials claim that the new fee structure is necessary step to maintain proper service levels and avoid backlogs the issue for congress concerning the proposed new uscis fees is whether uscis has enough money to fulfill its mission and if not how that gap should be funded as part of the former immigration and naturalization service ins uscis was directed nearly two decades ago to transform its funding structure to become more feereliant although the agency has been appropriated several hundred million dollars in the last decade these appropriations have largely been directed towards specific projects such as the backlog reduction initiative the vast majority of the agencys funding however comes from the adjudication fees of immigration benefit applications and petitions consequently if the agency is to operate in an efficient manner without the buildup of backlogs ag ency funding must be sufficient to cover the overhead and adjudication costs cost estimates by both uscis and government ac countability office had found that the previous fee structure was insufficient to cover the services entire operation how these funds will be raised remains divisive issue since there is disagreement over whether such funding should come from fee increases or direct appropriations fee increase proponents contend that even under the proposed fee schedule us immigration benefits are good deal by world standards fee increase opponents are concerned about the potential impact of fee increases on lowerincome families and further believe that the push for making the agency entirely feereliant has resu lted in backlog buildup and promoted backlog definition changes the citizenship promotion ac t of 2007 hr 1379 s 795 would provide for an increase in directly appropriated funds to uscis criticisms of the new fee schedule have taken on heightened significance in the face of issues such as backlog reduction and comprehensive immigration

g343g561g11g151g157g155g152g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g561 the charging of fees for government services or benefits has long been practice in the united states by the federal government immigrants for example have had to pay admissions fees for entry into the country at least since 19031 such fees have usually been charged only to those individuals who have used the service or benefit in order that the government may recover the cost of providing that serviceso called user fees 2 while this principle is seemingly simple the issue of cost recovery for immigration services has grown more complicated in the past two decades as immigration services grow in complexity taking on new obligations and tasks tangentially related to services questions have emerged concerning what users of feebased services should be obligated to pay for this question becomes especially difficult when an agency is established that is based almost entirely around providing feebased set of services in such cases agencies have historically received direct appropriations from congress thereby receiving some funding from nonusers as related to immigration the current debate centers around two approaches to the funding question 1 an agency should either recover all of its costs through user fees or 2 an agency should only charge user fees that recover the costs directly associated with providing the given service or benefit more recently this question has focused on the department of homeland securitys dhs citizenship and immigration service uscis which adjudicates immigration benefit applications this agency which used to be component of the immigration and naturalization service ins has transformed to become its own fee reliant agency and has moved increasingly towards recovering full agency costs from users 3 this movement resulted in proposed new fee schedule which coupled with the reduced request for direct appropriations would make uscis almost completely fee reliant the final fee schedule for immigration and naturalization adjudications and benefits that takes effect on july 30 2007 4 will increase fees by an average of 88 for each benefit and eliminate number of fee waivers5 as result over 99 of the agencys budget would come directly from user fees6 with the funding transformation of uscis has also come transformation in the stakeholder composition of the agency as the agency funding becomes increasingly feebased the general public becomes less of stakeholder in the agencys activities while such shift may be 1 32 stat 1213 2 according to the

raises functional questions over the degree to which congressional oversight would be performed over an entirely feereliant agency in essence issues arise from this agency transformation over whether the distribution of immigration benefits will be driven by public policy or the market mechanism of agency cost recovery opponents of the agency cost recovery contend that fully feereliant agency compromises the public interest since the agency would only be accountable to itself for its costs and expenditures7 if these costs escalate through agency inefficiencies critics argue fees could eventually elevate to levels that are prohibitively expensive for some potential users moreover the recent fee schedule by uscis has raised questions by some observers whether the prohibitive fee levels have already been reached historically the role of congress has been to appropriate some funds to agencies adjudicating immigration benefits particularly in relation to multiyear special projects congress has also had an oversight role in how these funds as well as funds collected through fees were being obligated by immigration agencies as such congressional reactions to these new fees have been strong and divergent creating continuum re flecting the overarching debate the continuum tends to range from service cost recovery advocates on one end to agency cost recovery advocates on the other hereafter referred to as service cost advocates and agency cost advocates respectively service cost advocates have called for congressional action to prevent the new fees from being implemented 8 although they are generally not opposed to the increased funding for uscis the opponents wish for uscis to only recover direct service cost and otherwise request direct appropriations to offset agency costs9 agency cost advocates10 however contend that subsidizing agency costs may keep fees low enough to potentially allow immigrants that qualify as public charges under the immigration and nationality act ina to receive immigration benefits 11 these advocates further contend that the immigration benefits us immigrants receive are good deal by world standards even under the new fee structure12 uscis officials claim that the new fee schedule which is set to become effective july 30 2007 is necessary step for them to maintain proper service levels and continue with other agency functions an issue for congress concerning the new usci s fees is whether uscis has enough money to fulfill its mission and if not should that gap be funded through increased fees the fee increase however raises potential issues for some members for example although the new fees are based upon cost estimates which showed previous fees were inadequate on per application basis there are questions regarding how efficiently and effectively previously allocated resources have been expended by the agency additionally concerns exist over the agencys expenditure of previous direct appropriations aimed at reducing the agencys application backlog some have questioned 7 us senator barack obama obama gutierrez schakowsky bill would send immigration fee hikes back to the drawing board press

charge user fee for the goods and services it provides23 as part of the former immigration and naturalization service ins uscis was directed nearly two decades ago to transform its funding structure with the creation of the immigration examinations fee account hereafter referred to as the exam fee account an account designed to fund the agencys activities and operations24 although the agency has been appropriated several hundred million dollars in the last decade these appropriations have largely been directed towards specific projects such as the backlog reduction initiative the vast majority of the agencys funding however comes from the adjudication fees of immigration benefit applications and petitions for example in the fy2008 budget request the agency requested 30 million in direct appropriations25 the remaining 25 billion of the appropriations requested would be funded from collected fees26 consequently if the agency is to operate in an efficient manner without the buildup of backlogs agency funding must be sufficient to cover the overhead and adjudication costs g8g142g142g561g11g151g140g155g142g138g156g142g561 the fees that fund the adjudication and petition

argued that this fee increase places significant burden on lower income families who must pay this fee for each family member uscis has responded to these criticisms by noting that despite the significant increase applicants who file to adjust status would longer be charged for interim benefits including applications for travel documents and employment authorization for applicants with

despite the significant fee increase uscis projects reduced workload volume for fy2008 and fy2009 hereafter fy200809 37 much of this decrease comes from an assumption that temporary protected status tps will not continue for individuals of certain nationalities38 the result of this assumption is projected decrease of 304086 applications from fy2006 levels in both i821 application for temporary protected st atus and i765 applications application for employment authorization in total the workload volume for uscis is projected to decrease by 414317 applications or 7 from 5991362 to 5577045 furthermore according to uscis the fee paying volume of the total workload is projected to decrease by 960204 applications or 17 from 5702571 to 4742367 the discrepancy between the workload volume and feepaying reductions is partly due to the absorption of interim benefit applications for work and travel authorization into the adjustment of status application 39

government accountability office gao released report on the financial practices of the ins55 it found that the ins had inadequate controls over its fee funding and was vulnerable to fraud and other

bureau and by stating that the new fee schedule of 1991 would reduce the growing applications backlog57 yet by 1993 concern among observers had grown that the increasing fees were not producing the promised performance results and some critics asserted that the ins was using portion of funds from the exam fee account for enforcement activities rather than adjudication services58 between 1993 and 2001 the ins continued to come under fire for not meeting its service obligations despite increases in funding from fees and appropriations59 many observers suspected that the ins was using portion of its immigration benefit collections to fund non service activities such as border security and interior enforcement as result of this suspected interweaving of service and nonservice funding there was significant push to separate the service and enforcement functions of the ins60 these efforts resulted in series of recommendations made by the us commi ssion on immigration reform commission61 in its report the commission recommended that the ins be dismantled and the adjudication and enforcement functions be divided up between the department of state dos and doj respectively62 the clinton and bush administrations however categorically rejected the proposal of ins dismantlement and instead pushed for internal reforms63 subsequent to the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 congress decided to formally separate the enforcement and adjudication functions as well as dissolve the ins with the passage of the homeland security act of 2002 hsa 64 congress established uscis new immigration adjudication agency within the newly formed department of homeland security dhs65 ins did attempt to increase its fees in fy2003 to cover certain additional costs related to security checks but doj did not act upon the request due to the upcoming transition of immigration functions from doj to dhs66 in the years since the agency was created uscis has been largely dependent upon

sufficient funds from fees to carry out its functions without directly appropriated funds67 the hsa specified that funding for uscis services would come directly from fees and that these fees should be sufficient to fully cover the cost of the agencys services68 as result gao released report on feebased funding and the processing costs of uscis services for fy2001 through fy200369 the principal finding of gaos investigation was that uscis fees were insufficient to cover the services entire operation gao determined that the costs were not fully covered by fees because the fee schedule was based upon an outdated fee study and in the interim additional processing requirements and costs had developed according to gaos cost analysis the three year total for fy2001 through fy2003 showed that 458 million or approximately 114 of total operating costs were not covered by fee collections70 during the same period congress provided an annual direct appropriation to ins of which approximately 441 million was used for administrative and overhead costs71 in addition to uscis fee collection shortages gao additionally determined that uscis did not have an effective strategy for reducing processing times to an average of six months72 or strategy for reducing the backlog of pending applications73 gao consequently recommended that uscis undergo comprehensive fee study to determine the cost of processing new immigration applications and that the agency termine the cost of eliminating the backlog of pending applications uscis generally agreed with gaos recommendations and performed comprehensive fee study which served as the justification for the new fee schedule g5g152g156g157g156g561g138g151g141g561g18g155g152g140g142g156g156g146g151g144g561 the cost of uscis various activities is unknown however according to published data on costs from the initial fee proposal the majority of the agencys costs come from processing activities these costs involve the

agency has been criticized for what some have deemed as inefficient processing performance gao has concluded that this processing underperformance is linked directly to the agencys insufficient recovery of its costs uscis has accepted gaos conclusions and has been actively engaged in obtaining an accurate assessment of its costsa process from which the proposed fees stem crs conducted its own analysis of the data released by uscis in order to illuminate the cost claims associated with immigration benefits being made by the agency this analysis is included in the sections below on costs funding and historical workloads because most of the data which the analysis is based reflects fy2006 and projected figures for fy2008 and fy2009 the conclusions drawn are only applicable to the current and forthcoming financial situation of uscis except where otherwise noted g24g138g155g146g138g151g140g142g561g146g151g561g18g155g152g140g142g156g156g146g151g144g561g5g152g156g157g156g561 one of the primary adjudication interests for many observers is the cause for the wide variance in the processing costs of different immigration benefit applications uscis has stated that the costs and new fee increases are related to the amount of processing time 74 involved for each application75 crs analysis of fy2006 data published by uscis76 indicates that as processing time increases the costs tend to increase as well77 moreover analysis indicates that the new fees also tend to reflect the current processing time involved across all categories of immigration benefits thus the new fees will statistically constitute an improvement over the previous fees since there is virtually relationship between the previous fee and processing time 78 in addition to the relationship of fees to processing time uscis has asserted that the costs and consequently the proposed fees tend to be inversely related to the volume of applications received for given immigration benefit79 based upon application volumes for fy2006 this assertion only results in strong relationship for the lowest volume applications such as forms i 695 i829 and n300 yet when correlating the current workload to total costs and proposed 74 there are as of february 2007 four immigration benefit applications that take over 20 months for uscis to process form i695 form i698 form i829 and form n300 as shown in appendix b these forms currently have processing times of 23 27 39 and 24 months respectively despite the long processing times and significant deviation from the presidents processing time goals these appli cations constitute relatively small portion of the actual workload cumulatively the fy2006 workload of applications with processing times of over 20 months was 1039 which represents less than one tenth of 1 percent of the fy2006 total workload of 5991362 furthermore based upon the benefit forms in question these applicants are unlikely to face immediate removal be in violation of status due to the application being pending or otherwise have to apply for continuing benefits 75 testimony of uscis chief financial officer rendell jones in us congress house committee on the

weak inverse relationship existed80 furthermore the same data show that there is almost relationship between the projected workload to the proposed fee81 thus while there is support for the relationship of new fees to processing time the evidence supporting the relationship of new fees to immigration benefit workloads is significantly weaker in other words the data that uscis provided do not support the asserted relationship of fees to processing time g3g141g141g146g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g5g152g156g157g561g20g142g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g156g561 in addition to the increase in fees uscis projects that some costs will be recovered through future reductions in workload although such reductions do not reduce costs on per application basis they do contribute to reduction in the overall agency costs for example one of the more significant reductions in activity costs comes from the assumption that temporary protected status for nationals from certain central american countries will not continue protections under the nicaraguan adjustment and central am erican relief act of 1997 nacara 82 are assumed not to be renewed in the projected workload and the combined effect of reduced volumes of temporary protected status applications for m i821 and employment authorizations form i 765 is projected decrease of 304086 applications83 additionally the workload volume would also be reduced for form i881 which pertains to the suspension of deportation or application of special rule under nacara 203 84

has tended to appropriate decreasing direct appropriations for uscis activities these appropriations are depicted in figure 1 below the presidents fy2008 budget request proposes level of direct appropriations that is 88 lower than that of fy2003 the year uscis was created the 923 million in total direct appropriations during this time period plus an additional 24 million transferred to other accounts have largely been dedicated towards backlog reductions and other special uscis projects according to uscis of ficials since fy2003 approximately 414 million of these discretionary funds have been used specifically for the backlog reduction initiative furthermore figure 1 demonstrates that while the proportion of discretionary appropriations to the total appropriated amount has decreased the mandatory appropriations from feebased 80 the correlation score of 028 indicates that while the relationship did exist it was weak and inverse in nature 81 correlation analysis of the projected

in this time period the projected processing activity costs for fy200809 would be 122 reduction from the fy2006 level of roughly 226 billion furthermore the projected financial situation for fy200809 constitutes an improved financial profile for the agency as compared to fy2006 in fy2006 only 636 of processing activity costs were recovered from fee funding while under the scheduled new fee structure the fee collections should exceed processing cost by almost 350 million thus analysis of the numbers shows that in order to recover activity processing costs additional funds to previous

agency has undergone two larger upward adjustments of its most common fees see table 2 in the past decade in fy1998 and fy2004 each of these adjustments was based upon the cost reviews implemented in fy199888 although other upward adjustments to the fee have occurred in the last eight years they have generally reflected inflation and thus constituted minor increases in fees89 the fee adjustments of fy1998 and fy2004 were more significant and thus warrant further examination subsequent to the fee review implementation of fy1998 the immigration benefits workload increased by roughly 62 from 45 million in fy1998 to 73 million in fy200190 furthermore the fee increase of fy2004 resulted in workload increase of 14 over the subsequent two years from 53 million in fy2004 to 6 million initial receipts in fy2006 however between fy1998 and fy2002 when the fee increases were significantly smaller the number of initial receipts for immigration benefits initially increased to peak level of 73 million in fy2001 before decreasing to level of 63 million in fy2002 thus the data revealed direct relationship between uscis workload and the fees for the five most common immigration benefit applications as opposed to the expected inverse relationship of fees and workload moving in opposite directions in order to compare application fees crs looked at fees for the five applications that

theory that measures the responsiveness of change in demand for good or service to change in price using this measure economists may determine how changing the price of good or service changes the demand for that good goods and services whose percentage change in demand for quantity of the good are greater than the percentage change in the price of that good are said to be elastic alternatively goods and services whose percentage change in demand for quantity of the good are less than the percentage change in the price of that good are said to be inelastic 88 us department of homeland

an average increase of 37 based upon the patterns of initial receipts by uscis the impact of past fee increases on demand for immigration benefits seems negligible despite the increases in fees the application rate for immigration benefits remained in the millions that is not to say that fee increases do not affect the disposable income of the individual petitioners or does not represent potential financial hardship for some applicants rather the overall demand for immigration benefits tends to be inelastic in other words fee increases have little or effect on demand possible interpretation of the pattern of initial receipts is that the number of initial receipts is more responsive to external factors such as terrorist attacks eg september 11 2001 or natural disasters eg hurricane mitch striking honduras 93 depending upon the external factor an event may cause demand for immigration benefits to increase or decrease consequently the variation in the upward trends in immigration benefit applications are complex interaction of 92 capturing and processing biometric information is not included in the workload totals presented in the analysis of this report except where specifically noted 93 historical data show that the application rate for immigration benefits dropped immediately following the terrorists attacks of september 11 2001 conversely subsequent to the destruction caused by hurricane mitch in the honduras applications for immigration benefits for honduran nationals increased

peak the completed applications totals steadily increased between fy1999 and fy2002 in fy2003 this total declined by 13 but began to increase again in fy2004 in comparison to the initial receipts and

g343g351g561unlike the pattern for the cumulative benefit application total in figure 2 the totals for n400 naturalization applications show distinct convergence pattern across initial receipts completions and pending applications prior to fy2002 the number of initial receipts and pending applications experienced significant declines while the number of completions increased however beginning in fy2002 these three categories converged relative to previous years this pattern sustained itself throug h fy2005 consequently uscis experienced minor workload decrease in the number of natura lization applications between fy2002 and fy2005 this stagnation in the pending applications occurred despite the decrease in the cumulative reduction of immigration benefits applications pending thus it is unclear whether the convergence pattern for n400 applications was result of an agency emphasis on processing other pending benefit applications or if the convergence occurred due to resource shortages or factors external to the agency

proponents and critics about the proper course of action for congress agency cost advocates argue in favor of laissezfaire approach contending that it has been congress intent for uscis to recuperate all agency costs through fees and become fully feereliant 95 service cost proponents however are worried about the level of the fee increase and that wealth may become facto driving element of immigration policy96 these same critics have also stated concerns over the potentially detrimental effects to congressional oversight of executive agencies that receive direct congressional appropriations an added layer of complexity develops when these opposing views are factored together with 1 the contextual relationship of fees to income levels 2 the linkages between legal adjudication and enforcement activities and 3 the potential for comprehensive immigration reform thus the cleavage of agency cost recovery versus service cost recovery has sparked number of related issues for congress

the fundamental division running through the uscis fee debate is the issue of which costs uscis should recover while there is general agreement that the agency should recover the direct costs of the adjudication services it provides there is disagreement over whether this cost recovery should extend to indirect costs as well since it was established as its own agency in 2003 uscis has moved towards recouping an increasing proportion of its costs through fees paid for applications and petitions in the fy2008 budget request approximately 99 of the budget funding is proposed to stem from

in addition to those being directly sought user fees are intended to represent payment for benefit that is provided and is frequently related to the cost of the service that is being provided in some cases additional collections are permitted to recover certain specified costs such as the costs of processing refugees and asylees who do not pay their own fees however for many service cost advocates the trend towards recovering full agency cost places too much of financial burden on the applicant 98 moreover service cost advocates have argued that making uscis more dependent upon direct appropriations from congress would increase the congressional oversight functions and provide an additional check on an executive agency99 these critics believe that the push for making the agency entirely feefunded has resulted in backlog buildup and promoted changes to the definition of the agencys application backlog 100 service cost advocates believe that more rigorous oversight by congress of directly appr opriated funds would both protect the interests of applicants for immigration benefits and provide more transparency and accountability in the agency101 g8g142g142g561g25g138g146g159g142g155g156g561 under regulations individuals applying for certain benefits may also apply for fee waiver if that applicant can demonstrate an inability to pay102 the criteria for demonstrating an inability to pay are general as it is uscis policy to treat each case as unique and judge each case upon its merits103 for example while it is desirable that an individual provides documentation to demonstrate financial hardship in some cases detailed testimony may be deemed sufficient by uscis supervising officer to qualify the individual for fee waiver104 more commonly individuals demonstrate eligibility for fee waiver by providing documentation such as evidence that the individual has qualified for or received federal meanstested public benefit within the last 180 days or tax documents showing the indi viduals income was at or below the poverty level 105 once the uscis officer with jurisdiction over the request is satisfied that the individual is

benefit applications and petitions106 uscis has justified this proposal on the basis that an inability to pay would invoke the immigration and nationality acts ina 212a4 which states that an alien who is likely to become public charge is inadmissable107 and as such would be ineligible for the benefit108 however under the previous fee structure the uscis field guidance memorandum stated that for the fee waiver petitions for form i485 the gr anting of fee waiver does not necessarily subject the applicant or petitioner to public charge liability under other provisions of the ina such as deportability under 237a5 or inadmissability under 212a4109 additionally this public charge rationale does not apply to us citizens who may be petitioning uscis on behalf of relative or fiancé even though these citizens would also be ineligible for fee waivers110 at congressional hearing on the new fee structure uscis representatives testified that across all potential fee waiver categories 85 of the pplicants who applied for fee waiver based on financial hardship were granted waiver 111 g3g156g162g149g142g142g156g561g138g151g141g561g20g142g143g158g144g142g142g156g561 one potential issue with the new fee schedule is that refugees and asylees adjusting their status would be treated differently as stated in the uscis final fee schedule asylees will not be able to seek fee waiver when applying to adjust status to legal permanent residence on form i485 refugees will not have to pay any fees because they are specifically exempted from adjustment of status fees while asylees are exempted from paying any fees for their initial asylum application they must apply for fee waivers to avoid paying to adjust their status or register as permanent residents the new fee schedule will longer pr ovide this waiver option despite uscis claims that aliens that could potentially become public charge are inadmissable asylees are exempt from this ground of inadmissability thus it is unclear from the uscis publications what the legal justification is for not allowing asylees to seek fee waivers for i485 furthermore from policy perspective it is unclear why uscis is developing

g507g14g18g20g508g561 the principal stated concern of the service cost advocates is the effect of these fees on lower income citizens and lpr that are applying for immigration benefits114 these opponents of the new fees argue that the new fee schedule will place disproportionate hardship on citizens and lpr with lesser financial means to seek immigration benefits such as naturalization115 as evidence of the possible disproportionate impact the feeincrease would have service cost advocates note the absence of any per family cap for immigration benefits although the new fee structure has some discounted rates for juveniles under the age of 14 unless waiver is granted all family members must pay for individual applications for given benefit under the new fee structure there will not be per family fee cap either and number of applications would longer allow for financial waivers 116 service cost advocates have argued that the significant level of the fee increases may force some families to seek benefits incrementally as opposed to as family unit and may cause some families to forgo benefits for certain family members all together 117 112 the other types of applications that require nncp background checks are asylum adjustment of status to legal permanent resident and naturalization uscis pays the fbi for nncp services with portion of the biometrics fee funding the nncp is one of several types of security checks uscis conducts 113 according to the uscis ombudsman processing delays due to fbi name checks were an issue in 157 of all written case problems the ombudsmans office received the ombudsman has recommended that uscis not participate in nncp because of the costs and inconveniences caused by processing delays he has additionally suggested that these delays inadvertently increase the risk to national security since it may extend the time criminal or terrorist remains in the united states moreover the ombudsman contends that since the nncp is only name

further illustrate the potential impact of fee increases on lowerincome families service cost advocates have cited the effect on us citizen or lpr seeking to sponsor the admission of family members but with an income slightly above the public charge level118 under ina 212 an admissions officer may consider an affidavit of support to serve as sponsor for an immigrant who might be deemed potential public charge the statutory requirement for such an affidavit is that the sponsor must maintain the sponsored aliens at level that is not less than 125 of the federal poverty line specified by the department of health and human services 119 for family of four the 2007 poverty guidelines120 specifies an income level of 20650 as the upper limit of the poverty level for the 48 contiguous states and the district of columbia121 for such household gross income of 25813 would render the us citizen or lpr eligible for sponsorship given the scheduled new fee structure however if the sponsor wanted to adjust the status of the sponsored aliens applying for the three sponsored aliens simultaneously would cost total of between 21302790 depending on the age of the dependents plus fees for biometrics122 the removal of fee waivers would place the full financial obligation of these fees upon the applicants and sponsor critics thus contend that such high fees could place hardship on immigrants wishing to apply for immigration benefits by contrast agency cost advocates contend that such examples of potential hardships actually serve as justification for uscis proposed removal of numerous fee waivers123 they note that under ina 212a4 person who is likely to become public charge is inadmissable to the united states124 agency cost advocates thus contend that if an alien applicant requires fee waiver on the basis of income that alien is inadmissable to the united states and should be disqualified from receiving such benefit consequently based upon immigration statutes agency cost advocates argue that potential financial hardship is not valid basis for developing uscis fee schedule furthermore they contend that the new immigration benefit fees should be viewed in comparative context claiming that relative to other advanced industrialized countries the uscis benefit fees are lower 125 118 statements by us representatives luis gutierrez artur davis and keith

the possibility of admitting potential public charges some opponents of the scheduled new fee increases are concerned about the impact of the fee increase on immigration policy126 as one of the principal pillars of us immigration policy family unification has been central to the ina since its passage in 1952 some critics of the fee increase are concerned that the size of the fee increase will cause latent shift in immigration policy where benefits will in facto manner be denied to otherwise qualifying aliens on the lower end of the income ladder these critics believe the new fees may force some families to choose which of its members if any should receive benefits and thereby would run counter to one of the ina pillars therefore some of these critics believe that congress should provide uscis with some direct appropriations to avoid the creation of an incomebased double standard in the uscis benefit processing 127

adjudication process has also been stated priority of president george w bush who has sought to reduce the application processing time for immigrant benefits to six months or less129 congress has called upon the service to improve its processing time and to eliminate the backlog to this effect since fy2002 congress has appropriated 574 million towards backlog reduction efforts including 494 million in direct appropriations although uscis reports that the backlog has been reduced since congress began appropriating direct funds for backlog elimination questions remain concerning whether most of the backlog has been eliminated because of newly provided definitions of what constitutes backlog uscis director emilio t gonzalez has stated that the current backlog of applications due to factors under the control of uscis was approximately 65000 130 critics continue to be concerned however about the more than 1 million additional applications that have been pending for more than six months that uscis does not count in its backlog figures and that the seriousness of the uscis backlog is masked by changes in the agencys backlog definition131 126 letter from american immigration

of the backlog of applications for immigration benefits has been altered several times since fy2002 generally these redefinitions have involved determining that an aspect of the adjudications process lies outside the control of uscis and thus classifying case as pending as opposed to backlogged in some cases these reclassifications involved delays with background checks conducted by other agencies other cases however have reclassifications that were due to such factors as the agency awaiting customer information or in some naturalization cases the applicant still needing to take the oath crit ics contend that these changes in the backlog definition were significant factor in causing the backlog to decrease132 from approximately 35 million backlogged cases in march 2003 to 914864 cases at the end of fy2005a reduction of nearly 26 million cases133 notably as figure 3 below shows over half of the backlog reduction occurred in the time span of juneaugust of 2004 when the agency twice redefined what constituted backlog thus while the backlog was reduced by 19 million applications in this time period the number of pending applications increased by almost 15 million cases but because of the multiple definition changes of the backlog the actual number of backlogged applications is unclear 132 ibid 133 us department of homeland security us citizenship and immigration services

reduction strategy that the agency had in place134 the report noted the importance many observers have attached to reducing the backlog as some believe the backlog creates incentives for businesses and individuals to circumvent legal immigration procedures the report noted that although number of improvements had been made in the adjudications process the agency still needed to streamline some of its processes and provide for better quality assurance program135 uscis reportedly planned to both address the current backlog and prevent future backlogs through improved resource allocation and investments in technological transformation yet as gao noted uscis did not expect these changes to be complete until fy2010136 subsequent to gaos backlog report uscis has made additional strides to reduce its backlog and increase its processing efficiency137 appendix b offers the processing times as of september 30 2006 according to the published data there were 20 immigration benefit forms for which the processing time was less than six months 13 forms with processing times exceeding six months and two forms for which processing times were not made public when combined with the workload totals from appendix the forms exceeding the six month processing standard combined for workload volume of 1519598 or approximately 254 of the fy2006 workload volume despite these improvements in processing times questions remain about uscis current and future handling of the backlogs and whether the proposed fee increase will affect the agencys ability to deal with these backlogs uscis claims that the scheduled new fees are more aligned with the agencys adjudication costs138 and respond to the criticisms raised by the government accountability office over the uscis cost structure139 thus the agency contends that the new fees will put the agency in better position to prevent future backlogs140 some critics however believe that due to the interagency dependence for conducting background checks uscis is not necessarily in position to prevent all future ba cklogs even with funding that fully covers the adjudication costs141 134 us government accountability office immigration benefits

among some service cost advocates there have been concerns about the potential economic impact and the flow of illegal immigrants the scheduled new fee increase might create number of observers have contended that timely and affordable processing of immigration benefits are an essential element for managing the levels of illegal immigrants these observers contend that slow processing times and higher fees encourage illicit work arrangements and visa overstays since workers are either priced out of the immigration benefits or placed in limbo by extended waiting periods for uscis adjudication 142 in particular these fees could affect the behavior of workers in low wage sectors of the economy additionally some service cost advocates have been concerned that if these fee changes do price out lower wage workers then it could adversely affect businesses that depend upon lower cost alien workers contrary to some of these concerns statutorily mandated143 study was conducted by the agency on the impact the fee increase would have on small businesses using analysis of random sample of immigration applications uscis determined that all employers in the sample would exhibit an impact on their sales revenue of less than 1 additionally since the study concluded that the average impact on small entities was less than 006 of sales revenue the proposed rule was deemed by uscis to be economically insignificant144 critics argue that pricing out low wage foreign labor would benefit us citizens by providing employment opportunities in those economic sectors as well as driving up wages by limiting supplies 145 service cost advocates however contend that in order to keep prices of their products lower and product demand high some business owners may seek out unauthorized aliens if low wage authorized aliens are unavailable146 g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g146g152g151g138g149g561g20g142g156g153g152g151g156g142g561 representatives gutierrez and schakowsky introduced hr 1379

judiciary committees in the senate and house of representatives identifying direct and indirect costs of providing immigration services as well as distinguishing such costs from immigration enforcement and national security costs estimates have been released detailing the impact of this legislation on the fees applicants would have to pay despite the potential of being criticized for shifting some of the adjudication costs to taxpayers sponsors of hr 1379 contend that the bill would offer benefits beyond direct savings for immigration benefit applicants such as improved congressional oversight over uscis g5g152g150g153g155g142g145g142g151g156g146g159g142g561g11g150g150g146g144g155g138g157g146g152g151g561g20g142g143g152g155g150g561 as congress considers comprehensive immigration reform the issues of managing adjudication workloads and recovering service costs could play role in the debate there are some who believe that if comprehensive immigration reform happens it will result in significantly higher inflows of migrants and an increase in applications for immigration benefits 147 these beliefs are based upon previous efforts at comprehensive immigration reform as well as the current effort entitled the comprehensive immigration reform act of 2007 s 1348 which would result in the creation of several new immigration categories and wider visa eligibility for aliens abroad thus if these changes occur uscis would likely see an increase in demand for immigration benefits and an increase in its adjudication costs based upon the possible projected inflows produced by various immigration analysts many observers believe that uscis is not in position to process such projected application increase148 given the reported difficulties uscis has had with reducing its backlog and pending applications some observers believe that uscis would require substantial funding increase in order to address both the additional applicati on receipts and the existing backlog gao for example has noted that when the 3 million individuals who legalized under irca in 1986 became eligible for naturalization in 1995 the application backlog increased markedly149 some additionally believe that if legalization program took effect the resulting increase in the application rate for immigration benefits would make direct appropriation necessary to adequately staff uscis prior to the legalization taking effect150 they say an increase in fees would potentially accomplish this task by allowing uscis to build up sufficient cash balance to handle some increases in demand for benefits 147 testimony of uscis director emilio t gonzalez in us congress house committee on the judiciary subcommittee on immigration citizenship refugees border security

current debate is based upon the division between recovering service costs versus recovering agency costs the near doubling of fees for immigration benefits may signal an eventual shift in future fee debates if fees for immigration benefits move beyond the tipping point of what members find acceptable the fo cus could shift from what applicants should pay for to what should the government charge current discussions over the possibility of sliding scale for fees has already hinted at this debate shift whether this shift would come to fruition likely hinges on the ability of uscis to control its costs and provide immigrants with set of services that members deem acceptably priced yet the debate will also likely be impacted by whether congress continues to support the notion of fully feereliant uscis and whether members agree upon legislation for comprehensive immigration reformhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34040 g561 g5g20g21g556g345g343g561g3g153g153g142g151g141g146g161g561g3g495
