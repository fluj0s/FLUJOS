slow pleasant rise or fall which does nothing when the auditor is doing nothing it has trace of irregular or reacting motion on the meter clean needle is like molasses being poured out of bucket by statue flawless midruds will give you one it flows at uniform rate of speed the pc may have an intransigent dirty needle but after you find the first ri you will get clean needle the only problem with this is that you have to assess over filthy needle dead horse list does minimal amount to clean the needle cleaning needle is not the same thing as cleaning read off the needle you will see clean needle when you have finished list before you have done anything else it will be slowly flowingly rising or more rarely falling this is particularly visible on mark v emeter that is what you should have before you start nulling so as to be sure that you can null if you put big midruds in faultlessly without missing read or cleaning clean clean needle is what you will see r212 is such good process that it shows up any flaws in the auditors trs model session or metering you cannot use pc upsets as an excuse there is only one point in running r212 where things look awry about half or third of the way through list when the list is getting hot and the pc doesnt want to confront the next string of rock slams or when the auditor tries to null an incomplete list and finds the needle frequently getting rough in these situations the pc will undoubtedly get somatics misemotion etc that is usual the final check for completeness of list consists of asking 1 is the list complete 2 are there any more items 3 have you thought of anything else that should have gone on the list 4 could there possibly be anything else on the list if you get any reads on these questions the list is incomplete the reverse of clean needle more or less is needle pattern chronic needle behavior that pc exhibits while the auditor is saying and doing nothing needle with reaction on it is dirty needle it doesnt look like molasses being poured out of bucket by statue any ticks any roughness any slight speedups as it goes dirty needle is any needle that departs from the appearance of clean needle it has nothing to do with the auditor he is doing nothing if in midsession with an auditing cycle complete it is doing anything that has any irregularity if it of any kind whatsoever that is dirty needle and your midruds are out watch the needle for count of five doing nothing and that whatever you see is the state of the needle it is not how sticky or unsticky the needle is it is whether the needle is ticking at all or halting at all seeing this the auditor is expected to get midruds in not to do so is goof 363 raw meat pc or pc who has had previous bad auditing and has filthy needle presents problem on such needle you cant expect much until you get your first ri that is the easiest way to clean the needle except that you have to assess accurately through dirty needle that is your most critical time in auditing it lasts only as long as it takes you to get an accurate first assessment it should take you only the first hour of auditing assuming that you dont get lot of dead horses if you get hot item just listing it will clean the needle you dont even have to null to clean it after you have the first ri you should be able to get midruds in pretty fast the pc will probably rockslam on list one anyway needle characteristics tend to become misinterpreted for instance people have failed to recognize rock slams rock slam is simply slashing agitation of the needle dirty read is buzzing agitation of the needle rock slam always has slash in it rocket read takes off it always goes to the right it takes off with very fast spurt and does very rapid decay like bullet fired into water its very fast it goes pshoo it looks like its got all of its motive power from its first instant of impulse with additional motive power being imparted to it by anything its kicked off and it has further kick so it just rapidly dies out how wide is it thats silly question ive seen them from sixtyfourth of an inch to dial wide you see they are any width rock slam can have its first slash mistaken for rocket read if the auditor has never seen rocket read but the rock slam doesnt go in spurt it is uniform and has power put to it the whole distance of its slash it doesnt decay it stops suddenly most commonly the first slash is to the left just one slash to the left is enough to identify it as rock slam even if it doesnt continue it can be awfully tiny too the first stroke could be sixteenth of an inch followed by dirty read rocket read should never be confused with even onestroke rock slam because of its rapid decay but dirty read is different it looks like an electric buzzer going it doesnt look like anything slashing and rock slam always slashes dirty needle is caused by big midruds buttons being out every pc has favorite button as you find out when doing an eighteenbutton prepcheck if you go beyond eight or nine buttons to get big midruds in you might as well do full roll your own prehav see pp 333334 above except that you are now doing routine 2 see hcob 5jun61 processes allowed and p 34 above instead of r212 the only trouble with routine 2 was that its results werent lasting good though they were at the time you have to find items for the benefit to last it is the need for mass that requires r212 item 1 is held in suspense in time because it is held in balance against item 2 which is also held in suspense in time this configuration can be unsettled somewhat just by running item 1 the balance will stay out but full benefit ie ten to fifty times as much benefit will result from running the whole package if you leave too many of these single items around the pc doesnt know what he is leaning against now and he doesnt think that he has gotten any gain even if he has after about six unfound items the pc will start getting nattery 364 therefore you will get only soso gains on r212 if you dont really find both sides of the package although you may think you did you can get lots of gains if you go back to the lists that didnt end up with an ri and extend them to get the item you will get gains if you represent an item that rockslams or if you fail to complete your cycles of action in fact you will get adverse results especially if the pc was very interested in the cycle you were on you must have clean needle before you nul mark v emeter expresses clean needle much better than mark iv it expresses ruds in pc when the slightest little thing is out the mark v just doesnt look clean it gets less flowing less right the mark v just amplifies the mark ivs tiny little ticks it is not more sensitive it is just easier to read you can harass pc in trying to clean up needle to the point where the needle gets dirty especially by asking supergeneralized question like what are you thinking about if the pc knew what he was thinking about it wouldnt make the needle tick therefore it is useless to ask this broad question to clean the needle you will do better to get in midruds on heavily charged list the pcs think influences the needle more than on lesscharged list if the needle has been clean then slowly dirties up dont leap to put midruds in the pc will feel interrupted and protesty if you do this when the needle gets dirty you cant always put in midruds or you get noauditing so when the needle was clean and gets dirty during nulling slowly twist the list around and show him as much as the needle has been worse on and ask which item he has had thoughts on get his suppressed and invalidated items cleaned up and go on nulling the pc may get allergic to this after while but this is not as bad as running midruds all the time the rud that goes out on checking especially goals checking is anxious about getting needle clean is an operation that takes all reactions off the needle when the auditor is doing nothing if the list is complete but the pc has some minor withhold from the auditor the withhold will cause him to be individuated so he will think things as you assess which because of the missed withhold will read and make items appear to read that are not reading you will have to clean them up also pc with an incomplete list essentially has missed withhold hence he has dirty needle and the needle reacts on everything the auditor says the pc is vulnerable to auditor actions because of the inflow of the withhold he isnt critical yet but he thinks extra thoughts he is individuated high sensitivity picks up all the analytical thoughts of the pc really severe arc break will give you very nice flowing needle also 365 l ron hubbard type 3 idate131262 volnum1 issue225 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec225 repair of r212 6212c13 shspec225 repair of r212 some of the material in this tape is covered by hcob 30dec62 urgent important routines 212 and 210 case errors points of greatest importance there is law embracing your disheartenment the more you goof the more disheartened you will get we are longer dealing with process that has to be tailored to the pc so any problems have to be with the auditor someone has to be shoved through it to win as an auditor so that he has reality on the workability of the process this is hard to confront it is like someone saying be responsible r212 produces results when it is done right or even not quite right when you first look at it you will think that r212 has hundreds of variables training auditors in r212 is based on the idea of walk before you read book on walking the only liability of this teaching method is that you need someone there who can untangle the inevitable goofs when several have gone by and the pc has gone weird the whole technology of straightening out goofedup r212 is to do it right the only crime is to lose the session records one way to lose them is careless labelling eg pc name or date or page number you need to know what went on and what the items were etc let anyone do r212 as long as they keep the papers this applies to goals dont lose old goals lists there was place to write goals in handbook for preclears those goals could very easily get lost r212 lists are even more important than goals lists since you can get back to goals with r212 if need be so mark down what happened especially if something rockslammed pain and sensation are less important to note note what happens to items when tiger drilled auditors reports are less important than lists they can be used to summarize not to keep track of ta reads needle behavior on lists is what counts give detailed report of results not session actions in the auditors report form dont get the ideas that there are lots of rules covering lots of variables in r212 one thing that will louse up some but not all cases is to represent rockslamming item instead of opposing it especially list one item you never represent rockslamming r1 the pc will go along with it the idiot but he knows that he shouldnt take his attention off the rockslamming item itself for second you are pulling his attention away from where he thinks he must remain with fixed bayonet so when fixing case check to see if that has been done when repairing case take repairing the first list one mistake as priority action because it has more bearing on the session the worst goof on list one is to represent what was rockslamming and should have been opposed it is less awful to oppose something you should represent complete opposition lists which way an item should be opposed can be problematic the closer things are to pt the more likely they are to be coterms therefore r212 has more coterms than 3gaxx being closer to pt coterms are opposed both ways who or what would coterm oppose and who or what would oppose coterm you can swap it back and forth half page each one side will run more smoothly after awhile and that is what you use opposing coterm can be tricky the commonest goof is not completing the list but trying to make it oppose instead this coterm thing is one thing that that makes it hard to complete lists 366 represent list that goes nowhere can be dumped with small liability the item will be found later somehow there are lots of rock slams in the bank but opposition lists must be completed if you represent something that didnt rockslam you should check if you having any trouble with it to see if it is actually rockslamming what you are representing might be the item suppressed and your representing it cleans it up so it now rockslams like prepchecking representing is powerful auditing on the other hand when you start to oppose something you key it in therefore you must complete oppose lists on r212 the commonest goof relating to this fact is failure to oppose something both ways to the method described above for handling coterms is not infallible the item might not be coterm wrong way to it might be an item that is deaded down never rockslammed or wrong source if it is wrong source it never becomes nullable nullable is different from item capable of being found on it nonnullable means list where the needle wont stay clean enough on it to null it so extend the list the trick in extending an oppose list is to do it the reverse way to the other direction this will prevent list from becoming 1000 items long with ris if it is wrong way to on oppose never renull extend the list and null what you now have this because an incomplete list is the commonest error in listing if you nulled it to nothing and ran out of rock slams it is incomplete so get more items your auditing could become good enough for you to be able to null list that isnt complete to nothing if you continue the list you will find that the rock slam will turn back on on the thing that you are opposing and you will get reliable item in repairing lists get old cycles of action done in order from first to last starting with oppose lists then doing represent lists always begin with scientology list one so start with the first goof made on list one this usually involves getting the rockslamming item that was missed and opposing it in any new group on r212 there will be people who tell you that it doesnt work this is the notgoingright type of case there are two possible reasons why the case is not going right 1 rock slam on list one was missed and not opposed or 2 somebody shifted the cycle of action opposition cycles of action are always more important than represent cycles so get the earliest and come up the track consecutively unless the list one was done as later case action in which case you fix any goof there first fix the first goof on list one first so the order of repair is 1 first goof on list one 2 rest of list one goofs in chronological order 3 first goof on r212 oppose list 4 rest of r212 oppose list goofs in order 5 first represent list goof 6 rest of represent list goofs in order 367 then there is the dead horse case on which one can find rock slam this could be an incomplete cycle of action case you should look for the following in such case 1 failure to oppose rockslamming item particularly on list one list one must be in restimulation for the case to now be laying dead horses 2 failure to complete the oppose list if the item was opposed 3 auditor needed white cane he didnt recognize or report rock slams that were there particularly in coaudit to determine whether this is the case you have to observe get one of the dead horse lists extended and see if it rockslams or extend it yourself and see 4 representing something that would become dead horse you will get complaints about cases rockslamming too much to get ruds in the best way to turn off the rock slam is to represent something that would become dead horse the rule is that case will continue to rockslam only when the subject that the rock slam is on continues to be addressed by the auditor if you are listing one thing the pc doesnt rockslam on something else you dont even get phantom slam on an uncharged list the list has to be hot to turn the slam on you can get confused as to which item is slamming as the rock slam turns on and off the phantom slam has this characteristic it never obeys the auditor it turns on and off but it cant be controlled the pc in such case cant be controlled either he is never doing what you tell him to do but rockslamming item on such case will obey the auditor the item will slam as long as the pc thinks about it then stops when he puts suppress etc on it if you get these buttons off it will slam again however you can kill an r212 item with tiger drilling it should be done briefly because the items are in pt so in patching up case look for 1 list one errors 2 oppositions it is lucky that case patchup is so simple since the number of possible errors is almost infinite however there are not infinite numbers of special cases on r212 the commonest mistake is for someone to go on and on representing and never check whether the item they are representing is now rockslamming it may well now that it has been unburdened so check it from time to time especially if it wont null false reports will give you the least difficulty except for cases where pcs tell you that they have pain when it is really sensation they will also lie about the fact that they have been invalidating items getting clean needle before nulling pulls all that up running the case parallels repairing the case doing r212 follows the same order of importance as the repair priorities an embarrassment you can get into is getting rocket reads instead of rock slams on r212 first be sure it was rocket read rocket reads take precedence over rock slams so just oppose it since the pc can use rocket read item to find goal with the pc may be continually intruding his goal at this point 368 fine get it checked out dont leave it in doubt when he gets his goal he can run r212 better this doesnt mean that he can be run on his goal complete r212 first the case that is being cleared over the top of an r212 ptp wont stay fning even if it gets to an fn eighty percent of all cases that have tried to go clear have hung up here so it is very important 368a l ron hubbard type 3 idate8163 volnum1 issue226 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0

presentations of scientology weve granted them and they have done weird things like fire the guy who asked for them time rolled along the fda started sniffing around the government organized smear campaign in the press and they raided church seized philosophic texts and emeters how did they do this they lied to the court they didnt tell the court who the warrant was for and they didnt mention books the warrant was signed by the president so ads are being placed in newspapers in the bible belt and there will be delay in the court hearing i frankly was getting worried wed been ignored too long we neednt waste time fighting the government it is its own oppterm what should happen when you find an item if you give the pc the wrong item he will have markedly more mass than he had minute before if the list is incomplete the pc will also arc break in the next few minutes and you will be unable to get him out of it except by completing the list with right item mass diminishes pc knows whether or not it is his item you are only auditing up to the pcs knowingness so if he doesnt know whether it is his item you know it isnt he has to be certain that it is right also when you package the item the pc must know that it is package if there is any queasiness about it it is out the pcs knowingness is paramount in getting the right item well done listing should produce an item that brings in vvvgis not just agreement routine 2 has little miracle to offer done this way the masses go pffft against each other the rock slams cancel out wrongly done r2 delivers more mass done right the pc has less mass it is question of havingness the wrong item has mass because 1 though it does have its own mass it is not the fundamental mass 2 you have told lie about it by saying that it is the fundamental mass more data on running routine 2 some day on routine 2 you will have the bad luck to have very suppressed pc he will suppress the item as he puts it on the list you will miss the rock slam and you will know you goofed and have to do something extraordinary the pc may arc break very thoroughly and auditing with ruds missed withholds etc wont handle it only routine 2 will fix it get him to extend the list get the item and the arc break will be gone 369 the more unnecessary arbitraries you introduce into how something is done the more trouble you will have with it r212 began to handle rockslamming r212 can be done at several levels there are lot of results to be had even doing it wrong auditors have had more trouble with it than lrh expected there are three sources for the first list in r212 1 the pcs immediate session environment 2 the environment the pc lives in more generally 3 the various parts of existence if you already have the pcs goal you can ask who or what in pt would your goal influence to get rockslamming item you could get life and livingness sources by asking what is part of your life and livingness in pt and what is not part of it each could be complete list if one doesnt rockslam the other will often both will we have to find something that isnt rockslamming to get list when you are after part or consist of list because you only oppose rockslamming items if the pc rockslams on your life dont list in pt ww does your life consist of test the source of list to make sure that it doesnt rockslam you can even tiger drill sources to be sure if source does rockslam skip it for represent list also dont oppose some outoftheblue rockslamming item rockslamming source for list is always out of context of another incomplete list that you dont necessarily know the heading of rockslamming item is therefore not necessarily an ri it is not totally destructive to oppose such an item just dicey sometimes the lists you get when you do this wont complete or you will get lots of coterms if you found scientology rockslamming you could just oppose it as security measure but there is liability to doing this so avoid the sourceless rock slam as something to list from if scientology rockslams find something else to list from that gets at the same thing you cant do represent you have to find some way of saying scientology so you are not representing scientology eg rons work or mental activities or some such say four dynamics rockslammed therefore the source is an incomplete list you have to complete it but how you find something about scientology or the dynamics that is broad and embracive like mental activity or what isisnt part of existence then you get an item and oppose it your success is monitored by this do routine 2 right and repair it with routine 2 little routine 2 and lot of general auditing wont give much result r2 is more powerful because it is hitting at the pcs ptp and hidden standard he doesnt know what they are until you direct his attention to them you could ask what would some healing process have to do to you in order for you to know you were better the pc will consult with circuit and give you his hidden standard if you tried to list this pcs goals all you would get would be the goals of those circuits this is another reason why you cannot get the pc clear with these circuits and hidden standards in the way after routine 2 you will begin to get the pcs goals instead of circuits goals get few packages off and out of the way and the pc will give you his goal then you can run him on goals process and clear him but you have to clear up the pt environment first 370 l ron hubbard type 3 idate8163 volnum1 issue227 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec227 case repair 6301c08 shspec227 case repair if you did the pure form of listing and opposing described in the last lecture you get less mass as result if you start seeing more rock slams than before and there is more mass on the pc you have been goofing the best visual indicator is the pcs skin tone if mass is increasing the pcs skin goes green or yellow or grey or black the eyes are also an indicator although they are somewhat less reliable because going through period of sen will make the eyes look seny but do note the pcs skin tone at the start of the session so that you can compare this with its later appearance age is another symptom the pc should look younger half way through the session even hair color will change it will get grayer or less gray weight will also change over the course of two to three sessions in the direction of optimum weight the meter should also behave better it should be more responsive there should be cleaner needle routine 2 doesnt do much for the ta position the needle is more indicative the pcs ta can sit at five with the pc getting better and better if the ta remains motionless throughout listing thats fine after awhile there should be some change it is not in the course of one session but after several eventually there should be improvement in high or low ta or the mass hasnt been cleaned up persistent low ta is worrisome seeing change in ta look for 1 wrong source or 2 list that should be completed you should be especially concerned if the pc was at 15 and didnt change after couple of packages had been found listing wrong way to makes the needle stiff and jerky on right list the needle should free up get clean and stay clean list can go clean needle before the item is on it so avoid short lists superlong list say twentyfive pages is from wrong source or wrong way to five to six pages should do the wronger you are the longer it takes the right way goes fast when nulling list dont tell the pc that an item rockslammed until you have finished nulling then watch his indicators to be sure that it is his item dont shift his attention after telling him the item if he arc breaks when you have given him the item it is wrong and you had better get him to go on he wont mind if it was the wrong item if he knows it is his item and you try to make him go on he will arc break when do you repair case when it wont run right the commonest error in routine 2 is wrong source and the commonest source of that is an item taken from an incomplete list any item is viewed as coming from list even if it was never before listed the three areas that you have available to get items from are 1 the pcs pt session environment 2 his pt nonsession life and livingness environment 3 the parts of existence so if the pc has several rock slams on list one you know at once that list one is an incomplete list this gives you the problem of regress you are always starting from list that hasnt been written the auditors responsibility is to make sure that the list source question doesnt rockslam since if it does it is obviously part of list so he cant use it for represent or consist of list all lists start with represent list 371 just because something slams you dont necessarily oppose it you might try to find out what the item is from by asking what list question would _______ be an answer to if you have been listing from something which when you check it now slams it is wrong source it is not that it is getting unsuppressed so what you want to do is to find nonrockslamming list question that produces rock slams there must be rock slam anywhere in the list question if you list from nonrockslamming source and dont get rock slams you can always use the negative version what doesnt _______ consist of if you dont get anything on parts of existence try what isnt part of existence you can also do this with list one if pc has his interest stuck on an item find what list that item was on and complete the list once you have got rockslamming item from complete list you can go ahead and oppose it what about case that has been run long time on wrong sources wrong way to and has lots of wrong items this is pretty sad but the case will still have been improved just repair it by finding the first incomplete list on the case even suppositional one or list one or whatever get list question of some sort that doesnt rockslam add to the list and try to tiger drill alive what originally rockslammed if you get rock slam while extending watch to see whether you keep getting them if you do it shows wrong source or wrong way to try it the other way around if it still wont clean up it is wrong source complete all such incomplete lists where you get ris oppose them and the bricabrac will blow off when repairing lists just examine the genus of the list and see if it needs completing get it completed to its proper item oppose it and package it up before this is done the pc will be interested in the item afterwards he will have interest in the item it erases he will cognite on it the pc may have trouble remembering right items wrong ones will be memorable because the pcs attention is still stuck there the purpose of routine 2 is to clear away chronic ptps and hidden standards so you can find and run the pcs goal having found his goal you may still need to use routine 2 to wipe out restimulated terminals when the pc caves in while running the goal you can use what does pt consist ofnot consist of or what does auditing consist ofnot consist of everything said here about lists also applies to goals clearing lists routine 321 for more data about r321 see pp 332 and 356 above more data is also available in confidential hcobs 7nov62ii routine 321 the twentyone steps finding goals and 17nov62 routine 321 one of the hardest things you will use to get rockslamming item from is goals list goals lists almost never run out of slams when they do though they behave like any other list remember that rocket read is senior to rock slam and that in other respects you trust it the same if you find rocket reading items on therefore incomplete list complete it to one rocketreading item 372 the frequency of rock slam test is senior to the stickier needle test on wrongwayto having found an ri pcs needle may be fine but the wrongwaytoness of it will beef it up do it the other way if it still doesnt clean up and give one rock slam on nulling the source item must have been from an incomplete list so complete it be prepared to be wrong and straighten it out straighten up routine 2 thoroughly fix up auditing briefly you could also find one rockslamming item that never got opposed so oppose it you could take list one and ask what question would complete list one and complete it this would handle most problems l ron hubbard type 3 idate10163 volnum1 issue228 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec228 r212 6301c10 shspec228 r212 the only commonwealth nation that has picked up on the fda raid was australia this shows the connections between australia and the us routine 2 has an important liability someone can be put off but good if you miss an item eg by giving the pc the wrong item since the missing item acts as supersized missed withhold you must get the item on the list or run into this missed withhold phenomenon on certain pc you may get away with having an incomplete list sixty to seventy percent of the time but the time you dont get away with it makes up for the lot the pc becomes unauditable he doesnt know why and he will just go round the bend further if all you do is to pull missed withholds without completing the list say you give him wrong item he may not arc break spectacularly then but his session goals in succeeding sessions will get less and less bright you should be able to see this as you go over the auditing reports and pick up the list where this goof occurred the pc will also be very massy arc breaky looking older darker skintoned etc he may also be arc broken when you tell him to complete the list this doesnt matter complete it anyway wrongwayto list doesnt produce the arc breaks neither does wrong source it is just incomplete lists so watch carefully when you abandon list or give pc an item if he goes out the bottom immediately or slowly repair by completing the list even if the pc has been doing lists off the wrong item for eighteen sessions on wrongway to list the rock slams keep increasing in frequency that is good way to spot one but beware of pcs wearing rings that can cause phantom slams on rightwayto list the slams will be less frequent from the third or fourth page on you may go another six pages before you get the next slam before the needle goes clean and the item is on the list if you give the pc wrong item he will do downcurve on the tone scale if the pc starts to go the slightest bit bis on being given an item tell him that you are sorry that is not his item and that you are going to extend and complete the list he should brighten up immediately thats all it takes dont ever shift pcs attention immediately after giving him an item watch him if it is the wrong item he will age subtly but definitively before your eyes you can watch his tone level go down by the second if you have handed him wrong item just tell him i dont think it was your item well extend the list and he will brighten up 373 there are very few pcs around who are arc breaky as hell and have been for several years they can get audited but it is gruesome what is wrong with them is most likely an unflat repetitive process the omitted answer is the missed item of course there is list problems intensive approach sorting out when they were happy with auditing using the meter as necessary can be used in this case using suppress you can fish up what process it was theoretically then you could prepcheck it out but why not let him complete the process so when the pc is left arc broken with the auditing the organization or whatever find the unflat process and flatten it you wouldnt have to flatten everything ever left unflat it the unflat process missed item could also turn up on an oppose list to auditing but missed item could turn up on any case that you are doing list on so watch for it another source of missing items is failure to oppose this especially happened when the list one item was opposed but the item found from this was not opposed in its turn the rule is that anything that keeps slamming must be opposed so you could get two packages by the time you are through an item from wrong source will slam until you straighten up the source rockslamming item from right source should always be opposed routine 2 is like racing car it gets you there fast but if you drive it wrong you can really wrap someone around telephone pole so you have to be skilled at case repair this has become an important skill the reason the pc gets more upset if you try to pull missed withholds when it is missed item is that the item keeps getting restimulated but he cant give you the item because you are not listing the pc may not be enthusiastic about extending the list but he will do it and brighten up watch out for this situation if you had two items slamming on the list and when you null only the second one slams beware when you give it to him as an item watch his indicators for few seconds before you go on dont distract him at this point it will aggravate the arc break if it is the wrong item among other things if it is wrong backpedal gracefully and continue the list bit to get the item of course the list may go on for pages also l ron hubbard type 3 idate10163 volnum1 issue229 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec229 how to audit 6301c10 shspec229 how to

missed withholds 374 cleaned up because they are the ones that make the pc groggy and dopey not the missing items it is pt nearlyfoundout that makes the pc go under on an item or list it doesnt happen just from the list r212 pulls withholds by the carload on track if you miss package it is giant missed withhold and screaming arc break but if you see pc go even slightly groggy dopey slumping down and shutting his eyes etc on nulling pull up right there and get the nearlyfoundouts you are after regular pttype missed withholds because missing item on list doesnt give the same dopeoff symptom having missed an item will give this other phenomenon body see hcob 3may62 arc breaks missed withholds for the fifteen signs of missed withholds the expected behavior of the pc during l and n and receiving or thinking of items is wide awake though the pc could have his eyes closed this is terribly important during nulling when you are depending on the item rockslamming it wont happen if the pc is anaten meters dont rockslam when the pc is anaten meter will tick but you cant depend on it rockslamming when there is insufficient attention present to charge up an item the same is true for rocket reads in goal checkouts boiloff anaten etc were discovered in 1952 to be flow running too long in one direction missed withhold is restrained flow any effort to outflow by pc who has missed withhold is blocked and only causes further inflow the pc has stuck flow if the pc has missed withhold hes inflowed as far as he can go and hes very very prone to boiloff he is holding back flow so he gets stuck flow very quickly sometimes missed withhold from out of session is keyed in by withhold in session then the pc boils off in this case you have to run the outofsession missed withhold that is why missed withhold stays in as random rudiment it gets you out of more trouble than it gets you into if you broaden the missed withhold question to include the track then you will get the restimulated ones too for instance you might ask in the past week has withhold been missed do this when you cant wake the pc not all missed withholds are on the second dynamic if you start steering missed withholds by dynamics you will start more incomplete lists keep the question general the nearlyfoundout is lefthand button suppressortype button which doesnt necessarily read on the meter if you pull session missed withhold but the pc goes dopey fifteen minutes later prepcheck the nearlyfoundout button with or without time limiter left hand buttons are those that prevent things from reading eg suppress fail to reveal anxious about careful of nearly found out right hand buttons make things read eg mistake been made suggested decided protested invalidated protested follows on the heels of nearlyfoundout thus it is point where left and right hand buttons meet in coaudit watch for dopeoff and put in the random rud yourself dont try to get students to do it take for granted that it is something out of session that keyed in you can use is there anything we nearly found out about you the we limits the question or get the student to run the random rudiment muzzled and repetitive until the pc looks desperate and about to arc break then go back to listing 375 which model session should one use as much as necessary more model session has these elements 1 adjust the pcs chair 2 get can squeeze 3 give the rfactor for the session 4 give tone 40 start of session 5 find out if the session has started for the pc 6 have the pc set goals for life and livingness and the session what you do next depends on whether you are going to list or null today dont worry about ruds in listing session who cares what the needle is doing dirty needle can best be cleaned up by listing the dirty needle is probably being caused by thoughts about doing the list if the list is complete the pcs list will be clean in this case it is noauditing to do anything other than to null the list take chance on betweensessions outruds only get worried if the pc starts to boiloff get off missed withholds if possible if it is not possible the list is incomplete so extend it in listing session get goals set and go right into listing that is more effective in cleaning up the needle and having the pc in session then anything else if the pc wont sit there and list that is different if the pc stops listing it is either suppress or inval forget the rest of the ruds take any items the pc gives you on these buttons put them on the list and go right back into listing that was the purpose of the rud after all at the end of the session discuss where you and the pc have gotten to and where in general you are going close off the body of the session then check endruds at sensitivity 64 get the pc out of the auditing environment with in this session was the run all right get your question answered but dont grind the pc to death check protest if this looks necessary refer to scientology 88008 it talks about thetan in the physical universe all the thetan is doing is stacking himself up against the physical universe and batting around like bluebottle fly in cage if you want to free the pc from the session ask if the room was ok then you have got the thetan and the physical universe straightened up if the pc starts inventing answers or seems nerved up it is probably missed withhold you wont do anything about it then get can squeeze asking about whether the run was all right usually gets his havingness back up but if he is down on havingness dont work over ruds run some havingness for few commands to restore the can squeeze not to run the bank the best havingness processes are 1 feel that _______ 2 touch that _______ 3 notice that _______ only use few commands not more than twelve this is also good way to get the pc back in session then take up session goals not life and livingness goals take down whatever gains the pc mentions get asksay answer question if he has one dont start handling what comes up you are ending session dont press for more give the pc tone 40 end of session and have him tell you that you are longer auditing him give him an altered visual aspect also to keep him from going on running his case look more cheerful and natural ask for cigarette or something 376 this is routine 2 model session using more than this minimum can get you into trouble for nulling session you can show the pc the list and ask for any major thoughts that he has had about it this practice lets the pc get off outruds on the list then you dont have to ask for them if the pc gets agitated in routine 2 session the first thing to assume is that there is something wrong with the routine 2 if the pc gets selfauditish or interrupts to get his ruds in just give cheery acknowledgment and go on dont let the pc obscure reads while listing if you are nulling just go down the list going bark bark bark if the needle gets dirty dont assume that it is outruds it is more likely that the list is wrong way to or from wrong source especially if your nulling was too brisk to give the pc time to think even more likely than the above is that the item is not on the list if list is incomplete pc wont register protest on the meter when you ask for more items even if he is protesting verbally you could also list for pages beyond where the list was complete then the needle can go dirty on protest but all other crimes fall short of not completing the list r321 requires more midruds than routine 2 see p 371 above for r321 as soon as you have ptps out of the road the case is ready for r321 find his goals nice as you please it is safer for an expert auditor to do goals on case than to do routine 2 an inexpert auditor is safer with routine 2 the list in pt who or what are you upset about would probably run more easily on pc simply in the form who or what does present time consist of cf expanded dianetics pt environment list this is the basic model but you could use who or what are you in contact with in pt on missed withholds realize that you can list whichever area is of most interest to the pc if you pick the wrong one of the three session life and livingness parts of existence to do first it can react like missed withhold make sure you get the universe where the problem lies l ron hubbard type 3 idate15163 volnum1 issue230 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec230 dead horses 6301c15 shspec230 dead horses an emergency is an unpredicted event failure to predict anything else is life dead horses lists are problem often you do represent list and it misbehaves it is hard to complete it cycles the essence of cycling list is that the needle periodically goes beautifully clean then dirties up again when lrh first noticed this he didnt understand it was like list wrongwayto but how could that be on represent list the cycle on rightwayto list is dirty needle dirty read rock slam dirty read dirty needle rock slam rock slam then needle clean and it stays clean unless it rockslams on wrongwayto oppose list the rock slams increase in number the clean needles do too you can tell by looking at any pcs list whether it is ok or wrong way to you will need to be able to do this when you are auditing in the field where you will have to repair other auditors pcs pcs can get sick on r212 and you had better know what could be wrong so that you can fix it compare page two and page five of the list if there are more rock slams on page five its wrong 377 you can list list each way for page or two observing how the pc looks before you start and when you stop you will get good at seeing changes in pc appearance as his bank caves in on him dont let anyone who isnt real expert do r212 on children because they wont sit still long enough to be repaired they are easier to cave in so getting back to dead horses and represent lists acting like wrongwayto lists the flaw in man is that he does not know himself he is much more able to observe enemies than self ask guy to name his enemies and he will give you list of names ask him to name himself and you will get joe that is why representlists tend to be wrongwayto sometimes and to give you oppterms they are easier to see than selves and they often dont rockslam properly the pc gets stuck flow of listing oppterms enemies and you must find wording that causes the pc to list himself his terminals list so the represent list is all oppterms and it doesnt rockslam and it gets clean needle dirty needle cycle if you are lucky there will be rock slams on it and you will find an item but often the pc will go greenish and the list is dead horse the case that gives you wrong way to represent list or dead horses is someone whose next available item is terminal not an oppterm the more the pc lists oppterms the worse he feels the missed item is the one that the pc is being right there in the session this also applies to the skunk list which runs out to item despite rock slams dead horse list is list with rock slams on it even with midruds in skunked list has rock slam but doesnt go on to an ri the pc doesnt know from which point of view to give you enemies so he has to give you everything say the terminal is bad boy we are asking to bad boy what does life consist of and we get just oppterms that is how you get wrongwayto represent list r212 can be run over another ptp and still get good results although under these circumstances the pc gets bit dispersed at times r212 gets the big hidden ptps and hidden standards out of the way so that goals can be found until these ptps are out of the way the pc doesnt have enough free attention units to do r321 most people dont think at all they just feed questions to circuits which answer special case of this is the pcs hidden standards hidden standard is circuit that is telling the pc what to think the pc has signal system rigged up scientology works if _______ it is quite complicated communication system like an automatic trainstopping system the guy who leaps up and says oh yes scientology works first had to ask one of these systems they dont think at all for instance the fda thinks the whole world is composed of two valences victims and victimizers there are other items for the fda the guy who makes food is victimizer and the guy who eats it is victim this makes the fda an enemy of all industry since industry emanates and those who dont are victims the fda lacking any other than those two terminals and wanting to be effective is victimizer and can only create victims this leads to whole country of victims communism etc 378 all dogooder government agencies fall under this heading life is sort of dreary game that goes on between all of these victimizers who have to be stopped and all of these victims the government official in one of these agencies is trying to protect everybody from himself dogooder gone mad has nothing but victims left eventually these boys have more purpose in life because so much is now missing from it the way to handle this dogooder is to sympathize with him if you do this he will go right out of the victimmaker valence and straight into that of victim he is defeated instantly if you like humanity you will leave that kind of politics alone in fact you will leave all politics alone the thing that man is tuned up to see first is enemies when they go batty they can see nothing but enemies everywhere the dogooder never recognizes that he is victimmaker however he would never give you victimmaker as terminal you could ask him who would have your problems and get terminals cf expanded dianetics wants handled rundown nobody recognizes what he is being as easily as what he is facing terminals are harder to pick up than oppterms at the start of case so you get wrong way to represent lists dead horses and skunks and thats the source of all of these you want terminals and you must phrase questions to get them the last rung of cases is that of pt rock slams that would be pretty grim because now you cant do represent list the way to get someone to list terminals is to list in pt who or what would have your problems or who or what would live the life you are living or who or what do people think you are or who is looking at or who could be looking at or some such pcs have items stacked up in order as well as packages stacked up in order the majority of pcs are bit overwhelmed and the first item to come up is an oppterm they are being an oppterm other pcs not few have terminal as the first item they need terminal question if you said who or what are you as listing question remember that you is undifferentiated so you should somehow differentiate it if you have listed dead horse list ask the pc who or what would oppose all those things and get

item ie anything that ever rockslammed because rockslamming item comes from some source and if you dont know what the source is it could be wrong an arbitrary source is dangerous this is the most dangerous point in r212 never use an arbitrary list dont try to oppose some rockslamming word that just comes from nowhere never abandon r212 nothing else will patch up r212 if it gets fouled up r212 is an ultimate process ie process that repairs itself never try to patch up r212 with something else because it will fail never let someone lose records or keep records inaccurately there is way to straighten out case whose records are lost however using the meter find when the pcs case caved in the session in which it occurred and put midruds in on that session this will get the pcs memory improved to the point where he can give you data about the list or whatever but this is very arduous approach 379 never attribute violent arc break to anything but wrong item or an incomplete list it is not caused by missed withhold except in the sense that the missed item is the withhold this datum applies in the workaday world as well as it does in session somebody has missed an item on the us government probably the arc break is from noauditing and missing all their items never run pc darker and massier he wont get lighter come off it at once never give pc an item and then do something else at once this is very distracting to the pc and if it is wrong item the arc break will be compounded you must allow minute or two of observation just put the meter aside and make little routine of it and say well apparently your item is _______ watch him like hawk does his face get dark does mass come in if so dont let it go any longer tell the pc that you want to continue listing never lead pc to believe that you are giving him an item when you are not there can be funny condition where all the indicators look right but after the pc cognites the rock slam will vanish as the lock blows after which the wrongitem indicators start to show up so dont shift the pcs attention this will save lots of trouble the longer you let pc keep wrong item the more trouble it will be to patch it up never persist with wrong action that is worsening the case just because you dont know what to do it is far better to end off or take break to straighten things out it is good sense to know what you are doing before you do it this does not mean somatics thats not sign of the pcs getting worse at all never let case errors accumulate or multiply when you are aware of an error on the case fix it without forgetting that it is an error to fail to complete cycle of action on the case but also dont interrupt pc that is doing well if the case isnt running ok repair earlier mistakes all lists stem from some arbitrary point it cant be helped the three universes from which you list are 1 the pcs pt session environment 2 his pt nonsession life and livingness environment 3 the parts of existence each of these can be listed positive or negative oppterm or and terminal or thus you have twelve sources one way to make auditing with these less risky is when clearing the command to test it for rock slams this can include testing words or segments within the command for rock slams never represent it if it rockslams clear the command and vary it around until it makes sense to the pc until its real to him never try to list list question that the pc cannot answer ie clear it with him and get his agreement to answer it choosing the wrong universe to list will get you missed withhold phenomena including arc breaks because the pcs attention is fixated on the universe that you are not asking him about never in your anxiety to clear someone or pacify someone fail to get his ptps and hidden

6301c16 shspec232 tr0 the original tr0 was to teach the auditor to be there and to be aware however in doing tr0 students have begun to confront with that definition the original definition and tr0 are still valid additives have arisen you can make someone confront with professional attitude an auditing attitude an interested attitude good coaching depends on spotting what the student is doing and running it out flunking it without either flunking so much that the student goes into apathy nor so little that the student never improves the purpose of tro is to enable the studentto stand up to the duress of auditing it disturbs pc to have an auditor whose confront is very unnatural and who shatters under an upset in session upsets are often assignable to faulty tr4 an auditor who q and as gives pcs withholds by not simply acknowledging one q and equals one missed withhold the pcs statement has not been acknowledged just acknowledged the reason some auditors take long time to learn not to q and isnt really outtr4 it is outtr0 the auditor cant stand up to the session whenever something in the session looks odd the auditor retreats tr0 is out the coach must have considerable perception to coach tr0 on useful gradient he has to see confront go out look at something the student is doing and punch the button lrh has noticed auditors who q and in the presence of an arc break because there is too much there to confront this is as disastrous as it is likely to happen coaching gradient on this would start with the coach shaking his hand in front of the students eyes somewhere on the gradient the student will demonstrate his ability to dodge flying emeter cans while still confronting for an auditor to freeze and go totally silent is worse for the pc than auditor q and it is noauditing situation we should give at least fifty percent of our coaching time to the fellow who goes into wood good coach can recognize the difference between someone confronting and someone going into solid granite the next worst thing to going wooden is fleeing this amounts to the same thing dont think someone is doing tr0 because he has gone into apathy you can add aliveness to being aware this point is easy for coach to miss someone whose tr0 is granite wont be able to handle what comes up in session because he is not really confronting when you find an auditor who is having trouble with tr0 you know what kind of response he is getting in auditing because when something happens in session the auditor flees good auditing as opposed to bad auditing will show up most clearly under duress tr0 is the first thing to go the auditor will start making mistakes which is one thing you cant afford to do if the auditors tr0 is poor the auditor will make wrong judgments matter how well he is taught there is gradient of bad tr0 consisting of three grades 1 tr0 of doing the drill not associated with anything 2 the person who clams up and cant act 3 obsessive motion as form of and all three of these must be cured with coaching there is something else you could do different from tr1 or tr2 talking confront you see if the student can go on counting while you throw the cans at him or whether he loses count 381 auditors must be trained to expect arc breaks and to keep going because auditors get arc breaks as well as getting wins and results lrh was aware recently of thinking less swiftly when pc arc broke he analyzed the phenomenon as his not wanting to confront it because it was counter to his intention for the session so he experienced small impulse not to confront it this gave lrh subjective reality on how an auditor could go from there to not thinking and making goof r212 arc breaks can be sudden violent and apparently inexplicable so tr0 must be beefed up in order to cope with this how much and how long should you run tr0 until the student comes to the independent conclusion that he can do tr0 and has the ability to do tr0 while doing all the other trs and until he can maintain tr0 when everything is going wrong and there is lots of duress bad tr0 leads to and lack of comprehension of what is going on and noauditing for the pc it takes awhile for someone to learn r212 if he is learning his trs at the same time you are liable to have mess on your hands coaudit with r210 see p 359 above can be done but only because guidance is very stringent and they dont have very much responsibility for tr1 go get good recording of lion roaring and then play it with the student putting intention into the middle of the speaker the degree of arc breaks the pc will have on r212 is proportional to the outness of the auditors trs bad trs lead to bad judgment if the auditors trs are perfect he will never have them tested by violently arc broken

needle gets cleaned up because you pick up all the thoughts of the pc thats wrong needle cleans up because the pc has more arc and more confidence in the auditor it isnt cleaned up on the significance of what the pc says so in ruds and havingness session the primary purpose of the session is to build arc with the pc by reason of auditing it is not what you do it is how you do it you are smoothing out his needle pcs arc determines his reads on the meter it is based on smooth basic auditing the first requisite of all auditing is to be able to give pc smooth session on ruds and havingness session which ends up with the pc in better arc the needle cleaner if you can do that the pc will have confidence in you the pc has to be able to confront his auditor before he can confront his bank the

the time to worry is when the pc looks and feels bad dont plow on at that point find what is wrong case repair can become necessary once goal has been found and run if the goal has not been run all it takes is prepcheck to straighten it out sometimes goal has been found which wasnt ready to be found or run and the auditor starts finding items that are out of another gpm then routine 2g comes into case repair see hcob 13apr63 routine 2g and 6303c21 shspec251 r2g series the actions you should take when one goal has been run and it has disappeared are resident in r2g1 or r2g2 not in r3m you list goals against items null old lists run r2g1 prepcheck an old goal etc if youve got items from different gpm in order to find goal from the items you have got you need to use r2g you will appreciate the fact that some class iv has checked out goal and verified that it rocket read when you try to find the matching items say you had an old goal which has been listed out on 114 lines and which longer ticks but on which there was once an fn or say someone had wrongly worded source list or someone made up his own line plot and got sick the primary datum of all case repair applies to all these situations all these weird actions are incapable of deranging gpm gpms are almost impervious to improper r3m though the pc can be made sick and caved in 384 so at any stage of case repair anything that was done right will stay right and anything done wrong can be corrected r3m stops working where it is done wrong anything that has been found on the pc has been found even if it is not correctly aligned as yet that an item was found out of place doesnt alter the gpm where it belongs r3m will still work fine we can call the whole bank the goals problem masses and one gpm gpm one goal and packet of items equals gpm r3m is what handles the repair of messed up gpms if you want to know exactly what gpm is and the explanation for the formation of the gpm read dmsmh wherever it says engram in the explanation of why people have engrams put in item or gpm it is quite interesting there is reason why the thetan postulated each goal it was born out of the goal that the thetan has just survived only the first goal of the bank is postulated from nothing the only thing that can upset gpm is the exact auditing that we give it it hangs together by violence or lack of it so it is accustomed to violence and mistakes practically auditing goof can affect it though you can make pc unhappy and miserably uncomfortable by making auditing goofs you will upset the pc but you wont upset his bank however you are not running the pc you are running gpm with the pcs cooperation the varying length of gpm depends on how well it served the pc as survival mechanism that doesnt vary much although the difference of line plots gives the appearance of more variation this occurs because some items found are extraneous and others are strays from other line plots if you cant find anything while doing r3m you have goofed and you are looking in the wrong place it is not that there is nothing there or that the gpm has gotten messed up in case repair at any stage of auditing the gpm find the first wrong action that you can find behind you and do it right if piece or item of gpm is missing you can always find it and put it in you can do goals oppose list to start it and stop it also dont just straighten out the pcs straighten out the auditor who goofed get him to study the bulletins and find what he didnt get it could be that he never read them otherwise he will keep making the same mistake handle case repair as though it were clear test compare the goal to the line plot and see if they relate put in buttons on the goal get it to fire or at least tick go over your line plot and read each item against the meter if one rockslams even though it is from source list and has been opposed you know the source list was improperly handled any item that reads matter how slightly after having itself been opposed came off wrongly done or handled list that is stable datum if it rocket reads you have guarantee that there has been wrong way oppose the only guarantee is that the list it came from is wrong correct that list what you want is the earliest item on the line plot that now reads look behind it at the line plot on which it appeared and do that list correctly if you

and gives you stray item that looks out of place on the plot so seeing stray look at the list it came from one test for which way to list is to call the question each way the one that turns on more

van straden there is world of difference between sec checking and midruds or any ruds ruds are done in perfunctory manner just to be able to get on with auditing sec checking and prepchecking are auditing the pcs case on goals running you are using midruds to brush the pc off so that there is nothing in your road in sec checking and prepchecking you are pressing the question home you are seeing to it that the pc sees how the question applies to his life dig dig dig you discuss and restimulate things so that you can clean them up to be called an auditor you must be able to do both of these things the brushoff and the presshome in r2g1 you have to be able to do both it is an art you have to be able to audit the pc in front of you you have to work around enough to really clean

6304c18 shspec258 directive listing part i details on running r3m gobbledygook to comply with the form isnt right the pc sometimes gives it knowing that it should be suchandsuch form dont use it since it will result in rocket read something odd but conceptually right eg catholicness is ok it is up to the auditor to direct the pcs attention to what should be there and get him to find it the liabilities of getting wrong items wrong goals missed items etc are so great that you should do everything possible to prevent these things from happening you have bank pattern that is at least close to the perfect pattern the upper fourteen to eighteen and the lower twelve items omitting the two lowest oppterms which vary on every goal are very set and patterned the pattern is that of lrhs fifteenth gpm he realized that we needed the basic fundamentals of the bank and that the pc was in bank so far back and so beefy that it was vital to get its character and its right pattern or get killed as pc there is more to the gpm than appeared earlier because one could confront it all until lot of charge had been taken off the goal of that bank is to create to lrhs amazement the pattern holds true later on the track and on other pcs if the pc isnt run closely guided to this pattern his rocket read goes off so the pattern has value there will be other patterns for other types of goals but they can be extrapolated from this one directive listing has to do first with the accuracy of the pattern when the auditor doesnt know what he is trying to do it is not very successful directive listing is kind permissive listing wastes time and pcs the main thing that will give you trouble is the top oppterm and the top terminal these are characterized as the final achievement of the goal the top oppterm and the negation of the goal the top terminal l ron hubbard type 3 idate30463 volnum1 issue261 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec261 directive listing part ii 6304c30 shspec261 directive listing part ii finding the pattern of the gpm has been pure slaughter you have to hunt and punch around among various banks stirring everything up lrh was horrified in the past to find so many items he wondered if some were locks now it is all shaken out it is mysterious that the noun form declines into ity forms then the goal as an oppterm the goal declines through the same pattern all the way down through absolute and perfect into the ivities then you get to the end of the goal which doesnt decline mysteriously body weight and machinery get knocked around sometimes when doing directive listing it is the unrun items which slamming into the body increase the bodys mass this is one of the oldest findings in havingness processing like mockups being shoved into the body increasing the bodys weight partiallyrun gpm being in restimulation impinges on the body more than it did so you get more body weight mental mass and physical mass are the same stuff but mental mass is thinner gpm mass looks like steel shell or is sphere covered with black or grey cloud the mass on halfdischarged bank looks like grey cottonwool it has finite dimensions the mass alternates black banks and grey 387 banks going back down the track black bank partly discharged turns greyish and murkybrown while there are still some items it shakes and shivers and tries to fall apart the best items are those that turn on little mass the first items off take off proportionally more charge than the later ones however leaving lower ris undischarged is dangerous because the lower items hold it all together and it will charge up again the top items are uncomfortable and upsetting but not that important the lowest oppterm is the keystone that keeps the bank in its channel because it is cross between the failed goal of the next gpm down and the one you are in that is how the goals stay in sequence what keeps the bank charged up is the goal when you reach the goal as an ri you cant just leave it you have to list what would oppose it but dont let the pc start to run what comes up as the item because it is the next bank and before going into it the pc has to come up to pt acknowledge it very thoroughly dont null the list go back to the top of the first bank you ran and find its goal find the opposite oppose and go on to pt it is always harder to go the other way going later rather than earlier but that is the way to do it the reason is that you are trying to clear the pc by obtaining for the pc the greatest possible auditing gains per unit of time it is mechanically true that the more items you get off the more banks you run the more charge you discharge the more the pc will cognite but we are running the pc under special conditions that you as scientologist recognize as special but that one else would see as out of the ordinary you are running thetan in body that just about ruins ninety percent of the things you could do you are auditing bank with frail human body interposed between the bank and the pc but you need the pcs body to hold onto the cans that is what has given lrh trouble in research the pc is put into danger in that you cant audit dead body end if the pc dropped his body half way through bank he would probably be sufficiently restimulated so that he would have trouble picking up new body he would keyout but he would feel betrayed because the hope factor was way up so auditing is monitored by the consideration of what gains you can achieve in spite of the fact that the pc has body between himself and the bank this is real problem the bank is capable of influencing the body that is why the emeter can be used the emeter is not connected up to the auditor but the auditor can accidentally start looking at or into his own bank to figure out the pc and kick in some restimulation the auditors bank and the pcs are on different wavelengths so they dont collide mest has wavelengths also someone whose wavelength is near to yours is someone you feel very close to soulmate you can influence each other more than average being both more pleasing and more irritating there is also the possibility of having known the other person before so there is thetan plus body plus bank the bank consists of free track that hasnt been drawn into the gpms all the goals all the gpms all the locks secondaries engrams and circuits then there is the thetan the body and the physical universe with all its ptps so in sense in auditing the pc you are auditing the whole physical universe and everything in it it is seldom necessary for the auditor to handle the pcs environment except when handling very neurotic or psychotic pc or pc with psychotic family 388 if you were auditing thetan with body you could run him back to his earliest bank knock it out and then run off the later ones more easily the body gets in the way of this because when the thetan made his earliest bank he didnt have body and his adventures were more strenuous than body could take so you can make someone quite ill by chasing them down into early banks and badly handling them the body is useful adjunct though nuisance in some ways so you should safeguard it by staying with standard procedures whatever you come up with to run run it well with minimum of stress on the body what could you do to overstress the body you could fail to clear the bank you are working on and go off into other banks you could not run banks closer to pt before going earlier you could not try as far as possible to run bank from its extreme top to the bottom you could keep auditing the pc over and over finding nothing and not discharging the bank you could find wrong items and run wrong goals you could fail to follow the pattern but assume that your pc is different your pc simply wont rocket read well on some parts of the gpm it is just charge that prevents the right item from firing just as the pc has many goals and many banks he has many ris in one gpm instead of worrying about all the gpms there are to run you should be worrying about cleaning up the ris you have your hands on just as if you halfran half of the pcs banks so if you halfrun half the ris in bank the pc will sooner or later feel queasy the monitoring consideration is that you should audit what you have your hands on dont run r3 on pc audit the pc with r3 that goes for every auditing skill we have i never sec check pc i audit the pc with sec checking i dont find goals on pc i audit pc with goals finding if you keep that frame of reference you will win all the way with routine 3 it is almost possible to audit the pc with scarcely somatic if you use everything you are doing at the moment you are doing it to clear the pc of what you have your hands on it will go something like this the first ri takes 2 12 hours the next thirty ris take half an hour apiece the next thirty ris take twenty minutes apiece the next thirty take fifteen minutes apiece the next bank takes you 45 minutes to get your first rl half an hour each for the next halfdozen fifteen minutes each for the next thirty etc etc this happens because you are building on gradient scale the thetans confidence and leaving nothing behind you to worry about this state of affairs is attainable if you follow some rules say you have spent two sessions trying to get the top oppterm to fire youve still got the whole bottom of the gpm and various points to cut in where the pc can get rocket reads by auditing the lower parts of the gpm you could unburden the case and then progress forward you should be aware that you can always go down in bank matter how hard you try to list upward your first interest is to get charge off if you get charge off the pc can confront more now he can find that missing top oppterm youve got countless locks which will fire when you first enter bank any part of the goal anything will fire because you are looking at the whole mass and it is so crosscharged that anything will fire that makes the top oppterm the hardest to find after you have taken some charge off all these weird combinations dont fire the more bank the more things will fire and the more restimulated the pc will be in life 389 details on directive listing procedure some pcs will have to be taught the language if they dont understand the words in the pattern eventually they will get

contained in hcob 15may63 the time track and engram rum ing by chains bulletin i and hcob 8jun63 bulletin ii handling the time track one basic tenet has never changed you have never successfully audited anything but the time track there is nothing to audit but the time track there is grand key to the release of things but the time track locks valences machinery etc are all phenomena of the time track the time track is the continuous record of time of the individual from the first moment he began to experience on through until now an interrupted threed fiftytwo perception movie things happen to that movie it gets grouped and becomes unavailable to the pc for various reasons eg his inability to confront the fact that it can get grouped etc all that auditing ever does is to straighten out the time track make it available and asis it the track gets collapsed and looped by chains which consist of related incidents until you get solid wad of experience which is unavailable to the pc and thus has command value over him there are only two classes of things involved in the time track 1 the mechanical things the matter energy space and time that is the time track 2 the significance of it people who cant confront the track at all eg psychologists and psychiatrists conceive it to consist of thought only the time track is not imaginary and shouldnt be treated as imaginary it has mass in the physical universe brick wall is the product of various people and forces where it all come from neednt be investigated for practical purposes the time track has remained undiscovered and undescribed by mental health practitioners because they have lacked the confront to get past certain mechanisms that make it unavailable nothing is holy to scientologist there is nothing that should not be investigated nothing is unavailable although psychiatrists think so they dont know that the time track is real they have fallen for the first trick that the time track employs to make itself unavailable the idea that there is nothing in the mind but thought that is trick of debarment the consideration is anybody who says that he is looking at brick building in the mind isnt looking as brick building and it must therefore be imaginary so therefore he is living in the field of illusion or delusion so therefore he must be slightly mad insane people must be mad because they are seeing things says the psychiatrist then he compounds the insanity by saying you are not seeing these things he makes the time track less available 390 the direction of sanity lies in the capability of confronting the time track and the pt environment for any individual existence consists of the physical universe pt and everything that is in it at this exact precise pt instant and the time track which consists of everything that has been and that is the total isness as far as this thing called reality is concerned archeology studies suppositional reality but it is not outlawed for that reason you can take some ruin and say what has it been but that is not the isness it is suppositional reality subject to error however archeology is not outlawed as science for that reason furthermore all futures are suppositional if they are suppositional enough they come true lrh used to tell fortunes by looking at persons facsimiles and mocking something up the future is always enforceable with altitude and authority this is just trick method of making postulate stick it is still suppositional reality there is isness and there is suppositional isness the time track often gives people the feeling that the was can return it can be quite solid when there is extra awareness jammed into particular moment you also have to look at borderline phenomenon creating someone says he will build building and he does his saying he will nearly puts it there but creation is suppositional reality until it is actually created at which point it becomes an isness and remains an isness for whatever period of time it endures part of the thought of reality is the adjudication of whether it is good bad or whatever thought is not separate from reality it is woven solidly into reality and is part of the isness of reality one can establish the isness of reality at time by asking about it some people cant even confront that here lrh recounts an anecdote about the cia or the police following students and pcs around for weeks as they ran union station an outdoor objective process command was you invent way of destroying that indicated person see hcob 6feb58 hgc clear procedure outline of february 6 the process was done to take over destructive automaticities they were trying to find out what the scientologists were doing without ever taking the trouble to ask it never occurred to them to establish an isness they couldnt even view the thought in the isness this is even worse than only being able to view the thought in the isness so there is descending gradient of ability to confront an isness 1 able to confront or view an isness 2 able to confront or view only the thought in an isness 3 unable to confront or view the thought in an isness or even to ask about it opinions are there are thoughts and opinions abroad in the world that we may not agree with but which are part of the isness wrought iron fence is thought woven into the physical universe as to some degree is all else when someone creates something in the physical universe part of its isness is the expression of his thought thought is expressed by the formation of the mest so thought is to some degree part of the physical universe likewise the time track is composed of matter energy space time and thought so both the physical universe and the time track are composed of mest and thought added onto these are many complexities such as suppositional isnesses befores and afters purposes and aesthetics 391 the degree that an individual is on suppositional kick measures directly his confrontingness how much suppositional isness is added to actual isness critic says the artist should have the should have measures the amount of nonconfront the critic is doing this is also true of pcs who typically say well it looks as if there might have been there could possibly have been wreck of some kind here at one time or another maybe i think it was an airplane it turns out that it was building the pc is very suppositional he doesnt give the isness of it someone who criticizes anything is doing supposition about how something should be they are not confronting the isness the time track straightens out and erases in direct ratio to the amount of isness confronted by the pc and that is how sane and capable he gets it is measured directly by the amount of isness the individual is able to confront in view of the fact that he pcs track is in terrible condition there are two factors at work 1 the pcs own feelings of incompetence 2 the unrecognizableness of the track these combine to give you cats breakfast an extreme form of this problem is seen in the pc who supposes all sorts of horrible things who thinks it is so uncomfortable that he doesnt even show up for session thetans state is not really pinned mechanically by anything he is not made less of thetan or more by mest but when you surround him as intimately as the time track does with tremendous amount of suppositional unconfrontability he is enforced into state of low morale where he doesnt think that he can do anything and the isness then is that he cant the pc supposes that the time track is not confrontable that the auditor is not going to be able to do anything for it that he wont be able to handle it etc all the time hes supposing hes not confronting he knows what will happen he has had all these unconfrontable experiences and his attention is still fixed on something and he knows he mustnt take his attention off of it he also knows that if he doesnt take his attention off of it he will go to pieces then he has forgotten that he has his attention on it he feels degraded by all this in addition the state of his track is horrible it is scrambled shredded snarled up the thetan in the middle of it all is convinced that if he moves or looks at any of it something horrible will happen all of it has command value over him yet at the same time it is valuable to him it has become his havingness its all the old tin cans hes got its all his knowingness hes like somebody who has become totally dependent on the record department and then the record department has been bombed he cant even find out his own name rank and serial number without it that dependency and the why of it is also in the record department the great savants who have remained ignorant of the time track have just q and ad with its unconsciousness by remaining unconscious of it and unwilling to approach its pain the time track is unavailable to the being so the savant supposes that it is unavailable to him but the auditor mustnt do this q and 392 the only real tragedy of life i suppose is that absolute unconsciousness and absolute unknowingness are unobtainable the fact that thetan cant remember at first what happened in an engram doesnt mean that he was unconscious at the time if absolute unconsciousness and unknowingness were possible we would probably be all right dont underestimate the violence that is there on the time track and dont force the pc into it but if you get the earliest moment of the earliest gpm it runs like hot butter even though theres as much charge on it as there is on later one the difficulty you hit with the later one is that it has the charge of all the earlier ones in addition to its own so it is far harder for the pc to confront it is important not to give the pc loses early on you should know the mechanics of engrams and the time track be sure your commands mean what you intend them to mean through the incident does not mean through the incident to the end and if you just say move to the end the pc wont go through the incident the bank follows the you think you are there so you are there mechanism of the thetan so the difference between to and through is very important use to in scouting and through in running engrams and dont mix them up lrh found that some pcs cant run gpms until they have run an early engram also if you can run the overt engram that relates to these gpms as an engram fantastic amount of charge will come off the implants themselves and they will run like hot butter here is datum that particular implanting outfit was located down towards the center of this galaxy and was founded 52863010 654079 years ago it was destroyed 38932690862933 years ago by the 79th wing of the 43rd battle squadron of the galactic fleet it was wildcat activity they used to drag magellanic clouds out of the center hub of the galaxy let them follow lines of force and come over system and then send planes in with speakers the place would be caved in for thousands of years as result of radioactive clouds you are not likely to find any implant earlier then or even near 52 trillion years ago or closer to pt than 359 trillion years ago any other kind of implant is different kind or dramatization of it someplace else the helatrobus implanter had the dream of everyone in the universe being good they used the ice cube see history of man pp

state of ot there isnt government on earth that has the right to permit our survival as an organization cognition the only reason you have present time problem is that you dont have enough time the helatrobus implants you can call them the heaven implants had big effect on thetans with their cold energy or frozen energy the helatrobus government had gold crosses on their aircraft one could find out who they were they couldnt find out who was behind and actually doing the implanting the implants were based on cold energy with significance placed in it the implants tended to talk the helatrobites had figured out something that looked to everyone else like natural phenomenon the magellanic radioactive clouds with which they surrounded planetary systems 393 the stars in galaxy tend to be collected towards the center of the galactic wheel when you look at the milky way you are looking towards the center of this galaxy in the opposite direction you see other galaxies we are awfully far out from the center of this galaxy our sun is rim star galaxies are condensations of radioactive clouds into suns and planets planets sometimes shatter to become belt of asteroids suns range from dead suns to red yellow white and blue suns as they get hotter and brighter bodies could exist that are suited for conditions on other planets some science fiction writers have very good memories but have fallen victim to the implants that reverse time such that the past equals the future the boogie man is standard mechanism for keeping people from going places and looking at things confronting for instance the phoenicians spread seamonster rumors to prevent competition with england in the tin trade scare stories about terrible beings are quite standard they are used to keep people out of things that others want to keep hidden most planets run by animal forms have classifiable types of forms similar from system to system depending on the environment someone built for jupitertype conditions would look perhaps eskimoish you could become very disheartened and caved in about this universe and see it as trap until you recognize that the thetan is helped all the time by mest it gives him location consecutive scenery and persistent structure of matter this universe has solved lot of problems for the thetan when he gets too far down on the tone scale therefore he gets on stuck oneway help flow with respect to the physical universe the thetan doesnt help the universe you could run him on how could you help the physical universe and he would feel better about it degraded beings come to the conclusion because of the above situation that the trouble with this universe is that it has free beings in it they feel that the universe is too good for free beings so every now and then someone decides to make it evil if thetan is that degraded what he sees as wrong with the physical universe is that it has free beings in it so he tries to make them unfree the origin of the physical universe in the first place is probably collision of home universes the problem of why everybody stays in single present time was one of the more fantastic problems the why is response to vibration there is one underlying vibration that the universe your bank and you are vibrating at the only variation in that vibration relates to the progression of time therefore you can move someone on the time track one overwhelmed others with vibration very minute vibration the size of the vibration of light particle the time track is formed by an involuntary intention in studying the power of an operating thetan lrh has had pauses in thinking although intellectually such power is conceivable recently lrh has been exploring the actual potentialities of an ot the problem of an ot may be analogous to the problem that one encounters if one tries to pick up the cellophane wrapper from pack of cigarettes without denting it at all you could 394 only do this if you could estimate or measure the exact force necessary to pick it up without denting it this is probably the basic problem of an ot and it may give him his time track the power of thetan is such that if he were to pick up steel cylinder capable of resisting pressure of several thousand pounds per square inch it would be like you with the cellophane wrapper the problem is how to touch something without crushing it the thetan is being careful in handling mest he seeks another method of handling he feels that he is quite destructive people who have lost their ot abilities and strength will try and did try on the time track to convince free thetans that they were dangerous people who havent that level of action would believe that free thetan was destructive and would trap him with the idea by causing him to use new trick doing things by intention instead of directly we have always thought of intention as primary but it is secondary the postulate and action through postulates is secondary to action through energy you should be able to do both but it is more natural for thetan to just pick something up than to pick it up by an intention or postulate that it be up it is great downgrade intention is unnatural it would be natural to just move things however this is hard to do if the thetan is afraid that he will destroy the thing in the process instead he develops the safer method of operation by intention alone he can do this but it enforces great restraint on him it is like putting yourself on terrific withhold of self the thetan trains intention to become involuntary it is not imaginary it is like involuntary nerves or muscles that work automatically mest is fragile recently in new york or melbourne when they started running the goal to forget in coaudit the emeter got fused the pc melted the lines some involuntary intention was triggered in him and zap unless you understand this as too great power within the ethical limits of the individual you wont understand the problems of an ot thetan is stronger than the fragility with which he is surrounded and he compensates by reducing his power this was the wrong solution he developed an automatic action eg the phone rings he doesnt touch it it springs into the air and he talks the postulate does things without his having to intend them there is difference between an involuntary intention to act and an involuntary intention to duplicate and an involuntary intention to create and thats where the time track comes from this is an hypothesis to account for the time track then someone gives the thetan things for the automatic machinery to mock up which would be bad for the thetan or someone jams the machinery and makes the thetan fight his own automatic intention the next thing you know he has messedup time track he goes solid he picks up meat body the withhold begins with the steel cellophane rational solution would have been not to make everything so damned fragile withholding all the time has all sorts of ill effects including putting engrams on your track these matters have lot to do with scientology organizations seeing the character of an ot we see that these matters could be upsetting in various directions we have some responsibilities to start things out right if we are going to make ots early on conceiving that free thetans were very dangerous and should be shot down people like the helatrobites started laying in implants and weakening people working with great 395 industry before these implants planets were suddenly surrounded with radioactive cloud masses from the center of the galaxy waves of black and grey clouds would sweep over the planet engulfing it in radioactivity the dark horse nebula in orion is one huge radioactive cloud like this this could go on for million years universes have lines of force vectors like spokes which were used by the helatrobus group to move magellanic clouds they just set them loose one found out that it was being done by someone it was all explained as natural phenomenon because of these theories one thought to look for anyone doing it at least hundred years after system had been engulfed helatrobus would send capturing troops in ships with little orangecolored electronic bombs that would talk speech was frozen into electronic capsules the clouds would talk hark hark look out etc it sounded like fun house its unbelievability made detection of its origin all but impossible it confused the thetans all to hell for some reason the symbol of airplanes goes through this this symbol goes earlier to implants at 80 trillion years ago where aircraft symbolized needing machine to get you off planet so for some years after years of radioactivity the clouds were there with speech in them containing contradictory commands like come here cant come go mustnt go it was doubletalk the helatrobites put traction beams on thetans eventually after many incidents of resisting it the thetan got sucked up into small capsules via bubbles and thence into spaceships all of this assaulted his credulity he couldnt understand what was going on this had never happened before then in one to six months the helatrobites would get him into an implant area fix him on post wobbled him around ran him through an implant of goals on little monowheel pole trap with the effigy of body on it he had body at that time eventually he would get home then he would get picked up again and put through more series of implants probably the helatrobites knew who had been implanted already because we find implants in pairs of two and four never three or one once this started the planet would be in turmoil and revolt and things got very insane the heaven implants then were preceded by tremendous periods of unrest with radioactive clouds orange bombs warfare wild anarchy etc it was chaos rather like twentieth century earth it was hitlerlike stuff it got more and more crazy and out of control they were very worried thetans before the clouds came there would be occasional thetatrapping etc but things were generally pretty peaceful it was only when the free thetans were threatened that they became restive and ungovernable free thetans in themselves are easy to put up with in pi radioactive fallout is key restimulator of this whole scene but how does partlyfreed thetan feel when he sees the old situation seeming to repeat itself with all the symbols from the track it makes him mad at fallout government wars etc earth is in for period of chaos which scientology can render less extreme than it would otherwise be but we cant entirely eliminate the chaos since some earlier chaos will be restimulated but the planet is doomed if we dont operate lrhs attention is therefore on organizational concerns how do we move through such period the scientology organization is set up to handle this period of chaos 396 as long as thetans have rage in their hearts about the situation their power is curtailed this is safety factor if we just let chaos happen we will slow our forward progress sooner or later there will be the rest of the galaxy to deal with earth has already blasted off into meatbody space opera which may not be appreciated by someone out there earth people get hysterical when they think that there is an invasion from space so it represents real threat not something people think is unreal or impossible orson wells radio broadcast of the war of the worlds resulted in ecuador in the radio station that broadcast it being torn down by enraged ecuadorians they knew about space opera even though they didnt have science fiction to educate them with things as they are several factors confront us if we handle things as they are we may be able to have things as we would like to have

is contained in hcob 27may63 cause of arc breaks lrh has discovered the common denominator to all arc breaks bypassed charge an arc break is defined as the pcs transfer of attention from the bank to the auditor and dramatization of the bank directed at the auditor charge that has been restimulated in session may provide background booster for session upset when you drag the pcs attention to the auditor the charge that has been deliberately restimulated in the session doesnt get asised and the pc arc breaks thus something that outside the session could not cause an arc break may and will cause an arc break if it happens in session the arc break is not caused by social faux pas it is caused by the sudden shift of attention the unleashing of charge that was held back by the fact that the pcs attention was on it as long as the pc has his attention on the bank he is cause over its charge the moment his attention is flicked off of it he is the effect of that charge and the pc then dramatizes it any tone level or knowtomystery scale level that is higher than the chronic tone of the pc being higher than the pc is cause over the pc and is therefore dramatized it should be noted that apathy is high tone for pc the tone level contained in the incident is what the pc unintentionally dramatizes he could dramatize anything eg boredom effort eg breaking chair or manic and the auditor is good target the pc himself is helpless to restrain himself from dramatizing he will be surprised at himself amazed to react that way etc an arc break comes about whenever charge is bypassed that then puts the pc at its effect point the pc dramatizes the charge that has been bypassed this charge is unknown to him and can therefore affect him adversely the remedy is to locate and indicate the exact bypassed charge at which point the arc break ceases that is the mechanics of it you dont have to go into do and run the arc break and run all engrams connected with it etc you only have to indicate bypassed charge the remedy is not continuous auditing 397 you know now how to turn off someones anger by saying that someone missed his withholds that often works but when it doesnt it is because you indicated the wrong bypassed charge you could assess number of possibilities eg missed gpm missed goal missed ri he will stop being arc broken when you get the right one in session only few charges can be missed goals ris engrams refutation of reality rejection of affinity more basic incident failure to acknowledge that pretty well covers it these things occur in life also rage is an automaticity in such delicate balance that almost anything can make it slip neurosis is actually hard to maintain that explains the simple effectiveness of correctly locating and indicating bypassed charge the psychiatrists failure comes about from two sources 1 lack of technology 2 an interest in insanitys being very hard to solve arc breaks are not hard to handle if you know the cause and handling of them dont back off or fear them just develop the skill to find and indicate the right bpc or you will get loses in auditing and eventually give up temporary or permanent conditions of misemotional stress are something that you have to face up to as an auditor 0r just get out of the auditing chair so i want you to get confidence that you can find the bpc and then by indicating it to the pc realize the tool that is in your power that pc arc breaks is guarantee that the pc is in poor case shape or difficult to get gains on just indicating the correct bpc turns off the arc break you may find that the charge was bypassed two sessions ago or the arc break doesnt get handled because you cant find what it was until somewhat later then when you indicate it the pc calms down but you shouldnt let an arc break last more than two or three minutes because arc breaks multiply on steep curve governments these days are run by riot because they are so scared of arc breaks englands matteroffact handling of the ban the bomb movement is an exception to this rule like an auditor who doesnt get thrown by or governed by arc breaks governments have also been run by fear of assassination this is just dramatization of the helatrobus implants you as an auditor could be governed by arc breaks if you cant handle them you are never governed by that which you can handle with ease so learn to handle arc breaks until arc breaks become just another phenomenon like runny nose your attitude on arc breaks must never be one whereby you are driven by the arc break because you will be driven then into not getting the items clean into taking the pcs orders which are the direct result of dramatizations the orders are the significance contained in what you just put him at the effect of the bpc dont for instance as registrar get reasonable in the face of dramatization hunt and peck around for bypassed charge the rage is an automaticity psychosis is very tenuous and easy to break number of arc breaks is not correlated with the success of auditing arc breaks multiply as the square of time the greater the facility with which you handle arc breaks the less you are governed by them 398 pcs who are continually arc broken in session can be run on the threeway arc break process this process however is not for use every time the pc arc breaks for instance for an auditor messed up with arc breaky pcs you could run the following _ what attitude has been refused in auditing what reality has been rejected what communication has not been acknowledged this works better than midruds it is the successor to arc break straightwire which in 1958 could go into engrams and even implants it works because what it does is directly to locate and indicate bpc if you let the arc broken pc control you you will be taking his orders because he is dramatizing not only the emotion but also the significance contained in the bpc this is dangerous to the pc so you should 1 learn to handle arc breaks 2 be good enough as an auditor never to bypass charge you can bypass charge by not finding any you press on with the session in the teeth of pc who is dramatizing apathy then the pc gives you wrong goal and you take it thereby bypassing more charge the harder you are driven by arc breaks into doing bad job the more charge you bypass it wont run well bypassed charge is always prior to the charge on what you are doing so the arc break is blessing in disguise since it tells you that there is more charge which you have bypassed it is more accurate than the meter in this case arc breaks are cumulative in their effects you do still have to peel enough charge from later incidents to get to the earlier ones but the pc wont arc break if you indicate to the pc as an rfactor what you are doing if you tell the pc that there is basic on the chain he wont arc break even if you dont run the basic because you have indicated the earlier charge indicating that there is earlier charge also makes it possible for the pc to run the later stuff the pc can arc break in the rudiments because he has outruds in the incident that is just bpc and you can indicate it so when you chicken out of cleaning an rl because the pc is protesty and arc broken you have set yourself up for more arc breaks on subsequent items dont buy an ri that doesnt rocket read full dial if it wont there is bpc to clean up bypass the charge keep it secret you will get an arc break dont bypass charge l ron hubbard type 3 idate29563 volnum1 issue270 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec270 programming cases part 1 6305c29 shspec270 programming cases part 1 the subject of programming cases is almost as old as the discovery of the engram programming is the overall action taken to resolve the case regulated by the state of the case and the necessary steps if guy stubs his toe and you decide to give him an assist that is programming the assist is auditing the two are not the same these are the things to be adjudicated in programming 1 time how much is available 2 what will the case accept stand for or tolerate as auditing 3 what will the case progress on as auditing 4 order of actions this comes back to time 1 5 when you will start auditing you cant leave out any of these adjudications 399 you need good grip on programming before you can actually make clears even if you have technique that works on everybody because programming is easy to do lrh has never put it out as itself so it has been missed as factor in getting all cases to run well programming is easy unless you dont do it programming is based on some fundamental principles it is based on 1 the behavior of the time track 2 the abilities and disabilities of the pc related to the time track the time track is the worlds longest movie in 3d included in the movie are things which apparently destroy some of the movie so between say reel 16 and reel 80 everything is missing with improper programming you will never find that section and you can audit reel 80 and reel 16 and everything beyond reel 80 and though the pc gets lots of auditing nothing happens to his case because what is wrong with him is what is between reel 16 and reel 80 this film has total effect on the pc he lives it as you run it you can only be effective if you run the parts that are personal to the pc that is running the reality of the pc there are things you can run that are unreal to him but that nevertheless affect him eg the helatrobus implant but dont exceed the pcs reality by too much the program is not monitored by what the pc has reality on before you audit him it is monitored by what the pc can obtain reality on during auditing after all you want to increase his reality dont omit pc change and volition in your calculations and remember his reality might exceed yours if you dont try to increase the pcs reality you neglect his capacity to change it does the pc good to audit him farther than where he is at yesterdays mental sciences made this mistake continually they treated patients only from and on the viewpoint of their own reality then denied the patients capacity to change programming is based 100 on the following 1 the capability of the auditor 2 the capability of the pc to receive auditing 3 the amount of time available 4 the maximum result to be obtained given these limits in terms of increase of r and c affinity the increase in affinity can be seen in the persons change in position on the knowtomystery scale of which the tone scale is the middle guts person has personal reality except for possible intellectual reality on those tones that lie above his position on this scale he only has reality on those tones that lie below his chronic tone his chronic tone can be the tone of the body plus thetan or chronic tone as thetan the body plus thetan tone can be considerably higher than his tone as thetan the chronic tone of the body plus thetan combination can be at 40 while the level of the thetan is at unconscious any level above the chronic tone is susceptible of being dramatized dramatization is thetan or thetan plus body performing evolutions not under the thetan or thetan plus bodys control nonvolitional actions old mental studies fixated on these and believed that there is nothing else but there are volitional actions they lie below the chronic tone of the individual on the tone scale 400 there are two chronic tones that of the thetan and that of the thetan plus body combination the body plus thetan can dramatize any tone above the chronic tone but most likely it will be the half tone above the chronic tone the above is of arc therefore increasing affinity is making the pc less susceptible to dramatization and gives the pc reality on more tones that are now below him you have added levels on which he has reality and subtracted levels which he may dramatize previously as certain tone was above him he was the effect of it now being above that tone he has reality on it and he is longer the effect of it the body plus thetan tone is an apparent tone and it never goes above 40 so you could have pc flying along at 40 enthusiastic and the next day you will get the thetan alone and he drops from 40 to zilch he has come up to degradation as thetan he feels awful for apparent reason because you are now seeing the thetan who has come up above unconsciousness to degradation as thetan for the first time this is case gain in terms of affinity to go somewhere by route one you have to get the thetans chronic tone level upscale enough to do it reality you can measure persons reality by measuring significance since reality is matter energy space time and significance the five parts of universe psychological testing measures reality on significances you can test reality by solution of problems if persons conversation is full of cant understand and he gets very reasonable about unreasonable things and he can assume viewpoint but his own while he doesnt really have one his reality level is low he may demonstrate this by the fact that as the pc comes to others viewpoints he begins to recognize his own overts and to suffer on that account that is big reality increase and occurs because understanding more and being more able to take other viewpoints the pc becomes more responsible he cognites cognition is actually the process of changing reality of significance it is necessary to case gain cognition more understanding case gain pc saying that the session was wonderful has not necessarily had any case gain he may have been beaten into propitiation but if he says you know my mom must have had quite hard time that is cognition if the pc is able to assume new viewpoint in this case that of his mother he has had case gain getting the pcs goals and gains at the end of the session is little psychometric test measure of case gain communication there is obvious gain when the pc is more willing to talk to people but his increased perception of walls etc isnt really changed reality so much as it is increased communication reach and withdraw willingness to receive etc is what is involved here even if the case is delusory and sees the room as full of polar bears it would be case gain at the end of the session if he could see the polar bears better if you are operating from the platform of the reality that the room is not full of polar bears and that you must therefore get rid of the polar bears you will have dropped the pcs communication this was one of freuds errors he cant communicate with you but he can communicate with these polar bears if he could communicate with the polar bears well enough he wouldnt have to communicate with them and they would depart thats the way to get rid of polar bears 401 psychiatrists try to convince the patient that he doesnt have any bugs crawling on him this is the same as saying there must only be this one reality and unless we can hold the status quo of this reality we have lost this has been the criterion in all mental activities for the many trillenia and an auditor may be holding onto it with both fists and not realize it this consideration is that our only gain would be from the platform of where we are if we could continue the alteration to making things more like they are here and now we we would get case gain this consideration is way to clobber people by holding them on the time track these are the technical data underlying programming auditing is done by 1 unburdening basics 2 discovering what basics there are 3 disentangling them so as to erase basics this includes cchs it includes all processing discovery of basics end eradication of basics is done by discovering what basics can be found before the basic that disentangles the basic that you are trying to untangle basic will almost blow by inspection unless there is more basic one holding it in however basic on chain contains elements that are not basic to the basic say you have the basic on the chain of some somatic it is basic on the chain you are running but it has something in it that comes from more basic chain on another subject when this happens you can slip the basic out from under the earlier basics by finding the basics of remaining elements in the basic of the original chain frequently this can be done by dating by the time you are through you have practically cleared somebody if you can keep track of what you are doing you will be very successful if not the whole track collapses and the pc goes under the first action you should undertake on case is the most advanced action that can be undertaken in your estimation always enter case more boldly than you think is wise and you will usually be right if you dont you will never find the ceiling at which the pc can operate if you get away with it you are all set you have saved time that is what you are doing with the helatrobus implants if the pc cant manage it pull back so all there is to auditing is unburdening finding chain finding the basic on the chain and taking apart the basic i dont care what process you are using running chain back is unburdening it its taking off charge so that you can lay your paws on basic you are after the first gpm and if the pc cant recall what he had for breakfast this morning you have to unburden the case how long should you continue unburdening the case until you can get your hands on an implant not one second longer that you run the charge off of at least one dialwide disintegrating rocket read per item if and when you get stuck you probably have too early an implant one that is too close to basic remember you are trying to unburden pick up the last incident in the second chain if you know what it is and run that one with fast pass or lets use straightwire to give him some locks or find overts on this lets see if we can chase him earlier and find the first it is all unburdening you see lets run the threecommand process for awhile we are just trying to get our hands on an implant so we can run some charge off of it and find an earlier implant so that we can get to the basic implant 402 you have to go later and unburden the basic implant because you are asking the pc to walk through wall of fire between pt and basic there is wall of fire you cant push the pc through the wall of fire you have to get him through to get the pc through it you have to put some fire out on gradient that is done by programming l ron hubbard type 3 idate30563 volnum1 issue271 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec271 programming cases part ii 6305c30 shspec271 programming cases part ii some of the data in this tape is contained in hcob 8jun63 the time track and engram running by chains bulletin 2 handling the time track in particular p3 of this bulletin contains scale of case states that is relevant to this tape there is gradient scale of cases it is not complete there are interim points that are not shown on this scale the lowest level on the scale level 8 is that of total unconsciousness the next one up level 7 is awareness of own evaluations this is where the mental sciences are at psychiatrist listens to someone chatter and becomes aware of his own evaluation of the person as crazy what he perceives is his own evaluation of what he perceives or of what is there to be perceived its an incapability of observation because its an observation of own evaluation you see it most flagrantly in the fields of arts and aesthetics the less that is known of subject the more it has authority or evaluation as its sole reality or adjudication this is where most antiscientology wogs lie i had an uncle who said you shouldnt mess with the mind that uncle is perceiving not scientology but his evaluation or anothers evaluation of it the next level up level 6 is dubin of dubin here person has dubin of his own nightmares that is all he sees it is someone forming his opinion on newspaper articles actually that is dubin the readers of dubin the reporters of dubin the sources this level is below but approaching unconsciousness as thetan manifestation the body plus thetan can go lower scale than thetan whose unconsciousness lies just above this level of dubin of dubin body plus thetan can apparently stay conscious longer than the thetan can as far as awareness of being thetan is concerned lot of boiloff occurs above level 6 level 5 is dubin of the time track the facsimile does exist but what the person or pc sees is dubin of the facsimile that is there second facsimile above this at level 4 is nonperception where the pc gets blackness invisibility small rockets etc it is nonvisibility what used to be called the black v is at this level above this at level 3 is spotty partialperceptic glimpses of the time track with only some visio sonic or tactile etc then at level 2 there is totally visible time track with interruptions there is blackness in this track unless the blackness was really there in an incident fifty or sixtygoal clear would be in this condition he could monitor the time track the way one monitors the physical environment above this at level 1 there is time track the lowest two levels are gross lower scale harmonics of level 1 403 the above is scale of perception of the time track it is what makes cases different auditing time estimates should be based on pcs location on this scale you could probably use the physical universe to test where pc is on this scale for instance you could have him look at wall with picture on it close his eyes and tell you what he gets the result will be about half tone or tone higher than where he really is eg if he cant see it what wall he is at level 4 above though actually he will tend towards level 5 in running track there is tendency to slip one level the only levels that are fairly serious are levels 7 and 8 because it is very hard to get into communication with those cases but establishing communication at one level moves the person up to the next level and so on up to the top ultimately dont expect this to be done swiftly and accurately however most of the cases that you will be dealing with will have invisibility and sporadic track if you consider the amount of auditing necessary to audit sporadic track case as one unit of time invisibility would take two units dubin of track would take four units of time etc ie the time required to get given auditing result doubles at each level as you go down the scale for instance if it took one hour to audit out one engram on pc with sporadic track it would take thirtytwo hours to audit out an engram in an unconscious case actually that is optimistic at both ends the case result that we are interested in is ot we already have the fait accompli of clearing so we are going beyond it any effort to get an ultimate result in processing leads to ot that upgrades the number of hours to ot to say 500 hours to ot for the sporadic track case insanity neurosis or ability to respond to communication play part in that scale of cases because those conditions are found only at one level of the scale the own evaluations level level 7 any objective test of case state that has human observer adjudicating pass or fail works out poorly where the observer is himself at case level 7 have you ever been flunked on tr1 by coach that couldnt coach the concepts of insanity or neurosis are contained as goals in the helatrobus implants therefore they cannot be used to evaluate state of case wisdom based on the helatrobus implants is nuts other goals from that implant include to die to be sick to move to escape to get it ie to get sickness etc etc almost any one of these goals has been the source of learned treatises dramatizing them to explain all of mans ills eg treatises on escapism the history of man contains references to few implants it remains valid though and the engrams described in it did exist they just got collected together during implants what causes different people to be at different positions on this scale it could be the length of time that they have spent in this universe this implies universe that accumulated from the successive collisions of home universes with it the mest universe picks up different home universes at different points on the track older thetans are in worse shape state of case then would be monitored by number of overts different statuses of thetans at the time of entry etc the why doesnt need to be known to solve the situation how these thetans came to be there in this universe can be stated easily charge this is 404 quantitative matter you pump charge into case when the eighteen prepcheck buttons go out ie inval eval etc if there were thought involved you could probably shortcircuit it all but there is also thought which includes volition as the universe pumps charge into thetan he pumps it into other thetans and other things then he inhibits himself from doing so the result is overts and withholds the charge gets encysted as composite picture of the number of things done to the being held in place by the number of things done by the being this produces x amount of charge on the case that in the absence of auditing just keeps on growing the thetan gets lot more or little more in given lifetime but it is always additive that is what makes the universe trap if charge didnt keep accumulating the universe would be therapeutic instead of aberrative you can have an attitude about the charge too the attitude doesnt alter the charge but it can affect how you feel about it in view of the fact that an ot has fantastic power it is funny that charge would bother him until we figure out the basic overt of the thetan any overt thetan commits is also mixed up with the energy thetan is emitting all of his overts have particles connected with them so the only way to really get him is to hit him with particles because that is the path of his overts so most implants are mainly connected with particle flows of various types people therefore have different amounts of charge one person has quantity of charge another person has quantity b etc the more charge person has the more difficult it is to release it that is why it takes so much longer to get results on the unconscious case this depends to degree on whether the case condition is chronic ie lasting more than lifetime or acute temporary one lifetime or less eg the pc may be spastic now as an acute condition relating to his body the question is whether he is always going to be that way matter what body he picks up chronic if condition is chronic it will add lot of time to auditing you could put deaf man on meter and ask him whether he was deaf last lifetime and the one before that if he was you have deaf thetan on your hands not deaf body and it will take time to fix charge is what causes case to be the way it is just because thetan plus body is low on the state of case scale the thetan itself is not necessarily low on that scale environmental factors can also make someone look downscale when they are not lrh relates an anecdote of time when he audited girl who was acting very nutty and brought her through in short space of time you have to estimate this to program someones case what you are going to program is the persons case so you have to estimate the case to determine how to get the charge off the case case is programmed in relation to the amount of charge on the case that is what determines how you are going to take the charge off the case since auditing requires the cooperation of the being you have to estimate his cooperativeness his ability etc this does affect the ease of auditing and the speed of auditing sample program the case dubs in track charge can be run off we get dialwide rocket reads on helatrobus implants if the pc can run it run it it is dicey because the case can easily go to smithereens it is better to pull overts on this lifetime and run any stretch of track on which the pc has reality be very sure 405 that the case has withholds from the auditor especially thislifetime ones muzzle the auditing dont force this pc run rocket reading implants as long as they run easily when things get difficult fall back swiftly to patching up roughedup track return to an arctype process if the going gets too rough on ris tunning ris is dangerous that would be very extreme and daring programming for this case it is quick but dicey the safe way is using straightwire havingness withholds etc an alternate approach is if you got goal run all the charge off the goal never look for earlier goals when you have found one dont try pushing the case to get all the charge off of an implant take case with sporadic track you can run it pretty hard you can move around on the track from one gpm to another without messing things up much this level of case level 3 could even stand leaving goals without running them he may arc break but you can do it the case can be pushed hard the invisibility case level 4 can be pushed bit but not as hard as the sporadic track case with the dubin case level 5 you need lots of track repair ow running havingness you must readily cut and run if implants get rough with the dubin of dubin case dont let him near implants this isnt common case level 6 use straightwire and arc break processes run the case lightly for wins every session you are running the case too steep if you are not getting session wins unless this case is aware of having regular wins in session the cases reality is not coming up the aware of own evaluations case level 7 is suited only for havingness and cchs room processes contacting pt processes this case cant detect an overt as such he has responsibility he will tell things to you but not as overts to get daring with this case run straightwire with the unconscious case level 8 establish communication animal processing is the same sort of thing establish comm get the animal to reach always be little optimistic in estimating where someone is on the scale then program to get as much charge off as you can with the pc winning how much charge is being gotten off is measured by the ta and needle action charge is important because its what restimulates when he tries to outflow and prevents his outflow its what educates him not to reach in getting off charge processing lets him reach and do total selfdeterminism is only possible at the highest level given above level 1 there there are automaticities time track charge on the case the result is unlimited reach 406 l ron

engrams i found out youve been trying to run engrams and you never run engrams you run chains of engrams this is the way i ran engrams in 1949 this got crossed up with repetitive processing flatten the process became flatten the engram when it should have been flatten the chain you flatten the chain by getting the basic engrams never exist all by themselves there is always chain an engram is only part of chain of similar incidents which in turn is part of time track you are essentially running time track you never handle an engram all by itself because it is too closely related to the rest of the track to be treated that way if you are skilled auditor you can quickly pick up bpc when the pc arc breaks indicate it and have the arc break disappear until you can do this you will have rough sessions in engram running the bpc is always the earlier incident on the engram chain charge is able to make the pc feel worse or better depending on whether it gets restimulated and encysted or blows you can let the pc learn more by entering lot of engrams and not finding basic the result is that the pc knows more but feels worse because you havent erased basic on the chain running chain of engrams is not the same as finding out about lot of incidents every time you run an engram you open up valve into the next earlier engram letting its charge get restimulated and partially leak into the one you are running if you continue to run the later engram it gets sticky ta ceases and it gets solid and will eventually collapse on the pc the bpc from the earlier engram causes the pc to arc break moving back to the earlier one blows some of the charge charge always flows later from its source not earlier we can only find the earlier engram because the later one was run as we go back on the chain each incident seems to be the earliest incident when it is actually just the earliest available incident if two engrams or any two pictures collapse the cause is bpc and the pc will very shortly arc break the converse is also true if the pc has bpc and is arc breaky you have two pictures collapsed outofvalenceness thats over there is also problem of bpc if an earlier engram is tapped it will bleed charge into the one you are running the somatic will strengthen but this phenomenon wont cause outofvalenceness an outofvalenceness is caused by an earlier portion of the same engram that you are working on that hasnt been seen it is assisted by charge bleeding from an earlier incident you could even run dubin case and get him earlier than the dubin however it is safer to use straightwire or mest processes suppose you are running an engram where the pc hit his head and when the pc goes through the incident the part where he actually hits his head gets skipped this indicates that the engram is part of chain of hit head so we work our way back through earlier incidents as he gets back to basic he gets full perceptics when we get to basic we run it over and over and his somatic blows if we came back up through the chain you could send the pc through each engram on the chain and now he would get the somatic each time 407 the only way to flatten an engram is to flatten chain of engrams chains of overts follow the same principle as was done in sec checking this involved the withhold system used in prepchecking old style see hcob 1mar62 prepchecking class ii skill and pp 208209 above these also go much earlier than this life chains of overts include overt engrams it doesnt matter which you run because the overtmotivator sequence is an installed mechanism it is very old it is not as deeply laid in as obsessive create but it is equally implanted and engramic either overt chains or motivator chains can be run they rarely entwine sometimes the pc will jump chains from motivator to overt when that happens you should follow it down to the basic overt but you should then also pick up and complete the motivator chain running engrams is very simple here is how lrh would do it get crude date eg 89 trillion years ago get the pc to return to this incident ask him what he is looking at ask how long is this incident get the duration by meter get the pc to move on through the incident to the end there will be long pause the pc says i did ask him what it is all about the pc tells you ask for an earlier beginning get when it was send the pc to the earlier beginning then through the incident the pc goes through the incident and tells you about it pc has somatic lrh dates with the meter an earlier incident with the same somatic he sends the pc through that incident you go earlier date it etc if you dont complete the chain in one session and the pc doesnt get the picture run few commands of since the last time i audited you is there anything you were unwilling to duplicate run this to clean needle the picture will now be on dont harass the pc to find all the unknowns in the incident it is not necessary to do this when you have had rough session try since the day before that session occurred what have you been unwillingwilling to duplicate alternate these commands if the pc cant run engrams it is because he is at the wrong place on the scale of case levels to be able to confront it even dubin case can run earlier than the dubin but it is dangerous engram running is important because you wont make ots without it all the fancy stuff was developed to handle cases that were too heavily charged to run real track the least common denominator of the case scale is noduplicate which is right in the middle of the communication formula the swan song of this universe is that that which you are unwilling to duplicate tends to go on automatic an arc break is an unwillingness to duplicate if you show students bad tvd they will flub the first five minutes of their next session because they were unwilling to duplicate the bad tvd and therefore it went on automatic in their next session this is what happens when you show bad example you could clean up earlier bad auditing by running since few days before the bad auditing what have you been unwillingwilling to duplicate it will clean up resistance to duplication can be caved in one can become what one resists or the effect of what one resists persons ability to duplicate is what determines his ability to run engrams because the engram itself is duplication of the actual event the pc duplicates the event but if the picture he is running is an altered copy of the original it is dubin all engrams have some dubin in them and develop new material you can get some surprising changes one is particularly unwilling to duplicate dangerous things so one then gets lots of them 408 the person who is totally unaware has tried to whip the mechanism of obsessively duplicating everything the trouble with this strategy is that his duplication goes on total automatic some people have very heavy engrams indeed over which they have control these engrams are very inaccurate they stub their toe and have picture of being run over by truck that is all they run if anything since there are very incredible things on the track anyway such as the helatrobus implants it would be very inaccurate and dangerous to determine whether or not pc can run engrams by looking for factualness for instance basic on prenatals is an incident from the helatrobus implant in which the thetan on pole is tumbled through series of tubes all curled up one way to see if guy can run engrams is to try him out if it is go you can get out the arc triangle in hurry better test is simple duplication for instance you can call off series of numbers 3 6 2 9 7 to person and ask him what you said if the pc didnt duplicate you you can forget about running engrams or you can go by the chart of attitudes or any test of duplication but you shouldnt go by the material he runs you can use an arc process to improve someones reality all sorts of other processes will also do this the duplication process see p 414 below also works well cchs are effective when rightly used to show the pc that it is safe to duplicate if the case cannot run engrams and if you are running them correctly engram running is probably too steep gradient for the pc the reason these data on engrams is important is that the helatrobus implants are long chain of engrams each one with basic and they tend to bunch the whole track on some cases you can only run six gpms before the rocket read shuts off and at this point you have to start running engrams when do you go earlier whenever the pc recognizes that there is something earlier however he states it he may say so directly or he may say something that shows that he is looking for something earlier if the pc sees something earlier you go earlier never ignore this if you ignore the indication that an earlier incident is available the one you are running will get harder to run besides you risk an arc break charge is registered on the emeter by needle and ta motion you must get ta action or you are just restimulating the case without blowing anything there is absolute basic on engram chains when you get to basic on chain there may be portions of it that themselves have earlier basics go ahead and run those out too there is only one basic basic it contains those impulses which eventually became aberration there are two things you can do with dating 1 relieve charge 2 identify something if you do total dating it goes down to the second you get the exact number of years plus days minutes seconds ago get the date accurately and the incident gets placed right where it should be on the track thus relieving charge dating also contains identification you can use rough dates for this purpose eg 89 billion or 450 million as long as you dont have bunch of incidents close together in row 409 blocking out an incident has these steps 1 get an approximate date 2 move the time track to that date 3 ask the pc what is there accept whatever he gives you in every case 4 find its duration fairly accurately if it is days get the number 5 move the pc through it not to the end 6 then establish what was there 7 move the pc to the beginning and send him through again dont vary the routine and dont q and with the pcs unknownness if the pc keeps saying im stuck forget about holders and denyers he has just gotten in over his head bail him out and revert to lighter processes always suspect that there is something bit earlier ask for it blocking it out is done by going through it once after that the pc may be expected to tell you if there is something earlier generally run the pc through the incident twice once through is plenty if it is gummy having to go through an incident more than twice is suspect dont try to keep getting more out of it it is ok to keep running an incident as long as we are getting motion on the meter but dont strain to get more perceptics out of the incident more will turn up as you go earlier you can keep running an engram as long as the pc is interested in it and finding out more but the instant he says there may be something earlier go earlier or you will stick him in the later incident if you dont go for earlier incidents you blunt the pcs ability to go earlier and stick him where he is but dont force him earlier if he is starting to bounce up to pt let him and run arc processes basic isnt generally the more powerful incident it is just the first incident it seems so unimportant to the pc yet later incidents built up on it bigger and bigger basic is the shorter lighter incident theoretically you could run back to basicbasic if you found and erased this the pc would then have pictures and track if pc seems to be trying to escape running engrams by going earlier he is over his head and needs more preparation if you get the pc fully interiorized into the engram say by putting his attention on large object in the incident he will get it all fully charged up in 3d this is not what you want you will never get him out of the universe that you are packing around him l ron hubbard type 3 idate12663 volnum1 issue273 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec273 arc straightwire 6306c12 shspec273 arc straightwire arc straightwire is the oldest broadnature repetitive process it is possibly the first repetitive process the arc triangle was originated in july 1950 in elizabeth nj it was expanded in september or november of 1950 at the hubbard dianetic research foundation in angeles it was an important tool for understanding the mind it is best described in notes on the lectures see pp 916 the arc triangle is the most fundamental statement of significance although it also embraces mest when prime postulate impinges on mest it becomes involved with arc the mest can be in the physical universe or in the time track affinity is so much itself and so relative that we get into difficulties trying to interpret it in an auditing command affinity embraces everything from the knowtomystery scale it is feeling for or feeling with or lack of those it has connotations of feeling about it is not enough to say emotional response sympathy and empathy come into it it is very broad and new concept if you will substitute the knowtomystery scale for affinity and use the words emotion and misemotion pcs will respond to it the emotions scale being just part of the knowtomystery scale is included in affinity the word affinity is really inadequate to embrace the whole concept because the concept has not been expressed in any language how many words can be used in command to express the concept of affinity lots everything on the knowtomystery scale can be used including the whole tone scale we find the pc chronically situated at one of these levels and that is the level to which he will respond in processing reality could pertain to significance alone as in his reality is poor or to actual chunks of matter reality is normally considered to consist of considerations about something or someone on up to the more solid concepts of matter energy space and time in clearing this word you will have less trouble than in clearing affinity unless the pc is really in thought but if you bad to vary it you would have harder task on your hands you would have to specify which part of mest you meant or which consideration communication is anything that fits under the communication formula it involves cause effect duplication etc in clearing communication you could specify which type or kind you meant you could use various parts of the communication formula in the third c command of arc straightwire clearing commands doesnt just mean can the pc define the word it is matter of substituting words in the command so that the pcs level of reality is met by the command the question we should ask is which word communicates to the pc what we are trying to communicate to him r and c make understanding when combined this was worked out mathematically in the fall of 1950 they actually compute mathematically when the pc cognites he has reached point of arc expressed as new understanding you wont get cognition if you omit one of the legs of the arc triangle if you run only r and c and not you dont get cogs if you wish to raise any one point that is low you can and should work on the other two points that is terribly valuable datum that must be observed in any arc process any point that is overrun or more difficult will give you trouble unless you preserve the balance amongst the three one leg will ever flatten by itself it is the three that you are trying to flatten so flatten all three in flattening process you can run it to 1 three equal comm lags 2 cognition leave the process right there dont ever overrun cog for instance dont put in the last midrud if the pc cognites on the nexttolast the arc processes unflatten easily so if you go past cognition the process will be unflat 3 ta motion runs out for arc processes this is the least reliable and the most desirable you can run by blowdown but you cant depend on ta motion to run out at the same time on each leg the way to flatten one leg is to give equal time to the other legs not to beat the slow one to death 411 the first thing that arc straightwire was found to do was to break neurosis if it is going to have that effect it will work fairly fast the only difficult cases on the 1950 positive process are the ones who ground down to finite number of answers and gave those over and over without ever cogniting the reason for this is that their positive arc moments are quite few and they run out quickly they are pleasure moments and wont flatten you have to run the reverse side of it around 1958 lrh started running lot of reach and withdraw the way 1q was being raised was to run what could you withhold on someone funny phenomenon or you could plunge people into an engram and run it half way that will also raise iq scores as person who needs mass to think gets more mass to think with the upsets you run into on case are not the cases pleasure moments they are times of separation and individuation the most fundamental forms of arc breaks are 1 times when the pc was knocked away from being part of things 2 times when the pc was forced to part of things that he wanted nothing to do with his power of choice to connect or disconnect was overthrown this gives an arc break he was there but didnt want to be there or he wanted to be there but couldnt be there an implant is the biggest kind of arc break you can run recall an arc break on someone and it will run him into implants into times when he was held in place where he didnt want to be and told things that he didnt want to hear fundamental overthrow of his power of choice the arc straightwire processes were revised to saw out pieces of implants in order to help handle the helatrobus implants lrh discovered that the big midruds see hcob 8mar63 use of the big middle rudiments or the 18button prepcheck mush an engram they mess it up spoiling the record the engram frays around the edges it turns into pure energy without giving the pc any memory of what happened in the incident this showed that if you were going to use big mid ruds and big prepchecks on pcs stuck in engrams you werent going to unstick them you need steam shovel not hand shovel thus the negative arc processes were invented negative arc processes do handle implants lrh also discovered that pc is operating on entanglements with the physical universe it is one thing to bail him out of this and another thing to get him to look at his considerations about being entangled its not what happens to person that is important it is his considerations about it that count people especially sociologists get caught up in the idea that the environment determines peoples states of mind this is the philosophy on which foreign aid is based power of choice is senior to this by miles it has to do intimately with r and c enforced r or or c will wreck the triangle but given the same environment and predicament two people can have quite different reactions the goodness or badness of the surroundings doesnt necessarily reflect in the happiness or unhappiness of the inhabitants this messes up social planning because the happiness of the individual involves his preferences and his considerations about his surroundings whether or not he has arc for them the pc has had all these preferences and considerations present with regard to all his circumstances all up and down the track that is an adequate statement of power of choice 412 this raises the question of whether there is such thing as an ideal state or condition in scientology the possibility of such state exists as it has never existed before in the universe an ideal state is state that someone wanted to be in over which he had full power of choice the attainment of happiness for pc is parallel to attaining clear the two factors are 1 the environmental conditions of the pc 2 the pcs r and c with regard to the matter energy space time and postulates of his condition this is channel that has remained fundamentally unknown to this universe these are born out of an interplay between the pcs postulates and the experiences he has netted we are still on an interactive basis between postulates and conditions of experience the persons power of choice is his affinity reality and communication with regard to set of circumstances existences or environments we should give this fact more attention in processing we needed process that could easily be ground out by the hour by any old auditor but which would give fantastic results arc straightwire approaches this ideal as process though it does require some skill and it can be done very wrong arc straightwire does give fantastic results although unfortunately it does not go the whole route because it doesnt actually handle the conditions of existence it only handles pcs attitudes reality and power of communication relative to these conditions but it handles enough to cut away lower levels of case especially levels 4 5 and 6 see p 402405 above for description of the eight levels of cases at level 7 its usefulness is doubtful at level 8 it is useless it brings cases upscale to where they have their own time track to run and are able to run it at that point power of choice is less our concern because the pc believes now that his power of choice is alterable and that he can do something about his conditions now he can handle the real stuff that has aberrated him sooner or later too one has to actually handle the conditions of existence auditors who dont understand arc straightwire can dream up all sorts of wrong ways to do it for instance they skimp on one leg because the pc has trouble with it although cases at level 3 can run the process commands in the order 1 2 3 1 2 3 you will get more ta with the order 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 that is the only way it will run on lower level cases so you might as well run it that way with equal time on each leg until flat or run an equal number of questions on each leg to get over the fact that the pc may have long comm lags on one leg you are after similar amount of run for each you depend on the other two legs to fix up the tougher one letting them get out of balance defeats the process how long you should spend on each leg depends on the pc and how long he takes to flatten something listen for cog to end off on the number of variations that there could be is great always try to get the pc to run the simplest most fundamental version the one that is closest to pure r and c the less you change the command the happier the pc will be since this produces the minimal change of process if you find the pc struggling with wording get it changed early if you are going to change it at all good question for affinity is what attitude has been rejected dont change the question too much settle down for the long run make sure the pc has question he can run 413 another keynote of arc straightwire is that it is always run muzzled the auditors sole concern is understanding and acknowledging what the pc says it is true that sometimes the pc will arc break if you dont talk with him but dont q and or change from an unflat process only talk with the pc to avoid arc breaks and dont violate the auditors code if you run into trouble you can put big mid ruds in on the arc process this wont mush an engram it takes chunks out of parts of the engram chain it picks up parts of the engram chain that belong to other chains anyhow dont try to run arc straightwire as cyclic process cycling to pt on every leg he hasnt been in pt for trillenia you can get him to pt any time by giving him the command move to pt date theoretically he will only get to pt when the process is flat the process is flat when all ruds are in on the process and it produces departure from the pcs clear read on any leg you are not really after this flat point with the process you are only trying to get part of the charge off so that the pc can run engrams remember that can unmoving tone arm early on in the process is meaningless ta has to be run in before it is run out during the course of running this process the ta may well go up and stick on each leg your main concern is is the pc answering the auditing command does he understand it can we keep it balanced so that we can bring him through it you can ask the pc is there any question or command you havent answered the process can be prefixed with any combination of words eg in auditing on your job or in marriage this makes it more powerful than problems intensive especially if it is assessed against the problem areas of the persons life taking an area that reads well the helatrobus implants contain words like remember and think so you avoid these in auditing commands as much as possible rougher cases will be happy to run this there are cases that cannot recall or remember levels 7 and 8 they need reach withdraw and cchs you can use these principles in discussing whether or not they wish to be here whether they like you whether they wish to talk to you using the above prefixes you can run arc straightwire as pt 2wc process l ron hubbard type 3 idate13663 volnum1 issue274 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec274 levels of case 6306c13 shspec274 levels of case here is where we are at technically we are developing dianometry to point where one can give series of tests and decide what you need to do with case there are six types of processes that are learnable and workable direct processing of postulates is not included although rising scale processes do sometimes work especially on level 1 cases the scale of case levels is invaluable and the six types of processes handle all levels the six processes are the only ones that raise case up the levels the only problem lies in how well they are known and how reliably they are executed we are working on how you can tell where pc is so you can tell what to use on him lacking this data you can just process the pc and go up or fall back to hit his level 414 here are the case levels 1 ot track you can even go higher than level 1 for instance you can tell the thetan how to handle theta trap you can also teach him how to maintain game so he wont have to go downscale to have one what you can do with this level consists of education and practice only 2 this is theoretical state usually parts of the time track are missing and those parts that are there are under handling although the thetan at this case level is theoretically supposed to have total access to his time track with nothing aberrative on it the perfect time track is unobtainable it would fold up before it got there at this level we work to get the person over the idea that he has to have time track by handling engrams the thetan learns to block out facsimiles special process is used here 3 at this level the pc has partly visible time track that is however very aberrative he has lots of engrams but he can run them at this level you would use engram running by chains blocking that sort of thing out 4 this is an occluded case with black invisible andor spotted field lower levels can also have such fields so be careful at this level you can still run engrams if you have made sure that you are not actually dealing with level 7 or 8 you can run him on r3n r3n is strippeddown directive routine 3 which uses line plots it has to do with implant gpms r3n2 is an abbreviated form of r3n see 6305c14 shspec263 implant gpms and 6305c21 shspec266 the helatrobus implants see also pp 426 456457 below 5 dubin case easy to restimulate this case should be run on arc break straightwire duplication what there are processes that produce change in the pc without necessarily giving change in case level processes can be powerful enough to overwhelm the pcs power of choice so you can change the case but the pc may not recognize it so his reality and confront havent improved that is what occurs when you run higherlevel process on lowerlevel case that is why it is idiocy just to cure someone of an illness he will just get sick again you have just worked directly against his hidden standard your real object is to advance the case up the reality scale so you had better use the process that corresponds to the pcs case or reality level you should see improvement both directly in terms of upgrade of case level attitude towards existence etc and indirectly by seeing ta motion if there is ta the pc is not improving with regard to his viewpoint of existence level of communication etc level 4 or 3 cases can also be run on arc break straightwire fur repair or boost 415 6 dubin of dubin this case is distinguished from level 5 by the degree of franticness and the terrible automaticity of the bank it is not common type of case but it is struggle to audit because the track wont hold still to be looked at nothing bites because of this constant motion of the time track the level 6 case longer has the power of stopping motion you could call this type of case the grouped automatic time track or the moving time track case you cant run straightwire on him because of the constant motion of the track such cases should be run on cchs repetitive processes work as do sec checks and to lesser degree prepchecks so does general ow done as an excuse for sec checks and prepchecks it is not done as strictly repetitive process the overts you get are very light and feathery that is ok the bottom rung on level 6 has passed beyond the ability to run bank 7 this case can only confront his own evaluations these cases can get enormously interested in cchs because that stuff is dangerous to them they cant run the bank it is not there to be run it is utterly unconfrontable 8 the unawareness case this case can only be run on reach and withdraw being virtually or actually unconscious if you have someone who is in coma take his hand and with commands have him touch the blanket touch the sheet etc the perpetual boiloff case needs reach and withdraw just like the guy in the coma reach and withdraw runs several levels above level 8 for instance it runs up to levels 5 and 6 but here on level 7 you must flatten cchs or you will leave the pc parked the pc at this level will run heavily on these processes you can run processes at levels higher than the case level for which they are primarily intended they dont do much damage if left unflat if the case level is several levels higher than that of the process but dont overestimate the case level and get loses the six types of processing are 1 reach and withdraw 2 cchs 3 sec check 4 repetitive processes 5 r3n implants 6 r3r route 1 could be added as way of handling level 7 case almost any case reacts to almost any of these processes but what you want to do is to improve the level of the case with economy of time there are certain processes that will do it fastest and host of others that dont fit the pcs case level the fastest process is the one that we are after for instance we just run enough r3n to clear off implants so that we can get at other parts of the track you can run someone on implants for long time but what you are after is unburdening the track enough so that you can run gpms 416 there are more implants per unit time in the pt area ie the last 5000 years then there were earlier but the only really thorough workmanlike job that was done was in the helatrobus implant darwins theory of evolution came from one implant case level improves to the degree that charge is removed case level is determined by the amount of encysted and unreleased charge not by the inherent power of the thetan concerned different cases may have different tolerance of charge but the levels will still be determined by the amount of charge the auditors sole interest is to relieve charge in order to change case manifestations the index of charge off is amount of ta or dialwide rocket reads that start out like mad and turn into fall if you are running engrams without getting ta watch it you are just stirring up the bank and not discharging anything the pc will get unhappy with you just give the pc the rfactor that you are going to run more implants to get them out of the road so we can get this earlier material discharged let the ta run into the case on arc break straightwire this may take two sessions if necessary you can drop back to cchs and sec checking or even reach and withdraw it is better to start low and run high underestimate the pcs ability so as to avoid giving the pc loses and keep his confidence and hope factor up the variable is the ability of the case to rise up the scale of course the lower the case level the slower charge blows level 5 and 6 cases will get into rows about being underrun but when the case is being run in the direction of up the case will forgive you almost anything the lower the case the more they estimate their ability to be they dont feel confident enough to see their limits such people do take social pride in their case level there is statusseeking in auditing god forbid let ta motion be there instead and we will all have won l ron hubbard type 3 idate18663 volnum1 issue275 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec275 beingness 6306c18 shspec275 beingness the overtmotivator sequence is about trillion trillion trillion 1036 years old minus hundred thousand trillion it is long track but we have the process to take it apart the main difficulty with the time track and its use in auditing is that there are so many cases that cant confront time track or any part of it so you get loses trying to run engrams we have been accumulating processes that can bring someone upscale to where they can view the time track great number of processes have been accumulated and recently codified as we looked at the fundamental of what we are trying to do with case the ultimate procedure is rote engram running but not everybody could do it so the subject has had to be wrapped up in such way that it could be done by all current rote engram running is superior to and different from earlier engram running we are running engrams by chains to open up and smooth out the time track the only reason we are doing anything about engrams at all is that those are the parts of the time track that are least confrontable if you get rid of those stretches the pc has time track the worst part of the time track denies anyone the best part unless you get rid of the engrams you havent got any time track because the pc cant confront it 417 this sets up innumerable problems the more heavily charged the track is the less the pc can confront it and there is point where the pc moves out of any confrontability of the engram and now there is nothing to confront at all this gives you the scale of cases ot to unaware awareness of the physical universe also diminishes as you go downscale if each case level were to be divided from the others it would be divided by layers of anaten anyone at level 8 would have to go through layers of anaten to get to level 7 awareness of own evaluations as one goes upscale the layers of anaten seem thinner and are thinner because the more aware one is the less one minds unawareness the lowest conscious level of unawareness would be catalepsy or amnesia but even man thinking that he has only lived once has lot of automatic unawareness of the time track when you throw into his lap the idea of having lived before you will get confrontation of his opinions about it eg what would that do to old age pensions and this will make him pretty groggy if you push him up the line his suppositional actions will occur in the absence of processing as he goes from level 7 to level 6 he will get wild ideas after going dopey he gets dubin of dubin lots of suppositional reality for instance he may think he is tutankhamen if you could get him to discuss it more intimately he would get pictures of pictures then as the pc reaches level 4 it all goes black the blackness or invisibleness are parts of real pictures the rest of the picture is just unconfrontable the blackness of level 4 is on the time track it is actually there on the time track it is nice dark safe part of the incident that actually happened run him through run him earlier and pictures can turn on at this point he gets very groggy in the incident as he reaches level 3 in this way he can see much more easily as level 2 moves into level 1 the time track disappears possibly because the time track itself is method of not confronting something he doesnt want to confront it and this overwhelms him to the point where without power of choice he makes picture of it and you have the involuntary picturetaking apparatus that is the time track one can however only be overwhelmed by that which one does not confront so the levels of cases scale is scale of confronting and we could mistakenly think that confronting would solve the time track while confronting does get results and is an interesting process it is not the common denominator of processes the common denominator of processes is duplicate the common denominator of reaction is confront the time track is duplication of an actual event and each one of the case levels is level of willingness to duplicate or unwillingness to duplicate so your breakdown from ot towards clear is an individual lack of desire to duplicate what he has to duplicate in order to be an ot leading to an overwhelming automaticity of making time track duplication goes hand in glove with the idea of beingness as we study beingness we will see this with great clarity to be or not to be is not the question in this universe you are going to be something whether you like it or not your power of choice on this matter longer exists you can notbe certain thing but only in order to be something else you can be or notbe certain thing but you will always be something the question is what to be 418 so this is the problem one picks up as one enters this universe it doesnt matter if the universe is timeless because you entered it somewhere as you examine peoples time tracks you find that their tolerance of time is improving as you go back since time is the single source of aberration if your timetolerance improves as you go back on the track you must be getting into periods not only when the pc was less aberrated but also approaching the beginning of the time track an individuals time track is not infinite because 1 he entered the universe at some point 2 the earlier he gets on the time track the less it is constant continual and infinite thing the universe on the other hand continues at its own rate of vibration if the individuals time track were of infinite duration cases would be unresolvable getting back to the question of beingness once in this universe you cant absolutely notbe the question is what to be that is the only question in the universe that really bothers somebody you will drive kid up wall by asking him what do you want to be if you want him to be something and he knows it would be dangerous you have postulatecounterpostulate situation continuing problem of beingness theres dwindling spiral of beingness the moment one enters this universe there are fewer and fewer safe things to be you can aberrate someone by being after him to be something that is very dangerous you get problem with this the lesson of this universe is that everything you can be is too dangerous to be but there is nothing to do but be in this universe the universe has finite space that looks infinite the gains of r212 came from the fact that the pc was making lists of beingnesses and the fact that real ri is potential beingness anything you might want to be is either too dangerous or too discreditable states effort to dominate the individual is out of jealousy of beingness the press is dramatizing this by saying you mustnt be scientologist it is dangerous to be one so if you want guy to start sorting out his time track at almost any level where he is aware of it at all you could start him at once on question that would get him into some interesting categories time track is to duplicate or not to duplicate but any duplication winds up in beingness duplication and beingness are united or gradients of one another you will have cases that will not become ot until the beingness of ot is demonstrated to them to be not quite as dangerous as it has been all cases or all pcs have assigned to all upper states dangerous or discreditable beingness and the same to all lower states and to their own states impossibility to be well that is the state of any case if there is program for the security of this planet that we can push forward people become loathe to advance their states of case or do anything else they stay parked in an inertia because there is desirable future hope factor this is why hope is rudimentary therapy to some degree you would have to promise that an advanced state of case would not then bring about further problems complicated by the political or sociological problems on this planet if there is nothing that one can do with an advanced state of beingness it is doubtful that people will try to attain it so one needs future or else the problems one got into before as free thetan make one see point in case advance people will downgrade their own states if they feel uncomfortable lonely or unsafe up there planning and organization 419 to resolve that problem alone would bring about case advance in the absence of such planning promise and organization you wont get as fast case advance if you advance any helatrobus goal lot of people will go on an automatic notis there are people who are on prevented beingness they make theta traps implants etc they can be tested for by offering them any beingness they will notis it for instance you say wise prime minister would be nice he says oh i dont know that would just give you more powerful government they would degrade any more advanced beingness or anything you wanted them to be they might even think that they were doing people favor we have the idea that if we dont have success with certain number of cases we havent got enough people to form any strata of civilization it is ok to say all right you are making an officer cadre the rest can be as they are that presupposes that there is future plan to take care of all this we have plan now for what to do with this planet fine now what about the boys from the next planet you inevitably progress into an organizational future so you have to solve the problem of beingness not only at the level of the individual case but also on out into the future through some organization that ensures some safe future an ot can straighten things out on the planet but unless you mock up plan to do so to solve the beingness problem more broadly you wont make any ots unless you plan to straighten things out few people will go through to ot because it has been so unsafe in the past the ot has had blind spot his own power was so great that he thought he could stand alone but every time he went up against an organized body he lost because the organization could furnish more viewpoints than he could it is the plurality of viewpoints that confuses the individual he cant sort it all out and eventually gets pulled down the individual could furnish only limited number of viewpoints to which he could pay attention and which he could coordinate communism advances because it has plurality of viewpoints organized to confuse the individual viewpoint the individual ot has his problems because he is an individual and has been convinced that he could do it all by himself and he could but the little boys with the airplanes always show up some time in the future the universe was ended by magellanic clouds less than 500 trillion years ago only space and rubble was left there were suns and planets lot of thetans got together to put it all back together you got planet builders and sunbuilders in spite of all this the little men with the airplanes showed up then with their thetatraps where did they come from this has happened repeatedly in this universe this universe surrenders to cooperative action and not to individual action but now we have new breed of cat the experienced being when you get through auditing someone now he is an experienced being who knows the isness of the universe and who knows that matter how tough you are you can get in pole trap we have the technology to straighten someone out unless powerful being learns that this is universe of organization and coordination he will just be back on the pole trap again any body of beings operating with coordinated program can beat him you have got situation where the individual is trying to operate in universe of cooperation and of course that degrades the 420 beingness of the individual to that degree the more he fights to be an individual the less he cooperates the less he is willing to cooperate the more enforced is his cooperation the more he fights against this sort of thing and the less freedom he has that is description of the dwindling spiral that an individual goes through noconfront is the mechanical basis of the spiral discarded beingnesses are what bring him down in facsimile the hardest problem the pc usually has is trying to isolate what is him and who is he and what is he this is usually the biggest lie in the facsimile the pc has been running it as an overt being the executioner and he finally turns out to have been the victims wife it is in fact dangerous not to be scientologist but the rest of the beingnesses are matter of opinion and the coordination of beingnesses is one of the better solutions being at the bottom of the reality scale has gone down through scale of beingness to get him to be anything at the bottom is impossible except to be an unaware being there are deeper channels of unawareness but there is absolute unawareness he goes into coma taking responsibility for any beingness of any kind whatsoever to move him up the line he would have to have some security in being able to be something at an upper level you can have problems in processing if there is future beingness going out of responsibility occurs because one continually gets the lesson that being responsible lands you in the soup the repetition of this lesson is what puts the individual downscale in livingness the scale keeps going further south to deeper levels of unawareness it has to be made safe to be exterior to be theta clear without some guarantee that you wont just wind up in the soup again you wont become skyscraper tall again havingness is useless without purpose unless the game itself is an expanding game then processing cannot produce stability future livingness ties into rise up the scale outreality equals responsibility what to be to be an or to be b that is the question if you cant be an and cant be b and there arent any other things to
