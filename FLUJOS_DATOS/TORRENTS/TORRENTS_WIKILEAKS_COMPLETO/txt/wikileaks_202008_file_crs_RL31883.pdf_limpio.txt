established semiautonomous agency the national nuclear security administration nnsa to oversee does national securityrela ted programs pl 10665 within nnsa congress created the office of defense nuclear counterintelligence to implement ci policy at nnsa facilities doe retained separate office of counterintelligence which develops ci policy for doe and nnsa but implements it only at nonnnsa facilities t hough representing separate organiza tions the two ci offices share resources and personnel for some progra ms although doe has taken steps to strengthen ci practices some observers have questioned whet her the departments bifurcated ci structure is the most eff ective in countering continuing efforts by foreign intelligence services friendly and hostile to target doe and nnsa facilities several organizational approaches have been discussed including the following one approach is to maintain the stat us quo proponents suggest that the current structure is necessary if ci is to receive the attention it warra nts opponents counter that dual offices lead to in efficiencies that could under mine ci effectiveness under second approach doe and nnsa ci programs could be completely separated proponents ggest that this approach would establish clearer lines of authority opponents counter that this rrangement would produce chaos at the field level and lead to coordinati on and communication problems third approach would be to give nnsa authority to implement all ci programming while preserving for doe all ci policymaking responsibility proponents suggest that doing so would re sult in integrated and coordinated ci operational activity pponents counter that this appr oach still would leave in place two separate ci offices and lead to c ontinuing confusion over roles and mission finally congress could consolidate the tw ci programs either under the direct control of the energy secretary or under the supervision of the nnsa administrator proponents of doe control assert that the importance of ci argues for consolidated office that answers directly to the doe s ecretary opponents contend consolidation within doe would contrave ne congresss intent to maximize nnsa autonomy in all areas including ci because of does perceived deeply rooted antisecurity culture they recommend that all ci pr ograms be consolidated but under the nnsa administrator rather than the energy secretary former doe secretary spencer abraha m proposed consolidating the two ci programs into single office reporting directly to the energy secretary congress however continues to support the bifurcated program energy secretary samuel w bodman is reviewing various legislativ proposals including one that would consolidate the two ci programs under doe control this

department of energy policy issues and options introduction lapses in the department of energys doe security and counterintelligence program have plagued doe since 1977 wh the department was established through the merger of 40 government orga nizations including the energy research and development administration and the federal energy administration1 some policymakers expected the new agency to focus the governments energyrelated enterprises almost solely on the energy crisis others saw doe as an unsuccessful attempt to fuse vastly diverse organizations many with significantly different if not conflicting missions one legacy of its origin is that doe has struggled to balance open scientific inquiry with the security under which some of those scientific inquiries must be conducted this inherent nsion has led many observers to question whether does highly classified weaponsrelated prog ram has received sufficient attention particularly with regard to counterintelligence ci due to numerous problems with the ci program the clinton administrati on issued presidential decision directive 61 pdd61 which fundamenta lly restructured does ci program among other changes pdd61 mandated that the federal bureau of investigation fbi assume leadership of does ci program an initia tive which continues to this day in 1999 congress took further step and estab lished the semiautonomous national nuclear security administration nnsa to manage does national securityrelated programs including does sensitive weapons laboratories par ticularly concerned about ci congress provided nnsa with its own ci office but maintained separate ci office in doe though repres enting separate organizations the two ci offices share resources funds nd personnel for some

management prior to the 1999 reorganization in 1998 president clinton was so troubled by intelligence evidence that the prc had successfully stolen secrets from doe s weapons laboratories that he issued presidential decision directive pdd 614 in an effort to improve quality and accountability the directive established fo r the first time in does history an independent ci office under the direction of senior fbi executive previously the departments ci effort had been high ly decentralized and widely dispersed throughout various program offices and wa s according to some observers grossly underfunded5 pdd61 stipulated that senior fbi fficial the fbi is the primary us government agency responsible for domestic ci be named director of the office and report directly to the energy secretary the pdd also directed that existing doe contracts with the labs were to be ame nded to include ci goals and objectives as well as ci performance measures to ev aluate compliance counterintelligence oversight functions previously assigned to doe operations and field offices were to be consolidated under the directors c ontrol under followon implementation plan issued in 1999 the director gained authority over programming and funding as well as personnel authority over counterintelligence activitie s at all doe field offices and laboratories by 1999 however major ity in

assertions of wholesale losses of nuclear weapons technology th rough espionage the pfiab panel did concur on balance with the intelligence communitys assessment that the prc had obtained by espionage

the report by the presidents foreign intelligence advisory board pfiab that blamed poor organization and failure of accountability for does ci failures the report also criticized doe for being dysfunctional bureaucracy incap able of reforming itself12 one result of this dual office is partially bifurcated ci structure the two offices share resources funds and personnel for some programs13 that has sparked debate over its effectivene ss particularly in light of emerging nontraditional counterintelligence threats specifically cr itics have warned that inadequate communication and coordination between the two offices could threaten sensitive ci investigations supporters argue that separate dedicated ci office within nnsa is necessary if counterintelligence is to receive the focus it warrants policy issues for congress observers have focused on two interrela ted questions first are doe and nnsa accomplishing their ci missions sec ond is the current partially bifurcated ci management structure within doe and nnsa the most effective approach to ci management are doe and nnsa accomp lishing ci missions one study has questioned does managerial approach to ci effectiveness the commission on science and security established by thensecretary bill richardson concluded in 2002 report that becau of does continuing management dysfunction security including ci lacks cl arity consistency and broad strategic planning specifically the commission said doe lacked systemwide approach for assessing risks to its assets and for determining priorities for the protection of those assets adequate i nvestments in tools and technol ogies for its counterintelligence programs and sufficient priority for cybersecurity14 with respect to ci the commission said the dual office structure led to fragmentation and prevented the establishment of single strong ci program15 another study however points out th at doe and nnsa have made some progress in their ci programs although

47concluded that doe and nnsa were making progress in accomplishing much of their basic ci mission particularly in th areas of strategic planning operating procedures and implementation of information systems but criticized the bifurcated ci structure16 ncix blamed the current dualoffice fo rmat for numerous daytoday problems including duplicative and at times contradi ctory messages to field sites misrouting of sensitive ci information related to investigations uncoordinated communications to the fbi and the intelligence community and dual sometimes inconsistent tasking of program managers17 although manageable under the current st ructure ncix suggested that these problems posed the potential for more fundame ntal missteps in the future according to one law enforcement officer cited by ncix the twooffice configuration might some day lead the department to miss serious ci breach or prevent the conduct of an effective investigation18 the directors of central intelligence and the federal bureau of investigation fbi endorsed the ncix findings in sepa rate letters to the ssci chairman and vice chairman19 is the bifurcated structure most effective with regard to bifurcated structure two general views prevail according to one view espoused by the pfiab and ot hers real and lasting ci reform is unworkable within does current struct ure and culture to achieve the kind of protection that these sensitive labs does national security laboratories must have they and their functions must have thei r own autonomous opera tions structure free of all the other obligations imposed by doe management20 the pfiab in 1999 recommended the establishment of semi autonomous agency within doe with its own coherent ci structure21 the contrary view holds that ci mu st be unified

counterintelligence investigations analysis and all other counterintelligence information must be developed within unified organization and provided to the secretary and other senior officials without bureaucratic delays this vital function necessitates one organization with one chief of counterintelligence reporting to the office of the secretary22 ncix in its report conclude d this partial bifurca tion of ci responsibilities at doe not only served to further complicate the formidable challenge of managing ci at doe but also endangered the goal s and implementation of an effective ci program23 ncix further noted that in light of the history of ci investigations that foundered because of misco mmunications within wellestablished agencies the twooffice arrangement has raised the odds of missteps and problems24 ncix recommended that the two offices be cons olidated under one senior ci officer with doewide responsibility for all aspects of th program and that would report directly to the secretary of energy25 former doe secretary spencer abraham after completing his own review of the bifurcated ci structure concluded in 2003 that the structure was not optimaland proposed to congress that the departme nts two ci programs be consolidated under does control and that the combin ed office report directly to the energy secretary26 instead however the senate armed services committee as part of the fiscal year fy 2005 defense authorizati on bill authorized the doe secretary to consolidate the two offices but under th control of the nnsa administrator27 the house took action in its version of the sa bill the senate receded and house and senate conferees retained the bifurcated structure stating in the conference report the conferees note that the nnsa was originally set up as semiautonomous agency in large part to ensure that there would be adequate focus and priority placed on counterintelligence activitie s the conferees urge

nnsa programs and facilities28 possible organizational alternatives congress of course coul d choose to maintain the current organizational structure29 if congress however ultimately decides to modify the structure number of organizational appr oaches have been proposed the range of alternatives currently being discussed include the follo wing 1 maintain the status quo 2 completely separate doe and nnsa 3 consolidat ci implementation under nnsa and leave ci policymaking in doe and 4 consolidate all counterintelligence both policymaking and implementation either within doe or conversely within nnsa alternative one main tain the status quo does office of counterintelligence woul d continue to be responsible for developing ci policy across doe including the nnsa but implementing that policy only at nonnnsa facilities nnsaodnci would continue to implement ci policy at nnsa facilities proponents of the status quo point to congressional concern in 1999 that doe was failing to focus necessary and appropriate attention on ci the semi autonomous nnsa and its offi ce of nuclear counterintelligence they argue was established for the express purpose of having one entity outside of doe focus on and be held accountable for implementing ci policy at does sensitive nuclear and national security programs including its w eapons labs the current structure it is suggested accomplishes that goal while maintaining reasonably close integration of program activities pponents counter that the current structure produces inefficiency confusion unnecessary contention and miscommunication30 they also suggest that in some areas the nnsa structure within doe has exacerbated the general problem of too many layers in doe particularly with respect to counterintelligence31httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31883crs8 32 see national counterinte lligence executive an assessment of the effectiveness of the division of the ci programs at the department of energy and the national nuclear security administration 2003 p 1516 33 ibid p 17alternative two completely separate doe and nnsa this approach is complete separa tion of doe and nnsa counterintelligence programs with oci providing ci s upport to doe and nnsaodnci providing ci support to nnsa proponents suggest that this approach would establish clearer lines of authority for ci within doe and nnsa which would improve communication and coordinati on pponents c ounter that such an arrangement would produce chaos at the field level and could lead to future problems of redundancy coordination co mmunications and relations with law enforcement32 alternative three consolid ate ci implementation under nnsa the third approach consolidates all doe ci implementation under nnsa leaving does office of counterintelligence in charge of formulating all ci policy proponents suggest that this approach woul d support an integrat ed and coordinated ci operational activity and result in more effective allocation of resources by permitting nnsa to focus its resources on ci implementation and doe to target its efforts on policy formulation they so argue that nnsa oversees the most sensitive classified activities within doe and therefore is best suited to implement all ci activities across doe opponents counter that this approach would leave in place two ci offices one with policymakin g responsibilities and one with operational responsibilities thereby contributing to tinuing confusion as to roles and mission alternative four consolidate all ci within doe the final approach consolidates the tw ci programs either under the control of the energy secretary or under th control of the nnsa administrator proponents of doe consolidati on assert that the importance of ci argues for consolidated effort controlled by the energy secretary they also contend such consolidation would highlight ci as departmentwide mission that includes protecting leadingedge technologies cr itical infrastructure and national nuclear weapons secrets as well as protecting doe facilities against in ternational terrorist attacks they point out that much of does national securityrelated work focuses on issues other than just those related to nuclear weapons and therefore is not limited to nnsa sites33 opponents counter that consolida ting ci under doe control would be inconsistent with congress intent to maximize nnsa autonomy in all areas and particularly with regard to ci because of does perceived deeply rooted anti security culture they trace does antisecurity bias to the longstanding tensionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31883crs9 34 see presidents foreign intelligence advisory board science at its best security at its worst p iii 35 ibid p 18between science and security and assert that only semiautonomous agency such as nnsa can establish cultural environment that values security34 although both sides dispute where c onsolidated program should be housed neither proponents or oppone nts question that consolidation will improve accountability administration communicati on and coordinati on all essential qualities they suggest of an effective ci program35
