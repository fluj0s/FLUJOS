1983 pp 1716217164legislative history of the gephardt rule the gephardt rule initially codified as rule xlix of the standing rules of the house of representatives was establishe d by pl 9678 93 stat 589591 an act to provide for temporary increase in th public debt limit the house adopted the legislation hr 5369 by vote of 219198 on september 26 19793 during consideration of the measure representative gephardt explained that the purpose of the new house rule was to place the consideration of the public debt limit within the context of the overall budget policies contained in the annual budget resolution in addition it wa s intended to reduce the amount of time spent and the number of votes in the house and in committees on the issue of raising the public debt limit one of the aggregate figures require d to be included in the nnual budget resolution is the appropriate level of the public debt as the budget resolution has evolved over time from sing leyear time frame to multiyear time frame the budget resolution has gone from including debtlimit level for only one fiscal year to including debtlimit levels for each fis cal year over multiyear period because budget resolution does not become law it is necessary to enact legislation in order to implement budget resolution policies re garding debtlimit adjustments the gephardt rule enables the house to combin the finalization of the budget resolution and the initiation of debtlimit legislation into single step representative gephardt stated that the new automatic engrossment process puts the consideration of the appropriate level for the debt ceiling where it legitimately and logically belongs that is in the context of when we vote for the spending that creates the need to change the debt ceiling4 in its original form the rule required the engrossment of joint resolution changing the temporary public debt limit in 1983 the existing separate temporary and permanent statutory limits on the public bt were combined into one permanent statutory limit pl 9834 subsequently the house amended the gephardt rule to reflect this change by agreeing to hres 241 98th congress by voice vote on june 23 19835 under the modified rule the automatically engrossed joint resolution would contain change to the permanent statutory limit in addition to this modification the rules change also provided that where budget resolution contains more than one public debt limit figure for the current and the next fiscal year onlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31913crs3 6 us congress constituti on jeffersons manual and

that the committee on rules believes that it is unnecessary and confusing to have single concurrent resolution on the budget trigger the engrossment and passage of two separate joint resolutions to increase or decrease the public debt limit7 at the beginning of the 106th congress the house recodi fied the rule as house rule xxiii certain language was deleted and modified from the existing rule but the revisions were intended to continue the automatic engrossment process without substantive change8 the house repealed the rule at the beginning of the 107th congress9 on the opening day of the 108th congress the house reinstated this automatic engrossing process as new rule rule xxvii10 the current rule contains the exact language as rule xxiii of the 106th congress current features of the gephardt rule house rule xxvii requires that the house clerk automatically engross and transmit to the senate upon the adoption of the budget resolution joint resolution changing the public debt limit to the level specified in the budget resolution the rule stipulates that the joint resolution is deemed to have passed the house by the same vote as the conference report on the budget resolution under clause 2 of the current rule if an adopted concurrent resolution under clause 1 sets forth different appropriate levels of the public debt for separate periods only one engrossed joint resolutionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31913crs4 11 for recent example of such statement see us congress committee of conference concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2008 conference report

table 1 shall be prepared under clause 1 and the blank referred to in the preceding sentence shall be filled with the limitation that is to apply for each period further clause 3a of rule xxvii requires the house budget committee and the conference committee on the budget reso lution to issue clear statement regarding the impact of the automatically engrossed joint resolution on the public debt11 specifically clause 3a states the report of the committee on the budget on concurrent resolution described in clause 1 and the joint explanatory st atement of the managers on conference report to accompany such concurrent resolution each shall contain clear statement of the effect the eventual actment of joint resolution engrossed under this rule would have on the statutory limit on the public debt the full text of the gephardt rule in its current form is provided in the appendix implementation of the gephardt rule table 1 provides information on the joint re solutions changing the public debt limit that were engrossed and deemed passed by the house pursuant to the gephardt rule during calendar years 19802008 in 11 of the 29 years since the gephardt ru was first established the rule did not apply due to its suspension or re peal by the house calendar years 1988 1990 1991 19941997 and 1999200212 in most cases the house suspended the rule because legislation changing the st atutory limit was not necessary at the time the existing public debt limit was expected to be sufficient in three cases the house passed or was expected to pass separate legislation to increase the statutory limit as noted above the rule was rep ealed at the beginning of the 107th congress and therefore did not apply in 2001 and 2002 during the remaining 18 years when the rule was in effect the house originated 19 joint resolutions under this procedure the first seven of these 18 joint resolutions were generated under the gephardt rule in its original form as menti oned bove the rule was modified in 1983 the current ru is substantively the same as this 1983 form of the rule the subsequent 12 jo int resolutions were generated under this modified language in three years calendar years 1998 2004 and 2006 while the rule was in effect the hous and senate did not agree to conference report on the budget resolution and therefore the auto matic engrossment process under the gephardt rule was not utilizedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31913crs5 13 specifically during the second session of the 99th congress the senate passed as amended the joint resolution hjres 668 automatically engrossed by
