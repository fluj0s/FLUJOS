physicians services current law medicare payments for services of physicians and certain nonphysician practitioners are made on the ba sis of fee schedule the fee schedule is intended to relate payments for given service to the actual resources used in providing that service the fee schedule assigns relative values to services that reflect physician work ie the time sk ill and intens ity it takes to provide the service practice expenses and malpractice costs the relative values are adjusted for geographic variations in costs the adjusted relative values are then converted into dollar payment amount by conversi on factor the conversion factor for 2007 is 378975 the same level as in 2005 and 2006 the fee schedule places limit on payment per service but not on overall volume of services the fo rmula for calculating the annua l update to the conversion factor responds to changes in volume if the overall volume of services increases the update is lower if the overall volume is re duced the update is higher the intent of the formula is to place restraint on overall increases in medicare spending for physicians services several factors ente r into the calculation these include 1 the medicare economic index mei which meas ures inflation in the inputs needed to produce physicians services 2 the sust ainable growth rate sgr which is essentially target for medicare spending growth for physicians services and 3 an adjustment that modifies the update whic h would otherwise be allowed by the mei to bring spending in line with the sgr target the sgr target is not limit on expenditures rather the fee schedule update reflects the success or failure in meeting the target if expenditures exceed th target the update for future year is reduced as result payments to phy sicians were reduced in 2002 physician payments have been slated for reductions in each year since 2002 but congressional actions have prevented th reductions through 2007 for example in november 2007 the cms announced that the 2007 conversion factor would be cut 5 below the 2006 leve l however the tax relief and health care act of 2006 froze the 2007 conversion factor at the 2006 level in addition the act also provided that beginning july 1 2007 and ending december 31 2007 physicians who voluntarily report certa in quality measures can receive bonus payments of 15 in the absence of further legislation the 2008 conversion factor will be reduced by over 5 below the 2007 level further reductions are anticipated in subsequent years presidents proposal the presidents propos does not address the physician payment update thus the cu t in the 2008 conversion factor would be allowed to go into effect with new budgetary savings or costs httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33868crs6 outpatient hospital update current law hospital outpatient department hopd services are paid based on prospective payment system the unit of payment is the individual service or procedure as assigned to one of about 570 ambulatory payment classifications apcs medicares payment for hopd services is calculated by multiplying the relative weight associated w ith an apc by conversion factor the conversion factor is updated on calendar year schedule these annual updates are based on the hospital mb starting in cy2009 however the outpatient update for hospitals that do not submit required quality data will be the mb minus 2 percentage points the reduction for not submitting quality data would apply for the applicable year and would not be taken in to account in subsequent years presidents proposal

of beneficiary premiums and federal general re venues in general beneficiary premiums equal 25 of estimated program costs for the aged the disabled pay the same premium as the aged federal genera l revenues account for the remaining 75 beginning in 2007 higherincome enrollees pay higher percentage of part b costs the increase is phased in over three years in 2007 individuals whose modified adjusted gross income agi exceeds 80000 and couples whose modified agi exceeds 160000 are subject to higher premium amounts in 2007 higher income enrollees pay total premiums ra nging from 283 to 433

of part b enrollees will pay higher premium in 2007 with less than 1 payi ng the highest premium amount of 16140 beginning in 2008 the income thresholds for higher part b premiums are increased by the percentage increase in the cpiu presidents proposal the proposal would eliminate the annual cpiu adjustments consequently each year the number of beneficiaries subject to the higher premium would increase the budget includes estimated savings of 543 million in fy2008 and 7135 billion over the fiveyear budget period for this proposal part d premiums current law in 2006 medicare part d began providing coverage for outpatient prescription drugs for medicare beneficiaries c overage is provided through private prescription drug plans p dps or medicare advantage prescription drug mapd plans the program relies on these private plans to provide coverage and to bear some of the financial risk for drug costs federal s ubsidies covering the bulk of the risk is provided to encourag participation unlike other medicare services the benefits can only be obtained th rough private plans further while all plans have to meet certain minimum requirements there are significant differences among them in terms of bene fit design drugs included on plan formularies ie list of covered drugs and co stsharing applicable for particular drugs medicare part d is financed through co mbination of beneficiary premiums and federal general revenues in addition certain transfer s are made from the states beneficiaries pay different pr emiums depending on the plan they have selected on average beneficiary premiums account for 255 of expected total part d costs for basic coverage the cms estimates that the average premium for both pdp and ma pd plans is 22 per month in 2007 except for persons entitled to lowincome subsidies all persons selecting partic ular part d plan pay the same monthly premium amount presidents proposal the proposal would tablish incomerelated premiums for part d under the proposal the income thresholds would be the same as those established for incomerelating pa rt b premiums see above further as proposed for part b the income threshol ds would not be updated in future years consequently each year the number of beneficiaries subject to the higher premium would increase the budget includes estimated savings of 357 million in fy2008 and 3242 billion over the fiveyear budget period for this proposal interaction with medicaid current law the bba97 added another mandatory eligibility group of lowincome medicare beneficiaries who receive assistance with medicare premiumshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33868crs13 known as qualifying individuals 1 qi1 the qi1 group was originally set to expire in december 2002 however cong ress has subsequently extended the expiration date most recently til september 30 2007 in pl 10991 individuals are eligible as qi1 if they are entitled to medicare part and their incomes are at least 120 of the federal poverty level but ss than 135 and also have limited assets the medicaid benefit for qi1s consists of payment of the full medicare part b premium qi1s are entitled to three months of retroactive coverage if they were eligible during those months and the retroactive month does not fall before january of calendar year presidents proposal the presidents budget includes oneyear extension of the qualified individuals qi program through september 30 2008 the medicare costs reflect program expenditure s for this group of individuals the budget includes estimated costs of 425 million in fy2008 and 425 million over the fiveyear budget period for this proposal premium interactions the savings for the individual proposals listed in table 1 are the gross savings however there is an offsetting cost associated with part b benefit savings that occurs because any savings to the program are shared between the medicare program and beneficiaries as beneficiaries pay share generally 25 of program costs or beginning in 2007 for certain higher income beneficiaries larger share of program costs for example for those be neficiaries paying 25 of premiums for every dollar saved the dicare outlays will be reduced by about 075 and beneficiaries will sa ve about 025 the estimated offs etting costs are shown in the interaction line of the table 325 million in fy2008 and 5605 billion over the 5 year budget period fortyfive percent rule the medicare trigger current law the hospital insurance hi and supplementary medical insurance smi trust funds are overseen by board of trustees who make annual reports

require s that if an excess general revenue funding determination is made for two successive year s the president is required to submit legislative proposal to respond to the warning the congress is required to consider the proposal on an expedited basis however passage of legislation within specific time frame is not required presidents proposal the presidents budget includes an automatic reduction to all medicare payments if ge neral revenue financ ing is projected to exceed 45 of total medicare financing and only when that threshold is met and congress fails to act on recommendations to reduce that level in such case four tenths of 1 reduction would be made across the board to all medicare payments and would increase each year by 04 percent until general revenue is brought back to

presidents estimate as shown in table 1 cbo has slightly different estimates of the medicare savings proposals included in the presiden ts budget however the cbo estimates have separate savings estimate for the medicare advantage program as result of the savings in feeforservice spending ccording to the department of health and human services hhs the administration incorporated the ma savings into the individual proposals making direct co mparison of individual savings such as hospital update difficult therefore it is more appropriate to compare overall savings rather than looking at individual proposal s cbo estimates also do not include an estimate for the savings of the president s medicare integrity program administrative proposal looking at only the legislative proposals for the fiveyear budget window cbo estimates savings of 572 billion compared with the administrations estimate of 656 billion difference of 84 billion the different estima tes may be due to differing assumptions regarding the dicare population and other influential factors adding in savings for the admin istrative proposal increases the difference between the cbo and the adminis tration by another
