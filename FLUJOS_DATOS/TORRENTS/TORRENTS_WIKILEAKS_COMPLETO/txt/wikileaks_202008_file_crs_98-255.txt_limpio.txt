role in financing congressional elections joseph cantor specialist in american national government government and finance division summary political action committees or pacs are legal entities through which interest groups raise and spend money in elections they constitute one of four major sources of funds contributed to congressional campaigns along with individual citizens political parties and candidates while pacs proliferated and became an issue in the 1970s and 1980s interest groups have long played major role in funding american elections the term political action committee is colloquial and does not appear in federal law and corresponds with two legal expressionsseparate segregated fund and political committeedepending on whether the pac is affiliated with sponsoring organization of the 4027 pacs registered with the federal election commission fec at the end of 2002 74 were separate segregated funds such fund is essentially bookkeeping arrangement wherein an organization prohibited by law from making direct campaign donations from its treasury operates separate entity using treasury funds that seeks voluntary contributions from its members for expressly political purposes organizations that maintain such funds include labor unions corporations trade and health associations membership groups eg national rifle association and national organization for women cooperatives eg dairy cooperatives and corporations without capital stock egsome savings and loan or shareholder insurance companies the remaining 26 of todays pacs are not sponsored by organizations and do not constitute separate segregated funds these pacs referred to as nonconnected by the fec are organized merely by meeting the laws definition of political committeea group that raises or spends 1000 or more in year unlike separate segregated funds these pacs are not required to limit fundraising appeals to specified groups of persons however the nonconnected pacs must pay their own administrative and fundraising expenses out of contributions not having sponsors to underwrite these costs for the most part the nonconnected pacs comprise ideological and singleissue groups congressional research service the library of congress crs2 origin of pacs pacs had their origin in the 1940s as response by organized labor to the 1943 war labor disputes acts prohibition on contributions from union treasuries in connection with federal elections 57 stat 167 this ban was made permanent by the 1947 labor management relations act 61 stat 159 unions began to establish separate segregated funds to conduct electioneering activities and for the next three decades labor pacs dominated the field of interest group political activities corporations prohibited since the 1907 tillman act 34 stat 864 from making contributions in federal elections were reluctant to establish pacs in part because of the relative lack of precedent for such endeavors and the concomitant absence of conclusive judicial rulings number of legislative judicial and administrative actions in the early and mid 1970s helped pave the way for other groups to explore the pac option by removing legal ambiguities and granting statutory authority to unions corporations trade associations and others to set up separate segregated funds in addition to the elimination of legal barriers the growth of pacs was spurred by perceived decline in the strength of political parties by higher contribution limits than those for individuals and as response to increased government regulation and involvement in peoples lives and livelihoods contribution limits the law provides for different sets of limits for two types of pacs political committee and multicandidate committee the limits for basic political committee are 2000 per election to federal candidate 25000 per year to national political party committee and 5000 per year to another political committee 2 usc 4314 in these limits the law treats political committee as it does an individual citizen except that committees are not subject to an aggregate annual limit on all political contributions the law allows political committee to contribute higher amounts by becoming multicandidate committee ie being registered with the fec for at least six months receiving contributions from more than 50 persons andexcept for state party committeecontributing to at least five federal candidates 2 usc 441bb by so qualifying as the vast majority of pacs do pac is eligible for limits of 5000 per election to federal candidate such pac may also give 5000 per year to political committee and 15000 per year to national party committee pac statistics table 1 shows aggregate pac data in each election cycle since 1972 in current and constant 2002 dollars receipts expenditures and donations to congressional candidates which account for the great bulk of federal pac giving the gap between expenditures and contributions consists of donations to parties and to state local and presidential races to congressional races in other years nonconnected pacs fundraising and administrative costs which for separate segregated funds are paid for by sponsors and independent expenditures crs3 as shown in table 1 pac expenditures have increased greatly since 1972 from 192 million to 6565 million in 2002a nearly 700 increase controlled for inflation the data also reveal that the pac explosion of the 1970s and early 1980s reached high point in 1986 after which total pac expenditures leveled off or even declined in constant dollars not until 2000 and again in 2002 did inflationcontrolled pac expenditures increase again and notably so similar pattern is seen in contributions to congressional candidates which rose from 85 million to 2661 million in current dollars from 1972 2002 controlled for inflation this represented more than 600 increase after reaching the constant dollar high point in 1988 aggregate contributions were relatively level until the 2000 and 2002 elections when significant increases occurred table 1 financial activity of pacs 19722002a millions of current and constant 2002 dollars adjusted adjusted

estimated based on available data table 2 places pac giving into perspective by showing contributions to congressional candidates in general elections since 1972 as percentage of campaign receipts in order to portray the level of receipts that are wholly or partly under candidates control the table presents two types of data total receipts reported by crs4 candidates and political party coordinated expenditures the latter is unique form of spending that allows parties to spend money on behalf of their candidates with their cooperation but without any requirement to report the expenditures in candidates fec filings 2 usc 441ad thus table 2 presents candidate receipts party coordinated expenditures pac contributions to candidates and the percentage of pac money in total candidate receipts the percentage was calculated by dividing the pac contributions by the sum of candidate receipts and party expenditures the data in table 2 show consistently greater reliance on pac money among house candidates than among senate candidates pacs accounted for between 30 and 40 of house candidate receipts and between 15 and 22 of senate candidate receipts during most of the years covered these data also show an increasing pac role relative to other sources through 1988 among senate candidates when high of 223 was reached and through 1990 among house candidates when high of 404 of funds came from pacs after those elections however the data show notable decline followed by leveling off in the relative pac role in house elections and decline in the next three senate elections followed by an increase and then rather constant levels since 1996 table 3 documents the pac proliferation since the 1970s indicating by category the number of pacs registered at the end of each twoyear period the data fall into six categories devised by the fec in 1977 corporate labor trade membership and health nonconnected cooperatives and corporations without capital stock the latter two representing only small share of contributions are combined here from 1974 to 2002 the number of registered pacs rose from 608 to 4027 reaching high of 4268 in 1988 followed by general leveling off while labors 201 pacs in 1974 made up onethird of all pacs their 320 pacs in 2002 accounted for just 8 of the total by contrast the 89 corporate pacs in 1974 grew to high of 1816 in 1988a more than 1900 riseand today constitute 38 of all pacs the mostly ideological nonconnected pacs grew from 162 in 1978 the first year the fec used this category to high of 1145 in 1992 today 26 of pacs are nonconnected the fourth major groupingtrade membership and healthgrew from 318 in 1974 to high of 975 in 2002 table 3 also provides information on the aggregate level of contributions to congressional candidates for each of the fec categories of pacs the dollar figures amplify some of the trends shown by the other data in this table the 36 million given by labor pacs in 1972 constituted 42 of all pac contributions that year the 519 million from labor pacs in 2002 accounted for just 20 of all pac contributions some 34 of 2002 contributions were from corporate pacs916 millionmaking it the largest financial category among the six fec groupings the second highest level of contributions in 2002 was from the largely businessoriented trade membership and health pacs whose 715 million made up 27 of all pac donations the fourth categorynonconnected pacsaccounts for the smallest share of contributions among the major groupings446 million in 2002although it is the second most numerous category these pacs typically give less in contributions than the others because large portion of their receipts are spent on their substantial operating costs often involving expensive directmail
