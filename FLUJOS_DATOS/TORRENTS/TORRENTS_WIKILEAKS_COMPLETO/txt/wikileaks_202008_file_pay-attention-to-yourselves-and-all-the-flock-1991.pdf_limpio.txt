the inhabited earth for witness infact he said the good news hasto be preached mark 13 10 this is the good news that god wants people to hear since overseers of the flock of god are responsible for

b loving overseers working with the congregation as overseers work with the congregation they should make it their goal always to imitate the loving ways of the supreme overseer jehovah in the same manner as jehovah has shown consideration for the disadvantaged and needy so also overseers should be sensitive to the needs of the aged the sick the new ones the young and those who need material assistance even as our heavenly father has shown interest in the spiritual growth and advancement of all of his intelligent creatures so overseers today ought to demonstrate constant interest in the spiritual wellbeing and advancement of all in the congregation ps 14679 doubt you would like to be of even greater assistance to your brothers in these matters what kind of overseer are you very likely you are busy person leading full life with many responsibilities if you are married you have wife and most likely children to care for spiritually physically and emotion ally caring for this primary responsibility requires time and thoughtw86111 p22 your secular employment can be very demanding of your energy time and emotions other important matters involving kingdom interests such as personal study preparation for meetings field service and helping and encouraging publishers in many ways tax your time maintenance and cleaning of the kingdom hall need to be scheduled and carried out and at times your help may be needed when new kingdom halls are built you also need rest and relaxation elders can learn to become proficient and to keep balance so that all necessary matters receive proper attention 19at 2 corinthians 11 2427 the apostle paul mentioned some of the great pressures that he faced and yet he said in verse 28 that from day to day there was also rushing in on him anxiety for all the congregations you as loving overseer feel similar concern for all the brothers and sisters in your congregation paul wrote to timothy i am grateful to christ jesus our lord who imparted power to because he considered faithful by assigning to ministry 1 tim 112 appreciation for the lovingkindness and mercy shown us by jehovah and his as well as our love for them and for our brothers moves us to serve the congregation as fully as possible despite other responsibilities therefore do not rely on your own wisdom and strength always petition jehovah for his wisdom to direct you in doing his work especially when problems or circumstances arise that you have never experienced or handled before jas 15 pray for holy spirit it can provide power beyond what is normal luke 1113 2 cor 47 8 16 the congregation prays that jehovah willbless your efforts to serve him and his people as loving overseer working with individuals who have special needs at 1 peter 2 17 we are encouraged not only to honor men of all sorts including secular rulers vs 13 but also to have love for the whole association of brothers by taking personal interest in your brothers and sisters you stay awake to their needs and are in position to show them appropriate love and honor all the flock of god need to feel the loving shepherding of the elders the aged and the sickly often need special

homes run errands they often need encouragement and reassurance that the elders care about them and are interested in them 1 thess 514 they may need someone to help them get to the meetings read to them or in other ways help them to stay spiritually strong consider ways that you can provide such practical assistance other brothers and sisters can help you carry the load invite them to volunteer make definite arrangements as to how they can help it is important to check periodically to see that someone is following through on arrangements made to give assistance your being alert to such needs and providing the appropri ate assistance will mark you as loving overseer you may be sure that this is well pleasing to jehovah heb 131 16 individuals with medical problems who are facing the blood

assistance might be given on humanitarian basis to those not having good standing in the congregation for example if disfellowshipped one takes firm stand on the blood issue local elders or the hospital liaison committee could share information with the family out of consideration for those faithful ones in major cities some elders are especially assigned as mem bers of patient visitation groups to visit hospitals regularly to assist witness patients this arrangement does not relieve local elders of their responsibility to visit the sick at home and in the hospital newly associated

remind them to do this 22 pay attention to yourselves and to all the flocktrain all the brothers and sisters to take the initiative in approaching new ones and getting acquainted with them so that you may encourage and help others be sure to arrive at the meetings early and stay for while after the program you can associate with new ones at other times also perhaps visiting with them in their home or yours such personal interest lets them see that genuine love exists among jehovahs people john1335 it also fills the void created when they cut off former associations and worldly entertainment young members of the congregation need to be strength ened to resist the desires incidental to youth 2 tim 222 parents have the primary responsibility to care for the needs of their children eph 64 col321 however the young ones are part of the congregation and elders have responsibility toward them also and should show genuine interest in them why is knowing the full names of all the youth in

and demonstrate desire to be used can be given certain assignments to perform around the kingdom hall before being appointed as an elder or ministerial servant brother must be tested as to fitness first 1 tim 310 your being alert to give qualified brothers something to do in the congregation will provide an opportunity for such testing and will give them added training giving due consideration to their exemplary conduct activity in the ministry and fine spiritual outlook the elders can determine what would be best for these broth ers keep in mind that not all have the same abilities or

brothers tak ing others with them in field service as often as possible they may need to set better example in encourag ing their wife and children in this activity be generous in giving commendation to these brothers when progress is made it is powerful force that often motivates persons to continue progressing 1 cor 112 if brother is lacking certain qualifications needed by ministerial servant it would be kindness to speak with him about the matter and give practical suggestions that might help him to develop the needed qualifications train ministerial servants who are reaching out for the office of overseer brother may need experience in shepherding provide training by taking him along on certain shep herding calls after call you might ask him how he would have handled certain things that came up this may enable you to see how he reasons you may be able to help him improve his ability to exhort after he has expressed himself you might explain to him why you handled the situation as you did brother may need greater discernment in the practical application of bible principles 28 pay attention to yourselves and to all the flocksuggest that he regularly read the bible and certain past watchtower articles and society publications the body of elders may extend greater teaching privileges to capable ministerial servants who make fine advance ment and meet the requirements from time to time encouragement and counsel should be given to these brothers although our sisters will never be ministerial servants or elders they need help to make progress also some may be encouraged to share in auxiliary or regular pioneer service adequate field service arrangements should be made for the sisters when you are not able to be with them consider other ways in which you can encourage and help your sisters including single parents urge sisters to become more effective in developing and conducting bible studies periodically elders should meet together to consider what can be done to help others advance since you have many responsibilities look for occasions when you can combine one activity with another and thus accomplish both at the same time an example of this would be arranging to work in the field service with publisher who needs spiritual couragement give other examples joyful results congregation members feel secure as they benefit from the concern assistance and protection of loving over seers working with them compare ezekiel 34 1116 servants of jehovah are glad to cooperate and exert them selves vigorously in his work rom 1211 12 many are motivated to

much from jesus the master teacher by observing how he taught but remember teaching is not matter of mastering techniques effective teaching requires love getting the spirit of things motivating others reaching the heart of those being taught learning how to teach by studying jesus example the following observations show why jesus was such an effective teacher his motive was to honor jehovah john849 50 he based his teaching on gods word matt44 7 10 123 5 194 223132 he presented matters with simplicity brevity and clarity and he was practical matt57 he used questions to involve his hearers and help them to reason and draw conclusions matt16512 224245 he used illustrations that applied to his listeners such as those concerning fishermen shepherds and housewives matt134750luke15310 he explained matters that were not understood by his hearers matt 1815mark410 1320 34 he used object lessons john13216 he reached the heart of those to whom he spoke luke 2432 the result of his ministry

action gods word is the truth our personal opinions may lose effectiveness as circumstances change or may even be in error avoid drawing attention to yourself as gods humble servants we should seek to honor him in all that we do and say emphasize the scriptures rather than your own ideas jokes and humorous stories are not necessary and often detract from the power of the scriptures the bible does not indicate that jesus used such devices logical development is key ingredient in effective teaching it makes presentation persuasive and easy to follow present specific material as jesus did talk dealing with generalities lacks impact and authori ty it is vague when giving instructions explain how they are to be executed notice jesus specific instructions at matthew 101114 do not introduce more material than can be adequately developed in the allotted time keep your presentation simple uncomplicated allow time to repeat the main points teaching with the bible involves more than simply read ing bible text when reading emphasize key portions of the text when giving public talk do not ask volunteers in the 32 pay attention to yourselves and to all the flockaudience to read scripture texts they may not empha size the portion applicable to the argument explain the scripture illustrate the main point of the text apply the points to your audience this will help you to hold their attention and should move them to apply what they learn illustrations were an important feature of jesus teach ing and they can help you to be effective luke7 4143 make your illustrations simple complex ones may be difficult to follow and may even detract from your argu ment note the simplicity and power of illustrations used by james jas 3111 what makes these illustrations so practical in giving counsel against gossip effective questions may be used to stimulate thinking and help individuals to draw conclusions note how jesus used questions matt 161316 luke 10 252836 asking leading questions based on what person already knows may direct his mind to correct conclusion matt 172427 enullample new brother tells you that his employer requires him to overcharge customers he asks you what he should do rather than tell him what to do help him reason on the matter and draw his own conclusion based on the scriptures draw him out by asking questions such as how do you feel about it is such an action dishonest if so why what does the bible say about dishonesty would you want person to do that to you as you read and discuss appropriate scriptures with him you will help him to draw the right conclusion based on the bible and he may be mo tivated by good heart to follow through on the counsel of the scriptures unit 2 33asking person what he thinksviewpoint questions helps you to find out what he believes on matter getting answers to such questions will help you to know what counsel or encouragement he needs his comments will help you to discern how to reach his heart enullample if sister asks you about marrying an unbeliever you might ask her what do you think about it do you remember any scriptures that have bearing on the subject after reading with her 1 corinthians 7 39 and 2 corinthians 6 14 15 you might ask what do those scriptures tell you as to gods view on the matter do you agree with this counsel what benefits can you foresee coming to the person who follows this counsel from god appeal to the heart in your teaching the figurative heart in man stands for the sum total of the interior man as manifested in all his various activi ties and in his desires motivations affections emo tions thoughts and so forth ps 11911it1 p1057 heartfelt appreciation is necessary for person to apply the truth it must first get into his heart when teaching you must reach the heart of the student one way to reach his heart is to encourage the person to ponder on what he learns you can help him do this by emphasizing the main points and encouraging him to review these another way is to ask probing questions such as how do you feel about this bible point and what the society has published on this subject how could you apply this information in your life or to this present situa tion third way to impress the truth on the heart is to help your listener to think in terms of his relationship with jehovah 34 pay attention to yourselves and to all the flockunit 2 aencourage him to ask such questions as why do i want to do this am i seeking to please god or am i catering to my own fleshly desires emphasize the importance of seeking jehovahs di

the field service by exerting undue pressure on them however encouragement is proper endeavor to stimulate their hearts so there will be desire to serve jehovah wholesouled and to have as full share as possible in the preaching work mark1230 wholesouled devotion is implied in the greatest com mandment of the mosaic law less is required of us as disciples of jesus christ matt223640 do not expect everyone to do or accomplish the same in witnessing people have different circumstances and different conditions of health all can render wholesouled service some by producing thirtyfold others sixtyfold or hun dredfold according to their circumstances matt1323 help the brothers to appreciate that participation in proclaiming the good news is sacred duty require ment on which our life depends rom 1010 1 cor 916 keep before the brothers the fact that our work relates to the supreme issue of the rightness of jehovahs sovereignty this should stir our hearts and move us to zealous

doing work never to be repeated that the work is not in vain that the reward for endurance in gods service is certain overseers who appreciate their privilege and discharge their responsibility to

jehovah 36 pay attention to yourselves and to all the flock unit 2 37unit 2b teaching at congregation meetings the spirituality of the congregation depends greatly on the quality of teaching at the meetings the five weekly meetings form an integral part of our theocratic education the brothers come to these meetings expecting to be instruct ed in gods word and encouraged in his work you have great and wonderful privilege to stand before your brothers gods flock in your care to feed them and build them up do this willingly with joy and earnestness 1 pet 52 this will motivate them to zealous service and increase your happiness as well teaching at the watchtower study thewatchtower is the principal means of dispensing spiritual food at the proper time the information it contains can greatly help individuals to establish and maintain good relationship with jehovah and with fellow worshipers the spiritual food is needed to nourish the heart to teach effectively at the watchtower study you will need to prepare prayerfully and carefully look up the scriptures and know how they apply take keen interest in the material and in your brothers reach their heart progressively strive to improve your teaching at the watchtower study the opening remarks of the conductor should be brief and to the point calling attention to the theme and stimulating interest in the material be warm enthusiastic inviting and yet specific 38you may ask two or three questions that will be answered during the study make statement to be proved present problem that needs solution or focus attention on the teaching box theconductor should not comment excessively as teacher you do not do the thinking for the congrega tion rather by pointed questions you help them to think in an orderly manner and arrive at correct conclusions when important points are not covered in comments from the congregation or when the application of scrip ture is overlooked ask specific questions to draw out the information however caution do not ask additional questions unnecessarily for doing so may stifle comments on other points that the audience has in mind ask additional questions onlywhen needed avoid talking too much or leading the brothers to concentrate on details rather than on the main points tactfully and kindly stimulate the brothers desire to participate this may be done by being warm and friendly yourself and by commending the brothers for their comments and efforts promote personal and family preparation encourage the brothers to comment in their own words briefly and to the point train the audience to give direct answer to the printed question first additional comments by the audience may then draw attention to scripture application to supporting argu ments or to practical application of the material the congregation should not be scolded if answers are not forthcoming as quickly as the conductor would like for this may stifle future comments unit 2 b 39make good use of the bible during the study acts 1711 help the congregation to appreciate that every study has been prepared to help us understand bible prophecies teachings moral principles and so forth encourage the audience to look up and comment on the scriptures used in the study as time permits the conductor may invite all in attendance to look up selected scriptures as they are read and commented on some scriptures could be assigned in advance for indi viduals to read and comment on help the audience to understand how key scriptures sup port the theme of the study keep concluding comments brief ask the review questions in the teaching box that appears toward the end of the lesson these draw attention to the main points encourage application of the counsel in our lives jas 1

questions but also the reasonsfor the answers and the value of the information make practical application to personal lives attitudes field service and so forth conduct the study in way that will

to details if comment made detracts from the theme kindly direct the discussion back to the theme and main point enullample if you are considering john 3 16 and the theme is the ransom you would draw attention to the point that god gave his onlybegotten as ransom rather than become involved in discussion of the expression the world although this is also men tioned in the verse unquoted scriptures may be read and discussed as time allows the conductor decides how this is best handled be selective choosing texts that best illuminate main points long citations may be read they may be summarized by someone assigned in advance or key verses may be read carefully observe the response of those in attendance do not comment excessively rather by pointed ques tions endeavor to draw out answers from the audience at times persons who tend to read their comments may be kindly encouraged privately to put them in their own words be discerning it might be offensive or discouraging if this is done after new or timid person has made comment be alert to commend the brothers for what they do strive to make the material reach both the mind and the heart to help the brothers understand points that are not clear various types of questions may be employed unit 2 b 41youmightusetrueorfalse statements aswellas multiplechoice leading or viewpoint questions help the brothers to see the practical value of the mate rial watch for points that the brothers can use in field service are there points that would be helpful to those in divided households or information that could be used by the brothers at their place of employment by the children at school or by christians in other situations encourage all to participateyoung ones and new ones as well as mature ones keep the atmosphere respectful yet friendly and inviting perhaps you may be able to help some individuals prepare for the study timid persons may be willing to read scripture others may be given assignments or may be kindly encouraged to comment keep the concluding review brief and specific highlight ing main points learned if practical have the closing review from the bible rather than from the book especially if the material was consid ered verse by verse continue to work at improving your teaching at the congregation book study teaching at the public meeting the public meeting generally features discourse though slide presentations produced by the society are also used all the elders and especially the presiding overseer should be concerned with maintaining highquality pub lic talks the presiding overseer will consult with other elders and 42 pay attention to yourselves and to all the flockschedule talks that will be most beneficial for the congre gation and for new ones that attend the information should be spiritually upbuilding to both new ones and regular attenders request speakers from other congregations who are known for their effective teaching ability those who are assigned to give public talks should regu larly work toward improving their teaching ability do thorough research in the societys publications to bring the material to life be sure that your outline is kept current periodically update your statistics experiences illustra tions and so forth points from recent articles in the watchtower and awakemay be worked in when appropriate apply the information to the needs of the congregation visiting speakers who are not familiar with the particu lar needs of congregation should be cautious in at tempting to give pointed counsel to the audience on local situations when preparing public talk ask yourself why is this information needed how willi present it and illustrate it so that all will benefit by understanding how the informa tion can be used present the information so that an unbeliever in the audience can see the reasonableness of it we want to help people not ridicule them we want to appeal to their reason and better judgment and not belittle their intelligence enullample if your talk is on the subject of evolution you would not want to present the material in such way as to ridicule those who believe in evolution while the brothers might consider such presentation humorous it would not appeal to person in the audience who believes in evolution unit 2 b 43help the brothers in the audience to see how they could present the material in way that would appeal to those in the territory who believe in evolution use terms that are easily understood by all involve your audience by the use of rhetorical questions make good use of key scriptures not only read scriptures but also explain illustrate and apply them do not read all cited scriptures focus on key ones rather than have persons in the audience read scrip tures the speaker should read them with proper emphasis sense stress and enthusiasm enthusiasm is very important in your teaching without it wellprepared material may not be clear put your heart into your talk adhere closely to the material and the timing set out in the societys outlines accept and appreciate constructive counsel offered by other elders who are interested in helping you to improve your speaking and teaching ability elders should not hold back from kindly offering help ful counsel and suggestions to fellow elders when such is needed for improving the quality of public talks if it is decided by elders that visiting speaker needs to improve suggestions may be provided through the presiding overseer of his congregation be sure that your aim is to teach the audience and not to entertain them teaching at the service meeting the purpose of the service meeting is to equip and stimulate the brothers to share fully in the preaching and disciplemaking work 44 pay attention to

help the brothers to see how the information presented is practical and how it can be helpful to them in their ministry ask yourself why does our congregation need this information what points will be of greatest value to the publishers then highlight these points for your instruction and counsel to be most effective you should first of all appreciate the value of field service and set good example in the work taking the lead 1 tim 412 the service meeting should be 45 minutes in length excluding the songs and prayer the brothers appreciate having the meetings conclude on time if someone before you on the program takes too much time try to reduce your part to compensate if someone habitually goes overtime the presiding overseer or another elder should speak to him in kindly way give practical suggestions and help him to see the need to make adjustments unit 2 b 45perhaps he should have less material perhaps he should spend less time on introductory remarks and get right into the assigned material periodically the elders should discuss what they can do to improve the service meetings each one should work at being more effective teacher when he has part on the service meeting

inviting the brothers to look for the answers 46 pay attention to yourselves and to all the flockoral counsel should encourage the student and further help him to develop speaking and teaching skills

member of the congregation to do it some students may need help to improve their reading ability it is important that everyone in the congregation be able to read well and understand what they read arrangements might be made to help some improve their reading skills perhaps an auxiliary room could be used for these classes when the school is being conducted or they could be held at another time all meetings should always be conducted in such way as to honor jehovah spiritually build up those in unit 2 b 47attendance and cause us to grow ever stronger in our love for jehovah his service and our brothers all meetings should begin and end on time this requires thorough preparation on the part of every participant public speakers should adhere strictly to the 45minute total timing indicated

in the evangelizing work jehovah has assigned his people one of the most important tasks ever performed on the earththe evangelizing work evangelizing involves preaching and teaching the good news of the kingdom by means of every appropriate method open to us why is the evangelizing work so important because it provides touchstone by which mankind is being judged acceptance of the good news and obedience to it result in salvation rejection and disobedience mean destruction this in itself impresses upon us the urgency of the work matt 2540 45 especially must the elders be wholesouled in the evange lizing work the apostle paul stated whatever you are doing work at it wholesouled as to jehovah and not to mencol 323 what is wholesouled service wholesouled service involves using your whole self your heart mind and strength every fiber of your existence is involved in lovingly serving god function capacity or desire in life is excepted it means being godoriented that is goddirected wholesouled service does not require that we be physical ly perfect imperfect people are urged to be wholesouled mark 1228 30 it is matter of using all our imperfect faculties to the fullest extent possible in gods service people have different abilities so their accomplishments differ 50jesus spoke of the seed sown upon the fine soil as producing hundredfold or sixtyfold or thirtyfoldall is wholesouled matt 131823 one person may have better health or more energy resources or natural ability than another circumstanc in life differ two women in bible times received honorable mention for their contributions to gods service though the material value of their gifts differed greatly mark143 69luke2114 similarly today some may be wholesouled even though personal circumstances and limitations allow them to do very little in field service help your brothers to enjoy what they are able to do in the evangelizing work whether it appears to be little or much being wholesouled makes one more effective in the evangelizing work if we put our whole heart into our presentation of the kingdom message people may sense this and it may have much to do with their favorable response to the good news when in the field service we should keep our mind on our ministry how to present the good news effectively and not on matters of selfinterest as dedicated servants of jehovah we should be deter mined to exert ourselves physically using our energies and strength in the evangelizing work 1 tim410 an hour or two at time may be all that an older or sickly person can wisely spend in field service his service would be wholesouled those whose strength and circumstances permit them to do more need not discontinue their activity just because others cannot stay out longer honest

fulltime service mention benefits of the pioneer work in your talks when appropriate include pioneers in your congregation prayers be alert to the needs and problems of those already in the pioneer

attention to the particular needs of the pio neers in your congregation be prepared to encourage them and to render loving assistance one of the best ways to encourage pioneer service is for elders

and to all the flocksome elders in the following situations have found it possible to be regular pioneers those who are retired those who have dependent children those who have secular work that does not consume much of their time some have made adjustments in their secular em ployment so they can pioneer some elders whose circumstances do not permit them to be regular pioneers have been able to engage in auxiliary pioneer service one or more times during the year selfexamination more serious thought and prayer can help each person determine if he can increase his per sonal field service time and still care for all his scriptur responsibilities many elders have encouraged and helped their wife and children to share in either regular or auxiliary pioneer work cooperation among family

every opportunity to help others learn the truth concerning gods purposes mark1310 phil 215 likewise today you as overseers should motivate the brothers to vigorous action in the evangelizing work

are not taking the initiative to evangelize informally take time on the service meeting to relate experiences or to demonstrate how to witness infor mally some publishers may need to learn how to converse in way that is not objectionable so that the listener does not feel that he is being lectured col 46 to be effective publishers must discern not only how to begin but also when to stop speaking on scriptural subject it is often good to make statement or two and then pause to see what response you get notice how jesus witnessed informally john 4 7261 few brief but appropriate statements from time to time may accomplish more than trying to say it all at once stimulate regular participation in prearranged evangelizing work the evangelizing work can be done in various formal ways and often the elders can arrange for groups of publishers to share in these activities an effective method of reaching people with the good news is by calling on them from house to house unit3 b

activity for all in the family other publishers also need the help and encouragement you can give by accompanying them in the houseto house ministry by listening to your presentation the publishers learn how to do the evangelizing work more effec tively in the local territory when you are with other publishers as they speak at the doors you will be able to recognize problems they may have tactfully offer suggestions for improving their service do not be critical of the brothers and do not try to force them into mold be upbuilding and helpful in what you say recognize their limitations reassure them of their worth as willing ser vants of jehovah train publishers to keep an accurate housetohouse rec ord so they can call back on interested people make arrangements for calling again where one was at home effort should be made to find someone to speak to at every home the best time for reaching people may vary in different parts of your territory some publishers have had good results by witness ing in the late afternoon or the early evening with little encouragement and assistance from the elders or other experienced ones more publishers might be able to share in afternoon and evening witnessing 60 pay attention to yourselves and to all the flockgive prompt attention to expiring subscription slips return visit slips and other notices you receive from the society asking you to call on individuals in your terri tory arrange to approach subscribers soon so there is break in their subscription if this is what they desire and they are benefiting from reading the magazines offer to start study with them if they are agreeable when the society sends notice for someone to call on person who has requested literature or spiritual assistance be sure to have capable publisher call promptly elders should make definite arrangements for publishers to witness in public places in the following ways contacting people at their place of business witnessing to people on public streets and at places where people shop talking to people waiting in automobiles and at bus or train stops visiting hospitals rest homes jails and so forth investigate other ways in which you may be able to reach people in your territory not all publishers feel confident in speaking to people in such public places if the elders take the lead in this activity other qualified publishers may follow suit some publishers on the other hand may excel in some other form of evangelizing activity other ways you can help your brothers in the evangelizing work you may be able to help some publishers by visiting them in their home and helping them to prepare the unit 3 b 61currentpresentation fortheministryorsomeother bible discussion for use in the field your visit may provide fine opportunity for them to practice giving their presentations and for you to demon strate the scriptural discussions you are using accompany the publishers from house to house if at all possible this is most effective way to give personal assistance the publishers can listen to you and observe what you do and by your suggestions they can be helped to be more effective in the evangelizing work if you cannot personally accompany some publishers as often as you would like make arrangements for other effective evangelizers to go with them try to share with others in the midweek evangelizing work if you can arrange that from time to time this may prove to be very strengthening to sisters or others who cannot share in the field service on weekends and it will give them joyful sense of support 62

body of older men who work closely together is indeed blessed but what is the key to their being able to work in unity primarily it is their recognizing jesus christ as head of the christian gregation when elders meet together christs headship should dominate 1 cor 113 their meetings should be well arranged 1 cor 1440 they should try to reach decisions on matters discussed definite arrangements should be made for someone to follow through on the decisions that are made how can the presiding overseer conduct meaningful elders meetings what must each individual elder do to make positive contribution to these meetings but first what is involved in recognizing christs headship and how does this unite body of elders recognizing the headship of christ unites the body although jehovah god is the shepherd and overseer of our souls he has appointed jesus christ as head of the christian congregation eph 122 23 1 pet 225 by genuinely accepting jesus christ as head of the chris tian

accepting this fact elders will be helped to work together as body each elder should listen carefully to the scriptural sugges tions of the other elders we should not make an independent decision for the congregation if matter is one on which we should consult other elders what enables elders to display the spirit of cooperation jehovah through his unifies the congregation for harmonious cooperation eph 416 compare romans 828 elders are really cooperating with jehovah when they cooperate as body for the good of the congregation col 219 1 cor 12 cooperation is result of displaying the fruitage of the spirit which every elder should cultivate in his personal life both publicly and privately gal522 23 65in the following ways elders show that they are cooperat ing together and striving to maintain the unity referred to at psalm 133 1 keeping communication among elders open and free especially if there are differences in background sharing pertinent information with fellow elders not shielding elders or their relatives from needed counsel seeking assistance and suggestions from elders who have much experience not campaigning among fellow elders to undermine decisions of the body that do not meet personal prefer ence accepting fellow elders excelling qualities as well as their limited abilities not finding fault with fellow elders as they are learning new duties making sure that reports and records that other elders need to refer to are available and uptodate promptly following through to completion on assign ments given by the body it should be possible for bodies of elders to be unanimous in most of their decisions acts 1525 if bible principles are involved the elders should make their decision in harmony with these when there is counsel from the faithful and discreet slave on the matter either by letter or from the societys publications the elders will want to take that counsel to heart matt 2445 other matters may generally be decided by the majority of the elders on the basis oftheir sound judgment and of their concern for providing the best guidance and direc tion for the congregation even the majority should not insist on personal

individual elders will cooperate closely with what the body of elders as whole determines is in the best interests of the congregation if the majority decide that matter should be handled in certain way then the minority should give willing support to such decision however if those in the minority have bible reference and comments in print on the matter from the faithful and discreet slave the majority should recognize such corrective information so that biblebased decision can be reached if in the opinion of the minority biblebased decision is still not reached the minority should continue to cooperate with the rest of the body and bring the matter to the attention of the circuit overseer during his regular visit the congregation will cooperate if they sense that all the elders base their decisions on gods word 2 tim 3 16 17 working together as body of elders working together as body does not mean that all share in performing each task or making each decision individual members of the human body carry out certain functions without direct participation by other body members 1 cor 121231 honoring one another elders will allow the presiding overseer and other assigned elders

repentance when the individual has shown himself to be guilty of hypocrisy lying or making deliberate efforts to deceive also be cautious when it is apparent that the wrong act was preceded by deliberate scheming perhaps in cold calculating way this is quite different from when an individual under the unexpected pressure of certain tempting circum stances gives in because of human weakness

move him to repentance however the judicial committee is not obliged to meet repeatedly with the wrongdoer or put words in his mouth trying to force him to repent if it is obvious that he lacks godly sorrow in all cases the elders on the judicial committee must weigh such factors as the following the seriousness of the wrong committed the time that has passed since it occurred the circumstances

prayerful consideration of such information would be appropriate before the committee initiates the hearing itself before forming judicial committee person who becomes witness to serious should

cases of fornication or adultery 118when the witness is victim of the wrongdoer as in cases of incest or rape when the witness is extremely timid in such cases or when other extenuating circumstances exist two elders may discuss the matter with the ac cused or an elder may accompany the witness to dis cuss the matter with the accused of course if it is determined that judicial committee should be

if the new allegations are nonetheless established and if the person does not demonstrate genuine repentance the appeal committee may decide to disfellowship on these new grounds the appeal committee

both committees which should clearly state that the original judicial committee agrees with the deci sion the original committee willreceive copy of the letter which will be kept in sealed envelope in the congrega tions confidential file unit 5 c 127at times the original committee and the appeal committee may hold conflicting opinions when this occurs the individual should not be given any

giving reasons for its decision and should include letter from the original committee expressing the reasons for dis agreement the appeal committee gives the original committee copy of its report both committees await reply from the branch office it may be that certain important factors are being over looked by one or both of the committees the branch office will be glad to comment on any such factors and offer additional scriptural assistance as may be needed such information will be supplied for the appeal committee further meetings with the accused or between the committees may or may not be necessary to conclude the case once any differences between the committees have been resolved in the light of the scriptural principles cited by the branch office the appeal committee should
