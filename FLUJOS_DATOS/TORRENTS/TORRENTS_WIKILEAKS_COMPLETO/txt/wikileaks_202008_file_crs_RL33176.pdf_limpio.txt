organization wto held its 6th ministerial summit in hong kong from december 1318 2005 wto ministerials are held every two years to bring together trade ministers from member states often to make political decisions for the body although an original goal of the ministerial was to agree on package of modalities methods by which the round is negotiated for the ongoing doha development agenda dda round of trad negotiations this aim was dropped in order to avoid highprofile failure similar to previous ministerials at cancun and seattle rather members agreed to some modest advancements in agriculture industrial tariffs and duty and quotafree access for least developed countries the final outcome of these negotiations could provide substantial boost to the world economy but if the round itself is not comp leted there may be re percussions for the wto as an institution and for the architecture of the world trading system agriculture has become the most significant challenge for the members in the negotiations at the ministerial members agreed to an elimination of export subsidies by 2013 members also agreed to three band approach to cutting domestic support and committed to achieving specific modalities areas of tariffs and domestic support by april 30 2006 trade ministers agreed to use swiss tariff reduction formula in the nonagricultural market access talks with specific moda lities to be agreed by april 30 2006 memb ers also reaffirmed commitment to completing the services negotiations with regard to the trade related aspects of intellectual property agreement trips the wto members acted before the ministerial to approve the final amendment of the trips agreement to incorporate the 2003 decision on access to medicines members also made commitment to extend dutyfree and quotafree access to all ldc products the outcome of the ministerial potentially has significant implications for congress any agreement resulting from th round must be approved by congress and there is pressure to come to an agreement well before the expiration of us trade promotion authority on july 1 2007 in addition any agreement on agriculture may affect the drafting or necessitate the revision of the next farm bill that may be considered by congress in 2007 congress has also expressed an interest in shielding us trade remedy laws from negotiations this report will

countries july 2005 available at wwwworldbankorgtradewto the different outcomes in these studies are due substantially to the assumptions concerning the liberalization resulting from the doha round as well as from differences in the econometric models themselves for example the world bank studies do not attempt to quantify services liberalizationtrade remedies while the ministerial text and the rules annex did not report consensus on any negotiating issue it called for the preparation of textbased negotiating instrument trade facilitation major breakthroughs in trade facilitation were announced in hong kong and the ministerial declaration did not agree on date for beginning textbased negotiations the ministerial served as review of progress and discussion of plans for future work dispute settlement the ministerial takes note of the work of dispute settlement negotiations but does not recommend any specific course of action trade and environment the ministerial reaffirmed its commitment to doha language aimed at enhancing the mutual supportiveness of trade and environment it also noted the cooperation between negotiating gr oups to identify environmental goods in which

involves the shifting of economic resources into mo re productive uses it inevitably involves dislocations including job losses and plan t closures to some groups and regions the future of the

when the lower ta riffs under trade agreement cause trade to be diverted away from more efficient producer outside the trading bloc to producer inside the bloc 6 this section was written by charles hanrahan senior specialist in agricultural policy resources science and industry division superficial agreement the world trading system could be affected in numerous ways first it may result in the loss of confiden ce in the institutions of the wto one of the achievements of the uruguay round was the establishment of binding dispute settlement system in which c ountries have recourse to ch allenge the trading practices of other members however failure of the wto to further trade liberalization in areas which are significant to its member s may bode ill for the legitimacy of its other institutions including dispute settlement second an unsatisfactory outcome of the doha round may accelerate the trend toward regional and bilateral free trade agreements while some of these agreements are quite comprehensive and do result in substantially free trade between the partners others are more political documents that include what is convenient and leave out whole economic sectors in addition regi onal and bilateral ag reements are often negotiated between countries of diffe rent economic power and the resulting agreement reflects the interests of the dominant negotiating partner the drawback of these agreements to the world economy is one that the multilateral trading system was designed to avoid namely trade diversion5 and increased complexity from spaghetti bowl of rules multiple tariff rates and arbitrary rules of origin if the doha round is not seen as moving forw ard these regional and bilateral deals increasingly may form the basis for the world trading system the doha round presents challenges to both developed and developing countries developed countries are challenged to negotiate an agriculture agreement that provides meaningful reductions to tariff and subsidies that impede the market access of producers with comparative adva ntage often developing countries developing countries are also looking to see m eaningful market access co mmitments in labor intensive industrial products the challenge for developing countries is to provide meaningful market access in industria l products and services partly to reduce their own inefficient barriers but also to allow political cover in developed countries to proceed with liberalization benefici to developing countries developing countries are also challenged to fully participate in the round and not to exclude themselves with the mantra of special and differential treatment to avoid liberalization that ultimately may be in their own interest agriculture6 agriculture has been among the most difficult areas to negotiate in the doha round yet progress in agriculture seems to be outpacing progress in other areas the doha round mandate and the july framewor k for the agriculture negotiations

tradedistorting subsidies for cotton and 2 proposals to establish multilateral system of notif ication and registration for wines and spirits and the provision of add itional protection for gis of agricultural products7 agricultural ne gotiating proposals in preparation for the hong kong meeting the united states the eu the g20 developing count ries such countries as brazil india and china and the g 10 group of net importers of agricultural products which includes switzerland norway and south korea each made proposals for specific modalities to address the three pillars8 major differences among the proposals cast doubt on the likelihood that full modalities in agriculture would be agreed in hong kong the unite d states for example made its offer to substantially reduce domestic subsidies conditional on gaining substantial market access for agricultural products from the eu and especially the developing countries the eu however indicated it would not move further on agricultural market access unless developing countries ag reed to open markets for services and industrial products and the united states made concessions on the treatment of geographical indications for food and agri cultural products the g20 for its part indicated it would not make substantially improved offers on i ndustrial products and services until there was progress on domestic farm subsidies and market access the g10 argued strongly for maintaining high tariffs for agricultural products although some members like japan have taken more conciliatory stance draft of the declaration for the hong kong ministerial noted that much remains to be done in orde r to establish modalities for agriculture and to conclude the negotiations as proposed the dr aft declaration would commit wto member countries to complete negotiations on modalities and to submit comprehensive schedules of concessions by dates in 2006 to be dete rmined report of the chairman of the agriculture negotiating

mid2007 and before the expira tion of the us farm bill in september 2007 the hong kong declaration deals with all three pillars of the agricultural negotiations export competition domestic support and market access and also with the controversial issue of the nature and pace of reform of tradedistorting cotton subsidies in the united states and other developed countries most progress was made in negotiations on the export competition pillar with an agreement on specific end date for the elimination of export subsidies but difficult negotiations remain on establishing new disciplines for othe r forms of export competition detailed negotiations are yet to be carried out for domestic support and market access as throughout the doha agricultural ne gotiations market access and especially how to deal with access for importsensitive pr oducts remains the thorniest issue not least because of eu intransigence on this pillar some agreement was reached on how to deal with export subsidies and mark et access for cotton but this issue still pits the united states which argues for handlin g the reduction of tradedistorting support for cotton within the domestic support p illar against the cottonproducing african countries who insist on an early harv est of reductions in cotton support export competition the most concrete outcome of the hong kong ministerial was an agreement to eliminate agricultural export subsidies by the end of 2013 the european union eu the largest user of export subsidies had opposed setting an end date maintaining that wto members needed to determine first how other forms of subsidized export competition export credit programs insurance export activities of state trading ente rprises stes and food aid would be disciplined the united states and brazil among others had been demanding an end to such export subsides by 2010 to be followed by negotiations on other forms of export completion as compromise the declaration calls for the parallel elimination of all forms of export subs idies and disciplines on measures with equivalent effect by the end of 2013 th end date will be c onfirmed however only after the completion of modalities for the elimination of all forms of export subsidies with respect to other forms of export competition the declaration included the followinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33176crs9 11 ssgs are presently

decided during the modalities negotiations the eu would be in the highest band and be subject to the largest reduction commitments while japan and the united states would be in the middl band the us proposal would have subjected japan to higher percentage cu t of its domestic support all other wto members including developing countri would be in the bottom band the declaration states further that the overall reduction in tradedistorting domestic support will still need to be made even if the sum of the reductions in the components of tradedistorting support would otherw ise be less than the overall reduction requirement this appears aimed at ensuri ng that the united states does not engage in box shifting to maintain its current spending levels market access the declaration calls for f our bands for structuring tariff cuts with the relevant band thresholds and withinband reducti on percentages to be worked out during modalities negotiations the treatment of sensitive products those to be exempted from formula tariff reductions was also left to modalities negotiations preliminary draft of the declaration would have required wto member countries to ensure that for sens itive products the greater the deviation from agreed tariff reduction formul as the greater would be the increase in tariff rate quotas the extent to which tariff rate quotas for sensitive products are expanded remains key determinant of the market access gains that would result from the round the declaration also ensured that veloping countries would have two privileges not otherwise ava ilable to developed countries 1 the right to self designate number of tariff lines to be tr eated as special products with lower cuts in tariffs based on certain criteria f ood security livelihood security and

ambitiously than under whatever general formula is agreed and that it should be implemented over shorter period of time than for other commodities agriculture nama and ldcs two other provisions in the

modalities the decl aration recognizes that it is important to advance the development objectives of the round through enhanced market access for developing countries in both agriculture and nama as result the declaration calls for complementary high level of ambition in market access for both these components of the round second in departure from special and differential treatment the declaration calls for all veloped countries and developing countries in position to do so to provide duty free and quotafree market access for products originating from ldcs with some excepti ons by 2008 or later than the beginning of the implementation period these asp ects of the hong kong declaration are discussed more fully elsewhere in this report doha and the 2007 farm bill current doha reform proposals suggest that substantial changes could be needed for several components of us agricultural policy the authorizing statute for which the 2002 farm bill expires in 2007 the agreement in the declaration to eliminate export subsidies would most likely affect exports of milk and milk products the principal beneficiaries of us agricultural export subsidies direct export subsidies for other eligible agricultural commod ities have been little used since 1995 the emerging doha agreement on export competition also suggests that the effectiveness of traditional export credit guarantees in supporting us commodity exports into pricecompetitive markets would be reduced however ongoing us changes in its export credit guarantee program made in response to wto dispute

against certain features of the us cotton program13 are likely to bring them into compliance with doha reform propos als thereby necessitating little if any further change since most of us food aid is in the form of commodity donations rather than cash us food aid donations w ould likely be reduced to the extent that reforms to food aid limit or restrict the donation of actual commodities14 the various components of us domestic support for farmers also could require some redesign in order to meet lowe r overall and individual component spending ceilings although there are many ways that such changes could be achieved likely approach would include shifting away from marketdistorting programs such as loan deficiency payments ldp or marketing loan gains mlg and towards greater use of nontrade distorting or green box progra ms such as decoupled direct payments conservation payments or rura l infrastructure development doha round agreement to reduce ta riff levels is unlikely to produce significant increases in imports for most us agricultural commodities since us agricultural tariffs are already very low relative to most other nations and relatively few commodities receive tariffrate quot trq protection however dairy products beef and sugar are three of the ma jor us beneficiaries of trq protection each of these products is likely to tinue to receive protection as

rudimentary and that for it to develop into an effective system of rules they would have to do more work therefore they mandated in article xix of the general agreement on trade in services gats that new negotiations on services commence later than five years after the uruguay round agreements ente red into force that is by the year of 2000 thus the services negotiations became along with the agricultural negotiations part of the socalled builtin agenda the negotiations did begin in 2000 but the early start has not ensured early progress by march 2001 the negotiators had tablished the guidelines for the negotiations but not much else negotiations would proceed using the requestoffer format in establishing commitments for ma rket access all services sectors and subsectors would be subject to negotiation and negotiators would seek progressive trade liberalization in services while recognizing the sovereign right of member states to regulate their national services sectors the doha ministerial declaration of november 2001 folded the services negotiations into the agenda of the dda round the ministerial declaration reaffirm ed the guidelines but mandated deadlines to spur the negotiators wto members were to submit their initial requests for market access and national treatment commitments from each member by june 30 2002 and their initial offers of commitments th ey would be willing to make by march 31 2003 any momentum which was modest at best that had been attained in the services negotiations was halted along with the other aspects of the dda negotiations with the failure of the ptember 2003 cancun ministerial by that time only few wto members including the european union eu and the united states had submitted their requests and made initial offerings per the deadlines set down in the doha ministerial declaration the july 2004 framework in an effort to recharge the negotiations reaffirmed the mandates contained in the doha ministerial declaration the july framework specifically charged the negotiators to complete and submit their initial offers as soon as possible to submit revised offers by ma 2005 and to ensure that the offers are of high quality the presence of the services negotiations in the framework is considered important to the us business community it had been concerned that the wto negotiators commitment to services might be

other observers have suggested several other underlying causes rooted in process and substance negotiating format some negotiators and othe r observers have suggested that the requestoffer negotiating format might be stalling the process because it is timeconsuming and tedious at the suggestion of wto officials some members have suggested ways to alter the format to accelerate the process the united states and the eu among other wto members separately have proposed formats that would include numerical targets for example that wto members agree to liberalize trade in certain percentage of core s ectors some have proposed plurilateral negotiations whereby subgroups of countri jointly present offers to other subgroups some developing countries such as brazil that are highly protective of

united states has b een regarding mode4 it has also created some tension between the us business co mmunity and the us government all of this criticism is despite the fact that mode4 accounts for less that 1 of world trade in services23 the controversy arises in part because the issue of mode4 delivery is closely related to immigration policy in the united states and some other countries and comes at time when the united states has tightened restrictions in response to the attacks of september 11 2001 in addition some members of c ongress have warned that changes in us immigration laws th at

primary products ba sically all trade in goods which are not foodstuffs while other areas of wto negotiations have received greater scrutiny in the doha round trade of industrial and primary products the subject of the nama negotiations conti nue to make up the bulk of world trade nearly 89 trillion in manufact ures and primary products were traded worldwide in 2004 accounting for 81 of world trade activity26 in the united states industrial and primary products accounted for 70 of exports and 83 of imports in 200427 hence the outcome of these negotiations could have substantial impact on the us trade pictures and on the overall us economy previous to the doha round industrial ta riff negotiations were the mainstay of gatt negotiations these rounds led to the reduction of developed country average tariffs from 40 at the end of world war ii to 6 today however average tariff figures mask higher tariffs for many labor intensive or valueadded goods that are especially of interest to the developi ng world seen from the developed world perspective gains from the nama talks in this round are to be had from the reduction of high tariffs in the developing world particularly from such countries as brazil india and china in previous rounds developing countries were not big players in the market access talks which has helped to perpetrate the heavy tariff structure in those countries developing countries are leery of opening up their markets to competition often making the ar gument that protec tionist policies have been employed in the development of many successful economies from the european and north american economies in the 19th century to the rise of the east asian tigers in the 20th however as negotiating positions have made clear developed economies w ill demand more access for their i ndustrial products as price for opening up their agricultural sectors where many developing countries have comparative advantagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33176crs17 as in other sectors negotiations on nama have been conducted on the basis of the july 2004 framework agreement which provided the basis on which to conduct negotiations on modalities although many usef ul discussions have taken place final agreement on nama modalities was not reached in time for the hong kong ministerial at the ministerial wto members agreed on new deadline of april 30 2006 to achieve final negotiating moda lities and to establish draft schedules based on these modalities by july 31 2006 major negotiating issues tariff reduction the hong kong ministeria l declaration endorsed the use of nonlinear swiss style tariff reduction formula this builds on july 2004 framework agreements endorsement of nonlinear formula applied on lineby line basis as modality to conduct tariff reduction negotiations nonlinear formula works to even out or harmonize tariff vels between participants this type of formula would result in greater percentage reduction of higher tariffs than lower ones resulting in greater equalization of tariffs at lower level than before the swiss formula is t atat where t the resulting tariff rate is obtained by dividing the product of the coefficient and the initial tariff rate t by the sum of the coefficient and the initial tariff t selection of the coefficient is key where lower coefficient results in lower resulting tariff t the swiss formula also works to reduce tariff peaks and tariff escalation another stated goal of the declaration tariff peaks are c onsidered to be tariff rates above 15 that often protect sensitive products from competition tariff escalation is the practice of increasing tariffs as valu is added to commodity as an example of tariff escalation cotton would come in w ith low tariff fabric would face higher tariff and finished shirt would face the highest tariff tariff escalation is often employed to protect importcompeting valueadding industry the emphasis on tariff peaks and escalation results from findi ngs that the use of peak tariffs and escalations are particularly levied against the products of developing countries as well as adding to the costs of consumer s in developed countries the framework does not specify an implementation period for tariff cuts but developing countries are to be afforded long er implementation periods although the ministerial agreed to swiss formula it did not agree on the coefficients that would finalize the negotiating modalities currently two swiss formula proposals are on the table in geneva the first option proposed by developed countries is the simple swiss formula with the coefficient taking one value for developed and another higher value for developing countries for example pakistan proposed that the developed countries ve coefficient of

coefficient of 10 for devel oped countries and dvanced developing countries and 15 for ldcs this proposal has been criticized in the developing world for differentiating between developing count ries which runs counter to current wto practice distinct from the simple swiss formula proposal with multiple coefficients is the proposal put forth by argentina braz il and india known as the abi proposal29 abi also uses the swiss formula but it proposes the coefficien t to be the tariff average of each country thus each country would have its own coefficient abi would not result in tariff harmonization be tween countries because there would not be common coefficient however it woul d result in certain harmonization within each countrys tariff schedule30 tariff binding the framework encourages the continued binding of tariffs and uses bound tariffs as the baseline fo r the reduction formula tariffs are bound when country commits to not to raise th em beyond certain level therefore binding has been seen as the first step in tariff reduction bound tariffs are often significantly higher than applied tariff levels which has led to questions as to the usefulness of reductions from bound rather th an applied rates for its part the eu still seeks cuts from applied rates reductions from applied rates would result in greater cuts to actually applied tariffs however the use of the applied rate may serve as disincentive for c ountries to undertake unilatera l liberalization under this reasoning countries would hesitate to unde rtake unilateral tariff reductions if they knew that multilateral liberalization efforts would use the applied rate that the country had already unilaterally lowered as starting point it may also increase the incentive to raise applied rates prior to negotiation31 under the framework tariff reductions would be calculated from the bound rather than the applied vel under the 2004 framework agreement reductions in unbound tariff lines would be calculated fro m twice the currently applied rate however the ministerial declaration dopts nonlinear mark up approach but did not adopt any particular formula ge nerally such an approach would add certain number of percentage points to the applied rate of the unbound tariff line in order to establish the base rate on wh ich the tariff reduction formula would be applied discussions have ra nged from 530 percentage points as an addition which would generally result in lesser bound rates than under the framework agreement the framework also provided flexibility fo r developing countries who have bound less than 35 of their tariff lines th ey would be exempt from tariff reductionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33176crs19 commitments in the round provided that they bound the remainder of their non agricultural tariff lines at the average tariff for all developing countries special and differential treat ment for developing countries the framework provides several flexibilities known as paragraph 8 flexibilities to developing country members it permits developing c ountries longer periods to implement tariff reductions under the fr amework developing countries may also choose one of the following flexibilities 1 apply less than formula cuts for up to 10 of tariff lines provided that the cuts applied are less than half the formula cuts and that the tariff lines do not exceed 10 of the value of all imports or 2 keep tariff lines unbound or not applying formula cu ts for 5 of tariff lines provided they do not exceed 5 of the value of memb ers imports least developed countries ldcs would not be required to apply form ula cuts nor participate in the sectoral cuts but would undertake to substantia lly increase the level of bound tariffs developedcountry participan ts and others are encouraged to grant ldcs duty free and quota free access to their market s by date to be negotiated in the negotiations since the july fr amework the relationship between the paragraph 8 flexibilities and the formula negotiations have proved controversial certain developed country pr oposals have linked the flexibilities to the value of the coefficient of the tariff reduction formul thus according to this proposal if developing countries want differentiated coefficient th ey would have to give up certain of the paragraph 8 flexibilities however the ministerial declaration reaffirmed the paragraph 8 flexibilities as an integral part of the modalities nontariff barriers the industrial market access talks also encompass negotiations on the reduction of nontariff barriers non tariff barriers include such activities as import licensing quotas and other quantitative import restrictions conformity assessment procedures and technical barriers to trade in the negotiations in geneva members have submitted notifications of ntbs in order to identify examine and categorize them in order to proceed with negotiations the ministerial annex b noted that members were holding bilateral discussions on ntbs and groups of members were discu ssing ntbs by product sectors and by specific ntbs however the ministerial reached agreement on the reduction of ntbs or on the procedures to negotiate such reductions sectoral approaches wto members have agreed to consider the use of sectoral tariff elimination as supplementary modality for the nama negotiations sectoral initiatives such as tariff elimina tion or harmonization permit critical mass of countries representing the preponderance of world trade in an item to agree to eliminate tariffs in that good such an rrangement requires the participation of the major players however because under most favorednation princi ples those tariffs would be eliminated for all countries ev

proponents develop realistic view of what may and may not attract broader support in the group37 the third phase consists of bilateral and plurilateral meetings for technical consultations partly aimed at developing possible standardized questionnaire which administering officials could use in ad investigations in order to reduce costs and increase transparency38 many observers believe that

largest share of trade remedy actions worldwide since the present texts of the trade remedy agreements are highly detailed and were painstakingly negotiated over at least three multilateral trade rounds44 the issues that negotiators are attempting to clarify and improve tend to be quite specific in na ture however much of the discussion seems to be based around few central th emes such as refining methodology for determining injury and existenceextent of dumping or subsidies giving more specific guidance on conduct of reviews nd providing special and differential treatment for

and subsidies margin s could affect both dumpingsubsidies determinations and the level of duties assessed if an affirmative determination is made first prohibition on zeroing is being pushed by the friends of antidumping zeroing is the process in which when calculating dumping margins for targeted merchandise administrative authorities factor in zero rather than negative amount if subgroup of the rchandise is found to have negative dumping margin the friends of antidumping group alleges this practice leads to erroneous findings of dumping as well as inflated dumping margins us use of zeroing is being challenged in wto dispute settlement proceedings on number of fronts45 second the friends of antidumping india and the european union have submitted papers advocating the establishment of mandatory lesser duty rule this proposal would require investigatin g authorities to impose an ad or cv duty lower than the full dumping margin if it is determined that the lesser amount is sufficient to offset the injury or threat thereof suffered by the domestic industry third the friends of antidumping recommend that the antidumping agreement require increased use of p rice undertakings or alterna tive measures negotiated with the exporting country in which the price of the targeted merchandise is increased to eliminate the dumping or the pr oduct is longer exported to the united states some developing countries favor mandatory use of such actions by developed countries in ad investigations involving developing countries us antidumping law already allows such

ldcs and by developing countries with insufficient manufacturing capabilities to authorize the manufacture of generic pharmaceuticals to treat hivaids malaria tuberculosis and other epidemics by th irdcountry producers compul sory licenses have always been authorized by the trips agreement for domestic purposes however the agreement did not account fo r countries without domestic manufacturing capacity the decision will allow such country to source certain ge neric pharmaceuticals from country with manufacturing capacity by issuing compulsory license to that manufacturer although it may be necessary to do so through the host government on the eve of the hong kong ministerial wto members agreed on method to amend the trips agreement to inco rporate the 2003 decision soon after the 2003 decision negotiations bogged down over how to incorporate it into the agreement either to amend the actual text of trips or to incorporate it as an annex and also how to treat the accompanying chairmans statement the united states had sought footnote to the trips ag reement incorporating both documents and had rejected positions that ignore or downplay the chairmans statement the eu tabled proposal to include the decision as an annex but without the chairmans statement several developing countries such as argentin brazil india and south africa sought to amend trips itself base d on the decision also without including the chairmans statement the decision worked out by the general council and approved on december 6 2005 provided for th trips agreement to be amended with the inclusion of an annex and an appendix to trips the chairmans statement was reread at the time of general council appr oval without debate however it does not constitute part of the written decision51 traditional knowledge second issue that is subject to doha round negotiations is the relationship of the trips agreements to the convention on biological diversity and the protection of traditional knowledge and folklore th is negotiation was meant to address concerns by certain developing countri that traditional remedies or genetic materials that are the basics for pharmaceuticals are being patented by companies in developed countries without compensation india together with brazil and other developing countries proposed language fo r the draft ministerial declaration that would commit members to start negotiations to provide greater protection and compensation for genetic materials an d traditional knowledge originating in developing countries the language woul d amend trips to require that patent applicants disclose the country of origin of biological materials and traditional knowledge obtain consent from the country of origin and share the proceeds with the country of origin52 the united states and othe r developed countries generally have opposed commencing nego tiations to amend trips to address this issue and the ministerial declaration did not address this issuehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33176crs27 53 this section was written by danielle langton analyst in international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade division 54 carol cosgrovesacks how to achieve efficient and open collaboration for trade facilitation trade facilitation the challenges for growth and development united nations economic commission for europe new york and geneva 2003trade facilitation53 there is standard definition of trad facilitation in public policy discussions but it can be broadly defined as the simplification harmonization and automation of international trade proce dures and information flows54 within the context of trade negotiations trade facilitation has focu sed on customs procedures such as fees and documentation requi rements but it may also invol ve the environment in which transactions take place including the transparency and professionalism of customs and regulatory environments trade facilitation aims to increase the speed and reduce the cost of trade through more efficient policies and management estimates of potential savings from trade facilitation vary but studies tend to agree that trade facilitation becomes more important in reducing overall costs as trade is further liberalized as international trade flows increase national administrations must cope with increased traffic straining nationa l budgets trade facilitation by increasing efficiency could mitigate this problem small and medium enterprises may benefit from trade facilitation in greater proporti on because they are often priced out of international trade due to relatively high administrative costs for transporting small volumes developing countries have particular interest in trade fac ilitation discussions because they will have to significantly reform their policies and procedures to implement an agreement th reforms are expected to be costly and will require financial nd technical assistance fro m developed countries trade facilitation negotiations there has been ongoing multilateral work on trade facilitation for more than fifty years including in the context of the gatt however trade facilitation did not enter multilateral trade discussions as separate policy issue for negotiation until the singapore wto ministerial in 1996 when it was introduced as one of the socalled singapore issues the other singapore i ssues including government procurement competition and investment policy we re dropped from the doha development agenda dda in the july 2004 framewor k agreement developing countries initially opposed including any of the si ngapore issues in the doha round but accepted trade facilitation because of its potential benefits to development if combined with technical assistance the modalities for trade facilitation include special and differential treatment sd pr ovisions that reach beyond those of other agreements the doha ministerial declaration tablished that negotiations on trade facilitation would take pl ace after members reached decision to begin such negotiations by explicit consensus at the fifth session of the ministerial conference in 2003 in ca ncun mexico according to the doha ministerial declaration the council on trade in goods was to review nd clarify relevanthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33176crs28 aspects of articles v viii and x of gatt 1994 and identify the trade facilitation needs and priorities of member s particularly developing country members the july framework agreement includes modalities but certain key negotiating issues are yet to be resolved since 2004 trade fac ilitation negotiations have reportedly been among the smoothest of the wto negotia ting areas members began to submit proposals to revise the rele vant gatt articles in early 2005 and the trade facilitation negotiating group has compiled these proposals to facilitate textb ased negotiations which have yet to begin developed countries and multilateral institutions have continued to provide technical assistance to developing countries on an ad hoc basis the modalities described in the july 2004 framework agreement cover three core negotiating issues of trade facilitation improving the relevant gatt articles providing technical assistance to deve loping countries and identifying and considering the needs and prio rities of all countries includi ng special and differential treatment sd for developing countri sd has traditionally meant longer implementation periods for veloping countries but the framework goes further to state that the extent and timing of entering into commitments shall be directly related to the capabilities of developing country memb ers also the members agreed in the framework that developing countries will not be required to undertake infrastructure investments beyond their means the framework encourages developed country members to provide technical assistan ce to developing countries but does not provide specifics on how much to spend or specific areas of assistance it also does not specifically state whether negotiations will result in guidelines or binding rules in trade facilitation reviewing and clarifying the gatt 1994 articles v v iii and x is major focus of the negotiations each of these articles concern different aspects of trade facilitation and they were in itially agreed to prior to the formation of the wto article v describes the rights of goods passing through territory between countries article viii requires efficient and fair fees for moving g oods in and out of countries article x requires transparent trade regulations and the equal enforcement of these regulations including judicial review process wto members have submitted proposals for strengthening these articles and their proposals will form the basis for textbased negotiations to take place so metime after the hong kong ministerial negotiating issues in trade facilitation an agreement on trade facilitation may not be as straightforward as it appears from the modalities in the july 2004 framework agreement trade fac ilitation may include behind the border measures to tackle corrupti on and other administrative issues and these measures are interrelated with other effi ciencyenhancing measures beyond trade facilitation in developing countries agreeing on reforms for trade facilitation may require discussions that go beyond the traditiona l realm of trade negotiations trade facilitation measures may requi re passing new legislati on amending existing laws or establishing new domestic institutions it may be difficult for trade negotiators to agree to such measures which will have significant costs and may not be possible without technical assistan ce from developed countries the potential cost of trade facilitation measures is daunting for many developing countries costs vary by country depending on the degree of change needed and are difficult to estimate the poorest countri may require the greatest change tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33176crs29 implement trade facilitation measures and are the least able to afford the costs of such change it is also not known how much must be spent on trade facilitation to begin to realize its benefits and this amount is likely to vary by country trade facilitation may entail costs in the follo wing areas new regulation institutional changes training equipment and infrastructure the question of who will pay the potentially high costs of trade facilitation has not yet been fully answered the july 2004 framework agreement states that veloped countries should provide support to developing countries to implement trad facilitation measures and that developing countries will not be require d to implement trade facilita tion measures that they do not have the means to implement the agreement explicitly discusses the costs relating to infrastructure inve stments but is not as exp licit about other significant costs of trade facilitation measures unlike in other negotiating areas technical assistance is an integral component of the trade facilitation negotiations technical assistance is important to trade facilitation negotiations because of th potentially high costs and capacity requirements for implementa tion one of the main sticking points in technical assistance for trade facilitation is chicken and egg problem before committing to any binding agreement developing c ountries would like developed countries to provide detailed technical ssistance plans conversely many developed countries insist on seeing more conc rete commitments from developi ng countries before they will provide details about plan s for technical assistance there are other issues that may arise within the discussions on techni cal assistance there are concerns about coordination of technical assistance activities and integration into general development strategies veloping countries would pr efer more comprehensive integrated approach but it is easier for developed countries to provide oneoff activities wit hout significant c oordination there is also concern about how countrys capacity to implement trade f acilitation measures w ill be determined allowing countries to assess their own capabilities could present problems if they argue lack of sufficient capacity in order to avoid trade facilitation obligations meanwhile many countries would likely ba lk at delegating that authority to committee or other entity finally there is consensus on whether an agreement on trade facilitation would result in rules subject to wto dis pute resolution or whether an agreement would merely comprise guidelines for be st practices annex of the hong kong ministerial declaration has language that intimates negotiated commitments are final goal of trade facilitation negotiations but there is outright agreement on this developing countries prefer not to be s ubject to binding trade facilitation rules but the united states and other veloped countries be lieve that rulesbased agreement would be most effective to ensure that measures are implemented however some experts observe that outside pressure from binding obligations will have tangible impact if developing countries lack the capacity implement the obligations insofar as technical assistance provided during the negotiations may increase the capacity of developing countries to take on trade f acilitation obligations it may also have positive effect on the willingness of developing c ountries to consider binding commitments technical assistance has alr eady had an impact on developing country attitudes toward trade facilita tion because as developing countries implement trade facilitation measures they become more aw are of the potential benefits of trade facilitation agreementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33176crs30 55 this section was written by danielle langton analyst in international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade divisionoutcome of hong kong after the hong kong ministerial trade facilitation is still considered negotiating area that is prog ressing relatively smoothly although it appears that the main work of the negotiating group on trade facilitation reviewing proposals submitted on improving the relevant gatt articles is moving slowly major breakthroughs in trade facilitation were announced in hong kong the ministerial served as review of progress and disc ussion of plans for future work including further review of proposals to improve the relevant gatt articles provision of technical assistance and c onsideration of individual c ountry trade facilitation needs the negotiators did not agree on date for beginning textbased negotiations but the trade facilitation negotiating gr oups report discusses the need to move into focused drafting mode soon after the ministerial in order to conclude the negotiations in time the report by the negotiating gr oup on trade facilitation to the trade negotiating committee summarizes the work accomplished thus far and what remains to be done and it incl udes list of the proposals that have been tabled the report is included as annex to the ministerial text special and differential treatment55 through special and differe ntial treatment sd veloping countries are allowed favorable treatment in the negotiations and flexibility in implementing wto agreements this flexibility usually takes the form of longer implementation periods but may also include partia l implementation such as re ducing tariffs to lesser degree than developed countries special treatment may include preferential market access and technical assistance for negotiating and implementing agreements sd is negotiated within each of the specific negotiating areas such as agriculture and services but also within special session of the committee on trade development ctd sd is based upon two main premises firs t to assist developing countries transition into the global trading system and second to allow developing countries to maintain trade policies s upportive of their development strategies some experts question whether sd is beneficial for velopment at all economists point out that developing countries gain the most from trade negotiations in liberalizing their own markets and sd is often used to void liberalization on the other hand trade liberalization is known to redistribute inco among different sectors in country and while the net effect may be positive fo r economic growth some segments of the population may suffer significant hardshi p sd may help reduce the hardship resulting from trade liberalization in veloping countries and thus promote development friendly outcomes there is official list of developing c ountries that are eligible for sd with the exception of least devel oped countries ldcs ldc status is based upon income and determined by the united nations and ldcs may receive further preferentialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33176crs31 treatment in wto agreements aside from ldcs developing countries in the wto are selfidentified and they are all eligible for the same sd provisions most developed country wto memb ers favor differentiating veloping countries into multiple tiers because developing countri vary widely in their income and development levels as an example br azil and south africa are currently eligible for the same sd provisions as lower income developing countries such as nicaragua and ghana developed countries argue that they could make sd provisions deeper and more meaningful for developing countries if there were multiple tiers of sd provisions devel oping countries however are reluctant to consider that option the lower income developing countries reportedly do not want to lose the negotiating leve rage gained from being grouped with the higher income countries and the higher income countries do not want to risk losing eligibility for sd provisions sd negotiations in the doha round prior to the doha ministerial wto member countries criticized the overly general and ineffective app lication of sd provisions contained in the uruguay round in response the doha minister ial declaration manda ted that all sd provisions should be reviewed with view to strengthening them and making them more precise effective and operational the ctd was tasked with fulfilling the doha mandate on sd as the discussions progressed significant divisions between developing and developed countries on sd became clear one important point of divergence has been whether to negotiate the crosscutting issue of establishing multiple tiers of sd provisions for countries at different development levels the developing c ountries ve held that sd discussions should focus entirely on agreementspecific sd proposals while veloped countries maintain that the crosscutting issues are important the july 2004 framework agreement dealt with this divide by instructing the ctd to complete the review of all outstanding agreementspecific proposals mandated by th doha declaration and to address all other outstanding work including on the crosscutting issues it further instructed the ctd to issue report to the gene ral council with recommendations for decision by july 2005 deadline that was not met in order to move beyond the deadlock on sd members agreed to prioritize the five agreementspecifi c proposals pertaining specifically to ldcs in preparation for hong kong of these proposals the most controversial b ecame key accomplishment of the hong kong minist erial developed count ry members agreed to provide duty free and quota free mark et access for products originating from ldcs this agreement is detailed in annex f of the hong kong ministerial declaration duty and quotafree access is to be granted by ll developed countries for all products originating from all ldcs beginning in 2008 or at the start of the implementation period of completed doha round agreem ent member developed countries with sensitivities may designate at most three pe rcent of tariff lines to be excluded from this duty and quotafree access initially but they agree to take steps to expand the list of eligible products over time to 100 developing country members in position to do so are also expected to allow duty and quota free access to products originating from ldcs so observers have commented that the language on exclusions may lead to c onflict between us industries over which goods w ould be excluded three percent of ta riff lines is equal to about 300

to products from ldcs four other ldc proposals were agreed upon in hong kong the other four proposals were 1 to require th general council to respond within 60 days to requests from nonldcs for waivers to imp lement measures in favor of ldcs 2 to exempt ldcs from certain obligati ons under the agreement on traderelated investment measures trims 3 to link ldc obligations generally with their capacity to implement the obligations and 4 to urge bilateral and multilateral donors to ensure that conditions for assist ance to ldcs are consistent with their rights and obligations under the wto implementation issues developing countries also have concerns about the implementation of commitments made during the uruguay round of wto negotiations some of these issues were resolved at the doha ministerial but many issues remain outstanding developing countries have soug ht implementation of agreements in way that is benefici to them and does not cause them undue hardship in many cases the agreement language does not specify the treatment of developing countries and the actual imp lementation of the agreement has been contrary to developing country expectati ons implementation i ssues are found within wide variety of negotiating areas and are dealt with primarily by the committee responsible for the relevant negotiating area outstanding implementation issues are found in the area of market access investment measures safeguards rules of origin and subsidies and counterva iling measures among others the hong kong ministerial declaration reite rates previous instructions adopted in august 2004 and instructs the negotiating bodies and others to redouble their efforts to find solutions to implementation issues deadline of july 31 2006 was given for the general council to review

of wto agreement or whether tc b should simply be encouraged in the agreement dispute settlement58 the wto understanding on rules and procedures for the settlement of disputes dispute settlement understandi ng or dsu which entered into force january 1 1995 with the uruguay round pack age of agreements provides the legal basis for dispute resolution under virtually all wto agreements and is the primary means of enforcing wto obligations the dsu introduced significant new elements into existing gatt dispute settlement practice intended to strengthen the system and facilitate compliance with dispute settlement results in particular the dsu makes the establishment of panel the adopti on of panel and appella reports and the authorization of requests to retaliate virtually automatic and adds right to appellate review of panel reports on issues of w and legal interpretation its system of deadlines and timelines expedites proceedings at various stages of the process seeks to ensure that compliance with adverse panel reports is achieved if not immediately within reasonable period of time and allows disputing parties to exercise their rights under the dsu by defined dates ce rtain unilateral actions in trade disputes involving wto agreements such as spending wto concessions or other obligations without multilatera l authorization are prohib ited the system has been heavily used the wto secretariat repor ting 335 complaints filed between january 1 1995 and november 21 2005 r oughly half involve the united states either as complainant or defendant current dispute settlement negotiations which are taking place in the special session of the wto dispute settlement body dsbss are an extension of talks begun under uruguay round ministerial d eclaration that called on wto members to complete full review of dispute settleme nt rules and procedures within four years after the wto agreement entered into force and to decide at the first wto ministerial meeting held after completion in effect the 3rd ministerial conference held in seattle in late 1998 whether to continue modify or terminate them while there was much discussion of possible revisions and draft text containing amendments to the dsu was circulated at the seattle ministerial consensus could not be reached at that time decisi ons on reforms were taken by wto members subsequent to the seattle meeting and the future of the review remained unclear until wto members agreed at the doha nisterial meeting in november 2001 to continue negotiations on impr ovements and clarifications of the dsu with the aim of reaching agreement by the end of may 2003 and bringing the results into force as soon as possible thereafter further di spute settlement nego tiations would not behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33176crs34 conducted concluded or their results brought into force as part of the single undertaking planned for doha negotiations as whole in the absence of probable consensus by the may 2003 deadline the outgoing chairman of the ssdsb peter balás hungary drafted chairmans text of proposed amendments to the dsu dated may 28 2003 in which he incorporated numerous proposals including those involvi ng consultation pro cedures thirdparty rights procedures for terminating panels before they complete their work remand authority for the appellate b ody sequencing of requests fo r authorization to retaliate with requests for compliance pa nels procedures for terminating retaliatory measures awards for litigation costs and special provisions for developing countries action was taken on the document and in july 2003 the wto general council extended the talks until may 31 2004 with additional proposals submitted but little progress by the new date the wto ge neral council agreed in the august 2004 doha work program that work in the dispute settlement negotiations would continue on the basis set out by the new dsbss chai rman david spencer australia in his june 2004 report to the wto trade negotia tions committee the report stated that there was agreement among members that the special session needs more time to complete its work on the understanding that all existing proposals would remain under consideration and bearing in mind that these negotiations are outside the single undertaking in addition the chairman di d not recommend specific target date for completion noting however that one might be considered later among specific concerns unde r the dsu is the issue of sequencing originally identified during the implementation phase of the useuropean communities ec banana dispute the problem results from the gap caused by the failure of the dsu to integrate article 215 wh ich provides that disagreements over the existence or adequacy of compliance measures are to be decided by recourse to dsu procedures with the processes and deadlines of artic 22 which permits th prevailing party in dispute to request authorization to retaliate within 30 days after the compliance period ends if the defending party has not complied with its obligations by that time the ec argued that full compliance pro ceeding including consultations was called for the united states argued that give n the 30day deadline for retaliation requests it would lose its right to request authorization to retaliate if it waited for compliance panel to complete its work while sequencing remains an issue in the negotiations parties to disputes have resolved existing difficulties by entering into ad hoc bilateral agreements in specific disputes under which for example the complaining party requests both the establishment of compliance panel and authorization to retaliate the defending party objects to the level of retaliation proposed an action that automatically sends the request to arbitration and the arbitration is suspended pending completion of the compliance panel pr ocess including any appeal another casebased problem arose with the enactment of us carousel legislation in may 2000 under which the ustr is required periodi cally to rotate lists of items subject to authorized trade retaliation unless certain exceptions apply the legislation in large part reaction to the ecs failure to comply with the wto decision faulting the ecs prohibition on hormonetreated beef the ec argued that changing list would be unilateral action not authorized under the dsu along with the issues just described the negotiations have taken up broad range of other topics with over 50 wo rking documents publicly circulated byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33176crs35 members and other informal proposals and compilations made dur ing the course of the talks the united states has generally sought increased transparency and access to the process through open meetings timely access to sub missions and final reports and guidelines for amicus briefs it has also proposed shorter time fra mes in tandem with clarifying the sequencing issue and has called for steps that would give members more control over the process ch as requiring the wto appellate body to issue interim reports for comment by disputing parties allowing the deletion from an appellate report upon agreement by the di sputing parties of findings that they view as not necessary or helpful to resolvin g the dispute and giving parties the right to mutually suspend panel and appellate proceedings to allow them to work on solution to the case in october 2005 th united states also suggested draft parameters concerning both the use of public international law in wto dispute settlement and the proper interpretive approach for use in disputes its proposed interpretive guidelines are aimed at ensu ring that wto adjudicative bodies neither supplement nor reduce the rights and obligations of wto members under wto agreements and among other things descri be types of gapfilling that should only be addressed through negotiations including panels reading right or obligation into the text of an agreement by for example extrapolating from different agreement provision the ec has proposed among other th ings permanent panelists remand authority for the appellate body prohi bition on carousel reta liation enhancing the availability of compensation before resort to retalia tion and formalized way to terminate multilateral authorization to retaliate japan has sought inter alia greater enforcement options and larger appellate body membership canada has proposed procedures to protect business confidentia l information and the creation of panel roster the ec japan and canada ve also proposed varying degrees of transparency in dispute proceedings proposals by developing country members generally reflect members lower level of capacity and desire to have developing country interests reflected to greater degree in panel and ppellate reports and dispute proceedings as w hole these members have proposed among other things extended timelines in cases in which they are involved including extensions for consultations brief filing and the implementation of adverse results provisions to ensure that developing country panelis t is included in all panels in which developing country is disputant and th possible authorization of collective wto retaliation where developi ng or lessdeveloped count ry ldc member is successful complainant they have also pr oposed ways of dealing with financial and human resource limitations in disputes including increased technical resources for developing countries and the awarding of litigation costs to developing country member that has prevailed in case veloping countries have been critical of some transparency propos als such as allowing nonmembers to sub mit amicus briefs to panels on the ground that nonmember pa rticipation in disputes would undermine the intergovernmental character of the dispute settlement process and that added requirements that might be placed on members such as responding to amicus briefs within prescribed timeframes would be particularly burdensome to developing countries while developed country members submitted re vised proposals

november 25 2005 report to the trade negotiations committee chairman spencer communicated that over th past 18 months of negotiations there had not been consensus of the sort needed to establish foundation for an agreement instead he noted the work of the sp ecial session has been based primarily on initiatives by members to work among themselves in an effort to develop areas of convergence

of convergence so as to lay the basis for final agreement to improve and clarify the dsu reflecting language originally suggested by the special session chairman the hong kong minist erial declaration takes note of the progress made in the dispute settlement talks so far and directs the dsbss to work towards rapid conclusion of the negotiations because the hong kong declaration reaffirms the decisions and d eclarations adopted at doha and takes into account the general council decision of august 2004 dispute settle ment negotiations will continue on their separate tr ack with results to be adopt ed separately from any doha single act environment and trade59 in general environmental issues were not major focus at the hong kong ministerial meeting given the predominance of other priority issues however the elements of the environmental paragraphs in the doha declara tion were discussed in the ministerial declaration which r ecognized work undertaken in the committee on trade and environment and urged tinued work on the environmental issues identified in the doha document when the wto was established in the 1994 marrakech agreement environment was prominent and often controversial i ssue issues related to environment and trade were closely linke d in 1994 to the somewhat amorphous need for sustainable development nd in april 1994 decision on trade and environment accompanied the marrakech acco rds stating there should not be nor need be any policy contradiction be tween upholding and safeguarding an open nondiscriminatory and equita ble multilateral trading system on the one hand and acting for the protection of the environm ent and the promotion of sustainable development on the other the issue was resolved in 1994 with the establishment of the committee on trade and environment cte which has been meeting ever since on regular basis to id entify the relevant issues httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33176crs37 60 paragraph 32 outlines instructions for

wide agreement that when all parties ar parties to an mea the mea rules should apply complications develop when possible di spute might arise between parties and non parties to an mea discussi ons continue on this and othe r technical legal points the ministerial declaration issued after the hong kong meeting reaffirms the paragraph 31 doha mandate imed at enhancing the mutu supportiveness of trade and environment and calls upon members to intensify negotiations on all matters listed in the paragraph it recognizes th progress that has been made in the cte on the relationship of wto rules to mea trade obligations and the work undertaken toward interorganization information exchange it also recognizes recent work undertaken under paragraph 31 iii through numerous submissions by members and discussions in special sessions of the cte and in technical discussions and instructs members to complete work expe ditiously under that paragraph in addition the declaration in annex d as it addresses rule s negotiations notes that broad agreement exists that the negotiating group on rules should strengthen disciplines on subsidies in the fisheries sector including prohibiting certain forms of subsidies that contribute to overcapacity and overfishing it calls on participants to undertake further detailed work to inter alia establish the nature and extent of those disciplines including transparency and enfo rceability the declaration also states that appropriate and effective special nd differential treatment of developed and lessdeveloped country member s should be an integral part of these negotiations taking into account the importance of this sector to developmen t priorities poverty reduction and livelihood and f ood security concerns finally the declaration in addressing negotiations on nonagricultural market access nama notes that limited discussion has been held in the nama negotiating group regarding nvironmental goods since july 2004 but that the ctehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33176crs38 has undertaken substantial work on the issue during this period it further states that close coordination between th two negotiating groups would be needed in
