congress crs2 hong kongs economy is heavily dependent on trade3 in 2004 hong kongs merchandise exports and imports were 259 billion and 271 billion respectively large share of hong kongs trade consists of entrepot and processing trade much of it involving china4 about 30 of chinas trade passes through hong kong taiwan which does not maintain direct commercial links with china ships most of its exports to and imports from china via hong kong large share of chinas exports also pass through hong kong before being reexported to other destinations some of this trade consists of products made by hong kong firms in the mainland which are sent to hong kong for further processing before being reexported elsewhere hong kong has transferred large share of its manufacturing base to the mainland in the pearl river delta region guangdong province china 50000 hong kong firms employ about 6 million chinese workers 20 times the size of hong kongs manufacturing workforce as result the importance of manufacturing to hong kongs economy has diminished in recent years while that of services especially those relating to trade such as banking and financial services has increased sharply in 2004 services exports and imports were estimated to total 65 billion and 36 billion respectively recent economic challenges hong kong has enjoyed relatively healthy growth over the past several years however in 1997 hong kongs economy was hit by the asian financial crisis beginning in july 1997 speculative pressures on the hong kong dollar which has been pegged to the us dollar since 1983 caused the hong kong monetary authority hkma to spend 1 billion to prop up the currency these pressures continued leading the hkma in october 1997 to raise interest rates to stop capital flight which subsequently led to nearly onequarter drop in the hong kong stock market the hang seng index over fourday period in late august 1998 the hong kong government intervened in the stock markets decline by spending 15 billion to purchase shares from 33 bluechip companies that make up the hang seng index which helped raise the value of the shares by 24 several analysts criticized the governments intervention arguing that it violated hong kongs free market principles by increasing the governments role over the economy the hong kong government maintained that its intervention was onetime event intended to halt speculation and stabilize the stock market5 the effects of the asian economic crisis on hong kong were significant the economy fell into major recession in 1998 real gdp fell by 50 the unemployment rate rose from 22 to 47 and exports and imports declined sharply the hong kong economy recovered somewhat in 1999 and 2000 but was negatively affected by the terrorist attacks against the united states in 2001 and by the outbreak and spread of new and deadly virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2003 hong kong was one of the areas hardest hit areas by sars which drastically reduced tourism and domestic demand by the end of june 2003 the unemployment rate rose to record high 3 according the hong kong trade development council hong kong is currently the worlds eleventhlargest trading economy and the tenthlargest exporter of services 4 in 2004 94 of hong kongs exports were reexports ie products that were imported into hong kong and reshipped elsewhere 5 in 1999 the hong kong government began to divest itself of many of these shares crs3 87 hong kongs economy picked up sharply in 2004 due to rising exports and strong domestic demand real gdp grew by an estimated 77 however unemployment remained stubbornly high see table 1 table 1 selected economic data for hong kong 19972004 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 annual real gdp 51 50 34 102 06 20

twodigit level source us commerce department date for 2004 estimated based on actual data for jannov 2004 the united states continues to treat hong kong as separate economic territory for such purposes as trade data and export controls us officials continue to work with hong kong officials to ensure that hong kong is not used by china to illegally circumvent us controls on exports of dualuse and other high technology products and to combat violations of us intellectual property rights ipr in hong kong7 export controls the united states seeks to control exports of dualuse technologies for variety of national security and foreign policy purposes through complex regulatory system of export license requirements despite the reversion of hong kong to chinese sovereignty the united states continues to treat hong kong separately from the mainland for export control purposes ie controls of us exports of dualuse items to hong kong are far less restrictive than those to china some members of congress have raised concern that china may be using hong kong to acquire dualuse items that cannot be obtained directly from the united states and have called for tighter controls on us exports to hong kong 7 us and hong kong officials also cooperate on variety of other matters such as terrorism alien smuggling moneylaundering counterfeiting organized crime and drug trafficking crs5 the united stateshong kong policy act of 1992 pl 102383 requires the us state department to report periodically to congress on conditions in hong kong and its relations with the united states including cooperation in the area of export controls in its most recent report april 2004 the state department stated that hong kong maintains an effective highly autonomous and transparent export control regime that the us government has encouraged others to emulate however the report stated that the growing economic integration between china and hong kong has presented new challenges to ensure effective compliance with export control regimes and noted that over the past two years inspections have uncovered an increase in instances of illegal re exports of us dualuse technology to china hong kong and us officials have agreed to boost cooperation on the sharing of licensing and enforcement information and to education the hong kong public of export control laws8 ipr protection over the past few years the united states has pressed hong kong to improve its ipr protection regime from april 1997 to february 1999 hong kong was designated by us trade representative ustr under special 301 provision of us trade law dealing with countries that violate us ipr as watch list country due to the widespread distribution and retail sale in hong kong of pirated compact discs9 hong kong was removed from the special 301 watch list after the ustr determined that hong kong had made significant improvements to its legal regime and enforcement efforts the 2001 and 2002 special 301 reports listed hong kong as one of several trading partners in which progress in protection of ipr had been made the ustrs 2003 ipr report praised the hong kong government for requiring government agencies to use only legitimate software and for its commitment to halt optical media piracy the 2003 state department report stated that hong kong had shut down virtually all largescale illicit manufacturing lines but noted deficiencies in two areas commercial enduse piracy and patent projection for pharmaceuticals10 hong kongs economic future several international economic forecasting organizations contend that the longterm prospects for hong kongs economic future remain relatively positive provided that it continues to employ free trade marketoriented policies and maintains its autonomy from mainland china11 the economist intelligence unit projects that hong kongs economy 8 us department of state united states hong kong policy act report apr 1 2004 p 7 9 under the special 301 provisions the ustr annually issues threetier list of countries judged to have inadequate regimes for ipr protection or that deny market access priority foreign countries considered the worst violators of us ipr and are subject to possible us trade sanctions priority watch list countries considered to have serious deficiencies in their ipr regime but do yet warrant trade sanctions and watch list countries identified because they maintain ipr practices of particular concern but do not yet warrant higherlevel designations 10 us department of state united states hong kong policy act report apr 1 2004p 6 11 major area of contention concerning hong kongs autonomy arose in july 2003 when the government tried to pass an antisedition law known as article 23 proposals which many continued crs6 will grow by 47 in 2005 and 36 in 2005 while global insight projects real gdp growth at 49 and 44 respectively12 chinas accession to the wto which occurred in december 2001 poses both opportunities and challenges to hong kongs economy on the one hand the removal of trade and investment barriers by china will likely significantly boost hong kong trade with and investment in the mainland hong kong is already by far the largest investor in china and china is the largest investor in hong kong and hence is likely to be in the best position to take advantage of more open chinese market in addition chinas wto accession is expected to sharply increase its trade flows and much of that increased trade will likely take place via hong kong13 on the other hand more open chinese market could diminish hong kongs role as middleman for foreign firms wanting to do business with the mainland especially if foreign investors believe that the rule of law rather than connections will be the primary factor governing business relations in china hong kongs economy could also be negatively affected if china and taiwan decide to establish direct trade links which would likely reduce the level of trade that takes place via hong kong14 11 continued critics contended was being pushed by beijing in order to undermine civil liberties in hong kong the relative secretness of the contents of the bill and concerns over number of other political and economic issues sparked massive demonstration in hong kong on july 1 2003 with an estimated half million participants forcing the government to withdraw the bill second major autonomy issue arose in april 2004 after the chinese government declared that political reforms in hong kong would have to meet beijings approval see crs

restrictions on mainland residents wanting to visit hong kong which has helped to boost hong kongs tourism industry in 2003 more than half of all tourists visiting hong kong were from the mainland 14 taiwan joined the wto in january 2002 wto rules may require taiwan to end its ban on direct trade links with the mainland for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20786
