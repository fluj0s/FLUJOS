medical insurance program covers broad range of complementary medical services including physician laboratory outpatient hospital services and durable medical equipment part c provides private plan options for beneficiaries enrolled in both parts and b the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma added part d to medicare which provided new outpatient prescription drug benefit starting january 1 2006 medicare has established specific rules for payment of covered benefits under parts b and c some such as physician services and most durable medical equipment are based on fee schedules some payments are based in part on providers bid an estimate of the cost of providing service relative to benchmark the maximum amount medicare is willing to pay bids and benchmarks are used to determine paymen ts in medicare part c some items of durable medical equipment in specified locations are to be based on competitive bidding in 2009 many services however including inpatient and outpatient hospital care are paid under different prospective payment systems ppss in general the program provides for annual updates to these payment amounts the program also has rules regarding the amount of cost sharing if any which beneficiaries can be billed in excess of medicares recognized payment levels unlike other services medicares outpatient prescription drug benefit can be obtained only through private plans further while all part d plans must meet certain minimum requirements they differ in terms of benefit design formulary drugs and costsharing amounts medicare payment policies and potential changes to these policies are of continuing interest to congress the medicare program has been major focus of deficit reduction legislation since 1980 with certain exceptions reductions in program spending have been achieved largely through regulating payments to providers primarily hospitals and physicians the balanced budget act of 1997 pl 10533 bba 97 modified some existing payment policies including changing underlying payment methodologies and updates to payment amounts subsequent legislation increased medicare funding to mitigate the financial impact of some bba 97 provisions mma too modified payment methods and established payment increases for some providers most recently the tax relief and health care act of 2006 pl 109432 the medicare medicaid and schip extension act of 2007 pl 110173 or mmsea and the medicare improvements for patients and providers act of 2008 pl 110275 or mippa have affected medicares payments this report

medicare beneficiary is composed of two parts program payment amount from medicare plus any beneficiary costsharing amount that is required 1 the required beneficiary outofpocket payment may be paid by other insurance if any medicare has established specific rules governing its program payments for all covered services as well as beneficiary cost sharing as described below g15g142g141g146g140g138g155g142g561g18g138g162g150g142g151g157g561g20g158g149g142g156g561 medicare has established specific rules governing payment for covered services under parts b and c2 for example the program pays for most acute inpatient and outpatient hospital services skilled nursing facility services and home health care under prospective payment system pps established for the particular service under pps predetermined rate is paid for each unit of service such as hospital discharge or payment classification group payments for physician services clinical laboratory services and certain durable medical equipment are made on the basis of fee schedules 3 certain other services are paid on the basis of reasonable costs or reasonable charges in general the program provides for annual updates of the payment amounts 1 not all services require cost sharing from beneficiary for instance clinical laboratory services and home health services under parts and b of medicare do not require payments from beneficiary or beneficiarys insurance such as medicare supplemental insurance medigap medicaid or employersponsored retiree health insurance cost sharing requirements under part c plans may differ from those under parts and b for the same service 2 outpatient prescription drugs covered under part d are not subject to medicare payment rules prices are determined through negotiation between prescription drug plans pdps or medicare advantage prescription drug mapd plans and drug manufacturers the secretary of health and human services is statutorily prohibited from intervening in part d drug price negotiations 3 the mma required the secretary to establish and implement competitive bidding program for durable medical equipment the program would pay for certain durable medical equipment prosthetics and orthotics based on the bids of qualified suppliers in designated areas the program was to be phased in beginning in 2007 the proposed rule for the program was published in the federal register on may 1 2006 two final rules were published in the federal register on august 18 2006 and april 10 2007 the first round of bidding closed on september 25 2007 and the competitive bidding program started july 1 2008 however mippa stopped the program terminated all contracts with suppliers and required the secretary to rebid the first round in 2009 expansion of the program was delayed by two years until 2011 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30526g15g142g141g146g140g138g155g142g561g18g138g162g150g142g151g157g561g18g152g149g146g140g146g142g156g561 g561

linked to the consumer price index for all urban consumers cpiu or to pr oviderspecific market basket mb index which measures the change in the price of goods and services purchased by the provider to produce unit of output g4g142g151g142g143g146g140g146g138g155g162g561g17g158g157g556g152g143g556g18g152g140g148g142g157g561g18g138g162g150g142g151g157g156g561 there are two aspects of beneficiary payments to providers required costsharing amounts either coinsurance copayments or deductibles and the amounts that beneficiaries may be billed over and above medicares recognized payment amounts for certain services for part coinsurance and deductible amounts are established annually these payments include deductibles and coinsurance for hospital services coinsurance for snfs cost sharing for home health services and nominal cost sharing for hospice care4 for part b beneficiaries are generally responsible for premiums which are incomeadjusted starting in 2007 135 deductible in 2008 updated annually by the increase in the part b premium and coinsurance payment of 20 of the established medicare payment amounts5 for part c cost sharing is determined by the private health care plans through 2005 the total of premiums6 for basic medicare benefits and cost sharing deductibles coinsurance and copayments charged to part c enrollee could not exceed actuarially determined levels of cost sharing for those same benefits under original medicare this meant that plans could not charge premium for medicarecovered benefits without reducing costsharing amounts beginning in 2006 the constraint on plans ability to charge premium for basic medicare benefits was lifted the bidding mechanism established by the mma allows plans to charge premium to cover basic medicare benefits if the costs to the plan exceed the maximum amount cms is willing to pay for medicarecovered benefits the mma eliminated the explicit inverse relationship between cost sharing for basic medicare benefits and premium for basic medicare benefits enrollee cost sharing under part c is now only constrained by the actuarial value of cost sharing under original medicare however also beginning in 2006 the secretary has expanded authority to negotiate or reject bid from managed care organization in order to ensure that the bid reasonably reflects the plans revenue requirements part d cost sharing includes deductible copayments and catastrophic limits on outofpocket spending 7 4in 2008 for each spell of illness beneficiary deductible is 1024 to cover day 1 through 60 in hospital the daily coinsurance charge is 256 for each day from 61 through 90 after 90 days in the hospital beneficiary may draw down 60 lifetime reserve days with daily coinsurance of 512 in 2008 in 2009 beneficiary deductible is 1068 for day 1 through 60 in the hospital the daily coinsurance charge is 267 for each day from 61 through 90 the coinsurance for the 60 lifetime reserve days is 534 per day 5 the part b premium will remain at the 2008 level for 2009 generally part b premiums are set to cover 25 of the costs of the part b program although the part b program costs are expected to increase for 2009 part b contingency reserves were drawn down in order to hold the premiums at the 2008 level however beneficiaries subject to incomeadjusted premiums will see an increase in their 2009 part b premium because 2009 is the first year such enrollees will pay the full amount of the incomerelated premium the part b deductible which is indexed to the annual percentage increase in the part b actuarial rate for aged beneficiaries will remain the same in 2009 6 through 2005 managed care plans had the option to charge premium for basic part and b medicare benefits only if the value of cost sharing for basic benefits was reduced by the same amount if plan chose to offer supplemental benefits not covered under original medicare the plan could charge supplemental premium equal to the actuarial value of supplemental benefits the value of the supplemental premium was not constrained by costsharing levels for basic medicare benefits all beneficiaries in part c and original medicare are required to pay part b premium unless the part c plan paysdown the value of the part b premium as part of supplemental benefit 7 for description of part d cost sharing see crs report rl34280 medicare part d

billed over and above medicares recognized payment amounts under part providers agree to accept medicares payment as payment in full and cannot bill beneficiaries amounts in excess of the coinsurance and deductibles under part b most providers and practitioners are subject to limits on amounts they can bill beneficiaries for covered services for example physicians and some other practitioners may choose whether or not to accept assignment on claim when physician accepts assignment medicare pays the physician 80 of the approved fee schedule amount the physician can only bill the beneficiary the 20 coinsurance plus any unmet deductible when physician agrees to accept assignment of all medicare claims in given year the physician is referred to as participating physician physicians who do not agree to accept assignment on all medicare claims in given year are referred to as nonparticipating physicians nonparticipating physicians may or may not accept assignment for given service if they do not they may charge beneficiaries more than the fee schedule amount on nonassigned claims for physicians these balance billing charges are subject to certain limits for some providers such as nurse practitioners physician assistants and clinical laboratories assignment is mandatory these providers can only bill the beneficiary the 20 coinsurance and any unmet deductible for other part b services such as durable medical equipment assignment is optional providers may bill beneficiaries for amounts above medicares recognized payment level and may do so without limit

focus of deficit reduction legislation considered by congress in recent years with few exceptions reductions in program spending have been achieved largely through reductions in payments to providers primarily hospitals and physicians that together represent about half of total program payments most recently medicares payments to managed care organizations were subject to congressional scrutiny regardless of which provider payments may be targeted past reductions stemmed but did not eliminate yeartoyear payment increases or overall program growth the balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 pl 10533 achieved significant savings to the medicare program by slowing the rate of grow th in payments to providers and by enacting structural changes to the program number of health care provider groups stated that actual medicare benefit payment reductions resulting from bba 97 were larger than were intended leading to facility closings and other limits on beneficiary access to care in november 1999 congress passed package of funding increases to mitigate the impact of some bba 97 provisions on providers this measure the dicare medicaid and schip balanced budget refinement act of 1999 bbra is part of larger measure known as the consolidated appropriations act for 2000 pl 106113 further adjustments were made by the medicare medicaid and schip benefits improvement and protection act bipa part of the larger consolidated appropriations act 2001 pl 106554 in addition to increasing medicare payment rates the subsequent legislation mandated the development or refinement of ppss for different medicare covered services the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 pl 108173 or mma contained major benefit expansion in adding prescription drug coverage congress included number of provisions that affected httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30526g15g142g141g146g140g138g155g142g561g18g138g162g150g142g151g157g561g18g152g149g146g140g146g142g156g561 g561
