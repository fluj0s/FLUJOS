offer some clue as to further development of the apprendiblakely principles this report is an abridged version without footnotes of crs report rl32573 united states sentencing guidelines and the supreme court booker fanfan blakely apprendi and mistretta background of the united st ates sentencing guidelines the sentencing reform act of 1984 which established the united states sentencing commission and authorized it to issue sentencing guidelines brought about striking changes in federal sentencing law consistent with the supreme courts case law at the time sentencing under earlier law was considered in consistent and uncertain di fferent federal statutes set different maximum pe nalties for the same crime committe d under different jurisdictional circumstances at the same time federal judges enjoyed virtually unlimited discretion to impose any sentence beneath the maximum established by statute once imposed sentences were ordinarily be yond appellate review moreove r time actually served was product of the parole laws under which federal prisoner in spite of facially longer sentence became eligible for parole after serving the shorter of 10 years one third of his sentence or the term set by the sentencing court at the discretion of the parolehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21932crs2 commission prisoner might be paroled at an time after becoming eligible up to and until his mandatory release date generally pegged at service of twothirds of his sentence or 30 years of each consecutive sentence of 45 years or more many in congress came to conclude that the system did not work congress responded with the sentencing re form act the acts most dramatic change was the creation of the united states sentencing commission and the acts insistence that federal courts impose sentences within the ranges dictated by the commissions sentencing guidelines except in those cases marked by circumstances that the guidelines failed to take into consideration the act gave the commission rather exact instructions as to the nature of the guidelines it was to issue the guidelines for instance were to establish sentencing ra nge for each category of offense involving each category of defendant and each of these was to be assigned sentencing range in which the maximum term of imprisonment was to be six months more than the minimum term for the range the guidelines were predi cated upon sentencing fact or principles which case law at the time seem to accept blakely apprendi and related matters focused upon the prosecutors burden to prove each of the crimes elements the supreme court some time ago held that once the prosecution had done so denial of due process occurred simply because the defendant convicted of the crime was subject to manda tory minimum sentence based upon the prosecutors proof to the court not th jury of an additional sentencing factor by preponderance of the evidence mcmillan v pennsylvania moreover at least when the sentencing factor wa s the fact of prior convicti on the sentencing factors might be used to enhance maximum penalties as well as to establish minimum penalties thus majority of the court saw constitutional impediment in statutory scheme that raised the maximum penalty of crime from two year s to 20 years based on the presence of prior conviction established to the courts satisfaction by preponderance of the evidence almandareztorres v united states logical though it may have been in light of the courts precedents majority of the courts members became uneasy with the implications of almendareztorres almost immediately and responded with apprendi apprendi was convicted of shooting up the home of his africanamerican neighbors ther was evidence which apprendi disputed that his crime was motivated by racial animus under new jersey law possession of firearm for an unlawful purpose is second degree crime and unle ss otherwise provided is punishable by imprisonment for term fi xed at between 5 and 10 years second degree crime however carries an extended term of imprisonment if the court finds that it was committed by defendant acting with purpose to intimidate an individual or group of individuals because of race second degree crime found to have been committed under such circumstances carries rm of imprisonment fixed at between 10 and 20 years apprendi plead guilty under mu lticount indictment which nowhere mentioned either the hate crime sentencing enhancement statute or the allegations which supported its application ne vertheless in the plea agr eement the prosecution reserved the right to seek the hate crime enhancement and apprendi reserved the right to challenge its constitutionality the trial court sentenced apprendi to hatecrimeenhanced term of 12 years on one of the unlawful possession counts which otherwise would have carried maximum term of 10 years and rejected his constitutional arguments httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21932crs3 the supreme court in decision written by justice stevens and joined by justices scalia thomas souter and gi nsburg reversed and remande d the court declared that the jury trial and notification clauses of th sixth amendment and the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments embody principle that insist s that other than the fact of prior conviction any fact that increases the penalty for crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to the jury and proved beyond reasonable doubt when the court limited the apprendi rule to facts which drove punishment beyond the applicable statutory maximum it seemed to leave unscathed the federal sentencing guidelines that appear to operate only up to that maximum the apprendi dissenters however nsed conflict with apprendi s underlying rationale the actual principle underlying the courts decision the dissent opined may be that any fact other than prior conviction that s the effect in real terms of increasing the maximum punishment beyond an otherwise app licable range must be submitted to jury and proved beyond reasonable doubt if so the dissenters speculated the principle thus would apply not only to schemes like new jerseys under which factual determination exposes the defendant to sentence beyond the prescribed statutory maximum but also to all determinatesentencing schemes in which the length of defendants sentence within th statutory range turns on sp ecific factual determinations eg the federal sentencing guidelines blakely after apprendi the lower federal appellate courts either implicitly or explicitly had as one held that the prescribed statutory maximum that triggered apprendi concerns was the maximum penalty assigned to the cr ime of conviction not the top of the range assigned to the sentencing guidelines base offense level for the crime of conviction the courts blakely decision raised questions about the accuracy of that view blakely applied apprendi principles to strike down state sentencing guideline enhancement that fell well within the maximum sentence provided for the crime of conviction blakely had kidnapped his estranged wife bound her with duct tape stuffed her into wooden crate in the bed of his truck and driven her from washington to montana he eventually pled guilty to second degree ki dnapping involving domestic violence and use firearm class b felony under washington st ate law class b felonies were punishable by imprisonment for maximum of 10 years under the applicable washington statutory sentencing guidelines the crime was punish able by imprisonment within the standard range of 49 to 53 months second statut ory guideline provision however authorized the court to impose more severe sent ence an upward departure when it found additional aggravating factors unaccounted for in standard range guideline upon hearing the circumstances of the offe nse the court found that th crime had been committed with deliberate cruelty and sentenced blakely to 90 month term of imprisonment the washington appellate court found blakelys apprendi argument unpersuasive although the enhanced sentence was based on judicial findings of fact that carried it beyond the ceiling set by the standard guideline range for the crime of conviction sentence of 90 months was still well within the 10 year 120 month maximum established for such offenses the united states supreme court disagreed the question in blakely was simply did the prescribed statutory maximum that triggered jury trial and proof beyond reasonable doubt requirements refer to the 10 year maximum for second degree kidnapping or to the 53 month maximum of the sentencing guidelines standardhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21932crs4 sentencing range in the mind of the blakely court the statutory maximum for apprendi purposes is the maximum sentence judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defe ndant in other words the relevant statutory maximum is not the maximum sentence judge may impose after finding additional facts but the maximum he may imposed without any additional facts blakelys guilty plea did not include the fact s upon which the sentenci ng court had relied to enhance his sentence from the maximum 53 months that his plea would have supported to the 90 month enhanced sentence the court had imposed thus because the states sentencing procedure did not comply with the sixth amendment petitioners sentence is invalid the blakely court expressly declined to co mment on the application if any of this principle to the federal sentencing guidelines as they had in apprendi justices oconnor and breyer in dissent expressed c oncern for the impact of the decision on the federal sentencing guidelines fanfan and booker fanfan and booker were each convicted of controlled substance offenses in both instances appli cation of the sentencing guidelines would require sentencing within ranges beyond thos supported by the jury verdict alone the court granted certiorari for expedited consider ation of the two cases as one in order to address two questions did apprendiblakely apply to the federal sentencing guidelines and if so how much if any of the guide lines or the sentencing act under which they were created remained viable the answers were easily stated but splintered the court the principles announced in apprendiblakely apply to the federal sentencing guidelines as consequence the statut ory provisions which made the guidelines binding on federal trial courts and those which directed federal appellate c ourts to ensure their binding application must be severed fro m the sentencing reform act the answers required an opinion of two parate parts each written and with one exception espoused by different array of the justices justice ginsburg joined the four apprendiblakely jury right justices stevens s calia souter and thomas in the part of the courts opinion devoted to the issue of apprendiblakely s application to the federal sentencing guidelines and she then joined the four apprendiblakely judicial sentencing factor dissenter s rehnquist oconnor kennedy and breyer in the part of the courts opinion devoted to the issue of severance other than justice ginsburg each of the justices wrote or joined dissenting opinion on the question of application justice st evens opinion for the court rather quickly dispensed with the counterappli cation arguments it repeat ed the ways in which it has described the basic apprendi principle that puts these objec tions to rest and ended with view of the principle from yet another angl any fact other than prior conviction which is necessary to support sentence exceed ing the maximum authorized by the facts established by plea of guilty or jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to jury beyond reasonable doubt the courts treatment of th second question may have co as surprise there were arguably three more predictable remedies assuming beforehand that the guidelines operated impermissibly by pe rmitting judges by preponderance of the evidence to make sentencing decisions constitutionally reserved for the jury the infirmity might prove fatal to the guidelines as whole or it might only prove fatal to those guidelines provisions that set the pre ponderance standard and made the impermissible factfinding assignment or it might simp ly require that the judge and the guidelines act only uponhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21932crs5 those fact determinations found by the jury beyond reasonable doubt or conceded by the defendant the second part of the courts opinion embraced none these options justice stevens in part one of the courts opinion ga ve hint of what was to come when he observed that the guidelines constitutiona l defect was product of their mandatory nature this suggested the remedy congress would have preferred and consequently the remedy the court adopted only the statut ory provisions that made the guidelines mandatory need be pruned from the system so concluded the second part of the courts booker opinion which also explained how the c ourt anticipated the modified federal sentencing system would operate thereafte r and how the opinion applied to booker and fanfan the court writing through justice breyer with the concurrence of chief justice rehnquist and justices oconnor kennedy nd ginsburg reasoned that congress would have preferred the demise of the sentencing reform act to guidelines system in which the jury made the factual decisions which the guidelines had originally assigned to the judge and it would have preferred an advi sory guidelines system over the loss of the sentencing reform act the court inferred these preferences 1 from the language of the statute 2 from congressional purpose in passing the act 3 from the fact that the sentencing statutes read to include the courts sixth amendmen t requirement would create system far more complex than congress could have intended 4 from the fact that reduced judicial role and an increased jury role would exacerbate the problems inherent in plea bargain 5 from the fact th at congress would not have intended system that encumbered the imposition of more seve re sentences but not of more lenient ones and 6 from the fact that the most of the act and most of the guidelines could continue to function effectively and constitutionally by severing but two provisions of the act the court then described the sentencing system that remained after severing 18 usc 3553b1 which required tr ial courts to follow the dictates of the guidelines and 18 usc 3472e which instructed the appellate courts to make sure that they did federal judges are longer bound by the gu idelines but they remain bound to consider them along with the other considerations id entified in section 3553a their sentencing decisions are still subject to appeal by eith er the government the defendant or both under 18 usc 3742ab the standard by which such appeals are to be judged is one of reasonableness as understood from the ju risprudence that arose under 18 usc 3742e3 prior to its repeal with respect to departures and the review of sentences for which there was applicable guideline booker applies to all cases on direct review to the extent the sentence imposed gives rise to the constitutional rights announced in booker and within the confines of the plain error rule and the harmless error doctrine and what of mr booker and mr fanfan the court affirmed the court of appeals decision vacating bookers senten ce because the trial court d increased it based on facts other than those found by the jury on remand the district court should impose sentence in accordance with the courts booker opinions and if the sentence comes before the court of appeals for review th court of appeals should apply the review standards set forth in booker fanfan had been sentenced solely within the facts found by the jury and consequently below the ra nge called for by the guidelines the court vacated fanfans sentence and remanded his case to permit the parties to seek resentencing consistent with the c ourts opinion if they elect to do so the alignment of the justices in booker renders predictions of its legacy even more perilous than usual why did justice gi nsburg join the four justices who believedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21932crs6 booker presented sixth amendment problem in the part of the courts opinion designed to solve the problem some may find illumination in case the court decided two months after booker shepard v united states shepard shepard arose out of what might be considered unusual circumstances factual dispute over the existence and status of prior criminal convictions shepard involved the application of the federal armed career criminal act acca which requires the imposition of minimum 15year term of imprisonment for unlawful possession of firearm by an individual with three prior serious drug or violent felony convictions burglaries are numbered among the qualifying violent crimes for purposes of 18 usc 924e the court has interpreted burglary as used here to include any offense consisting of the unlawful or unprivile ged entry into or remaining in building or other structure with intent to commit crime regardless of how it is captioned shepard had pleaded guilty to possession of firearm in violation of 18 usc 922g1 at the time he had five prio r convictions following guilty pleas under massachusetts statutes that outlawed breaking and entering into building ship vessel or vehicle with the intent to commit crime the complaints under which he was charged and plead recited the language of the statute without i ndicating whether the premises entered were burgl aryqualifying buildings or nonqualifying ships vessels or vehicles the government offe red copies of the police repor ts and complaint applications to demonstrate that shepard had previously been convicted of breaking into buildings rather than ships vessels or vehicles th trial court found this an impermissible basis for imposition of the mandatory minimum pe nalty under 18 usc 924e the court of appeals disagreed the supreme court agreed with the district court and reversed shepard arguably afforded the court an opportunity to walk away from the almendarez prior conviction exception to the apprendi rule justice thomas at least implicitly urged his colleagues to do so they declined in plurality opinion five members of the court justices stevens scalia souter ginsburg and thomas concluded that in the case of statute permitting conviction for either qualifying generic bur glaries or nonqualifying nongeneric burglaries qualifi cation must be shown either in the charging document the terms of plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was conf irmed by the defendant or some comparable judicial record of this information or in the charge to the jury justice thomas would reach the result by constitutional necessity the others as matter of statutory construction in constitutional avoidance
