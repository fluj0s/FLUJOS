financial assistan ce to state revolving loan funds srfs for purposes of buildin g and upgrading wastewater treatment and drinking water treatment facilities congress established the cwa srf program in 1987 and the sdwa srf program in 1996 under both federal capitalization grants are provided as seed money for stateadministered loan programs communities repay loans to the state providing s ource of capital for future loans and other investments both laws contain provisions that specify require ments for states to establish srfs and requirement s that apply to the srfs operation such as plans and reporting both define categories of projects eligible for assistance who may receive assistance and types of assistance activities key intention of both bills is to exte nd srf authorizations s

fy2004fy2008 in addition both would conform the two laws in several respects for example the sdwa currently allows states to offer additional subsidization to disadvantaged communities and longer loan repayment periods and both bills would add similar provisions to the cwa the bills are not identical however in some cases they take different approaches to an issue such as how to re vise the formula for statebystate allotment of cwa srf capitalization grants s 2550 includes provisions that would apply prevailing wage requirements of the davisbacon act to projects that receive srf funding and it includes new grant prog ram to assist small community drinking water projects as well as grant programs to address lead cont amination in schools and in the district of columbia hr 1560 includes provisions requiring communities to plan for capital replacement needs and to implement an asset management plan for the repair and maintenance of infrastructure future prospects for the legislation

report provides sidebyside comparison of two major bills in the 108th congress concerning water infrastructure pr oject financing it compares provisions of s 2550 the water infrastructure fina ncing act which would amend both the clean water act cwa 33 usc 1251 et q and the safe drinking water act sdwa 42 usc 300f et seq and hr 1560 the water quality financing act of 2003 which would amend only the cwa while number of bills that address water infrastructure project financing have been introdu ced these two measures are the focus of legislative activity in the 108th congress this report also describes relevant provisions of current law that would be affected or modified by the bills the cwa and sdwa provisions that these two bills would amend are principally the portions of those laws that authorize federal financial assistance to state revolving loan funds srfs for purposes of building and upgrading wastewater treatment and drinking water treatment facilities respectively at the federal level the srf programs in the laws are administered by the environmental protection agency epa under the pr ograms in both laws federal capitalization grants are provided as seed money for stateadministered loan programs recipients repay loans to the state enabling the state to build up source of capital for future loans and other investments thus m onies in the srf consist of federal capitalization grants from congressional ppropriations required state matching funds 20 of capitalization grant and loan repayments congress established the cwa srf program in 1987 pl 1004 repl acing what previously had been cwa program of grants to municipa lities before 1996 the sdwa had not authorized federal assistance for drinking water treatment facilities but in that year congress established the sdwa srf prog ram pl 104182 modeling it after the cwa program while also refining it to reflect experiences gained during the early implementation of pl 1004 for background information see crs report rl31116 water infrastructure funding revi ew and analysis of current issues key intention of both of the current bills is to extend and increase srf authorizations because estimate s by states and epa of funding needed by wastewater and water utilities to comply with the two acts exceed 330 billion needs estimates by other groups are even higher in th case of the cwa program authorizations under the 1987 law expired at the end of fy1994 while authorizations for the sdwa srf program expired at the nd of fy2003 however congress has continued to appropriate monies for capitalization grants each year for both since their authorizations expired httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32503crs2 1 for information see crs report rl31344 water infrastructure financing legislation comparison of s 1961 and hr 3930 2 the davisbacon act requires among other thin gs that not less than the locally prevailing wage be paid to workers employed under cont ract on federal construction work to which the united states or the district of columbia is party critics say that it unnecessarily increases public construction costs and hamper s competition supporters say that the law helps stabilize the local construction industry by preventing competition that could undercut local wages and working conditions congress has added davisbacon prevailing wage provisions to more than 50 separate program statutes including the clean water act for background see crs report rl31491 davisbacon act coverage and the state revolving fund program under the clean water actmore recently legislative activity concerning water infrastructure issues has been undertaken in the 107th and 108th congresses house and senate committees held oversight hearings on water infrastr ucture financing issues during the first session of the 107th congress and in the second session the house transportation and infrastructure committee approved h r 3930 committee report was filed the senate environment and public works committee approved and reported infrastructure financing legi slation s 1961 srept 1072281 further action occurred on either bill in large part due to controversies over provisions in both bills to apply requirements of the davisbac on act to srffunded water infrastructure projects2 and also over grant allocation formulas in the two measures in the 108th congress the house transportation and infrastructure subcommittee on water resources and environment approved hr 1560 legislation similar to hr 3930 from the 107th congress in july 2003 hr 1560 would authorize 20 billion for the clean water srf program for fy2004fy2008 it contains several provisions intended to benefit economically disadvantaged and small communities such as allowing extended loan repayments 30 years and additional subsidies including forgiveness of the loan principal and negative interest loans for communities that meet states affordability criteria it includes provisions to require communities to plan for capital replacement needs and to develop and implement an asset management plan for the repair and maintenance of infrastructure that is being financed the full committee has not acted on the subcommittee approved bill on june 23 2004 the senate envir onment and public works committee approved s 2550 it authorizes 4125 billi on over five years for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure programs in cluding 20 billion for the clean water srf program and 15 billion for the drinking wa ter srf program the bill includes new formula for statebystate allocation of clean water srf grants expansion of the types of projects and activitie s eligible for srf funding and renewal of several clean water act grant programs for sewer overfl ow control projects alternative water source pilot projects and the national tuary program it includes several provisions to conform administrative elemen ts of the two laws srf programs such as amounts reserved for state administrative costs the nate bill directs states to reserve portion of their annual clean wa ter and drinking wa ter srf capitalization grants for making grants to eligible communities and further requires epa to establish small drinking water system grant program to help small water systemshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32503crs3 3 during markup of s 2550 the senate environment and public works committee approved two similar amendments to establish small dr inking water system grant program although the programs contain many similarities they would authorize grant funding at significantly different levels see discussion of small p ublic water system grant program in this reportcomply with drinking water regulations3 among other provisions the bill authorizes funds to address lead conta mination in schools and in the district of columbia and directs the us geological survey to assess perchlorate cont amination nationwide s 2550 also amends the water resources planning act to require the water resources council to conduct sp ecial water resources study the house and senate bills differ in number of respects in some cases they take different approaches to an issue such as how to revise th formula for stateby state allotment of cwa srf capitalization gran ts they differ in other ways as well s 2550 but not hr 1560 includes provisions modeled on the current sdwa that would allow private utilities to receive cwa srf assistance both bills would permit states to make longerterm srf loans hr1560 generally would permit loans to be made for up to 30 years while s 2550 adopting the current sdwa approach extends clean water srf loans made to disadvantaged communities from 20 years to up to 30 years the house bill addresses several issues not included in the senatemeasure it would for example authorize states to use the clean water srf to provide technical assistance to small treatment works require aid recipients to conduc t additional project evaluations including of the cost and effectiv eness of innovative and alternative processes and techni ques and reauthorize the existing sewer overflow grant program in secti on 121 of the clean water act the senate bill also has several provisions not contained in hr 1560 including cost of service study by the national academy of sciences nationwide demonstr ation program for innovations in water quality management or water supply and study of lead in drinking water by the nati onal academy of sciences unlike the house bill s 2550 includes language that would apply prevailing wage requirements of the davisbacon act to projects that receive funding in whole or in part from cwa or sdwa srf future prospects for hr 1560 and s 2550 are uncertain for several reasons first the administration opposes the higher srf funding levels contained in both bills second strong disagreement exists in both houses of congress over including provisions to apply requirements of the da visbacon act to srffunded projects as well as over the statebysta allotment formula in s 2550 for clean water act capitalization grants similar disagreements were largely responsible for the lack of final action on water infrastru cture legislation in the 107th congress third only limited number of legislative days remain in the 108th congress fourth the househttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32503crs4 energy and commerce committee which has jurisdiction over the safe drinking water act has not yet considered counter part legislation to the sdwa provisions in s 2550 several other legislative proposals dealing with wate r infrastructure financing programs administered by epa not desc ribed in this report also have been introduced in the 108th congress these include hr 688s 252 to authorize
