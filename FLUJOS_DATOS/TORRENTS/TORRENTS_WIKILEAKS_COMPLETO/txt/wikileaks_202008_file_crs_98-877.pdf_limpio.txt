negotiate with the rebels only if they first laid down their arms but in early october 1996 in letter to regional heads of state he demonstrated willingness to participate in uncond itional talks these steps and responsive us pressure to eas the sanctions notwithstanding the african nations continued the embargo the regional measures have had serious impact on the burundian economy and have
