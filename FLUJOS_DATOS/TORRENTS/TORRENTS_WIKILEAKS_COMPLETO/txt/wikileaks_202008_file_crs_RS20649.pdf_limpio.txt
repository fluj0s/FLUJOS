presence forward presence remains an important component of us military strategy in the cold war it supporte d containment but now it primarily supports regional stability and the global war on terrorism advantages derived assures friends and allies of us commitments deters potential regional aggr essors places forces closer to crisis response sites and provides physical and human infrastructure for global military response capabilities disadvantages additional costs to maintain forces overseas personnel and operating costs 1020 above continental us may make it easier to act or be expected to act as world policeman adds to over commitment of downsized forces and potential to attract political or environmental complaints trends after the cold war ended overall size of the us armed forces declined while operating tempo increased the number of forces permanently stationed overseas declined especially in europe whereas 33 of the army wa s stationed overseas in 1989 the figure is now 16 not including ployments now 24 in iraq kuwait and afghanistan the clinton administration d ecided to stabilize us presence in europe at about 100000 troops down from 300000 in the pa st presence in the pacific region was also stabilized at about 100000 focused in volatile northeast asia where some 30000 troops are in south korea and 34000 in japan the bush administration is in the process of changing the global stationing posture while such presence stationing is normal and expected by individual uniform ed personnel temporary deployments for humanitarian or peacekeeping purposes joint and combined training and actual conflicts increased after the cold war and remain high units for these missions come from both overseas and stateside bases today us activities include land wa ter and air operations in and around iraq former yugoslavia korea afghanistan and other areas critical to the war on terrorism costs and burdensharing overseas presence and engagement commitments raise questions about costs broad questions involve how much the nation should devote to maintaining influence abroad and worldpower capabilities and whether there are cheaper ways to do so the united states has already shifted emphasis from forward presence to power projection cost savings from bringing forces home may be reduced by the need to compensate with greater airlift sealift and prepositioning because us presence is normally in the interest of both the host nati on and the united states there has often been pressure to have hosts pay more of the costs for analysis of these complicated issues see crs report 95726 defense budget alternative asures of costs of military commitments abroad and crs report 94515 defense burdensharing is japans host nation support model for other allies both by stephen daggett congressional actions since late in the cold war congress has set ceilings on us forward presence primarily by limiting the numbers of troops ashore allowed in europe currently 100000 in the defense authorization act for fy1999 pl 105261 congress again directed the president to seek increased burdensharing by each nation that has cooperative military re lations with the united states congress authorized but did not require several measures that the presiden t could use to encourage nations to increase such efforts for fy2001 hr 4205 cong ress
