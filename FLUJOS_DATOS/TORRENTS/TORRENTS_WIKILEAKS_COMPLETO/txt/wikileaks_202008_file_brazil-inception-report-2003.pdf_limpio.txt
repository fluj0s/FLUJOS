st critical sanitation issues in developing countries with the massive migration of p eople from the countryside towards the cities over the last 50 ye ars public authorities are neit her technically or economically capable of expanding urban infrastructure to properly receive their new dwellers coming from rural areas because of agricultural mechanization or droughts in their original regions that hinder subsistence agriculture this resulted in disorderly urban deve lopment in most of the cities within latin america and caused large portion of urban population to live in places under appalling sanitation cond itions which has negative effect on their health and quality of life among the different aspects of basic sanitation water pply sewage collection and treatment waste collection and disposal solid waste management has generally received less attention and fewer resources from public administration it is certainly not the top priority for town administration which in most of the cities within developing countries is in charge of household waste management in the cities despite the recurring lack of resources to meet all of its obligations activi ties within this segmen t are usually restricted to fairly regular waste collection in urban area s where there is intens business activity or highincome population the prob lem of final disposal has take n on alarming proportions taking into consideration only household waste indus trial waste management is responsibility of the generator itself it may be not ed that for years public administration activities have been limited to only remo ve the collected waste from urban areas sometimes dumping it in absolutely inappropri ate places such as forested mountainsides mangroves rivers bays and valleys over 80 of the towns in brazil currently disposes waste in open places in waterways or in vironmentally protected areas most of which are frequented by scavengers among whom ther are children and that brings to surface the social issues that result from poor waste managem ent however the attention waste management gets from public institutions in developing countries has increased recently at all govern ment levels federal and state governments 6have been allocating higher resources and creating pro grams and lines of credit with towns as sole beneficiaries on the other hand municipal administra tions have been more seriously engaged in addressing urban cleani ng issues and creating universal service conditions and maintaining quality standards through time this situation has been monitored with growing seriousness by the population environmental control agencies and nongovernment organizations engaged in environmental defense however in most towns there is one definite corroboration on ly societys pressure or dedicated mayor aware of the importance of urb an cleaning for public health and for the environment may change the situation of neglect undergone by th is segment this change is only possible through political decision and will necessa rily result in financial burden for the municipal governments which will require an increase in taxes or the reallocation of resources from other segments within munici pal administration in turn this will be politically rewarded with the improved qualit of the services rendered and the positive effects on populations heal th and quality of life the use of biogas generated in landfills as power source may become useful tool in the process of recovering unmanaged waste deposits open du mps and or the implementation of new sanitary landfills sinc this may result in additional resources which come not only from its use as fuel but also from awarding carbon emission reduction certifications within the clean development mechanism set forth in the kyoto protocol some considerations about final disposal of waste in brazil the final disposal of waste is one of the mo st critical segments of waste management in brazil and only recently it has attracted the necessa ry attention from public authorities the accumulation of waste in certain place increases i ts pollution potential and therefore demands greater effort to treat it the most us ual form of final disposal of urban waste in brazilian municipalities is the well known open du mp lixão the accumulation in sites far from urban agglomerations without any kind of treatment causing damage to the environment such as the contamination of water tables the proliferation of disease transmitting agents rodents roaches mosquitoes th silting up of rivers and channels the pollution of water resources and of the at mosphere by the combustion of residues or by the release of biogas in addition to compromising the local landscape in 2000 ibge the brazilian institute of geog raphy and statistics developed research on the sanitation sector in all 5507 municipali ties in brazil now they are 5561 including the federal district of brasilia this rese arch involved water and sewage systems drainage and waste management this is actua lly the only source of information on national level available in brazil there are of course some municipal waste management plans that could provide good amount of in formation about some cities in this regard but even in more developed federal states in the so uth and southeast regions of the country specific information abou t this theme is very scarce because of some deficiencies in getting the in formation from the municipalities the result of the research referring to the characteri zation of waste disposal sites indicates an 7excessively favorable situation the results asse ssed in short are the following if we take as parameter the quantity of waste collected and dum ped in final disposal units we notes that 4087 according to the answers ob tained were dumped in sanitary landfills 2204 in controlled landfills and only 3114 in inadequate sites that is more than 66 of all waste collected in brazil is properly disposed of in sanitary and or controlled landfills if the reference of the analysis is in number of municipalities the result is not so favorable 619 of them say that they deposit their waste in dumps and only 255 declare they have adequate landfills and there is still percentage of 126 that did not inform to where their waste is taken the char ts below

sanitary figure 2 final disposal by quantity of waste according to the population range of the cities the data indicates tendency that reflects an improvem ent in the situation of final disposal of household waste in brazil in rece nt years which can be attributed to many factors higher awareness of the population regarding the waste management issue which has positive and direct infl uence on councilmen and mayors the strong action of the state public attorney which has been decisively active the allocation of resources by the federal government to the sector through the national environmental fund and the support of some state governments however the improvement of final disposal sites has not been satisfactory because as is widely known this segment is little observed by the population due to the remote location of such sites usually on the outskirts of the cities where the pressure of opinionformers is mo re subtle being therefore the one that are less favored in the application of reso urces by the municipal administration in all latin american countries with the exception of chile there have been few attempts to implement the use of landfill gas or lfg part ly because such an initiative represents economic interest and also because environmen tal laws do not require specifically the collection and burning of gas to avoid gr eater impact on the greenhouse effect two significant experiences were implemented in the city of rio j aneiro brazil by comlurb municipal waste management company of the cit of rio j aneiro mixed economy company the municipality of ri has 99 of all shares whose activities are carried out exclusively within the city of ri j aneiro the first of these experiences took place from 1977 to 1985 and consisted in the dail collection of 10000 cubic meters of gas from former municipal landfill in rio and the transportation of that gas through 3 9km long gas pipeline to the natural gas plant run b the stateowned gas company in charge of gas distribution in the city the lfg without any sort of treatment and with an average heat power of 5800 kcal nm3 was xed with the cracked natural gas produced in the plant the landfill gas at that time re presented 1 of all the city gas distributed through the public network the second expe rience consisted in system for collecting purifying and compressing the lfg generated in the same landfill to use it in the vehicles of the urban cleaning company beginning in 1980 and d uring the next five years nearly 130 light and heavy vehicles were adapted to run mainly on the treated lfg with almost 85 of ch4 after co2 removal by means of water abso rption system within 14 kg cm2 pressure tanks as recently as only two years ago the use of landfill gas became again an important issue in brazil especially because of the possib ility of recovering economic resources by awarding carbon emission reduction cert ifications under the clean development mechanism cdm the subject of this case study is the nova gera r project the only project in brazil that has received positive approval from an inter national finance agency operations in the new landfill began in j anuary 2003 that is five months ago this case study will provide all pertinent information and background data since the beginning of the project ie when the muni cipal administration of nova iguaçu decided to change the way the final disposal of waste was carried out in the city through 15year concession with private company it will specifically detail ll the institutional problems face d by nova gerar in order to achieve through contract with the municipality full responsibility to install op erate and recover the landfill gas from new landfill and to acquire by means of an addendum to the contract the right to exploit the gas as fuel for power generation and to benefit from the related carbon credits it is stated in th is same contract that nova gerar has also the obligation to close the old open dump of the city and environmentally recover the site as defined in its contract with the nova iguaçu municipality this case study will also detail the social as pects involved in the implementation of the project because there were about 60 scaven gers working in the old open dump nova gerar had also to generate alternative jobs for thes people 20 background 21 ge neral background nova iguaçu is municipality about 30 kilomete rs from the city of rio j aneiro with 920000 inhabitants most of which live in urban area s household waste generation is around 800 metric tons day the collection

of rio j aneiro within the coa stal plain it extending along the coast among the ranges massifs and escarpments of the serra do mar along the socalled coastal mobile belt along the coastal plains of rio j aneiro sedimentary depositions are scattered in different environments in the indirect area of influence these depositions are fluvial and marine in origin and contain gravel sand and unconsolidated silt with crossbedding and aggradation to pelitic sedimentation regional p hysiography the diversified and complex environments affe cted by eustatic and climatic variations have contributed to the areas morphological di stribution based on the relationship of recent and subrecent facies and processes it is possible to distinguish more representative areas among which the alluvial plains stand out where the river depositional beds are flat these facies were formed as result of the land processes in relation to the changes to and types of stresses and mass movements as well as solifluction processes which result in colluvial flows and landslides which are co mbined with the hydrologic characteristics of the canals the colinas unit region is characterized by pressional topography with low elevations the geographical location of the referred unit was determined by the geological an d the climatic and sea level control activities and the subre cent processes whereas the erosional patterns comprise concave and convex ranges the ranges comprise erosional features with fine and moderate drainage density and ma present incisions of dozens of meters in depth covered with colluvial material on the peaks and angular and or subrounded rock lines which separate the colluviums from th metamorphic gneissose material the rock lines and the colluviums

there were holes or tears in the geomembrane piece of the liner was glued over the damaged parts its dimension exceeded the edges of the hole tear in about 30 cm at each side the geomembrane joint was done throug h welding process as defined by the manufacturer that welding was done through suita ble machines in order to ensure the perfect force tran smission the patches were done at the same geomembrane installation site the patches tran sverse to the 17geomembrane main dimension in adjacent straps were staggered at 20 m at least in the sloped areas geomembranes we re anchored in trenches dug by the means of drain rings placement when ever it was possible installation started on the one side of the foundati on unwinding the spindles up to its opposite side the anchorage trenches were cleaned of mud and fines in water suspension in the field the integr ity of patches was tested with the compressed air injection protection recovering after installing geomembrane it was protected by s oil covering according to the dimensions defined in the project the material poured came from the digging done in the land fill area or in the borrowed areas the material did not contain organic

in order to allow both the dispersion of gases and the collection of the leachate formed in the sanitary landfills cells drain s for leachate and gas collection were installed as shown in the project those devices were comprised of founda tion drains drain rings horizontal drains for leachate and vertical drains for leachate and gas where there is 18change in direction of foundation drains inside the san itary landfill draw in boxes were also installed as shown in the proje ct foundation main drain for leachate the main drain for leachate was installe d in the foundation it is comprised of s s

icipated in the project with suitable equipment and when necessary timbering was erected the trenches were dug before the draining system was placed on the geomembrane after the digging work the trench was pr epared in order to assure that the bottom presents uniform aspect with depression s and or ledges caused by the presence of preexisting stone blocks that leveling was done with crushed rock and or light concrete horizontal drains for leachate and drain rings both in the foundation and after ea ch waste cell was finished already covered by the soil layer the horizontal drains for l eachate and the drain ring were installed in order to conne ct the cell to the internal draining system of the landfill the drain rings were installed at the d side of the digging site and or in the berms on the digging through digging trenches as shown in the project those devices besides guarant eeing the leachate draining will act as anchorage element for the waterproofing geomembrane trenches were dug for the leachate horizontal drains connecting the vertical drains for gas and leachate til it reaches the top surface of the soil layer of the subjacent cell next log parts were placed in accordance with the thickness and sections defined in the project the remaining volume of the trench was recomposed with compacted waste until it had reached the basis of the soil top layer finally it was applied the necessary soil for the recomposition of the cell revetment 19the foundation horizontal drains were installed with out the trenches digging in order to avoid damages to the waterproofing geomembrane drainage ditch for gas and leachate the drainage ditches for gas and leachate were install ed according to the dimensions and features shown in the project in each cell the drainage ditches are installed before the waste is disposed alternatively the piping may be insta lled after the cell is finished through digging work in the drainage ditches as long as that procedure does not interfere with the landfill embankment process during the work all the necessary prec autions to protect the operation will be taken extinguishing the fire in the piping and k eeping in the area suitable equipment to fight other occasional combustio ns at the piping basis where there is geomembrane suitable protections in order to prevent it from puncturing will be placed the drainage ditches were done with re inforced concrete perforated pipes the minimum diameter for the holes is 15 cm spaced i n lines in every 20 cm in each line the spacing between the holes was 20 cm at maximum in adjacent lines the holes should be st aggered in half of the spacing layer of log parts with 50 cm in thickness was placed around the pipes for their protection in order to prot ect the log parts metal screen was installed at the top of the landfill when fi nished galvanized pipes with 15cm in diameter should be installed they should have burners at their ends as shown in the project drains for slope areas leachate drains for slope areas leachate will be in stalled at the landfill final external slope areas those drains aim to drain occasi onal percolated liquid flows not intercepted by the main draining syst em and lead them to the foundation main drain 20the spacing of those drains will be fined during the building work due to the local particularities and mainly due to the potential percolated liquids emerging points drawin boxs concrete drawin boxes will be done where there is change in the direction of the drains for leachate at the external slope areas those drawin boxes are molded in site or as an alternative they will be done with premolded parts the drawin boxes should have masonry walls with ope nings on the sides that contact the drains leachate storage tanks tanks to drain and store leachate will be done at the places predefined in the project monitoring systems brief descriptions of the systems landfill monitoring plan the purpose of nova iguaçu

manage the marambaia and adrianópolis land fills as part of this concessional agreement sa paulista is responsibl for the decommissioning and rehabilitation of the lixão da marambaia site the adrianopolis landfill commenced its operation in february 2003 and it is receiving around 900 metric tons of hous ehold waste per day collected in the municipalities of nova iguaçu and mesquita the executi ve plan prepared by 27sapaulista and approved by feema indi cates that waste disposal rate will be some 1000 metric tons day with maximum of 1500 day day the receiving capacity of the landfill is some 4000 5000 metric tons day for the project projections it is envisaged that the pr oject will be able to capture around 2000 metric tons day from nova iguaçu and other neighbor municipalities this possibility depends on the public ministry permit currently as already said the landfill is allowed to receive the waste from the cities of nova iguaçu and mesquita only sanitary emergency in other municipalities could force change in the public ministry position this coul d leads the adrianópolis landfill to receive waste from queimados 50 metric tons day and são j oão do merití 260 metric tons day which are now dumping in gramacho the rio j aneiro citys landfill whose closure is expected to occur in middl 2005 this scenario is very likely to happen due to the precarious waste disp osal situation in and around rio j aneiro separate study on the waste disp osal market provided by sa paulista shows that the rio j aneiro metropolitan area lack s of adequate waste disposal areas and most of the current sites w ill be closed by 2005 adrianópolis could likely be the only legal and clean option for the met ropolitan area if further landfills were approved by the local public administr ation besides that the environmental permits allow this site to receive waste also from the socalled big generators that is those commercial stores or insti tutions that produce more than 100 l day private companies collect this wa ste and this will help to increase the total quantity of waste dumped in this site in the n ear future b understanding the lfg fuel resource potential and an risk factors the new landfill will be managed according to the latest technology which is being sought from specialist waste management companies the bottom of the landfill will be coated with an impermeable highd ensity polyethylene membrane and the water residues will be channelled and trea ted in wastewater treatment plant landfill gas will be collected by gas collection syste m and channelled to the electricity generation units excess ga s will be flared the project has already secured all the necessary environmental permits required by the brazilian law quantification of

schematic gas collection network 29 figure 7 construction details of typical gas well the technical aspect of the analysis focu ses on the carbon reductions of the project and therefore its potential to produc net carbon reductions as part of this it is necessary to consider the different vels of carbon emissions associated with the with and without project environm ents the methodologies and results of this analysis are presented below data assumptions wherever possible the data used were based on project specific measurements in the case where data wa s not provided by the project it was sourced from other literature data and full references are given this calculation and estimate have been made at the be ginning of the project and have to be updated 30 the baseline scenario the baseline scenario is based on what would have ppened in the absence of the project activities in this case the baseline scenario is the continued uncontrolled release of landfill gas to the atmosphere similarly to most landfills in brazil see section 132 for more discussion the most accurate method for determ ining landfill gas quantity short of installing full collection system is to sink test wells in repr esentative locations and measure the gas collected from these we lls an added benefit of this method is that the collected gas can be tested for quality as we ll as quantity the gas can also be analysed for btu content as well as hydrocarbon lphur particulate and nitrogen content this will help in th design of the processing and energy recovery system this detaile d analysis will be undertaken in the initial stages of implementation of the novagerar project after adequate financing is secured in the absence of this detailed analysis prelimina ry assessment of the landfill gas generation of the marambaia and adrianopolis landfill sites has been carried out using first order decay mode l from the us epa manual turning liability into an asset landfill gas to energy ndbook for

year the waste disposal volumes r are based on historical data for the marambaia site while the projected values for the ad rianopolis site are based on waste disposal tonnages from the marambai site plus projected growth in waste 31disposal from the surrounding municipalitie s these data forms the foundation of the gas volume projection and is subject to change over the active lifetime of the landfill as refuse acceptance volumes va ry this implies that the gas volume projection will vary accordingly ther efore even though gas volumes may fluctuate over period of time because of varying disposal rates the ultimate total volume of gas projected for the site should remain cons tant is variable dependent on the type of waste depo sited and its organic content the other variable k is depend ent on factors affecting the decomposition of waste ie temperature and humidity the us epa has developed range of values for and k which were used for this analysis see appendix 2 for values used for the various variables because of the uncertainty in estimating k and however gas flow estimates derived from the first order decay model have high inherent error for this reason the proj ect aims at selling only 75 of the total amount of credits estimated at this stage the results of the preliminary landfill gas generation analysis are presented in figure 3 below and the full details ar shown in appendix 3 according to the analysis the adrianopolis site has the capacity to g enerate approximately 14 billion cubic metres of landfill gas over the next 10 years and 37 billion cubic metres over the next 20 years this dramat ic rise is due to an exponential increase in landfill gas production once core volume of waste has been placed conversely the marambaia site will only generate approximately 184 million cubic metres of landfill gas over the next 10 years landfil l gas at this site will decrease exponentially once waste placement has ceased this is highlighted by the fact that over the next 20 years the landfill gas ge nerated only increases to 199 million cubic metres note that these values could be higher or lower due to the uncertainty inherent to the

as determined by engineers of the environm ent and waste department of earthtech an environmental engineering company from oak brook usa in the project scenario all these landfill gases will be

department of earthtech an environmental engineering company from oak brook usa determined t hat the landfill gas of similar site located in são paulo is typi cally comprised of 54 methane see table 2 because of the similarities in waste co mposition and climate which are the main factors in determining landfill gas generation it was assumed that the methane content of landfill gas produced at the marambaia and drianopolis sites would be similar typical landfill gas analysis of similar site in bra zil in businessasusual sc enario without any gas collection or utilisation schemes in place the site would be resp onsible for the release of approximately 80000 tonnes of methane every year during this period using global warming potential gwp of 21 this is equivale nt to carbon dioxide emissions of approximately 17 million tonnes per year if the ip cc officially endorses an increase in the gwp for methane to 23 th numbers will be revised accordingly cumulative co2e emissions without

million tonnes of co2e will be emitted in the project scenario during the period 20022022 ext racts from these calculations appear in appendix 3 grid electricity displacement the project scenario also displaces grid electricity from the southern brazilian grid the brazilian elec tricity grid is low to moderately carbon intensive being largely comprised of hydropower however there are small but increasing elements of diesel gas and coke usage therefore electricity generated from the novagerar landfills will effectively reduce emissions by displacing electricity from the grid which has higher carbon inte nsity than electricity from renewable resource ie landfill gas based on the timations of landfill gas generation it is expected that these sites will produce levels of gas suitable for sustained electricity generation from 20022022 to calculate the emissions displaced th amount of electricity exported to the grid is multiplied by carbon emission factor cef for that year cef

novagerar will explore all business related to the use of the ghg and is the legal contractual partner of the ncdf net herlands clean development facility b specific contractual requirements sou rce project concept document the world bank the project was selected on basis of ncdf s eligibility criteria the ncdf funds projects in the framework of article 12 cdm of the kyoto protocol as per the terms of the agreement ncdf projects should be located in nonannex i countries as listed in the climate convention wh ich have i signed and ratified accepted approved or acceded to the kyoto protocol or ii signed the kyoto protocol and demonstrated clear interest in b ecoming party thereto in due time for example those that have already started or are on the verge of starting their national ratification acceptance or appr oval process or iii already started or are at the verge of starting the national accession process brazil meets the criteria under i as it is nonannex i country as per the climate convention and has ratified the kyoto protocol costeffectiveness and sustainability will play major role in selection and approval of ncdf projects projects are drawn from broad range of technologies and processes in energy industry and tr ansport which provide various vehicles for generating ers which contribute to sustainable development and achieve 42transfer of cleaner and more efficient chnology to host countries vrom ranks technologies in the following descending order i ren ewable energy technology such as geothermal wind solar and smallscale hydro powe r ii clean sustainably grown biomass waste iii energy efficiency improvement iv fossil fuel switch and methane recovery v sequestration brazil novagerar project has been approved by vrom and is part of the ncdf business plan for the period up to december 2002 the most important kyoto protocol requirement for cdm projects is that reductions in emissions are additional to any that would occur in the absence of the certified project activity this envir onmental additionality of the project is assessed against baseline which describes what wou ld happen without the proposed project the landfill gas projects are based on the collection nd utilization of landfill gas which is currently released in an uncontro lled manner this will lead to reductions of landfill gases rich in methane high ly potent greenhouse gas and potential reductions of ghg emissions associated with the use of fossil fuels used for generation of electricity the collection and reduction of landfill gases would not occur without the project involvement the landfill gas project clearly exceeds th requirements of brazilian regulations since they will ensure that landfills are managed according to the latest environmental standards aiming at collectin g the highest amount of landfill gases this represents an unprecedented investment in this type of activity in brazil there is not policy and regulatory framework which wou ld indicate certain quantity of methane to be flared or combusted and used for power generation national and state regulations will be checked period ically as part of the monitoring plan for the project to gu arantee that the project maintains the additionality as indicated as ne cessary under the kyoto protocol in the case of power generation it demonstrates tha t the current situation for small scale power producer is very risky due to low energy sales prices to be achieved on the market this would prevent private in vestors to go ahead with using methane gas for energy generation once it is not the most economic way to produce energy in parallel to the risks related to power sales there are further entrepreneurial risks such as the uncertainty of the exact amount of ndfill gas available over the years and the performance of the plant given that there is not single landfill site in brazil generating electricity this is seen as unproven technology by local investors 43 the additional value derived from the sale of carbon credits appears to increase the projects financial returns to level sufficien t to justify the inherent risks associated with longterm investment decisions and capital allocation for landfill gas collection systems and electricity generation equipment the novagerar baseline study confirmed the eligibility and viability of the proposed project particularly the study i confirmed the environmental additionality of the project and ii esti mated the quantity of ers that the project is expected to generate by reducing methane emissions an d fossil fuel replacement on the energy market the baseline approach adopted for the novage rar project is in accordance with the cdm rules the scenario that represents emissions fro m technology that represents an economically ttractive course of action taking into account barriers to investment the novagerar project circumstances pe rmit the use of simplified financial analysis to determin the baseline scenario the proposed project involves significant investment in power generation that must compete with other such investments it is therefor appropriate to assume that the decision between alternative baseline scenarios is based on an investment calculus the methodology involves an analysis of the economic attractiveness of the project alternative without the revenue from carb on credits using an irr calculation and comparison of the results with reasonab expected return on investment in brazil the results show that the project is not an economically attractive course of action the only other plausible scenario is continued nonutilization of landfill gas this scenario is determined as th baseline scenario based on an analysis of current practices and current and foreseea ble regulations in the waste management sector 35 social and environmental impact socioeconomic benefits source proj ect concept document the world bank the project will have positive impact on amenity nd the communities in the local area contaminated leachate and rface runoff from landfills can affect downgradient ground and surface water quality and have secondary impacts on the health of the local environment and the local population the uncontrolled release of landfill gas can also lead to risks of expl osions in the local surroundings 44by managing the marambaia and adrianopolis landfill sites properly the health risks and the potential for explosions is greatly r educed the project will also have small but positive im pact on employment in the local area as number of staff will n eed to be recruited to manage the landfill gas sites appropriate management of the land fill sites will also decrease the risk of landslide on the sites reduces risks to employees and surrounding population the project aims to promote capacity building seminars demonstrating best practices in waste management and cont ract so far illegal workers legally the project was subject to an environmen tal license process mandated by federal and state laws one of the stages consisted in the d evelopment of an environmental impact assessment where all of the environmental and social issues were analyzed also the mitigating initiatives to be implemented by the entrepreneurs for each of the project implantation stag were described this assessment was subject to public hearin g coordinated by the state environmental agency feema all of the relevant i ssues involving environmental or social interfaces proposed by any of the hearing attendants were registered and the entrepreneur should review the environm ental impact assessment to address any registered issues that may arise another stage in the license process co nsisted in an opinion poll with the participation of the different stakeholders who were in any way involved in or affected by the business implementation summary of the poll results is presented in appendix c the conclu sive comments are presented below according to the civil society segments co nsidered as opinion makers concerning to the open dump remediation and impl ementation of nova iguaçu sanitary landfill with methane gas energetic use public sector departments the project beneficiaries will be in the ma jority the population and the society and the greatest contribution of the project will be the global effort to fight against the climatic change the qualification generation of knowledge aiming the quality of life environment improvement will be the most important environmental socialeconomical factor non governamental organization 45the population will be the projects greate st beneficiary and the best contribution will be the promotion of green energy generation the most important environmental so cialeconomical factor will be the qualification generation of knowledge aiming the quality of life environment improvement the compensation to the environmental relia bility for greenhouse effects in brazil the incentive for production systems that generate environmental services to the global society the qualification genera tion of knowledge aiming the quality of life environment improvement and the awar eness of sustainable model are the most likely effects to occur scavengers association the local community will be the greatest beneficiary with the implementation of the project due to the increase in jobs the public power positioning will happen with the increase in jobs the increase in the quality of life and the conversion of the environmental liability for the greenhouse effect to investing countries private enterprise the beneficiaries of the project will be in the majority the population the city government and the entrepreneurs the grea test contributions of the project will be the global effort to fight against the c limatic change and the improvement of the companys image in brazil the most important environmental so cialeconomical factor will be the qualification generation of knowledge aiming the improvement of quality of life environment international entities the population will be the projects greate st beneficiary and the major contribution will be the global effort to fight against the climatic change the increase of income of workers producers directly invo lved will be the most important environmental soci

life environment and sustainable model awareness are the most likely effects that will probably occur wastepickers or scavengers called catadores in portuguese they are the people who pick up recyclable material in the landfills or in the streets environmental benefits source projec t concept document the world bank regarding the current precarious waste ma nagement situation in brazil specially in the final disposal sector as showed in the introduction of this study the project will generate many additional environmental benefits by collecting and combusting landfill gas the projecte d sanitary landfill will reduce both global and local environm ental effects of uncontrolled releases although the majority of landfill ga s emissions are quickly diluted by the atmosphere in confined spaces there is ri sk of asphyxiation and or toxic effects if landfill gas is present at high concentratio ns landfill gas also contains over 150 trace components that can cause other local and global environmental effects such as odor nuisances stratospheric ozone yer depletion and groundlevel ozone creation through appropriate and or improved management of the sites landfill gas will be captured and combusted removing the risk s of toxic effects on the local community and local environment in most cases the waste disposal situat ion is precarious leachate is directly going into the groundwater and small ri vers heading to the baia guanabara novagerar by providing appropriate m anagement on the site these potential problems should be avoided other potential hazards and amenity impacts minimiz ed by appropriate management of the landfill sites include the risks of fire or explosions landfill gas migration dust odor pests vermin unsi ghtliness and litter each of which may occur onsite or offsite where landfill gas utilization schemes such as the novagerar project are developed in countries like brazil there is also an opportunity to promote best practices to improve landfill managemen t standards and contribute towards global sustainable development 4740 p roj ct ve lop nt p hase 41 partnership arrangements and business plan ownership of waste landfill

sine qua condition to keep the project in operation considering the nat ural reaction that landfill provokes in the neighboring po pulation big effort was developed during the licensing period which happened during 2002 2003 due to the reaction of some political groups the last related ev ent occurred in september 9 when the project received an important nomination related to the local agenda 21 which was granted by the federal legislative group formed by senators and federal deputies nova gerar t ook this chance and organized an important event on the si in which many senators deputies the vice governor and state secretary of environment m ayors stakeholders and people from the nearby community have participated the event consisted in seminar followed by visit to the landfill it has been covered by the press and it had an important re gional repercussion these items will be detailed latter as the implementation of the gas recovery and utilization project has not yet commenced 47

of warrantees and performance guarantees not applicable at this phase of the project 50 summary of case study xpe rie nce 51 important lessons learned the most important lesson we have learned up to th current phase of the project is that since the very beginning in any dertaking that involves close relation to the public service and to the community the undertakers should be willing to show the general public transparence and credibility regarding the projects objectives any action that involves waste landfills has as result the reaction of the community from the surroundings th erefore the previous contact to the population next to the installation cl early showing the project details and the compensatory measures predicted is an ssential initiative to contribute to the undertaking implementation process feasibility it is also crucial the strict compliance with all applicable laws specially regardin g the environmental aspects in order to avoid nongovernmental organizations prosecuting counsel and environmental control institut ions antagonistic actions 52 summary critique of proj ect development experie nces up to the current phase of the project the undertaker s have led the whole process successfully from the moment they won th bid for adrianópolis sanitary landfill concession it was necessary the articulation among the different institutions involved in the permit process and in special of the adrianópolis community where the new landfill was implemented its interesting to realize that the reaction to the implementation of new landfill is always very strong even when it results into closing highly pollutant open dump as it was the marambaia landfill where 52there was protection against the leachate infiltration into th soil the waste was not covered there were permanent fires and there wa s constant emission of particles and bad odors during the wh ole implementation process there were many lawsuits trying to obstruct the continuity of the work but finally the environmental control agency feema granted the permit for installation and operation then it began the work for th old landfill environmental recovery and the waste final disposal in suitable vironmental way in the new landfill of adrianópolis the implementation of the recovery system and use of g as and the beginning of the process for carbon credit sale resulted fr om the reduction of carbon emissions to the atmosphere through pcfprototype carbon fund m anaged by the world bank also demanded great articulation capability by the undertakers together with nova iguaçu city administration once it wasnt initiative anticipated at the time of the landfill concession contract finally it should be observed that the negotiations with the world bank for any project that aims the carbon credit sale is lengthy and demands the compliance with series of ph ases until the final agreement is executed the carbon credit sale is not an easy task to execute successfully and it is necessary mainly to be able to provide guarantee of operational continuity within the paramete rs established in the beginning of the project hardly the city public administra tion is able to guarantee the operational conditions of the project in period longer than 10 years besides other factors thats due to the fact that in brazil there are ele ction processe s for mayors every 4 years and the changes in the public admi nistration might alter the citys waste management guidelines so that hardly project for the recovery and use of gas and the consequently carbon credit sale would be successful without longterm concession contract where all the guarantees for the com pliance of the agreement would be provided by privat group that is the case of the nova gerar project which is at this moment beginning the fi rst phase of the project implementation the burnt and generation of energy fr om the gas generated in the marambaia landfill which environmental recovery has b een developed it is expected for this phase to start in j anuary 2004 it is also expected for 2004 the beginning of the gas exploitation in adrianópolis new landfill ap p ndix 1 environmental permit

opinion survey on the open dump remediation and the implementation of the new nova iguaçu sanitary landf ill with energetic use of methane gas february 2003 1 presentation the brazilian association of environmenta l and sanitary engineering associação brasileira engenharia sanitária ambien tal rio j aneiro section abesrio was contracted by novagerar ecoenergia ltda to implement an opinion survey on the open dump remediation and impl ementation of the new nova iguaçu sanitary landfill both projects includin g an energetic use of methane gas the opinion survey used specific questionnaires as inv estigation tool these questionnaires aim different targetpop ulation which are public segment departments nongovernmental organizatio ns and associations private enterprises and international entities connected to the solid waste issue aiming to obtain an homogenous opinion about the energetic use of methane gas from the biodegradation organic matter present in the solid waste mass disposed as open dump and or landfills 2 obj ective the survey aimed to analyze the opinio n of the scientifictechnical community together with nongovernmental organizat ions from baixada fluminensecoastal lowland region of the state of rio j aneiro that w ork in the environmental sector society organizations from the l andfill surroundings and also the private and public segments related to that sector on the issue of energy generation from the energetic use of methane gas that comes from the b iodegradation of organic 65matter present in the solid waste mass disposed at adrianópolis sanitary landfill and at marambaia open dump 3 methodology the adopted methodology was comprised of three stages as it follows stage 1 covered the identification of different groups ntities and or individuals that formed the surveys target population at f i r s t i t wa s i n t i f i d s u b g r ou p s t hat would cover the institutions that take part in the survey they are public sector nongovernmental organizations private sector of the solid waste energy or gas area international entities wastepickers scavengers associations then the institutions that formed each bgroup were identified according to the following criteria groups that directly or indirectly migh t affect or be affected by the project groups with role to play in the project and their capacity to play it groups which occasionally negative responses to the project might strongly influence it the city state and national institutions with the h eadquarter in rio j aneiro metropolitan region besides the internatio nal institutions with the headquarter in brazil were defined as the sample universe of the sur vey the quantity of entities that took part in the analysis might be different from the quantity initially forecasted at the survey planning the addition of new entities is due to the lack of responses by some entities questio ned or to the interest that the question raised during the process during the planning stage of this survey 34 entities were identified and contacted stage 2 was the definition of the strate gy to contact the entities then it was decided for the personal and separate inte rviews for each entity that formed the targetpopulation using standardized qu estionnaires especially elaborated for each one of the five subgroups 66before the questionnaires were applied there was always speech about the enterprise explaining the adrianópolis landfill the marambaia open dump recovery and the project of biogas energetic use and th reduction of greenhouse gases the personal contact has been used to cl arify occasional doubts expressed by the interviewees assuring more effective result in order to elaborate the questionnaires it was sidered the expectation of the entity concerning the

subsectorial charts and demonstrative graphics from the 34 entities initially contacted one preferred not to make declarations about the issue and 14 did not respond to the several requests for appointment or for filling in the suitable questionnaire after adding new entities which were representative of the public sector and of the scavengers associations the final number of interviewees was 25 distributed as it follows public sector 11 nongovernmental organizations 3 private sector in energy and gas area 2 international entities 2 scavengers representatives 7 the survey application the survey was executed thought the application of sp ecific questionnaires in each sector defined as target population totalizing 25 tw enty five interviews as it follows public sector11 eleven ngo 3

05 five researchers in appendix 5 it is presented the exampl of questionnaires applied in each civil society segment when the field work was concluded the ta bulation stage was carried out resulting into data bank by types of response s to the subjects that comprised the questionnaire according to the five segments of the organized civil society defined as target population after that in february 2003 it was researched 79 f the total universe of scavengers from marambaia open dump totalizing 70 people from the 89 previously registered the results obtained were all of them declared to keep that activity due to the lack of alternatives in the formal job market and or to complement the family inco it was verified that 100 of them live in the open dump surroundings and all of them believe that there w ill be an environmental improv ement with the closing of marambaia and the operation of adrianópolis treatment center nevertheless the fear of the scavengers community is to lose the financial gain during the explanation about the undertakin g we tried to highlight the use of biogas for electric energy generation and the reduction of greenhouse gases the population of scavengers is not opposed to the project but point out that the project as whole has to generate jobs and income all the scavengers point out possibl way to implement cooperative below the graphic shows the percentage of scavengers who think that there will be improvement in working conditions 88 and those ones who do not believe in that improvement 12 68gráfico demonstrativo em relação à melhoria do trabalho 8812 simnão figure 12 public opinion results abou t better job quality due to the project the segment reported hopes the undertaking to be an other job creator besides searching for the environmenta l conditions improvement 6 conclusion the conclusive comments are presented be low according to the civil society segments considered as opinion ma kers concerning to the open dump remediation and implementation of nova iguaçu sanita ry landfill with methane gas energetic use public sector departments the project beneficiaries will be in the ma jority the population and the society and the greatest contribution of the project will be the global effort to fight against the climatic change the qualification generation of knowledge aiming the quality of life environment improvement will be the most important environmental socialeconomical factor the most likely effects to occur are the compensation for the environmental liability for greenhouse gases emissions in brazil nd the incentive for the production systems that generate environmental servi ces to the global society the criteria of carbon sequestration that are most suitable for definition of sustainable development are the reforestation and th use of alternative fuel 69the actors should be informed before th implementation most of these actors have little knowledge about the project so that the pedagogical awareness is the best methodology for the local community to get to kno w the project the possibility of regional integration and articulation to other segments will be higher with the creation of model of energy recycling and its expansion to other regions the community will be an active partner and the contribution to this community will imply exchange j obgeneration is the activity pr oposed by the executers that most generates income and most of them think that action or influence will dissatisfy the community in the surroundings non governamental organization the population will be the projects greate st beneficiary and the best contribution will be the promotion of green energy generation the most important environmental so cialeconomical factor will be the qualification generation of knowledge aiming the quality of life environment improvement the compensation to the environmental relia bility for greenhouse effects in brazil the incentive for production systems that generate environmental services to the global society the qualification genera tion of knowledge aiming the quality of life environment improvement and the awar eness of sustainable model are the most likely effects to occur the actors who need to be informed are the residents association and the local public power the best methodology for the local commun ity to get to know the project will be through the project pres entation in the media and communitary centers the possibility of regional integration and the articulation to other segments will be higher with the development of environmental awar eness the community will be an active partner and the contri bution of the project to the local needs will be through the solid waste separati on checking the interests of the 70community and the awareness about single sustainable model the last one will always require some kind of exchange the environmental credibility for the city will be the greatest advantage for the local environmental infrastr ucture when implementing the project and in the opinion of the majority action or in fluence will dissatisfy the community in the surroundings scavengers association the local community will be the greatest beneficiary with the implementation of the project due to the increase in jobs the public power positioning will happen with the increase in jobs the increase in the quality of life and the conversion of the environmental liability for the greenhouse effect to investing countries the reduction of methane gas emission to the atmosphere and the introduction of renewable energy are the criteria of projects for carbon sequestration that are most suitable for sustainable development definition the regional integration and the arti culation with other sectors in the implementation of the project will happen with the development of the environmental awareness and the creation of model of energy recycling and its expansion to other regions the relative increase in jobs will be th greatest advantage for the environmental infrastructure resulting from the implementa tion of project of that dimension private enterprise the beneficiaries of the project will be in the majority the population the city government and the entrepreneurs the grea test contributions of the project will be the global effort to fight against the c limatic change and the improvement of the companys image in brazil 71the most important environmental so cialeconomical factor will be the qualification generation of knowledge aiming the improvement of quality of life environment the captivation of investments an d currency for the region the qualification generation of knowledge aiming the improvement of quality of life environment and the quantity of jobs generated will probably be the most likely effects to occur the criteria of carbon sequestration that are most suitable for definition of sustainable development are those which ar environmentally correct socially fair and economically feasible t h p u b l i c r g n s s w l l t h s c i t h v t b i n f r m d b f r t h implementation and the best methodology for the local community to get to know the project will be through speeches pres entations information dissemination and democratization the creation of an energy recycling mode l and its expansion to other regions increase the possibility of regional inte gration and the articulation to other segments the community will be an active partner mainly if it gets to know the project well and in the opinion of half of the interv iewees problems with odor and risks of accidents and explosions might dissatisf the community in the surroundings the participation of the private sector wi ll be extremely important together with the state and the tax benefits for the companies international entities the population will be the projects greate st beneficiary and the major contribution will be the global effort to fight against the climatic change the increase of income of workers producers directly invo lved will be the most important environmental soci aleconomical factor the incentive for production systems that generate env ironmental services to the global society the qualification generation of knowled ge aiming the improvement 72of quality of life environment and sustainable model awareness are the most likely effects that will probably occur the actors that have to be informed are th residents association the local public power the scavengers association and the community the environmental education is the best methodology for the local communi ty to perceive the project the search for partnerships in order to promote dynamism in the sector as well the shared management to generate energy and the develo pment of environmental awareness will be the most important fact ors to enable the regional integration and the articulation to other segments the community might be an active partner depending n the leadership the project contribution to the local need s will be selective collection workshops and courses that contribution will alwa ys be connected to clear and perceptible exchanges the greatest advantages for the local envi ronmental infrastructure resulting from the project implementation will be the increa in local jobs and the contribution in reducing the greenhouse effect there will not be actions intrinsic to th project that might dissatisfy the local community the perception of nonappropriate actions mig ht emerge from the community distrust in the clearness of actions due to the level of its members unknowingness on the other hand even when knowing the projects actions if those actions are not well executed the cal community might be dissatisfied wastepickers or scavengers called catadores in portuguese they are the people who pick up recyclable material in the landfills or in the streets 73
