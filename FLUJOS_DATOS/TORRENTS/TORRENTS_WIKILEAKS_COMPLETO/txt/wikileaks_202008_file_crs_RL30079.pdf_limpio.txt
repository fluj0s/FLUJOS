investigations and administ rative and legal actions against numerous domestic corporations revealed th at the practice of making questionable or illegal payments by united states corporations to foreign government officials existed to some extent within the american business community the legal and regulatory mechanisms for dealing with these payments had involved actions by the securitie s and exchange commission sec against public corporations for concealing fro m required public disclosure substantial paymen ts made by the firm and the potential for an antitrust action for restraints of trade or fraud prosecutions by the justic department government officials and administrators co ntended that more direct prohibitions on foreign bribery and more detailed requirements concerning corporate recor d keeping and accountability were needed to deal effectively with the problem th revelations of slush funds and secre t payments by american corporations were stated to have ffected adversely american foreign policy damaged abroad the image f american democracy and impaired public confidence in the financial integrity f american corporations congress responded with the passage of the foreig n1 corrupt practices act of 19772 the principal purpose of the 1977 act was to prevent corporate bribery f foreign officials it has three basic provisi ons to accomplish this purpose 1 the act amended section 13b of the securities exchange act of 1934 to require issuer s3 4 which must register their securities with the sec to keep detailed books records and accounts which accurately record corporate payments and transactions 2 c registered issuers must institute and maintain an internal accounting control system to assure management s control authority and responsibility over the firms assets5 3 domestic corporations whether or not registered with the sec are prohibite d from corruptly bribing foreign official foreign political party party official r candidate for the purpose of obtaining or maintaining busine ss two provisions of the 1977 act provide crim inal penalties for any american business which uses the mails6 or interstate commerce corruptly in furtherance of an

prohibits the payment of money to any person by business if the business knew or had reason to know that the payment was to be used to bribe foreign official for his influence in obtaining or retaining business congressional intent appears to place an affirmative responsibility on the corporation to exercis control over its offi cers directors and employees and to take steps to assure that its foreign agents are not using corporate assets or payments made to them to brib foreign officials7 under the 1977 act not all payments to employ ees of foreign governments were intended by congress to be considered illegal bribes for example the definition of foreign official excluded employees of foreign government whose duties ar essentially ministerial or clerical also the legislative history of the act specifically states that it was not intended to cover grease payments to foreign officials explained as payments for expediting shipments through customs or placing transatlantic telephone call securing required permits or obtaining adequate police protection transactio ns which may involve even the proper performance of duties8 the legislative history also suggests t hat extortions of money by foreign officials may be used as defense against bribery charges by business if its property or lives of its employees have been threaten ed an example used to illustrate acceptable payments was the payment to foreign official to prevent the dynamiting of an oil rig9 almost since passage of the 1977 act there has been frequent criticism of it s operation opponents have argued that grey areas of the law where what i s permitted may not be clear have had chilling effect on united states export trade because many companies have ceased foreign operations rather than face th uncertai nties in the foreign corrupt practices act some critics of the act hav contended that these provisions have cost up to 1000000000 annually in t united states export trade critics of the act have argued for precise and specifi c guidelines to be enacted as to what is prohibited and what particular conduct i s permitted instead of the vague standards of the 1977 act and have argued fo r precise sta tutory language to effectuate congresss original intent to allow grease payments critics of the 1977 act also argued for the removal of the reason to know standard concerning liability for actions of firms agent in foreign country this would eliminate the legal responsibility of the management of domestic firm over the unauthorized and undirected actions of an agent without the necessity f managements also showing that it had n reason to know that the agent was using corporate funds payments or commissions to bribe foreign officials these critic s argued that american firms should not have to bear the responsibility of playin g detective co ncerning the independent actions of persons that they retained as agents in foreign countrieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30079pl 100418 102 stat 110710 h rept 100576 100 cong 2d sess at 916917 198811 thcritics also contended that the internal acc ounting controls required by the 1977 act were too costly and burdensome upon domestic firms especially when potential criminal penalties within the act for failure to institute adequate controls arguabl made officials of firms overly and unnecessarily cautious in implementing costl accounting controls the public record keeping requirements were also criticized as unduly burdensome critics of the act argued for materiality standard for publi c record keeping in which firm would be required only to report expenditures an d outlays deemed material to the profits and revenues of the firm another frequent criticism of the 1977 act was that the united states was more interested in exporting its cultural biases than its products it was argued that i n nations in which acceptance of fee or payment by government official from one doing business with the gove rnment is customary and not unlawful under the laws of that nation violation of united states l aw should occur critics also argued that an international agreement among the worlds industrialized nations prohibitin g businesses of all those countries from bribing foreign officials was necessary t prevent businesses of other co untries from gaining an unfair and harmful competitive advantage over american businesses in respons to these criticisms congress for number of years considere d amending the 1977 foreign corrupt practices act after great deal of debat through at least three congresses the f oreign corrupt practices act amendments of 1988 were signed into law as title v of the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 on august 23 1988 although the amendments maintained the three major10 parts of the 1977 act discussed abov the accounting standards the requirements of sec registered issue rs and the antibribery provisions the 1988 amendments made some significant changes in the 1977 act section 5002 of the trade act amen ds section 13b of the securities exchange act to provi that criminal liability shall be imposed for violation of th accounting standards unless person knowingly circumvents or knowingly fails t implement system of accurate and reasonable accounting trols according to the legislative history this provision is intended to ensure that criminal penalties would be imposed where acts of commission or omission in keeping books or records r administering accounting controls have the purpose of falsifying books records or accounts or of circumventing the accounting controls this is also intended to include the deliberate falsification of books and records and othe r conduct calculated to evade the internal accounting controls requirement11 section 5002 of the trade act also adds to section 13b of the securitie s exchange act provision that an issuer which holds 50 or less of the voting power of dome stic or foreign firm is required to use its influence only in good faith t cause the domestic or foreign firm to devise and maintain system of acceptabl accountin g controls the house report states that this amendment is

influence over the accounting practices of subsidiary12 for purposes of the accounting standards reasonable assurances an d reasonable detail mean such level of detai l and degree of assurance as would satisfy prudent officials in the conduct of their own affairs thus the prudent ma n qualificat ion was adopted to clarify that the current standard does not require n unrealistic degree of exactitude or precision section 5003 of the trade act amends the provisions of the foreign corrup t practices act which concern the antibribery prohibitions by issuers and domesti c concerns it remains prohibited for any issuer which has class of securitie s registered with the sec urities and exchange commission or for any officer director employee or agent of the issuer or any stockholder acting on behalf of the issuer or for any united states concern to make use of the mails or other means of interstate commerce to offer pay promise to give or authorize the giving of anything of value to foreign official foreign political party party official candidate or any person for the purpose of obtaining or maintaining business sect ion 5003 amended the 1977 act to prohibit payments to any foreign official for the pur pose of influencing any act or decision of such foreign official in his official capacity or inducing such foreig n official to do or omit to do any act in violation of the lawful duty of such official this language was inserted so that the f oreign bribery standard would conform to the domestic bribery standard found in 18 usc section 20113 the knowing requirement is retained and the recklessly disregarding standard was abandoned in conference however the knowing requirement i s intended to encompass the conscious disregard and willful blindness standards including conscious purpose to avoid learning the truth the conferees agreed that simple negligence or mer foolishness should not be the basis for liability however the conferees also agreed that the socalled headinthesand problemvariousl described in the pertinent authorities as conscious disregard willfu l blindness or deliberate ignoranceshould be covered so tha t management offici als could not take refuge from the acts prohibitions by their unwarranted obliviousness to any action or inaction language r other signaling device that should reasonably alert them of the hig h probability of an fcpa violation14 the major changes which section 5003 of the trade act makes in the 197 7 foreign corrupt practices act have to do with when the bribery provisions will not be found to apply to an american busines s or person acting on behalf of an american business for example the antibribery provisions shall not apply to any facilitating or expediting payment to foreign official political party or party official if th purpose is to expedite or to secur the performance of routine governmental action by foreign official political party or party officialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30079further an american business or individual may use one of the affirmativ defenses in urging that violation of the fcpa has occurred the first of thes enumer ated affirmative defenses is that the payment gift offer or promise f anything of value that was made was lawfu l under the written laws and regulations of the foreign officials political partys party officials or candidates country another affirmative defense is tha t the payment gift offer or promise of anything of value that was made was reasonable and bona fide expenditure such as travel and lodging expenses which were incurred by or on behalf of foreign official party party official or candidate and was dir ectly related to the promotion demonstration or explanation of pr oducts or services or the execution or performance of contract with foreign government or agency this defense would not apply however if payment or gift is corruptly made in return for an official act or omission because it would then not be bona fide good faith payment the attorney general after consulting with certain name d other federal officials is required to issue guidelines which describe specific types of conduct which would fit within the affirmative defenses and also general precautionary procedures which issuers may use in order to comply with the amendments the attorney general is also required to issue an opinion wit hin thirty days of request to provide response to specific inquiry by an issuer concerning the conformance of its conduct wit h department of justice guidelines in the definitional sections of the amendments the terms knowing and routine governmental action are especially important persons state of mind is knowing with respect to conduct circumstance or re sult if the person is aware of engaging in the conduct that the circumstance exists or that the result is substantially certain to occur or if the person has firm belief that the circumst ance exists or that the result is substant ially certain to occur when knowledge of the existence of particula r circumstance is required for an offense the knowledge is established if person i s aware of high probability of the existence of the circumstance unless the perso n actually believes that the circumstance does not exist routine governmental action is only ordinarily and commonly performed by foreign official in ob taining permits licenses or other official documents to qualify person to do business in foreign country processing governmental papers providing police protection mail pickup and delivery or scheduling inspection s associated with contract performance or inspect ions related to transit of goods across country or providing phone service power and water supply loading and unloading cargo or protecting perishable products or commodities from dete rioration the term does not include any decision by foreign of ficial whether or on what terms to award new business to or to continue business with particular firm the amendments also increased penalties for violations of the foreign corrupt practices act the maximum crim inal fine for firm or domestic concern was raised from 10000 00 to 2000000 and for individuals from 10000 to 100000 the maximum potential imprisonment for an ind ividual remained at five years there was also new civil penalty of 10000 one of the continuing criticisms of the fcpa was that amer ican businesses were at disadvantage in obtaining business abroad because many of the othe r industrialized nations d not have severe penalties for bribing foreign officials over the years there has been considerable amount of international interest i nhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30079oecd member countries are austria australia belgium canada czech

business transactions convention signing ceremony occurred in paris on december 17 1997 in many ways the oecd convention on bribery is very similar to the foreign corrupt practices act however there were few differences which necessitate d changes in the fcpa in order for the fcpa to conform with the oecd agreement in the 105 congress these needed changes were enacted as pl 105366th pl 105366
