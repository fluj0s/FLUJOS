before 1984 are covered by the civil service retirement system csrs federal employees hired in 1984 or later are covered by the federal employees retirement system fer s both csrs and fers require participants to contribute toward the cost of the plans through payroll tax employees who are covered by csrs contribute 70 of pay to the civil service retirement and disability fund csrdf they do not pay social security taxes and are not eligible for social security benefits employees who are covered under fers contribute 08 of their full pay to the civil service trust fund and pay 62 of wages up to 97500 in 2007 to social security the minimum retirement age mra under csrs is 55 for workers who have at least 30 years of service starting in 2003 the minimum retirement age under fers began to rise for workers who attain age 55 in 2007 the mra under fers is 55 and 10 months it will reach age 57 for those born in 1970 or later fers and csrs also allow retirement with an unreduced pension at age 60 for employees with 20 or more years of service and at age 62 for workers with at least 5 years of service the thrift savings plan tsp is defined contribution retirement plan similar to the 401k plans provided by many employers in the private sector in 2007 employees covered under either csrs or fers can contribute up to 15500 to the tsp employees age 50 and older can contribute an additional 5000 to the tsp employees covered by fers receive employer matching contributions of up to 5 of pay from the federal agency by which they are employed federal workers covered by csrs also can participate in the tsp but they receive matching contributions from their employing agency the office of personnel management opm estimates the cost of csrs to be an amount equal to 25 of employee pay the federal government pays 18 of this amount and the other 70 is paid by employees opm estimates the cost of the fers basic annuity at an amount equal to 12 of pay the federal government contributes 112 of this amount and the other 08 is paid by employees there are three other employer costs for employees covered by fers both the employer and employee pay social security taxes equal to 62 of pay up to the maximum taxable amount agencies automatically contribute an amount equal to 1 of employee pay to the tsp and agencies also make matching contributions to the tsp at the start of fy2006 the civil service retirement and disability fund had an unfunded liability of 576 billion consisting of 581 billion deficit for csrs and 5 billion surplus for fers although the civil service trust fund has an unfunded liability it is not in danger of becoming insolvent at point over the next 75 years will the fund be exhausted the civil service retirement and disability trust fund is invested in specialissue us treasury bonds congress could permit the trust fund to invest in other assetssuch as corporate stocks and bondsbut the effects of such change on the federal budget and on government ownership of privatesector assets would deserve careful consideration by congress

help them attract workers with valuable skills and to enable older workers to retire without facing the prospect of inadequate income employers must balance the goals of providing ad equate retirement income with controlling the cost of the retirement program for employ ers in the private sector another important consideration is the regulatory environment in which their retirement plans must operate privatesector retirement plans must comply with the relevant provisions of federal law including the employee retirement income security act erisa the age discrimination in employment act adea and the internal revenue code g22g160g152g561g22g162g153g142g156g561g152g143g561g20g142g157g146g155g142g150g142g151g157g561g18g149g138g151g156g561 retirement programs generally can be classified as either defined benefit plans or defined contribution plans in defined benefit plan workers retirement benefit is typically paid as life annuity based on years of service and average salary in the last few years before retirement1 defined contribution plan is much like savings account maintained by the employer on behalf of each participating employee the employer contributes specific dollar amount or percentage of pay into the account which is usually invested in stocks and bonds in some cases the amount that the employer contributes depends on the amount the employee contributes from his or her pay when the worker retires the retirement benefit that he or she receives will depend on the balance in the account which is the sum of all the contributions that have been made plus interest dividends and capital gains or losses the retiring worker usually has the choice of receiving these funds as series of fixed payments over period of years as lump sum or in the form of life annuity one important difference between these two types of retirement plans is that in defined benefit plan it is the employer who bears the financial risk whereas in defined contribution plan it is the employee who bears the financial risk in defined benefit plan the employer promises to provide retirement benefits in the form of life annuity or its actuarial equivalent 2 to pay the promised benefit the employer must make contributions to pension fund that is invested in stocks bonds and other assets the employers contributions to this fund plus the expected investment earnings on the contributions must be sufficient to pay the pension benefits that workers have earned under the plan the employer is at risk for the full amount of retirement benefits that have been promised to employees and their survivors if the pension plan is underfunded the employer must make additional contributions so that the promised benefits can be paid in defined contribution plan the employer bears risk beyond its obligation to contribute specified dollar amount or percentage of pay to each employees retirement account in these plans the employee bears the risk that his or her retirement account will be sufficient to provide adequate retirement income if the contributions to the account are insufficient or if the securities in which the account is invested lose value or appreciate too slowly the employee might reach 1 joint and survivor annuity pays smaller initial benefit in exchange for guarantee that the workers spouse will continue to receive an nnuity after the retired workers death 2 the actuarial equivalent of life annuity is lumpsum payment that could purchase an annuity of equal value assuming certain interest rate and life expectancy

congress passed the civil service retirement act of 1920 pl 66215 to provide pension benefits for civilian federal employees in 1935 congress created the social security system for workers in the private sector in the 1950s congress allowed state and local governments to bring their employees into social security and today about threefourths of state and local employees are covered by social security federal employees remained outside of social security until congress passed the social security amendments of 1983 pl 9821 this law required all civilian federal employees hired into permanent employment after january 1 1984 to be covered by social security enrolling federal workers in both csrs and social security would have resulted in substantial duplication of benefits and would have required employees to contribute more than 13 of pay to the two programs consequently congress directed the development of new retirement system for federal workers with social security as its cornerstone the new plan was intended to incorporate many features of the retirement progra ms of large employers in the private sector the result of this effort was the federal employee retirement system act of 1986 pl 99335 enacted on june 6 1986 fers has three elements social security the fers basic annuity defined benefit plan and the thrift savings plan defined contribution plan fers now covers all federal employees initiall hired into federal employment on or after january 1 1984 and employees who voluntarily sw itched from csrs to fers during open seasons in 1987 and 1998 3 former federal employees who were vested in csrs and are later rehired by the government after break in service can either join fers or participate in the csrs offset plan under this plan 62 percenta ge points of the employees payroll contribution and an equal share of the employer contribution are diverted from csrs to the social security trust fund later the retirees csrs annuity is reduced offset by the amount of his or her social security benefit both csrs and the csrs offset program will terminate with the death of the 3 the open season held from july through dec 1998 was authorized

both csrs and fers two factors determine an employees eligibility for retirement annuity age and years of service the amount of the workers retirement annuity is determined by three factors the number of years of service the accrual rate at which benefits are earned for each year of service and the salary base to which the accrual rate is applied privatesector pensions usually provide two retireme nt options related to age and years of service most plans define normal retirement age at which workers can retire with an immediate unreduced pension according to the us depa rtment of labor among workers in private establishments that offered definedbenefit pension plans in 2003 73 of workers covered by defined benefit pensions were in plans with normal retirement age of 65 4 eightyfour percent of workers covered by defined benefit pensions were in plans that offered an early retirement option before the normal retirement age the most common early retirement option was retirement at age 55 for workers with at least 10 years of service almost all plans with an early retirement option pay reduced benefit because these pensions will on average be paid over longer period the typical reduction in the benefit amount for workers who retire early is 5 for each year below the normal age of retirement for example worker retiring at age 55 in defined benefit plan with normal retirement age of 62 would have his or her pension permanently reduced by 35 below the amount that would have been paid to an employee retiring at age 62 with the same salary and years of service

retirement income adequacy is the percentage of preretirement income replaced by pension income this measurethe replacement rate is expressed by the following ratio earnings retirementpre annualbenefits retirement annual replacement rates usually are based on the sum of the employees pension benefit and social security benefit because retirees do not have the expenses that are associated with having job most people are able to maintain their previous sta ndard of living with less income than they had while working although there is fixed rule about what comprises an adequate replacement rate most pension analysts believe retirement income should replace at least 70 to 80 of pre retirement income5 workers who had lowwage jobs generally need replacement rate near

accrue retirement benefits at the rate of 1 per year worker with 30 years of service will have accrue d pension benefit equal to 30 of high3 pay for employees in fers who have at least 20 year s of service and who work until at least age 62 the accrual rate is 11 for each year of service for example worker covered by fers who retires at 61 with 29 years of service would receive fers annuity equal to 29 of his or her high3 average pay delaying retirement by one year would increase the fers annuity to 33 of high3 average pay 30 x 11 33 federal employees covered under csrs accrue pension benefits at rates that increase with length of service workers covered by csrs accrue benefits equal to 15 of high3 pay for each of their first five years of service 175 of high3 pay for the sixth through tenth years and 20 of high3 pay for each year of service after the tenth year these accrual rates yield replacement rate of 5625 for worker who retires with 30 years of federal service csrs accrual rates are higher than the accrual rates under fers becaus employees covered by csrs do not pay social security payroll taxes or receive social security retirement benefits members of congress congressional staff federal law enforcement officers and federal firefighters accrue benefits at higher rates under both csrs and fers than do other federal employees under csrs members of congress and congressional staff accrue benefits at the rate of 25 for each year of service this results in replacement rate of 75 after 30 years of service law enforcement officers and firefighters accrue benefits at the rate of 25 for each of their first 20 years of service and 20 for each year thereafter under fers members of congress congressional staff law enforcement officers and firefighters

because social security retirement benefits cannot begin before age 62 congress included in fers temporary supplemental benefit for workers who retire before age 62 this benefit the fers supplement is paid to workers who retire at age 55 or older with at least 30 years of service or at age 60 with at least 20 years of service the supplement is equal to the estimated social security benefit for which the worker will become eligible at age 62 but is based only on the portion of social security payments that are attributable to the workers years of federal employment it is paid only until age

social security taxes of 62 on salary up to the maximum taxable wage base 97500 in 2007 participants in csrs are not covered by social security16 congress made the sum of fers contributions and social security payroll taxes equal to the csrs contribution rate so that workers with the same salary would have the same takehome pay regardless of whether they were covered by csrs or fers members of congress contribute 80 of salary to the csrdf if covered by csrs and 13 of salary if covered by fers all members of congre ss pay social security taxes regardless of whether they are covered by csrs or fers17 in the private sector employers are required by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa pl 93406 to prefund the benefits that workers earn under defined benefit plans any unfunded liability of the pension plan must be amortized over period of not more than seven years prefunding of future pension obligations is beneficial for workers because there is always the possibility that firm could go out of business firm that closes down will longer have revenues to pay its pension obligations nd if these obligations were not fully funded retirees and employees of the firm would lose some or all of their present and future pension benefits federal agency the pension benefit guarantee corporation pbgc collects premiums from employers to finance insurance against the failure of firms that have unfunded pension liabilities pbgc insurance does not guarantee that retiree will receive 100 of the pension benefits that were promised by an employer the pbgc guarantees maximum annual benefit of 49500 for worker retiring at age 65 in 2007 the maximum benefit is lower for workers who retire before 65 the federal government requires firms in the private sector to prefund employees pension benefits to ensure that if firm goes out of business there will be funds available to pay its pension obligations although the federal governme nt is unlikely to go out of business there are other reasons that congress requires federal agencies and their employees to contribute money to the civil service retirement and disability fund 18 first by providing continuous source of budget authority the trust fund allows benefits to be paid on time regardless of any delays that congress may experience in passing its annual appropriations bills secondly the balance in the trust funds acts as barometer of the governments future pension obligations given fixed pension plan contribution rate and benefit structure rising trust fund balance indicates that the government is incurring obligations to make higher pension payments in the future 19 finally prefunding pension obligations forces federal agencies to recognize the full cost 15 as mandated by the balanced budget act of 1997 pl 10533 employee contribution rates under both csrs and fers rose by 025 in jan 1999 and by further 015 in jan 2000 another increase of 01 was scheduled for jan 2001 employee contribution rates were then to revert to their base levels70 under csrs and 08 under ferson jan 1 2003 the increases in employee contribution rates under both csrs and fers were repealed effective dec 31 2000 by the fy2001 department of transportation appropriations act pl 106346 the repeal applies to all federal employees except for members of congress who continued to pay the higher contribution rate mandated by bba97 until jan 1 2003 16 former federal employees are eligible for medicare at age 65 regardless of whether they were covered by csrs or fers and federal workers in both

local governments do not face this risk either however they are more like private businesses in that they have in some cases defaulted on their public debts 19 as is explained later in this report large trust fund balance does not by itself make it easier to pay these benefits when they come due this is fundamental distinction between the federal government and other employers in their ability

employee contributions generate revenue that reduces the proportion of pension costs that must be borne by the public through income taxes and other taxes in the context of the federal budget process employee contributions may make federal workers more conscious of their role as stakeholders in these programs thus generating some protection for federal retirement benefits during the annual budget debates in fy2006 employee contributions to csrs and fers totaled 37 billion equal to 42 of the total income of the civil service retirement and disability fund the other major sources of revenue to the csrdf are agency contributions contributions of the us postal service on behalf of its employees interest on the federal bonds held by the fund and transfer from the general revenues of the us treasury this transfer is necessary because the costs of the older of the two federal retirement programs csrs are not fully covered by employee and agency contributions fers benefits are required by

that result from pay raises and costofliving adjustments21 contributions from employees and the federal agencies that employ them meet about 56 of the normal cost of csrs 140250 56 the remainin g 44 of the cost of csrs is paid from the interest earned by bonds held by the retirement and disability trust fund special contributions by the us postal service for retired postal workers and through transfers from the general revenues of the us treasury the bush administration has proposed that each federal agency should pay the full cost of csrs benefits on an accrual ba sis as is done under fers each agency would contribute to the csrdf an amount equal to 18 of payroll which represents the dynamic normal cost of csrs minus the required employee contribution of 70 of pay the office of management and budget omb states that this would require agencies to fund the full government share of the accruing cost of pensions as they are earned by all federal civilian and military employees 22 congress has not acted on the proposal opm estimated the normal cost of the fers basi c annuity at 12 of payroll in 2006 federal law requires agencies to contribute an amount equal to the normal cost of fers minus employee contributions to the program which are equal to 08 of payroll consequently the normal cost of the fers basic annuity to the federal government is equal to 112 of payroll 12008112 the federal government has three other mandatory costs for employees covered by fers social security taxes are 62 of payroll on both the employee and the employer up to the maximum taxable amount of earnings 97500 in 2007 all agencies automatically contribute an amount equal to 1 of employee pay to the tsp agencies also make matching contributions to the tsp the normal cost of fers to the federal government is therefore at least 184 of pay for the average employee or slightly higher than the rmal cost of csrs federal matching payments to the tsp can add up to 4 percentage points to this total depending on an employees voluntary contributions csrs and fers differ in the way that each federal agency must budget for its contributions toward employee pension benefits under fers each agency must include the full normal cost of the fers basic benefit 112 of pay in 2006 in its annual budget request under csrs each agency must budget only 70 contribution even though this is less than the cost of the program the costs associated with csrs that are not paid by the employee contribution of 70 and the agency contribution of 70 are treated as general obligation of the us treasury in both csrs and fers government contribu tions to the civil service retirement and disability trust fund result in the treasury issuing securities that are credited to the fund the contributions for both programs are commingled and benefits for retirees and survivors in both programs are paid from the civil service retirement and disability fund which is trust fund of the us government government contributions to the tsp go into individual accounts for each tsp participant the accounts are managed by the federal retirement thrift investment board 20 pension plans normal cost is the level percentage of pay that invested today at particular real rate of interest will be sufficient to fully finance the retirement benefits under the plan 21 two other elements of pension plans dynamic normal cost are increases in benefits that result from 1 new or expanded benefits and 2 newly covered groups of workers 22 omb news release 200147 oct 15 2001

of fy2006 the civil service retirement and disability fund had net assets of 666 billion available for benefit payments under both csrs and fers at the same time the accrued actuarial liability under the csrs and fers plans was 1242 billion 23 in other words on october 1 2005 the civil service trust fund had an unfunded actuarial liability of 576 billion all of this unfunded liability is attributable to csrs because federal law has never required that employee and agency contributions to the fund must equal the present value of benefits that employees accrue under that plan in contrast the fers act requires that the benefits accrued each year by employees covered by fers must be fully funded by contributions from employees and their employing agencies although the civil service trust fund has an unf unded liability attributable to csrs the civil service retirement and disability trust fund is not in danger of becoming insolvent according to the projections of the funds actuaries there is point over the next 75 years at which the fund will be exhausted actuarial projections of the credits that will be entered to the fund and the benefits that will be paid from it indicate that the civil service retirement and disability fund will be able to meet its financial obligations in perpetuity according to opm the total assets of the csrdf including both csrs and fers tinue to grow throughout the term of the projection and ultimately reach level of about 48 times payroll or about 23 times the level of annual benefit outlays 24 one reason that the civil service trust fund will not exhaust its resources for the foreseeable future is that all federal employees hired since 1984 are covered by fers by law the benefits that employees earn under fers must be fully funded by the sum of annual contributions made by employees and their employing agencies

retirement and disability trust fund is similar to the social security trust fund in that 100 of the monies deposited are used to purchase specialissue us treasury bonds this exchange between the trust fund and the treasury does not result in revenues or outlays for the federal government it is an intragovernmental transfer which has effect on the size of the governments budget surplus or

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 p 8 25 trust fund merely represents budget authority only revenues and outlays affect the size of the annual budget surplus or deficit the excess revenues that result in trust fund surplus therefore reduce the governments deficit or increase its surplus and the outlays for retiree and survivor benefits either reduce the governments budget surplus or increase the budget deficit however the exchange of cash for bonds or vice versa between the trust fund and the treasury does not affect the deficit because it is an exchange that occurs entirely

the trust fund to the general public in exchange for cash they can only be returned by the fund to the treasury which recognizes each bond as representing an equivalent dollarvalue of budget authority to be used for the payment of benefits to federal retirees and their survivors and for other purpose as has been reported by the united states office of management and budget these trust fund balances are available to finance future benefit payments and other trust fund expendituresbut only in bookkeeping sense the holdings of the trust funds are not assets of the government as whole that can be drawn down in the future to fund benefits instead they are claims on the treasury when trust fund holdings are redeemed to pay benefits treasury will have to finance the expenditure in the same way as any other federal expenditure out of current receipts by borrowing from the public or by reducing benefits or other expenditures the existence of large trust fund balances therefore does not by itself increase the governments ability to pay benefits 26 government trust funds however can ease the burden of future benefit payments if an increase in the trust fund balance represents net increase in national saving again quoting omb from an economic standpoint the government is able to pref und benefits only by increasing saving and investment in the economy as whole this can be fully accomplished only by simultaneously running trust fund surpluses equal to the actuarial present value of the accumulating benefits and not allowing the federal fund deficit to increase so that the trust fund surplus reduces unified budget deficit or increases unified budget surplus this would reduce federal borrowing by the amount of the trust funds surplus and increase the amount of national saving available to finance investment greater investment would increase future incomes and wealth which would provide more real economic resources to support the benefits 27

bond is an ioua promise to pay one might consider an iou from someone else to be an asset provided that the issuer is willing and able to pay the debt when it is due but writing an iou to oneself does not create an asset this analogy applies to the us treasury bonds held by the federal governments trust funds they are ious issued by one agency of the us government and held by another agency of the same government both the issuer and holder are part of the same entity the us government when federal trust funds redeem their bonds the treasury has only one source from which to obtain the required cash the public it can do this either by collecting taxes or by borrowing from the public many state and local government pension funds invest in stocks bonds mortgages real estate and other private assets if congress were to permit the civil service retirement and disability fund to acquire assets other than us treasury bondssuch as the stocks and bonds issued by private corporationssuch assets

that would effectively be partly owned by an agency of the federal government28 among the possible drawbacks of allowing the csrdf to invest in private assets are that the stocks and bonds purchased by the trust fund would displace purchases of these assets by private citizens so that while civil service retirement benefits would be prefunded it would be at the cost of reducing the amount of privatesector assets held by private citizens in scenario of full displacement there would be net increase in the amount of saving and investment in the economy just reallocation of assets in which the government would own more private sector stocks and bonds and private investors would hold more treasury bonds second issue that would have to be considered if the trust fund were to purchase private investment securities would be the funds management and investment practices who would make the investment decisions and what would be the acceptable level of investment risk for the funds the most fundamental risk of course is that poor investment choices would result in the trust fund losing value over time also what othe r criteria would govern the choice of the funds investments deciding what constitutes an appropriate investment for fund that consists mainly of monies provided by the us taxpayers would undoubtedly result in some controversies not all companies industries or countries would be seen by the public as appropriate places to invest these funds in short the question of investing trust fund assets in securities other than us treasury bonds is one that would deserve close and careful consideration of all the possible ramifications allowing the civil service retirement trust fund to invest in privatesector securities also would have implications for the federal budget currently the trust fund is credited by the treasury with agency contributions on behalf of covered employees and receives revenue in the form of employee contributions agency contributions ar intragovernmental transfers and have effect on the size of the governments annual b udget deficit or surplus employee contributions however are counted as revenues of the us gove rnment as it now operates the only outlays of the trust fund are payments to annuitants in addition to outlays for administrative expenses and some other minor categories of expenditure if the trust fund were to purchase private assets such as corporate stocks and bonds rather than us treasury bonds there would be an immediate outlay of funds this outlay by the trust fund would be paid for in part by employee contributions that would be diverted from the general fund of the treasury the remainder of the purchase financed by agency contributions would replace an intragovernmental transfer with direct outlay of federal funds because the treasury would longer receive employee contributions toward csrs and fers as revenue it would have to borrow an equal amount from the public consequently without an offsetting reduction in outlays elsewhere in the budget or an increase in revenues from another source the net effect of these transactions would be an increase in the governments budget deficit or decrease in the budget surplus if the budget accounting period extended over long enough period of time these transactions would cancel one another out because the longterm effect is merely to move some outlays from the future where they would have occurred as 28 the railroad retirement and survivors improvement act of 2001 pl 10790 authorizes the railroad retirement trust fund to acquire corporate stocks bonds and other assets to fund railroad retirement benefits according to the congressional budget office such an action has clear precedent and raises
