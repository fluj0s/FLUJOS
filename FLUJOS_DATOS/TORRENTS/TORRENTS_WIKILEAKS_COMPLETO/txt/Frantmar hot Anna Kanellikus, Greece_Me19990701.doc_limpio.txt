to anne schlumberger sabina duerr gerber jbfo zurich date 1 july 1999 from tia healy trust department telephon345 949 7212 fax 345 949 0993 subject frantmar trust dear anne and sabina frantmar trust has been reassigned to and i have completed review of it and there are number of issues that need to be resolved i saw from the file that you have met the clients and are aware of the loan stituation etc so i am addressing this to you however if i should have addressed it to someone else please feel free to pass it on and let know the biggest problem is the way the account is being handled and the relationship between the settlor and primary beneficiary and the relationship manager d silbermann copies of correspondence between them refer to the account as mrs ks personal account as you know in trust situation the account belongs to the trustees there is risk that the structure could be regarded as sham if mrs k and ds operate the account as if it is mrs ks account the powers retained by mrs k in the deed are already so wide as to leave her with lot of control over the trust with regard to the loans we note that the loan has been renewed for further 3 months we did not receive any indication that this was going to happen nor were we consulted on whether it should be renewed or not it should be pointed out to the rm and the settlor beneficiary that the loans are not from the bank to her or from the company to her they are from the trust to her the trust is funding them through the company by borrowing the money from the bank the correspondence between the rm and mrs k would lead one to believe that the money is being lent by the bank to mrs k and that the company is being used just to formalize the payments the stated purpose of the trust in the trust creation questionnaire is estate planning the trust appears to be funding the settlors shipping business and indeed is receiving payments from it on regular basis the latest payment of usd43588368 apparently is to pay the interest on the loans however the loan from the trust to mrs k is actually interest free so this amount will have to be considered an addition to trust capital the loan interest will be met out of the companys portfolio i think it would be difficult to treat it differently given the documentation we have however we would welcome any suggestions or comments on this and the other payments which have covered the loan interest we hold shares in fancey developments ltd which holds shares in the settlors familys shipping business we have not been given any reason why these listed securities cannot be held in the main frantmar portfolio or why the settlor has remained director of fancey as you know we prefer to provide directors for companies that are held in trust the operation of the account is incorrect and i realise that the relationshhip of the rm and mrs k is important to the bank however the structure is at risk if the account continues to be operated in this way i look forward to hearing from you soon kind regards tia healy trust officer
