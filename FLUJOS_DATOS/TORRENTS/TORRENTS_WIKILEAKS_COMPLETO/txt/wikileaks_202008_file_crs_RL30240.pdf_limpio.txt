about 30 years ago following threeday december 1978 workshop on congressional oversight and investigations the workshop was organized by group of house and senate committee aides from both parties and the congressional research service crs at the request of the bipartisan house leadership the manual was produced by crs with the assistance of number of house committee staffers in subsequent years crs sponsored and conducted various oversight seminars for house and senate staff and updated the manual as circumstances warranted the last revision occurred in 2004 worth noting is the bipartisan recommendation of the house members of the 1993 joint committee on the organization of congress rept 103413 v ol i as way to further enhance the oversight work of congress the joint committee would encourage the congressional research service to conduct on regular basis as it has done in the past oversight seminars for members and congressional staff and to update on regular basis its congressional oversight manual over the years crs has assisted many members committees party leaders and staff aides in the performance of the oversight function that is the review monitoring and supervision of the implementation of public policy understandably given the size reach cost and continuing growth of the modern executive establishmen t congresss oversight role is even more significantand more demandingthan when woodrow wilson wrote in his classic congressional government 1885 quite as important as lawmaking is vigilant oversight of administration todays lawmakers and congressional aides as well as commentators and scholars recognize that congresss work ideally should not end when it passes legislation oversight is an integral way to make sure that the laws work and are being administered in an effective efficient and economical manner in light of this destination oversight can be viewed as one of congresss principal responsibilities as it grapples with the complexities of the 21 st century to revise document of this size and scope requires the contributions of many people five crs specialists listed on the title page were responsible for organizing and writing this version of the manual in addition other crs personnel assisted in the preparation and publication of this report along with staff of the congressiona l budget office cbo and the

has engaged in oversight of the executive branchthe review monitoring and supervision of the implementation of public policy the first several congresses inaugurated such important oversight techniques as special investigations reporting requirements resolutions of inquiry and use of the appropriations process to review executive activity contemporary developments moreover have increased the legislatures capacity and capabilities to check on and check the executive public laws and congressional rules have measurably enhanced congresss implied power under the constitution to conduct oversight despite its lengthy heritage oversight was not given explicit recognition in public law until enactment of the legislative reorganization act of 1946 that act required house and senate standing committees to exercise continuous watchfulness over programs and agencies within their jurisdiction since the late 1960s according to such scholars as political scientist joel aberbach congress has shown increasing interest in oversight for several major reasons these include the expansion in number and complexity of federal programs and agencies increase in expenditures and personnel including contract employees the rise of the budget deficit and the frequency of divided government with congress and the white house controlled by different parties major partisan disagreements over priorities and processes also heighten conflict between the legislature and the executive oversight occurs in virtually any congressional activity and through wide variety of channels organizations and structures these range from formal committee hearings to informal member contacts with executive officials from staff stud ies to support agency reviews and from casework conducted by member offices to studies prepared by noncongressional entities such as statutory commissions and offices of inspector general g18g158g155g153g152g156g142g156g561 congressional oversight

called for to redress what many in the public and congress saw to be an executive arrogation of legislative prerogatives

various ways for example numerous laws require agencies to submit reports to congress some of these are regular occurring annually or semiannually for instance while others are activated by specific

permanent subcommittee on investigations of the then titled committee on government operations the subcommittee was an outgrowth of the famous 1941 truman committee after senator harry truman which investigated fraud and mismanagement of the nations war program the truman committee ended in 1948 but the chairman of the government operations committee made the functions of the truman panel one of his subcommittees the permanent subcommittee on investigations since then this subcommittee has investigated scores of issues such as government waste fraud and inefficiency

project work conducted in members personal office can result in findings about bureaucratic behavior and policy implementation these in turn can lead to the adjustment of agency policies and procedures and to changes in public law casework responding to constituent requests for assistance on projects or complaints or grievances about program implementation provides an opportunity to examine bureaucratic activity and operations if only in selective way b sometimes individual members will conduct their own investigations or ad hoc hearings or direct their staffs to conduct oversight studies individual members have authority to issue compulsory process or conduct official hearings the government accountability office or some other legislative branch agency specially created task force or private research group might be requested to conduct an investigation of matter for senator or representative 2 committees the most common and effective method of conducting oversight is through the committee structure throughout their histories the house and senate have used their standing committees as well as select or special committees to investigate federal activities and agencies along with other matters the house committee on government reform and the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs which have oversight jurisdiction over virtually the entire federal government have been vested with broad investigatory powers over governmentwide activities b the house and senate committees on appropriations have similar responsibilities when reviewing fiscal activities c each standing committee of congress has oversight responsibilities to review government activities within their jurisdiction these panels also have authority on their own to establish oversight and investigative subcommittees the establishment of such subcommittees does not preclude the legislative subcommittees from conducting oversight d certain house and senate committees have special oversight or comprehensive policy oversight of designated subject areas as explained in the previous subsection

complaints and requests for projects and assistance frequently bring problems and deficiencies in federal programs and administration to the attention of members and their personal office staffs the casework performed by members staff for constituents can be an effective oversight tool

oversight and legislative interests of the member the senator or representative and the staff may be attuned to the relationship between casework and the oversight function this is facilitated by regular exchange of ideas among the member legislative aides and caseworkers on problems brought to the offices attention by constituents and of possible legislative initiatives to resolve those problems b if casework is to be useful as an oversight technique effective staffing and coordination are needed casework and legislative staffs maximize service to their members constituents when they establish relationship with the staff of the subcommittees and committees that handle the areas of concern to the members constituents through this interaction the panels staff can be made aware of the problems with the agency or program in question assess how widespread and significant they are determine their causes and recommend corrective action c office procedures enable staff in some offices to identify cases that represent situation in which formal changes in agency procedure could be an appropriate remedy prompt congressional inquiry and follow up enhance this type of oversight telephone inquiries reinforced with written requests tend to ensure agency attention 2 committee staff as issues become more complex and members staffs more overworked professional staffs of committees can provide the expert help required to conduct oversight and investigations committee staff typically have the experience and expertise to conduct effective oversight for the committees and subcommittees they serve committees may also call upon legislative support agencies for assistance hire consultants or borrow staff from federal departments committee staff in summary occupy central position in the conduct of oversight the informal contacts with executive officials at all levels constitute one of congresss most effective devices for performing its continuous watchfulness

congress in conducting oversight is coordination among committees both within each chamber as well as between the two houses as the final report of the house select committee on committees of the 93rd congress noted review findings and recommendations developed by one committee are seldom shared on timely basis with another committee and if they are made available then often the findings are transmitted in form that is difficult for members to use despite the passage of time this statement remains relevant today oversight coordination between house and senate committees is also uncommon and it occurs primarily in the aftermath of perceived major policy failures or prominent interbranch conflicts as with the irancontra affair 1986 and the 911 terrorist attacks 20012002 intercommittee cooperation on oversight can prove beneficial for variety of reasons it should for example minimize unnecessary duplication and conflict and inhibit agencies from playing one committee off against another there are formal and informal ways to achieve oversight coordination among committees g17g159g142g155g156g146g144g145g157g561g5g152g152g155g141g146g151g138g157g146g152g151g561

and impoundment c ontrol act of 1974 as amended enhanced the legislative branchs capacity to shape the federal budget the act has major institutional and procedural effects on congress institutionally congress created three new entities 1 the senate committee on the budget 2 the house committee on the budget and 3 the congressional budget office b procedurally the act established methods that permit congress to 1 determine budget policy as whole 2 relate revenue and spending decisions 3 determine priorities among competing national programs and 4 ensure that revenue spending and debt legislation are consistent with the overall budget policy 2 the new budget process coexists with the established authorization and appropriation procedures and significantly affects each on the authorization side the budget act requires committees to submit their budgetary views and estimates for matters under their jurisdiction to their committee on the budget within six weeks after the president submits budget b on the appropriations side new contract and borrowing authority must go through the appropriations process subcommittees of the appropriations committees are assigned financial allocation that determines how much may be included in the measures they report although less than onethird of federal spending is subject to the annual appropriations process the tax and appropriations panels of each house also submit budgetary views and estimates to their respective committee on the budget c in deciding spending revenue credit and debt issues congress is sensitive to trends in the overall composition of the annual federal budget expenditures for defense entitlements interest on the debt and domestic discretionary programs 3 in short the budget act has the potential of strengthening oversight by enabling congress better to relate program priorities to financial claims on the national budget each committee knowing that it will receive fixed amount of the total to be included in budget resolution has an incentive to scrutinize existing programs to make room for new

congress exercises significant control over any government agency 2 the entire authorization process may involve host of oversight toolshearings studies and reportsbut the key to the process is the authorization statute an authorization statute creates and shapes government programs and agencies and it contains the statement of legislative policy for the agency b authorization is the first lever in congressional exercise of the power of the purse it usually allows an agency to be funded but it does not guarantee financing of agencies and programs frequently authorizations establish dollar ceilings on the amounts that can be appropriated 3 the authorizationreauthorization process is an important oversight tool through this process members are educated about the work of an agency and given an opportunity to direct the agencys effort in light of experience b expiration of an agencys program provides an excellent chance for indepth oversight 1 in recent decades there has been mix of permanent and periodic annual or multi year authorizations although some reformers are now pressing for biennial budgeting acting on twoyear cycle for authorizations appropriations and budget resolutions 2 periodic authorizations improve the likelihood that an agency will be scrutinized systematically 4 in addition to formal amendment of the agencys authorizing statute the authorization process gives committees an opportunity to exercise informal nonstatutory controls over the agency knowledge by an agency that it must come to the legislative committee for renewed authority increases the influence of the committee b this condition helps to account for the appeal of shortterm authorizations c nonstatutory controls used by committees to exercise direction over the administration of laws include statements made in 1 committee hearings 2 committee reports accompanying legislation

its strategic position stems from the constitutional requirement that money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law b congresss power of the purse allows the house and senate committees on appropriations to play prominent role in oversight 2 the oversight function of the committees on appropriations derives from their responsibility to examine and pass on the budget requests of the agencies as contained in the presidents budget the decisions of the committees are conditioned on their assessment of the agencies need for their budget request as indicated by past performance b in practice the entire record of an agency is fair game for the required assessment c this comprehensive overview and the carrot and stick of the appropriations recommendations make the committees significant focal points of congressional oversight and is key source of their power in congress and in the federal government generally 3 enacted appropriations legislation frequently contains at least five types of statutory controls on agencies such legislation specifies the purpose for which funds may be used b it defines the specified funding level for the agency as whole as well as for programs and divisions within the agency c it sets time limits on the availability of funds for obligation d appropriations legislation may contain limitation provisions for example in appropriating 350 million to the environmental protection agency for research and development congress added this condition provided that not more than 55000000 of these funds shall be available for procurement of laboratory equipment supplies and other operating expenses in support of research and development 108 stat 2319 1994 appropriations measures and committee repor ts also stipulate how an agencys budget can be reprogrammed shifting funds within an appropriations account see box below

decisions have upheld the legislative branchs right of inquiry provided it stays within its legitimate legislative sphere b the roots of congresss authority to conduct investigations extend back to the british parliament and colonial assemblies c in addition the framers clearly perceived the house of representatives to function as grand inquest since the framers expected lawmakers to employ the investigatory function based upon parliamentary precedents it was unnecessary to invest congress with an explicit investigatory power d from time to time legal questions have been raised about the investigative authority of congress however numerous supreme court decisions have upheld the legislative branchs right of inquiry provided it serves legitimate legislative interest 2 investigations and related activities may be conducted by individual members b committees and subcommittees c staff or outside organizations and personnel under contract or d congressional support agencies 3 investigations serve several purposes they help to ensure honesty and efficiency in the administration of laws b they secure information that assists congress in making informed policy judgments and c

more time to probe the qualifications independence and policy predilections of presidential nominees seeking information on everything from physical health to financial assets confirmation can assist in oversight in several ways 1 the constitution provides that the president shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate shall appoint ambassadors other public ministers and consuls judges of the supreme court and all other officers of the united states whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for and which shall be established by law emphasis added the consideration of appointments to exec utive branch leadership positions is major responsibility of the senate and especially of senate committees b panels review the qualifications of nominees for public positions 2 the confirmation hearing provides forum for the discussion of the policies and programs the nominee intends to pursue this is classic opportunity for senatorial oversight and influence the confirmation process as an oversight tool can be used to provide policy direction to nominees b inform nominees of congressional interests and c extract future commitments 3 once nominee has been confirmed by the senate oversight includes following up to ensure that the nominee fulfills any commitments made during confirmation hearings subsequent hearings and committee investigations can explore whether such commitments have been kept 4 recess appointments the constitution provides that the president shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the senate by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session when presidents relied on this power to circumvent senate confirmation congress responded with legislation that prohibits with certain exceptions the payment of salaries to recess appointees 54 stat 751 1940 5 usc 5503 2004 also in the annual treasury transportation housing and urban development appropriations

presidents make other temporary or interim appointments since 1795 congress has legislated limits on the time temporary officer may occupy vacant advice and consent position in 1868 congress established procedure for filling vacancies in advice and consent positions through the vacancies act when the head of an executive department dies resigns or is sick or absent the next in command may perform the duties until successor is appointed or the absence ceases the president may also direct someone else previously appointed with the advice and consent of the senate to perform the duties these acting officials under the vacancies act were restricted by law to period of not to exceed 30 days that limit was violated with such frequency that congress in 1988 increased it to 120 days 102 stat 988 sec 7 1988 5 usc 334548 2004 the justice department took the position that some executive officials were not restricted by the vacancies act and could serve beyond the 120day period under that interpretation the administration selected bill lann lee to head the justice departments civil rights division and argued that he could serve longer than had he been recess appointee congress responded by passing legislation in 1998 to make the vacancies act the exclusive vehicle for temporarily filling vacant advice and consent positions the new vacancies act included in the fy1999 omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act pl 105277 rejects the justice department position and established procedures for the appointment of executive officials who

nonjusticiable constitutional challenge to the use by the senate in an impeachment proceeding of 12 member committee appointed to take testimony and gather evidence such committee makes recommendations as to the ultimate question before the senate nor does the committee rule on questions of relevancy materiality and competency rather it reports certified copy of the transcript of the proceedings before the committee and any evidence received by the committee to the full senate for its consideration the full senate may take further testimony or evidence or it may hold the entire trial in open senate in either event the full senate determines whether to convict on one or more of the articles of impeachment involved and upon conviction decides the appropriate judgment to be imposed 3 the impeachment process is cumbersome and infrequently used the house has voted to impeach in 17 cases 16 of which have reached the senate and 15 of which have gone to vote on one or more articles of impeachment seven cases all pertaining to federal judges have resulted in conviction and removal two of these also resulted in disqualification the most recent impeachment trial was that of president clinton in 199899 the most recent judicial impeachment trials were those of judges claiborne hastings and nixon in 1986 1988 and 1989 respectively number of issues were addressed in the clinton impeachment trial and other past impeachment proceedings although the answers to some still remain somewhat ambiguous for example an impeachment may be continued from one congress to the next although the procedural steps vary depending upon the stage in the process b the constitution defines the grounds for impeachment as treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors however th meaning and scope of high crimes and misdemeanors remains in dispute and depends on the interpretation of individual legislators c the constitution provides for impeachment of the president vice president and all civil officers of the united states while the outer limits of the civil officers language are not altogether clear past precedents suggest that it covers at least federal judges and executive officers subject to the appointments clause d members of the house and senate are not subject to impeachment because they are not civil officers william blount us senator from tennessee was

encompasses inquiries concerning the administration of existing laws as well as proposed or possibly needed statutes3 the court went on to emphasize that congresss investigative power is at its peak when the subject is alleged waste fraud abuse or maladministration within government department the investigative power it stated comprehends probes into departments of the federal government to expose corruption inefficiency or waste 4 but while the congressional power of inquiry is broad it is not unlimited the supreme court has admonished that the power to investigate may be exercised only in aid of the legislative function5 and cannot be used to expose for the sake of exposure alone the watkins court underlined these limitations there is general authority to expose the private affairs of individuals without justification in terms of the functions of the congress nor is the congress law enforcement or trial agency these are functions of the executive and judicial departments of government inquiry is an end in itself it must be related to and in furtherance of legitimate task of the congress6 moreover an investigating committee has only the power to inquire into matters

ether the congressional investigating power has been properly asserted was articulated in wilkinson v united states 12 1 the committees investigation of the broad subject matter area must be authorized by congress 2 the investigation must be pursuant to valid legislative purpose and 3 the specific inquiries must be pertinent to the broad subject matter areas which have been authorized by the congress as to the requirement of valid legislative purpose the supreme court has made it clear that congress does not have to state explicitly what it intends to do as result of an

information preparatory to investigations hearings however with more frequency in recent years when specially authorized congressional committees have utilized staffconducted depositions as tool in exercising the investigatory power staff depositions afford number of significant advantages for committees engaged in complex investigations staff depositions may assist committees in obtaining sworn testimony quickly and confidentially without the necessity of members devoting time to lengthy hearings that may be unproductive because witnesses do not have the facts needed by the committee or refuse to cooperate depositions are conducted in private and may be more conducive to candid responses than would be the case at public hearing statements made by witnesses that might defame or even tend to incriminate third parties can be verified before they are repeated in an open hearing depositions can prepare committee for the questioning of witnesses at hearing or provide screening pr ocess that can obviate the need to call some witnesses the deposition process also allows questioning of witnesses outside of washington dc thereby avoiding the inconvenience of conducting field hearings requiring the presence of members 10 us const art i sec 6 cl 1 11 eastland v united states servicemens fund 421 us 491 50307 1975 12 365 us 399 40809 1961 13 in re chapman 166 us 661 669 1897

through the contempt power or its threat that congress may act with ultimate force in response to actions that obstruct the legislative process in order to punish the contemnor andor to remove the obstruction the supreme court early recognized the power as an inherent attribute of congresss legislative authority reasoning that if it did not possess this power it would be exposed to every indignity and interrupt ion that rudeness caprice or even conspiracy may mediate against it18 there are three different kinds of contempt proceedings both the house and senate may cite witness for contempt under their inherent contempt power or under statutory criminal contempt procedure the senate also has third option enforcement by means of statutory civil contempt procedure19 inherent contempt under the inherent contempt power the individual is brought before the house or senate by the sergeantatarms tried at the bar of the body and can be imprisoned the purpose of the imprisonment

the congress until he agrees to comply the inherent contempt power has been recognized by the supreme court as inextricably related to congresss constitutionallybased power to investigate20 between 1795 and 1934 the house and senate utilized the inhe rent contempt power over 85 times in most instances to obtain successfully testimony andor documents the inherent contempt power has not been exercised by either house in over 70 years this appears to be because it has been considered too cumbersome and timeconsuming to hold contempt trials at the bar of the offended chamber moreover some have argued that the procedure is ineffective because punishment can not extend beyond congresss adjournment date b statutory criminal contempt congress recognized the problem raised by its inability to punish contemnor beyond the adjournment of congressional session in 1857 congress enacted statutory criminal contempt procedure as an alternative to the inherent contempt procedure that with minor amendments is codified today at 2 usc 192 and 194 person who has been subpoenaed to testify or produce documents before the house or senate or committee and who fails to do so or who appears but refuses to respond to questions is guilty of misdemeanor punishable by fine of up to 100000 and imprisonment for up to one year contempt citation must be approved by the subcommittee the full committee and the full house or senate or by the presiding officer if congress is not in session after contempt has been certified by the president of the senate or the speaker of the house it is the duty of the us attorney to bring the matter before the grand jury for its action the criminal contempt procedure was rarely used until the twentieth century but since 1935 it has been essentially the exclusive vehicle for punishment of contemptuous conduct prior to watergate executive branch official had ever been the target of criminal contempt proceeding since 1975 however 10 cabinetlevel or senior executive officials have been cited for contempt for failure to produce subpoenaed documents by either subcommittee full committee or by house 21 in each instance there was substantial or full compliance with the document demands before the initiation of criminal proceedings however following the vote of contempt of epa administrator anne gorsuch bu rford but before the contempt citation was forwarded to the united states attorney for grand jury action the department of justice raised the question whether congress could compel the us attorney to submit the citation for grand jury consideration the documents in question were turned over to congress before the issue was litigated in court the question of the duty of the us attorney under section 192 to enforce contempt of congress citations remains unresolved and has left some uncertainty as to the efficacy of the use of criminal contempt proceedings against executive branch officials c civil contempt as an alternative

that befell general st clairs expedition26 the vast majority of these interbranch disputes have been resolved through political negotiation and accommodation thus few have reached the courts for substantive resolution27 in fact it was not until the watergaterelated lawsuits in the 1970s seeking access to president nixons tapes that the existence of presidential confidentiality privilege was judicially established as necessary derivative of the presidents status in our constitutional scheme of separated powers of the seven court decisions involving interbranch information access disputes 28 three have involved congress and the executive29 but only one of these resulted in decision on the merits30 one other case involving legislation granting custody of president nixons presidential records to the administrator of the general services administration also determined several pertinent executive privilege issues31 the nixon and postwatergate cases established the broad contours of the presidential communications privilege under those precedents the privilege which is constitutionally rooted could be invoked by the president when asked to produce documents or other materials or information that reflect presidential decisionmaking and deliberations that he believes should remain confidential if the president does so the materials become presumptively privileged the privilege however is qualified not absolute and can be overcome by an adequate showing of need finally while reviewing courts have expressed reluctance to balance executive privilege claims against congressional demand for information they have acknowledged they will do so if the political branches have tried in good faith but failed to reach an accommodation however until the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuits 1997 ruling in in re sealed case espy 32 and its 2004 ruling in judicial watch inc v department of justice 33 these judicial decisions had left important gaps in the law of presidential privilege which increasingly became focal points if not the source of interbranch confrontations among the more significant issues left open included whether the president has to have actually seen or been familiar with the disputed matter whether the presidential privilege encompasses documents and information developed by or in the possession of officers nd employees in the departments and agencies of the executive branch whether the privilege encompasses all communications with respect to which the president may be interested or is it confined to presidential decisionmaking and if so is it limited to any particular type of presidential decisionmaking and precisely what kind of 26 see archibald cox executive privilege 122 u of pa l rev 1383 13951405 1979

executive response to congressional demand to produce information may be an assertion of presidential executive privilege doctrine which like congresss powers to investigate and cite for contempt has constitutional roots decision of the supreme court has yet resolved the question whether there are any circumstances in which the executive branch can refuse to provide information sought by the congress is on the basis of executive privilege indeed most such disputes are settled short of litigation through employment of the political process and negotiations 35 and the few that reach judicial forum find the courts highly reluctant to rule on the merits however in united states v nixon 1974 involving judicial subpoena issued to the president at the request of the watergate special prosecutor36 the supreme court found constitutional basis for the doctrine of executive privilege in the supremacy of each branch within its own assigned area of constitutional duties and in the separation of powers although it considered presidential communications to be presumptively privileged the court rejected the presidents contention that the priv ilege was absolute thereby precluding judicial review whenever it is asserted the court held th at the judicial need for the tapes outweighed the presidents generalized interest in confidentiality the court was careful to limit the scope of its decision noting that we are not here concer ned with the balance between the presidents generalized interest in confidentiality and congressional demands for information 37 in in re sealed case espy involving grand jury subpoena for documents to the white house counsels office during an independent counsels investigation of allegations of improprieties by the secretary of agriculture an appeals court elaborated on several important issues left unresolved by nixon and other watergaterelated cases the precise parameters of the presidential executive privilege how far down the chain of command the privilege reaches whether the president has to have seen or had knowledge of the existence of the documents for which he claims privilege and what showing is necessary to overcome valid

had not met its burden of showing that the subpoenaed evidence is demonstrably critical to the responsible fulfillment of the committees function the court noted that its denial was based upon the initiation of impeachment proceedings by the house judiciary committee the overlap of the investigative objectives of both committees and the fact that the impeachment committee already had the tapes in question concluding that the select committees immediate oversight need for the subpoenaed tapes is from congressional perspective merely cumulative the unique and confining nature of the cases

that the independent counsel had met his burden and ordered the disclosure of the disputed documents the district of columbia circuits 2004 decision in judicial watch inc v department of justice39 appears to lend substantial support to the aboveexpressed understanding of espy the judicial watch dispute involved requests by judicial watch inc for documents concerning pardon applications and pardon grants reviewed by the justice departments office of the pardon attorney and the deputy attorney general for consideration by president clinton40 some 4300 documents were withheld on the grounds that they were protected by the presidential communications and deliberative process privileges the district court held that because the materials sought had been produced for the sole purpose of advising the president on quintessential and nondelegable presidential powerthe exercise of the presidents constitutional pardon authoritythe extension of the presidential communications privilege to internal justice department documents which had not been solicited and received by the president or the office of the president was not warranted 41 the appeals court reversed concluding that internal agency documents that are not solicited and received by the president or his office are instead protected against disclosure if at all by the deliberative process privilege42 guided by the analysis of the espy ruling the panel majority emphasized that the solicited and received limitation is necessitated by the principles underlying the presidential communications privilege and recognition of the dangers of expanding it too far 43 espy teaches the court explained that the privilege may be invoked only when presidential advisers in close proximity to the president who have significant responsibility for advising him on nondelegable matters requiring direct presidential decisionmaking have solicited and received such documents or communications or the president has received them himself in rejecting the governments argument that the privilege should be applicable to all departmental and agency communications related to the deputy attorney generals par don

of the presidential communications privilege as well as the goal of serving the public interest communications never received by the president or his office are unlikely to be revelatory of his deliberations nor is ther any reason to fear that the deputy attorney generals candor or the quality of the deputys pardon recommendations would be sacrificed if the presidential communicati ons privilege did not apply to internal documents any pardon documents repor ts or recommendations that the deputy attorney general submits to the office of the president and any direct communications the deputy or the pardon attorney may have with the white house counsel or other immediate presidential advisers will remain protecte d it is only those documents and recommendations of department staff that are not submitted by the deputy attorney general for the president and are not otherwise received by the office of the president that do not fall under the presidential communications privilege 44 indeed the judicial watch panel makes it clear that the espy rationale would preclude cabinet department heads from being treated as being part of the presidents immediate personal staff or as some unit of the office of the president extension of the presidential communications privilege to the attorney generals delegatee the deputy attorney general and his staff on down to the pardon attorney and his staff with the attendant implication for expansion to other cabinet officers and their staffs would as the court pointed out in in re sealed case pose significant risk of expanding to large swatch of the executive branch privilege that is bottomed on recognition of the unique role of the president 45 the judicial watch majority took great pains to explain why espy and the case before it differed from the nixon and postwatergate cases according to the court until in re sealed case the privilege had been tied specifically to direct communications of the president with his immediate white house advisors46 the espy court it explained was for the first time confronted with the question whether communications that the presidents closest advisors make in the course of preparing advise for the president and which the president never saw should also be covered by the presidential privilege the espy courts answer was to espouse limited extension of the privilege down the chain of command beyond the president to his immediate white house advisors only recognizing the need to ensure that the president would receive full and frank advice with regard to his nondelegable appointment and removal powers but was also wary of undermining countervailing considerations such as openness in government hence the espy court determined that while communications authored or solicited and received by immediate white house advisors in the office of the president could qualify under the privilege communications of staff outside the white house in executive branch agencies that were not solicited and received by such white house advisors could not 47 the situation before the judicial watch court tested the espy principles while the presidential decision involvedexercise

his senior white house advisors to be protected the court conceded that functionally those officials were performing task directly related to the pardon decision but concluded that an organizational test was more appropriate for confining the potentially broad sweep that would result from functional test under the latter test there would be limit to the coverage of the presidential communications privilege in such circumstances the majority concluded the lesser protections of the deliberative process privilege would have to suffice 48 the appeals court ordered the disclosure of 4300 withheld documents since the kennedy administration executive policy directives establish that presidential executive privilege may be asserted only by the president personally the latest such directive issued by president reagan in november 1982 and still in effect requires that when agency heads believe that congressional information request raises substantial questions of executive privilege they are to notify and consult with the at torney general and the counsel to the president if the matter is deemed to justify invocation of the privilege it is reported to the president who makes his decision see reagan memo at appendix b however memorandum of september 28 1994 from white house counsel lloyd cutler to all department and agency general counsels modified the reagan policy by requiring agency heads directly to notify the white house counsel of any congressional request for any document created in the white house or in department or agency that contains deliberations of or advice to or from the white house that may raise privilege issues the white house counsel is to seek an accommodation and if that does not succeed he is to consult the attorney general to determine whether to recommend invocation of privilege to the president the president then determines whether to claim privilege which is then communicated to the congress by the white house counsel thus it would appear that decision making with respect to claims of presidential privilege is now fully centralized in the white house but that the president must still personally assert the claim see cutler memo at appendix c the current bush administration has not taken public position on the reagan memorandum or the cutler modification but president bushs sole assertion of executive privilege in december 2001 was issued over his signature the current bush administration through presidential signing statements 49 and opinions of the department of justices office of legal counsel olc has articulated legal view of the

officers and employees of the executive branch51 the olc assertions of these broad notions of presidential prerogatives are unaccompanied by any authoritative judicial citations and as indicated in the above discussion recent appellate court rulings cast considerable doubt on the broad claims of privilege posited by olc taken together espy and judicial watch arguably have effected important qualifications and restraints on the nature scope and reach of the presidential communications privilege as established by those cases and until reviewed by the supreme court to appropriately invoke the privilege the following elements appear to be essential 1 the protected communication must relate to quintessential and nondelegable presidential power espy and judicial watch involved the appointment and removal and the pardon powers respectively other core direct presidential decisionmaking powers include the commanderinchief power the sole authority to receive ambassadors and other public ministers the power to negotiate treaties and the power to grant pardons it would arguably not include decisionmaking with respect to laws that vest policymaking and implementation authority in the heads of departments and agencies or which allow presidential delegations of authority 2 the communication must be authored or solicited and received by close white house advisor or the president the judicial test is that an advisor must be in operational proximity with the president this effectively means that the scope of the presidential communications privilege extends only to the boundaries of the white house and the executive office complex 3 the presidential communications privilege remains qualified privilege that may be overcome by showing of need and unavail ability of the information elsewhere by an appropriate investigating authority the espy court found an adequate showing of need by the independent counsel while in judicial watch the court found the privilege did not apply and the deliberative process privilege was unavailing

investigative inquiries although there has never been definitive supreme court ruling on the question the strong constitutional underpinnings of the legislative investigatory power longstanding congressional practice and recent appellate court rulings casting doubt on the viability of commonlaw privilege claims by executive officials in the face of grand jury investigations support the position that committees may determine on caseby case basis whether to accept claim of privilege thus it is well established by congressional practice that acceptance of claim of attorneyclient work product or other common law testimonial privilege before committee rests in the sound discretion of that committee such commonlaw privileges cannot be claimed as matter of right 51 id at 3

it needs the information sought to be protected in order to accomplish its legislative functions52 in actual practice all committees that have denied claims of privilege have engaged in process of weighing considerations of legislative need public policy and the statutory duties of congressional committees to engage in continuous oversight of the application administration and execution of the laws that fall within its jurisdiction agai nst any possible injury to the witness committees among other factors have considered whether court would have recognized the claim in the judicial forum53 moreover the conclusion that recognition of nonconstitutionally based privileges is matter of congressional discretion is consistent with both traditional british parliamentary and the congresss historical practice54 the legal basis for congresss prerogative in this area is based upon its inherent constitutional prerogative to investigate which has been long recognized by the supreme court as extremely broad and encompassing and which is at its peak when the subject is fraud abuse or maladministration within government department55 commonlaw privileges are on the other hand judiciallycreated exceptions to the normal principle of full disclosure in the adversary process which are to be narrowly construed and have been confined to the judicial forum these privileges have

testimonial privileges in congressional proceedings58 an advisory opinion directly addressing the issue59 by legal ethics committee of the district of columbia bar in february 1999 provides substantial support for the longstanding congressional practice the occasion for the ruling arose as result of an investigation of subcommittee of the house commerce committee into the circumstances surrounding the planned relocation of the federal communications commission to the portals office complex 60 during the course of the inquiry the subcommittee sought certain documents from the portals developer mr franklin l haney mr haneys refusal to comply resulted in subpoenas for those documents to him and the law firm representing him during the relocation efforts haney and the law firm asserted attorneyclient privilege in their continued refusal to comply the law firm sought an opinion from the dc bars ethics committee as to its obligations in the face of the subpoena and possible contempt citation but the bar committee notified the firm that the question was novel and that advice could be given until the matter was considered in plenary session of the committee 61 the firm continued its refusal to comply until the subcommittee cited it for contempt at which time the firm proposed to turn over the documents if the contempt citation was withdr awn the subcommittee agreed to the proposal62 subsequently on february 16 1999 the dc bars ethics committee issued an opinion vindicating the action taken by the firm the ethics committee interpreting dc rule of professional conduct 16d2a 63 held that an attorney faced with congressional subpoena that would reveal client confidences or secrets has professional responsibility to seek to quash or limit the subpoe na on all available legitimate grounds to protect conf idential documents and client secrets if thereafter the congressional subcommittee overrules these objections orders production of the documents and threatens to hold the lawyer in contempt absent compliance with the continued communications between state government counsel and state office holder but see in re grand jury investigation 399 f3d 527

every appropriate objection to the subpoena until further avenues of appeal are available and even suggests that clients might be advised to retain other counsel to institute third party action to enjoin compliance64 but allows the attorney to relent at the earliest point when he is put in legal jeopardy the opinion represents the first and thus far the only bar in the nation to directly and definitively address the merits of the issue it is likely to arouse controversial and sensitive debate65 particularly if congressional committees choose to subpoena client documents from attorneys as matter of course assertions of deliberative process privilege by agencies have not been uncommon in the past in essence it is argued that congressional demands for information as to what occurred during the policy development process of an agency would unduly interfere and perhaps chill the frank and open internal communications necessary to the quality and integrity of the decisional process it may also be grounded on the contentions that it protects against premature disclosure of proposed policies before they are fully considered or actually adopted by the agency and to prevent the public from confusing matters merely considered or discussed during the deliberative process with those on which the decision was based however as with claims of attorneyclient privilege and work product immunity discussed previously congressional practice has been to treat their acceptance as discretionary with the committee moreover recent appellate court decision underlines the understanding that the deliberative process privilege is common law privilege of agencies that is easily overcome by showing of need by an investigatory body and other court rulings and congressional practice have recognized the overriding necessity of an effective legislative oversight process the 1997 appeals court ruling in in re sealed case espy 66 discussed previously is of special note the case involved inter alia white house claims of executive and deliberate process privileges for documents subpoenaed by an independent counsel at the outset of the appeals courts unanimous ruling it carefully distinguished between the presidential communications privilege and the deliberative process privilege both the court observed are executive privileges designed to protect the confidentiality of executive branch decisionmaking but the deliberative process privilege applies to executive branch officials generally is common law privilege which requires lower threshold of need to be overcome and disappears altogether when there is any reason to believe government misconduct has occurred 67 the courts 64 direct suit to enjoin committee from enforcing subpoena has been foreclosed by the supreme courts decision in eastland v united states servicemens fund 421 us 491 501 1975 but that ruling does not appear to foreclose an action against third party such as the clients attorney to test the validity of the subpoena or the power of committee to refuse to recognize the privilege see eg united states v att 567 f 2d 121 dccir 1977 entertaining an action by the

cognizable and must be strictly observed the house and many individual senate committees require that all witnesses be given copy of committees rules both the house and the senate have adopted rules permitting reduced quorum for taking testimony and receiving evidence house hearings may be conducted if at least two members are present most senate committees permit hearings with only one member in attendance although most committees have adopted the minimum quorum requirement some have not while others require higher quorum for sworn rather than unsworn testimony for perjury purposes the quorum requirement must be met at the time the allegedly perjured testimony is given not at the beginning of the session reduced quorum requirement rules do not apply to authorizations for the issuance of

of defining the subject matter of the hearing and thereby establishing the pertinence of questions asked the witnesses not all committees swear in their witnesses few committees require that all witnesses be sworn most committees leave the swearing of witnesses to the discretion of the chair if committee wishes the potential sanction of perjury to apply it should in accordance with the statute administer an oath and swear its witnesses though it should be noted that false statements not under oath are also subject to criminal sanctions witness does not have right to make statement before being questioned but that opportunity is usually accorded committee rules may prescribe the length of such statements and also require written statements be submitted in advance of the hearing

testimony and to make nonsubstantive corrections the right of witness to be accompanied by counsel is recognized by house rule and the rules of senate committees the house rule limits the role of counsel as solely for the purpose of advising them concerning their constitutional rights some committees have adopted rules specifically prohibiting counsel from coaching witnesses during their

investigative committees usually have short life span eg six months one year or at the longest until the end of congress at which point the panel would have to be reapproved if the inquiry were to

transferred from the congressional support agencies or loaned by executive agencies including the federal bureau of investigation the staff would require appropriate security clearances if the inquiry

minority members to the chairman before the completion of the hearing call witnesses selected by the minority and presumably request documents72 house or committee rules authorize either ranking minority members or individual members on their own to institute official committee investigations hold hearings or issue subpoenas individual members may seek the voluntary cooperation of agency officials or private persons but judicial precedent has directly recognized right in an individual member other than the chair of committee 73 to exercise the authority of committee in the context of oversight without the permission of majority of the committee or its chair moreover 1994 federal district court ruling dismissed the attempt of the thenranking minority member of the house banking now titled financ ial services committee to compel disclosure of documents from two agencies under the freedom of information act and the administrative procedure act the court held that the case was one in which congressional plaintiffs dispute is primarily with his or her fellow legislators and that the ranking minority members complaint derives solely from his failure to persuade his colleagues to authorize his request for the documents in question and that plaintiff thus has clear collegial remedy capable of affording him substantial relief 74 that court also suggested that the possibility that collegial remedy for the minority exists already pointing to 5 usc 2954 under which small groups of members of the house government reform and senate governmental af fairs committees can request information from executive agencies without the need of formal committee action 75 however the precise scope and efficacy of this provision is uncertain and recent federal district court opinion cases doubt on its enforceability by court 5 usc 2954 is derived from section 2 of the act of may 29 192876 which originally referred not to the current committees generally overseeing government agency operations but their predecessors the house and senate committees on expenditures in the executive departments the principal purpose of the 1928 act embodied in its first section was to repeal legislation that required the submission to the congress of some 128 reports many of which had become obsolete in part and which in any event were deemed at the time to have value serve useful purpose and were not printed by the house of representatives 77 section 2 of the 1928 act contains the language that has been codified in 5 usc 2954 the legislative history is somewhat mixed on the purpose of

necessity becoming evident to the membership of either body78 the house report agreed on that point but added if any information is desired by any member or committee upon particular subject that information can be better secured by request made by an individual member or committee so framed as to bring out the special information desired79 it is uncertain then on how closely 5 usc 2954 is tied to the 128 reports abolished by section 1 of the 1928 legislation80 moreover the provision lacks an explicit enforcement component agency refusals to comply would not be subject to existing contempt processes and the outcome of civil suit to compel producti on on the basis of the provision is problematic despite the leach courts suggestion further the provision applies only to the named committees thus members of all other committees would still face the leach problem finally even members of the named committees are still likely to have to persuade court that their claim is more than an intramural dispute that court has jurisdiction to hear the suit and that committee members have standing to sue within the narrow parameters set by the supreme court in raines v byrd 81 the first attempt to secure court enforcement of document demand under section 2954 was brought in 2001 in federal district court82 that case involved request of 16 minority party members of the house government reform committee for information from the secretary of commerce for data concerning the 2000 census th congressional plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief arguing that the plain language of section 2954 unambiguously directs agency compliance with information requests and that while resort to the legislative history of the provision is not necessary in such clear language situations that history is supportive in addition the plaintiffs argued that they were entitled to judicial relief because of the agencys direct and particularized rejection of an entitlement specif ically granted to them by law the government argued that because the case had arisen out of political dispute between congress and the executive concerning access to information the court should refrain from hearing the case in accordance with the doctrine of equitable discretion alternatively the government argued that section 2954 should be construed in light of its legislative history and to avoid doubts about its constitutionally as preserving congress access to the information formerly contained in the reports abolished by section 1 of the 1928 act but not as guaranteeing an unqualified right of access to information possessed by the executive branch the district court rejected these arguments and ordered release of the requested census data the government thereafter moved for reconsideration raising for the first time the questions whether plaintiffs as individual legislators lacked standing under the supreme courts ruling in raines v byrd to sue for institutional injuries and whether the plaintiffs had right of action under section 2954 the administrative procedure act or the mandamus statute to bring suit against the executive branch for access to information the court declined to consider these arguments on the ground that the government could have presented them in support of its original motion to dismiss but did not do so 83 78 srept

addition to asserting right of access under section 2954 the congressional plaintiffs allege violation of 5 usc 7211 which provides that the right of employees to fu rnish information to either house of congress or to committee or member thereof may not be interfered with or denied the government opposed the claims raising the issues of standing under raines v byrd jurisdiction of the court to enforce either statute and the doctrine of equitable discretion on july 24 2006 the district court applying the guiding principles established by the supreme court in the 1997 decision in raines v byrd ruled that the congressional plaintiffs did not have standing to sue 87 raines involved challenge to the constitutionality of the lineitem veto act of 1996 by six members of congress who had voted against it alleging that it unconstitutionally diminished the members voting power by authorizing the president to cancel certain spending and tax measures after he signed them into law without complying with the requirements of bicameral passage and presentment to the president in raines the supreme court held that the member plaintiffs lacked standing because their complaint did not establish that they had suffered an injury that was personal particularized and concrete the court distinguished between personal injury to private right and an institutional or official one and was of the view that congressional plaintiff may have standing in suit against the executive if it is alleged that the plaintiff has suffered either personal injury eg loss of members seat on an institutional one that is not abstract or widely dispersed but amounts to member vote nullification the court concluded that the plaintiffs in raines had alleged an institutional injury that damaged all members reduction of legislative and political power rather than personal injury to private right which would be more particularized and concrete 88 bound by the supreme courts precedent the district court concluded that when the secretary refused to produce the documents requested pursuant to section 2954 plaintiffs did not suffer personal injury as that term is defined by raines rather

assess the merits of the bill in question was impeded or impaired such an injury is precisely of the type that under raines deprives individual legislators of standing to sue quoting raines the court noted that the plaintiffs were not singled out for specifically unfavorable treatment as opposed to other members of their respective bodies and cannot claim that they have been deprived of something to which they are reasonably entitled since the alleged injury runs in sense with the members seat seat which the member holds it might be quite arguably be said as trustees of his constituents not as prerogatives of personal power violation of section 2954 the court concluded therefore raises personal or particularized injury to the plaintiffs but at most type of institutional injury which necessarily damages all members of congress and both houses of congress equally the plaintiffs right to request and receive information from the executive branch pursuant to section 2954 would cease once they were longer in congress or longer member of the house committee on government reform the right that is asserted the court observed runs with their congressional and committee seats and is not personal to them the court also noted that jurisdictional committee has specifically requested that the documents be produced either by an official request or by subpoena nor does the legislative history of the provision imply an intent to delegate authority to the requisite number of members to seek to enforce its provisions judicially the rules of the senate provide substantially more effective means for individual minorityparty members to engage in selfhelp to support oversight objectives than afforded their house counterparts senate rules emphasize the rights and prerogatives of individual senators and therefore minority groups of senators 89 the most important of these rules are those that effectively allow unlimited debate on bill or amendment unless an extraordinary majority votes to invoke cloture 90 senators can use their right to filibuster or simply the threat of filibuster to delay or prevent the senate from engaging in legislative business the senates rules also are source of other minority rights that can directly or indirectly aid the minority in gaining investigatory rights for example the right of extended debate applies in committee as well as on the floor with one crucial difference the senates cloture rule may not be invoked in committee each senate committee decides for itself how it will control debate and therefore filibuster opportunity in committee may be even greater than on the floor also senate rule xxvi prohibits the reporting of any measure or matter from committee unless majority of the committee is present another point of possible tactical leverage even beyond the potent power to delay senators can promote their goals by taking advantage of other parliamentary rights and opportunities that are provided by the senates formal procedures and customary practices such as are afforded by the processes dealing with floor recognition committee referrals and the amending process 91

1 oversight hearings or even prehearings may be held for the purposes of briefing members and staff on the organization operations and programs of an agency and determining how an agency intends to implement any new legislation the hearings can also be used as way to obtain information on the administration effectiveness and economy of agency operations and programs 2 agency officials can be noticeably influenced by the knowledge and expectation that they will be called before congressional committee regularly to account for the activities of their agencies 3 such hearings benefit the committee by for example helping committee members keep uptodate on important administrative developments b serving as forum for exchanging and communicating views on pertinent problems and other relevant matters c providing background information which could assist members in making sound legislative and fiscal judgments d identifying program areas within each committees jurisdiction that may be vulnerable to waste fraud abuse or mismanagement and determining whether new laws are needed or whether changes in the administration of existing laws will be sufficient to resolve problems 4 the ability of committee members during oversight hearings to focus on meaningful issues and to ask penetrating questions will be enhanced if staff have accumulated organized and evaluated relevant data information and analyses about administrative performance ideally each standing committee should regularly monitor the application of laws and implementation of programs within its jurisdiction prime objective of the continuous watchfulness mandate section 136 of the legislative reorganization act of 1946 is to encourage committees to take an active and ongoing role in administrative review and not wait for public revelations of agency and program inadequacies before conducting oversight as section 136 states in part each standing committee of the senate and house of representatives shall exercise continuous watchfulness of the execution by the administrative agencies concerned of any laws the subject matter of which is within the jurisdiction of such committee b committee personnel could be assigned to maintain active liaison with appropriate agencies and to record their pertinent findings routinely

regular oversight hearings but also for oversight hearings called unexpectedly with little opportunity to conduct an extensive background study 5 it is important that specific letters be directed by the committee to the agency witnesses so that they will be on notice about what they will have to answer in this way witnesses will be responsive in providing worthwhile testimony at hearings testify to the point and avoid rambling andor evasive statements and restrict their use of this kind of answer to questions i didnt know you wanted that information g5g495g561g5g138g156g142g160g152g155g148g561 an important check against bureaucratic indifference or inefficiency is casework as noted in section i typically members of congress hear from individual constituents and communities about problems they are having with various federal agencies and departments as house member once said last year one of my constituents 63y ear old man who requires kidney dialysis discovered that he would longer be receiving medicare because the social security administration thought he was dead like many residents who have problems dealing with the federal bureaucracy this man contacted my district office and asked for help without difficulty he convinced my staff that he was indeed alive and we in turn convinced the social security administration to resume sending him benefits 92 casework is important not only in resolving problems that constituents are having with bureaucrats but also in identifying limitations in the law as scholar of constituency service explained casework allows ad hoc correction of bureaucratic error impropriety and laxity and can lead senator or representative to consider changes in laws because of particularly flagrant or persistent problems that casework staff discovered 93 g6g495g561g3g158g141g146g157g156g561 1 periodic auditing of executive departments is among the strongest techniques of legislative oversight

performance standards been developed d are program objectives sufficiently clear to permit agency management to accomplish effectively the desired program results are the objectives of the component

vice presidents national performance review and from the gao resulted in the federal reports elimination and sunset acts of 1995 and 1998 nonetheless reductions in the number of required reports have

specify fiveyear goals and objectives for agencies based on their basic missions and underlying st atutory or other authority of the agency these plans initially required in 1997 were to be developed in consultation with relevant congressional offices and with information from stakeholders and then submitted to congress 2 annual performance plans and goals based on these longterm plans which may be modified if conditions and agency responsibilities change the agencies are directed to set annual performance goals and to measure the results of their programs in achieving these goals the objective of gpra is to focus on outcomes ie the results and accomplishments of program such as decline in the use of illegal drugs for an antidrug abuse program rather than outputs ie other measures of agency activity and operations such as the number of antidrug agents in the field the annual plans which are also available to congress began with fy1999 the followup reports which began in 2000

promulgating covered rule must submit report to each house of congress and the comptroller general containing specific information about the rule before it can go into effect 2 rules designated by the office of manage ment and budget as major may normally not go into effect until 60 days after submission while nonmajor rules may become effective as otherwise allowed in law usually 30 days after publication in the federal register 3 all covered rules are subject to fasttrack disapproval by passage of joint resolution even if they have already gone into effect for period of at least 60 days upon enactment of such joint resolution new rule that is substantially the same as the disapproved rule may be issued until it is specifically authorized by law enacted subsequent to the disapproval of the original rule 4 there can be judicial review of actions taken or not taken by congress the comptroller general or omb but the failure of an agency to submit covered rule for congressional review may be subject to sanction by federal court

was to limit the ability of the federal government to impose costs on state and local governments through unfunded mandates the enactment has three components revised congressional procedures

through resolutions of inquiry 1 this is simple resolution approved by only the house 2 resolutions of inquiry are addressed to eith er the president or heads of departments and agencies to supply specific factual information to the chamber the resolutions usually request the president or direct administrative heads to supply such information in calling upon the president for information

devices are not to request an opinion or require an investigation see box 4 even when committee of jurisdiction reports resolution of inquiry adversely or succeeds in tabling the resolution on the house floor it is often the case that the administration has substantially complied with the resolution 5 resolutions of inquiry can be instrumental in triggering other congressional methods of

resolution is not reported within 14 legislative days after its introduction any member can move to discharge the committee of jurisdiction and bring the resolution to the floor however action by

oversight of policy areas follows two paths the legislative veto and advance notification 1 legislative veto beginning in 1932 congress delegated authority to the executive branch with the condition that proposed executive actions would be first submitted to congress and subjected to disapproval by either house or disapproval by both houses acting through concurrent resolution over the years other types of legislative veto were added allowing congress to control executive branch actions without having to enact law in 1983 the supreme court ruled that the legislative veto was unconstitutional on the ground that all exercises of legislative power that affect the rights duties and relations of persons outside the legislative branch must satisfy the constitutional requirements of bicameralism and presentment of bill or resolution to the president for his signature or veto ins v chadha 462 us 919 1983 despite this ruling congress has continued to enact proscribed legislative vetoes and it has also relied on informal arrangements to provide comparable controls legislative vetoes in statute congress responded to chadha by converting some of the onehouse and twohouse legislative vetoes to joint resolutions of approval or disapproval thus satisfying the requirements of bicameralism and presentment however congress continues to rely on legislative vetoes since the chadha decision more than 400 legislative vetoes have been enacted into public law usually in appropriations acts these legislative vetoes are exercised by the appropriations committees typically funds may not be used or an executive action may not begin until the appropriations committees have approved or at least not disapproved the planned action often

executive must be deferred giving congress an opportunity to pass legislation prohibiting the pending action or using political pressure to cause executive officials to retract or modify the proposed action this type of report and wait provision has been upheld by the supreme court the court noted the value of the reservation of the power to examine proposed rules laws and regulations before they

attorney general had discretion to seek an independent counsel for any person for whom there may exist personal financial or political conflict of interest for justice department personnel to

the matter 30day threshold review of the credibility and specificity of the charges and subsequent 90day preliminary investigation with possible 60 day extension the attorney general if he or she

appointment for independent counsels they could serve for as long as it took to complete their duties concerning that specific matter within their defined and limited jurisdiction once matter was completed the independent counsel filed final report the special division of the court could also find that the independent counsels work was completed and terminate the office periodic review of an independent counsel for such determination was to be made by the special division of the court an independent counsel prior to the completion of his or her duties could be removed from office other than by impeachment and conviction only by the attorney general of the united states for good cause physical or mental disability or other impairing condition and such removal could be appealed to the court the procedures for appointing and removing the independent counsel were upheld by the supreme court in morrison v olson 487 us 654 1988 investigation by the independent counsel could compete with parallel efforts by congressional committees to examine the same issue congress could decide to accommodate the needs of the independent counsel such as delaying legislative investigation until the independent counsel completed certain phases of an inquiry see box on previous page although congress could call on the attorney general to apply for an independent counsel by written request from the house or senate judiciary committee or majority of members of either party of those committees the attorney general is not required to begin preliminary investigation or to apply for an independent counse l in response to such request however in such cases the justice department was required to provide certain information to the requesting committee the independent counsel was directed by statutory language to submit to congress an annual report on the activities of such independent counsel including the progress of investigations and any prosecutions although it was recognized that certain information would have to be kept confidential the statute stated that information adequate to justify the expenditures that the office of the independent counsel has made should be provided 28 usc 595a2 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30240g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g146g152g151g138g149g561g17g159g142g155g156g146g144g145g157g561g15g138g151 g158g138g149g561 g561

oversight and an independent counsel was required to cooperate with that oversight 28 usc 595a1 in addition the independent counsel was required to report to the house of representatives any substantial and credible information that may constitute grounds for any impeachment 28 usc 595c on september 11 1998 independent counsel kenneth w starr forwarded to the house report concluding that president clinton may have committed impeachable offenses the house passed two articles of impeachment perjury and obstruction of justice but the senate voted only 45 to 55 on the perjury charge and 50 to 50 on the obstruction of justice charge both votes short of the twothirds majority required under the constitution the independent counsel statute expired in 1992 partly because of criticism directed at lawrence walshs investigation of irancontra the statute was reauthorized in 1994 but objections to the investigations conducted by kenneth starr into whitewater monica lewinsky and other matters put congress under pressure to let the statute lapse on june 30 1999 unless congress in the future reauthorizes the independent counsel the only available option for an independent counsel is to have the attorney general invoke existing authority to appoint special prosecutor to investigate particular matter for example when the independent counsel statute expired in 1992 and was not reauthorized until 1994 attorney general janet reno appointed robert fiske in 1993 to investigate th clintons involvement in whitewater and the death of white house aide vincent foster on july 9 1999 attorney general reno promulgated regulations concerning the appointment of outside temporary counsels to be called special counsels in certain circumstances to conduct investigations and possible prosecutions of certain sensitive matters or matters which may raise conflict for the justice department 28 cfr part 600 such special counsels will have substantially less independence than the statutory independent general including removal for misconduct dereliction of duty incapacity conflict of interest or for other good cause including violation of department policies

the federal budget covers and the major role the budget plays in the us economy substantial part of what cbo does is to support the work of the house and senate committees on the budget which were also created by the 1974 act those committees are in charge of the process spelled out in the act by which the c ongress sets its own targets for the federal budget including the overall levels of revenues and spending the surplus or deficit that results and the distribution of federal spending by broad functio nal categories each spring congress adopts the end result of that process the congressional budget plan in the form of concurrent resolution the resolution imposes an overall framework and discipline on the consideration of appropriations other spending measures and tax legislation the policies and principles that have shaped cbo since its inception are key factor in its effectiveness cbo is professional nonpartisan staff office and it does not make recommendations on policy that nonpartisan stance has been instrumental in preserving the agencys reputation for professionalism and has enhanced the credibility of its products cbo prepares independent analyses and estimates relating to the budget and the economy and presents options and alternatives for congress to consider it routinely discloses the assumptions and methods it uses which enhances the general perception of its products as objective and impartial some of cbos activities are statutory tasks others are carried out at the request of congressional committees or individual members according to the budget act cbo must give priority first to requests for services from the house and senate budget committees second to requests from the two appropriations committees the house committee on ways and means and the senate committee on finance and finally to requests from all other congressional committees cbo prepares various type of analyses for congress in cluding cost estimates for bills that individual members have introduced or plan to introduce but committee requests always take priority cbo handles requests from individual members only to the extent that its resources permit cbos services can be grouped in four categories helping congress formulate budget plan helping it stay within that plan helping it assess the impact of federal mandates and helping it consider issues

econometric models and commercial economic forecasting services it also relies on the advice of distinguished panel of advisers that meets twice year usually cbos forecasts are fairly close to the consensus of private forecasters cbo regularly publishes an evaluation of its economic forecasting record baseline budget projections the purpose of cbos budget projections is to give congress baseline for measuring the effects of proposed changes in tax and spending laws the projections show what would happen to the federal budget if current spending or revenue policies were unchanged over the projection period the budget committees use the projections to develop their annual budget resolutions and directives to other committees cbo uses them to produce cost estimates for proposed legislation and in scorekeeping tabulations for revenues and entitlement programs such as social security or medicare the baseline projections generally assume that current laws will continue without change for discretionary spending which is controlled by annual appropriation bills cbo bases its projections on the most recent appropriations adjusted for the projected rate of inflation analysis of the presidents budget and other assistance each year at the request of the senate committee on appropriations cbo analyzes the presidents budget to see how its revenue and spending proposals would affect cbos baseline budget projections in the analysis cbo uses its own economic assumptions and estimating techniques to recast the budget the president has proposed and submitted to congress in addition as congress moves towards its annual budget resolution cbo helps the budget and other committees estimate the effects of alternative budg et plans frequently cbo officials are asked to

estimate for virtually every bill reported by congressional committees to show how it would af fect spending or revenues over the next five years or more for most tax legislation cbo uses estimates provided by the joint committee on taxation separate congressional analytic group that works closely with the two taxwriting committees cbo also prepares cost estimates for use in drafting bills especially in the early stages formulating floor amendments and working out the final form of legislation in conference committees to the extent that its resources permit cbo estimates the cost of bills at the request of individual members in the past where appropriate cbo estimates contained the projected costs to state and local governments of carrying out the proposed legislation in march 1995 enactment of the unfunded mandates reform act greatly expanded cbos responsibilities in that area see below cbos cost estimates have become an integral part of the legislative process and committees increasingly refer to them at every stage of drafting bills the estimates may also have an impact on the final outcome of legislation because they are used to determine whether committees are complying with the annual budget resolutions and reconciliation instructions another cbo responsibility is providing estim ates to the appropriations committees of congress the numbers contained in appropriation bills usually represent budget authority and the resulting outlays must be estimated outlays are generally checks issued by the treasury or cashequivalent transactions that when subtracted from receipts are used to calculate the budget surplus or deficit cbos estimates may be crit ical in determining whether bill complies with allocations in the annual budget resolution scorekeeping one of cbos most important functions is to keep track of all spending and revenue legislation considered each year so congress can know whether it is acting within the limits set by the annual budget resolution cbo provides the budget and appropriations committees with frequent tabulations of congressional action on both spending and revenue billsalthough the bulk of cbos scorekeeping involves spending gislation the scorekeeping systems keep track of all bills that affect the budget from the time they are reported out of committee to the time they are enacted into law

first five years after the mandate takes effect cbo must provide an estimate of those costs if feasible and the basis of the estimate cbos statement must also include an assessment of what funding is

office is responsible to bipartisan joint leadership group which is comprised of the majority and minority leaders the president pro tempore and the chairman and ranking minority member of the committees on the judiciary and on rules and administration 97 the act specifies the activities of the office two of which are of immediate interest to committee oversight concerns representing committees of the senate in proceedings to aid them in investigations and advising committees and officers of the senate98 1 proceedings to aid investigations by senate committees the senate legal counsel may represent committees in proceedings to obtain evidence for senate investigations two specific proceedings are authorized the first proceeding is under the law providing committees the authority to grant witness immunity 18 usc 6005 it provides that committee or subcommittee of either house of congress may request an immunity order from us district court when the request has been approved by the affirmative vote of twothirds of the members of the full committee by the same vote committee may direct the senate legal counsel to represent it or any of its subcommittees in an application for an immunity order 99 the second proceeding involves authority under the ethics in government act of 1978 which permits the senate legal counsel to represent committee or subcommittee of the senate in civil action to enforce subpoena prior to the ethics act subpoenas of the senate could be enforced only through the cumbersome method of contempt proceeding before the bar of the senate or by certification to the us attorney and prosecution for criminal contempt of congress under 2 usc 192 194 the ethics act authorizes the senate to enforce its subpoenas through civil action in the us district court for the district of columbia 100 the house chose not to avail itself of this proced ure and this enforcement method applies only to senate subpoenas senate subpoenas have been enforced in several civil actions see for example proceedings to hold in contempt recalcitrant witness in the impeachment proceedings against judge alcee l hastings101 and proceedings to enforce subpoena duces tecum for the production of diaries of senator bob packwood102 97 2 usc 288a and b 288a 98 in addition the office is called upon to defend the senate its committees officers and

legal counsel to bring civil action to enforce subpoena in contrast to an application for an immunity order which may be authorized by committee only the full senate by resolution may authorize an action to enforce subpoena103 the senate may not consider resolution to direct the counsel to bring an action unless the investigating committee reports the resolution by majority vote the statute specifies the required contents of the committee report among other matters the committee must report on the extent to which the subpoenaed party has complied with the subpoena the objections or privileges asserted by the witness and the comparative effectiveness of criminal and civil proceeding 104 significant limitation on the civil enforcement remedy is that it excludes from its coverage actions against officers or employees of the federal government acting within their official capacities except where the refusal to comply is based on the assertion of personal privilege or objection and not on governmental privilege or objection that has been authorized by the executive branch 105 its reach is limited to natural persons and to entities acting or purporting to act under the color of state law106 2 advice to committees and officers of the senate and other duties the ethics act details number of advisory functions of the office of senate legal counsel principal among these are the responsibility of advising members committees and officers of the senate with respect to subpoenas or requests for the withdrawal of senate documents and the responsibility of advising committees about their promulgation and implementation of rules and procedures for congressional investigations the office also provides advice about legal questions that arise during the course of investigations 107 the act also provides that the counsel shall perform such other duties consistent with the nonpartisan purposes and limitations of title vii as the senate may direct108 thus in 1980 the office was used in the investigation relating to president carters brother billy and his connection to libya the office worked under the direction of the chairman and vicechairman of the subcommittee charged with the conduct of that investigation109 members of the office have also undertaken special assignments such as the senates investigation of abscam and other undercover activities110 the impeachment proceedings of judge harry claiborne111 judge walter l nixon jr112 and judge alcee l hastings jr 113 and the confirmation hearings of justice clarence thomas the office

september 28 1994 memorandum for all executive department and agency general counsels from lloyd n cutler special counsel to the president subject congressional requests to departments and agencies for documents protected by executive privilege the policy of this administration is to comply with congressional requests for information to the fullest extent consistent with the constitutional and statutory obligations of the executive branch while this administration like its predecessors has an obligation to protect the confidentiality of core communication s executive privilege will be asserted only after careful review demonstrates that assertion of the privilege is necessary to protect executive branch prerogatives the doctrine of executive privilege protects the confidentiality of deliberations within the white house including its policy councils as well as communications between the white house and executive departments and agencies executive privilege applies to written and oral communications between and among the white house its policy councils and executive branch agencies as well as to docu ments that describe or prepares for such communications eg talking points this has been the view expressed by all recent white house counsels in circumstances involving communications relating to investigations of personal wrongdoing by gove rnment officials it is our practice not to assert executive privilege either in judicial proceedings or in congressional investigations and hearings executive privilege must always be weighed against other competing governmental interests including the judicial ne ed to obtain relevant evidence especially in criminal proceedings and the congressional need to make factual findings for legislative and oversight purposes in the last resort this balancing is usually conducted by the courts however when executive privilege is asserted against congressional request for documents the courts usually decline to intervene until after the other two branches have exhausted the possibility of working out satisfactory accommodation it is our policy to work out such an accommodation whenever we can without undul interfering with the presidents need to conduct frank exchange of views with his principal advisors historically good faith negotiations between congress and the executive branch have minimized the need for invoking executive privilege executive privilege belongs to the president not individual departments or agencies it is essential that all requests to departments and agencies for information of the type described above be referred to the white house counsel before any information is furnished departments and agencies receiving such request should therefore follow the procedures set forth below designed to ensure that this ad ministration acts responsibly and consistently

the responsibilities and prerogatives of congress first any document created in the white house including white house policy council or in department or agency that contains the deliberations of or advice to or from the white house should be presumptively treated as protected by executive privilege this is so regardless of the docume nts location at the time of the request or whether it originated in the white house or in department or agency second department or agency receiving request for any such document should promptly notify the white house counsels office and direct any inquiries regarding such document to the white house counsels office third the white house counsels office working together with the department or agency and where appropriate the department of justice will discuss the request with appropriate congressional representatives to determine whether mutually satisfactory recommendation is available fourth if efforts to reach mutually satisfactory accommodation are unsuccessful and if release of the document would pass substantial question of executive privilege the counsel to the president will consult with the department of justice and other affected agencies to determine whether to recommen d that the president invoke the privilege we believe this policy will facilitate the resolution of issues relating to disclosures to congress and
