authority concer ning the meaning of section 1512b4 the supreme court unanimously reversed the fifth circuit decision the court looked at the plai n meaning of knowinglycorruptly persuades in the context of the statute and found that the term could appl only to persons conscious of wrongdoing and limiting criminality to persuaders conscious of their wrongdoing sensibly allows 1512b to reach only those with the level of culpabilitywe usually require in order to impose criminal liability citations omitted5 the court went on to criticize the lack of guidance given by the jury instructions indeed it is striking how little culpability th instructions required for example the jury was told that even if petitioner honestly and sincerely believed that its conduct was lawful you may find petitioner guilty the instructions also diluted the meaning of corruptly so that it covered innocent conduct6 the court stated that the jury instructi ons were inappropriate for second reason the instructions led the jury to believe that it did not have to find any nexus between the persuasion to destroy documents and any partic ular proceeding instead according to the court it had held in earlier cases that there must be nexus between the obstructive act and the proceeding otherwise if the defe ndant does not have know ledge that his actions are likely to affect the judici proceeding the defendant w ill lack the required intent to obstruct
