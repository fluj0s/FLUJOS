operational goals ghter physical and border security may also encourage terrorists and extremists to try to use other types of weapons to attack the united states persistent internet and computer security vulnerabilities which have been widely publicized may gradually encourage terrorist s to continue to enhance their computer skills or develop alliances with criminal organizations and consider attempting cyberattack against the us critical infrastructure cybercrime has increased dramatically in past years and several recent terrorist events appear to have been funded par tially through online cr edit card fraud reports indicate that terrorists and extremists in the middle east and south asia may be increasingly collaborating with cybercriminals for the international movement of money and for the smuggling of arms and illegal drugs these links with hackers and cybercriminals may be examples of the terrorists desire to continue to refine their computer skills and the relationships forged through collaborative drug trafficking efforts may also provide terro rists with access to highly skilled computer programmers the july 2005 subway and bus bombings in england also indicate that extremists and their sympathizers may already be embedded in societies with large information technology workforce the united states and international comm unity have taken st eps to coordinate laws to prevent cybercrime but if trends continue computer attacks will become more numerous faster and more sophisticat ed in addition recent report by the government accountability

introduction often it is very difficult to determine if cyber attack or intrusion is the work of terrorist organization with the objective of doing harm or cyber criminal who wishes to steal information for purposes of monetary gain just as terrorists and violent extremists often rely on exploiting vulnerabilities of targets seen as soft and easy to access to support possible future cybe r attacks cyber criminals exploit these same vulnerabilities to gain access to information that may lead to monetary gain implementation of stronger policy for dom estic physical security has reduced the risk to some targets that may have prev iously been vulnerabl to physical attacks also it is suggested by numerous experts that terrorists may be enhancing their computer skills or forming alliances with cybercriminals that possess highlevel of telecommunications expertise in add ition continuing publicity about internet computer security vulnerabilities may encourage terrorists interest in attempting possible computer network attack or cybera ttack against us critical infrastructure to date the federal bureau of inves tigation fbi reports that cyberattacks attributed to terrorists have largely b een limited to unsophisticated efforts such as email bombing of ideological foes or defaci ng of websites however it says their increasing technical competency is resulting in an emerging capability for network based attacks the fbi has predicted that terrorists will either develop or hire hackers for the purpose of complimen ting large conventional attacks with cyberattacks1 recently during the annual threat assessment fbi director mueller observed that terrorists increasingly us the internet to communicate conduct operational planning proselytiz recruit train and to obt ain logistical and financial support that is growing and increasing concern for us2 ibm has reported that during the firs t half of 2005 criminaldriven computer security attacks

cybercrime from suspected terrorist activitie s for example in recent report from the house homeland security committee fbi officials indicated that extremists have used identity theft and credit card fraud to support recent terrorist activities by qaeda cells4 also according to press reports indonesian police officials believe the 2002 terrorist bombings in bali were par tially financed through online credit card fraud5 this report reviews publications and government reports to explore the following 1 examples of vulnerabilities that may raise the level of interest that terrorists might have in attempting coordinated cyberattack 2 effects of the war on terror that are driving terrorists to use the internet more 3 inconsistent reporting about terrorists cyber activities and 4 ways that terrorists may be improving their cyber skills background distinctions between crime terrorism and war tend to blur when attempting to describe computer network attack cna in ways that parallel the physical world for example if nation state were to secretly sponsor nonstate actors who initiate cna to support terrorist activities or to create economic disruption the distinction between cybercrime and cyberwar becomes less clear because it is difficult to tell from where cyberattack originates an attacker may direct suspicion toward an innocent third party likewise the interactions between terrorists and criminals who use computer technology may sometimes blur the distinction between cybercrime and cyberterrorism it also may be the case th at individuals providing computer expertise to criminal or terrorist may not be aware of the intentions of the individual that requested the support so far it remains di fficult to determine the sources responsible for most of the annoying yet increasingl sophisticated attacks that plague the internet given the difficulty in determining the originator of the cyber intrusions or attacks some argue that unlike responding to traditional criminal acts the focus should be on the act rather than the pe rpetrator and the threshold for launching defensive and offensive ac tions should be lowered httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33123crs3 6

coordinated cyberattack unaccompanied by physical attack that would technically be very difficult to orchestrate and unlikely be effective in furthering terrorists goals because such an attack cannot

found in the inte rnet and in critical infrastructure computer systems are widely publicized many experts are concerned that private sector cyber security firms do not notif dhs or their customers immediately upon recognition of potentially serious internet security vulnerability if hackers become aware of this vulnerability observers speculate that these individuals could disable portions of the internet or successfully di srupt selected portions of the united states or international critical infrastructure this raises the following questions should vendors of computer products be required to quickly report all serious newly discovered product vul nerabilities to dhs should computer servi ce providers or busin esses be required to report to dhs any major security vulnerabilities that have been newly exploited by cybercriminals should there be penalties if an organization has poor security policy that contributes to major loss of sensitive information some actions are underway th at congress may consider97 for example on september 30 2005 an interim rule was issued by the federal acquisition regulations council outlinin g several new steps acquis ition workers must take to ensure it security is incorporated into all federal purchases under this interim rule government contracting officers must include additional cybersecurity rules in their acquisition planning which w ill require vendors to improve computer security for the it products and services they supply to the federal government98 experts now believe that terrorist colla borate with organized crime networks in the middle east for international smuggling of arms and illegal drugs criminal drug traffickers can provide terrorists with access to computer specialists with highlevel technical skills what are the pros and cons of linking counterterrorism efforts more closely to the efforts of agenci that counter drug trafficking should the counterterrorism efforts be li nked more closely with international efforts to prevent cybercrime what are effective ways to encourage more international cooperation fo r identifying which activ ities should be labeled as cybercrime and for punishing thos who operate as cybercriminalshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33123crs25 99 barton reppert remarks made by clifford lau july 26 2005 at the rayburn house office building

military networks are relatively secure many of those networks remain highly dependent on the civilian communications infrastructure99 should dod collaborate more closely with dhs for new technologies to strengthen the com puter security of civilian agencies and infrastructure trends for cybercrime indicate that computer attacks could increase in number speed and sophistication will futu re unknown computer vulnerabilities and sophisticated attacks allow terrorist to launch an effective cyberattack that might overwhelm the ability of civilian agencies to respond effectively could new approach to computer security reduce vulnerabilities an example of new approach to improve computer security for computer systems and the internet might include development and refinement of quantum methods for unbreakable cryptography100 however new approaches to computer security could also lead to the emergence of new threats directed against new vulnerabilities for example the proliferation and use of co mmercial products with unbreak able cryptography could seriously undermine the ability of law enfo rcement to perform critical missions such as protecting against threats posed by terrorists organized crime and foreign intelligence agents related legislation the following bills are related to improving national computer security or the prevention of cybercrime hr 1 hr 1 implementing the 911 commission recommendations act of 2007 was referred to the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs on january 9 2007 the dhs secretary sh all evaluate and annually prioritize all pending applications for cove red grants based upon the degree to which they would lessen the threat to the critical infrastruct ure including but not limited to cyber threats evaluation and prioritization shall be based upon the risk assessment by the office of intelligence analysis and the office of infrastructure protection of the threats of terrorism against the united states
