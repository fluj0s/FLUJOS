6110c04 shspec61 the prior confusion chronic somatic is the stuck point on the time track which is the stable datum of prior confusion so is hidden standard its easy to miss this because the confusion is earlier and is confusing the stable datum isnt in the middle of it if its aberrative you can always adopt stable datum in the middle of confusion its the one chosen later that sticks you on the track this isnt necessarily logical it is true because it is observed to be true not because of any theoretical reason the way to blow the chronic somatic is to blow the confusion immediately before its start it may be tricky to get the pc to look at the confusion not at the stable datum his attention bounces to later periods the confusion has lot of unknownness in it which may be masked by lot of pretended knowingness when looking for the prior confusion dont get just whatever was there right before it may be six months earlier lots of odd forgettingness turns up as you look forgettingness is caused be inability to confront motion the confusion area is notknow area which the guy handles with know later even if its stupid and painful its still knowingness all psychosomatics and hidden standards are cure for mysteries one can get feeling of relief following confusion that isnt really much relieved it can be just from getting knownness following confusion chronic somatic can be knowingness if its being used as hidden standard it is being used for knowingness there must have been some confusion before it this could be an explanation for the phenomenon of getting somatics following misunderstood words it can take some time for the pc to sort out when the somatic started and what the prior confusion was about when it started you can ask when did you notice it earlier or what happened before you noticed its not repetitive command you can even by assessment get the pc to look at the confusion accurately enough so it will asis and blow where the pc is not making progress on routine 3 you can bet that the pc has not done and is not doing the auditing command the pc may be being the auditing command he does the command and applies it to some area of the mind or body and looks at it to see if anything happened you are auditing pc whose attention is fixed on some special area and is doing something extra with the command it indicates outruds since the pc isnt under the auditors control but is putting in selfaudit step on each cycle any pc who hasnt gone clear in 150 hours is doing this he may resist telling the auditor what hes doing also if you ask him when did you start to notice the thing hes complaining of and he gives nonsequitur answer you can see him bounce out of the confusion and up to pt this tells you that you are on the right track you have to direct his attention to the right area to get the confusion dont just give him carte blanche to natter about the terminal hes fixated on keep guiding him to the occluded area that precedes the somatic or whatever ask about confusions or upsets or whatever you can get this sounds like long process this phenomenon can show up when you run an engram you start with the motionless point and search around to find the earlier action parts just auditing the motionless part with the chronic somatic in it wont resolve it even when running an ordinary engram as part of routine 3 if part of the engram sticks get the earlier part of the engram more basic question arises here how does person get stuck on the track in the first place and why is one on time track at all could it be that theres confusion at the beginning what is time maybe its retreat from confusion we did not care to confront persons ability to confront confusion could just blow chronic somatics but its not to be counted on it might be necessary to get several hidden standards out of the way so it might be well to clean them up well before getting into prehave levels using prior confusion assessments and sec checks
