drivers summary the transportation security administra tion tsa is gradually implementing section 1012 of the usa patriot act pl 10756 this provision seeks to reduce some of the security risks associ ated with hazardous materials hazmat transportation by requiring security th reat assessment of drivers with hazmat endorsement on their commerc ial drivers license cdl this process which includes immigration and database checks may deter terrorist from obtaining or keeping such an endorsement neverthe less the hazmat transportation system remains vulnerable to attac k members of congress ar overseeing implementation of tsas program reviewing its financial impacts and deciding whether to explicitly require in law comparable review of canadian and mexicandomiciled drivers transporting specified hazmats into the united states during 2004 tsa screened 27 million driv ers with hazmat endorsement by comparing their names to those on databases these checks generated more than 100 leads that were sent to the fbi tsa recognizes that the reliability of this process will be improved by incorporating fi ngerprintbased criminal background check for each of the next five years tsa w ill put roughly 15 of the drivers with or seeking hazmat endorsement through more comprehensive threat assessment process including fingerprintbased r ecords review this complex process is underpinned by detailed federal regulations and state procedures that pose costs or uncertainties for drivers or carriers federal program fees will likely cost each affected driver roughly 100 every five year s or so plus any additional state licensing fees for the first five years of the effort tsa estimates that the total of its startup and recurring program costs will be about 724 million but this figure is likely to change through its adjudication process tsa will face the difficult task of quickly responding to many drivers appealing ts as initial decisions effectively denying their hazmat endorsement or seekin g waivers from program standards tsa and the states have faced many challenges in the development and implementation of this initiative the complete program was originally planned to start in 2003 however it has been delaye d several times st arting january 31 2005 tsa will not permit state to issue ne w hazmat endorsement with cdl until determination has been made that an applicant does not pose security threat starting may 31 2005 this tsa rule also app lies to drivers seekin g either to renew cdl with this endorsement or in some cases to transfer hisher license from one state to another congress might consider whether to help the states pay for their costs to implement tsas program by specifying that any fee collected by tsa also must reflect state costs and must be shared with the states conduct additional oversight on tsas hazmat threat assessm ent process evaluate whet her tsa should be required to combine its hazmat security threat process with its transportation workers identification credential twic program or delay the finger printbased portion of the check until the twic is deployed each of these options poses its own set of unique costs and benefits that would need to be evaluated this report will not be updatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32740contents t s n d s c u r i t t h r t s s s s m n t s f h z m t d r i v r s 2 t h f i r s t p h s e4 second phase

the attorney general as being threat to the national security of the united states the commercial drivers license or the hazmat endorsement should not rely on this report but instead should consult and follow official regulatory information this report does not specify all of the relevant requirements 2 for example there are various training requirements for hazmat employees the knowledge test for the hazmat endorsement is in addition to the more general knowledge and skills tests required for cdl security threat assessments for hazmat drivers the transportation security administra tion tsa within the department of homeland security assesses various intelligence sources and other data to identify persons who they determine to pose security threat tsa has been assigned the lead responsibility for c onducting security threat ssessment on specified hazardous materials hazmat drivers when imple menting this responsibility tsa seeks to determine whether an individual poses s ecurity threat necessitating denial of hazmat endorsement as part of co mmercial drivers license cdl the endorsement basically author izes driver who has passe d knowledge test regarding hazmat transportation and meets other re quirements to transport specified amounts or types of hazmats1 2 through series of regulations and other activities the tsa is gradually instituting detailed and

national security of the united states 4 tsa maintains that it is also required to conduct background checks under sections 1121 1123 of the safe explosives act 5 for example as specified in its nove mber 24 2004 interim final rule tsa has determined that the security threat asse ssment standards should be changed to permit nonimmigrant aliens asylees and refugees who are in lawful status and possess valid and unrestricted documentation establishing eligibility for employment to apply for an hme and security threat assessment if they are qualified to hold cdl under 49 cfr parts 383 and 384 6 httpwwwtsagovpublicdisplaycontent09000519800d3fd3 7 the reader seeking more details on the program should consult continuedtsa and security threat assessments of hazmat drivers especially since 911 public and industry officials want to know more about the background of drivers transporting hazmat partly in res ponse to that concern congress enacted section 1012 of the usa patriot act pl 10756 which seeks to reduce some of the risks associated with hazmat transportation by requiring background checks on drivers transporting certa in hazmat shipments ie drivers who need hazmat endorsement on their cdl3 4 the complete check includes review of relevant intelligence and criminal history data bases tsas regulations state that the usa patriot act and the safe explosives act require check of various data bases to determine the drivers st atus under us immigration laws tsa requires the applicant for security threat assessment to meet certain specifications for example the person must be qualified to hold cdl and be us citizen or lawful permanent resident or meet other criteria5 pl 10756 also requires as appropriate check of the re levant international data bases through interpolus national central bureau or other appropr iate means tsa states that it also will check terrorist watch lists according to tsas regulations there are many different factors that can be used to determine that driver poses secu rity threat and thus must in general be disqualified from obtaining hazmat endor sement for example individuals who have been convicted of certain felonies who are specified fugitives who have been adjudicated as mentally incompeten t or involuntarily committed to mental institution or who are determined to pose th reat by terrorism or threat to national transportation security will not be allo wed to hold hazmat endorsement hme6 tsas regulations specify conditions and procedures under which driver who tsa deemed to pose security threat can app eal this decision also tsas regulations allow drivers who could not otherwise obt ain hme due to disqualifying felony conviction or lack of mental capacity to obtain waiver under specified conditions7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32740crs3 7 continued httpwwwtsagovpublicinterappeditorialeditorial_1730xml tsa prepared the following list of final rules interim final rules amendments and

unlimited number of ways that the hazmat transportation system is at risk from an attack by terrorists for exampl tank trucks can be attacked drivers can be killed and loads can be hijacked and released during shipment estimates indicate that there are hundreds of thousands of highway hazmat shipments per day in the united states simply put there are too many points of vulnerability to ensure security during hazmat transportation 9 upgrade occurs when someone with cdl adds hazmat endorsement to the license background check of commercial driver is widely regarded as an important security measure fingerprintbased criminal records review coupled with an intelligencebased review as part of b ackground check is one of many components in layered system to pr omote security of hazmat transportation tsas threat assessment process ma deter someone who may be security risk or who may be terrorist from obtaining or keeping zmat endorsement would terrorist want to go through criminal background check and have hisher name checked against multiple data bases by not being able to obtain or k eep hme persons access to some parts of the hazmat transportati on system can be reduced thus making it more difficult to do harm also tsas s ecurity threat process may make it more difficult for group of terrorists to organi ze coordinated attack using hazmat however tsas process is not intended or designed to address all the vulnerabilities in the hazmat transportation system in the war against terrorism tsas assessment process is viewed by some as prudent m easure by others as feel good measure it is recognized by all however that this investment is inherently limited in its impact8 tsas program has and will c ontinue to affect the zmat components of state cdl programs federal law and regulations have the ne t impact of almost forcing the states to participate in this program more specifically the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa in the depa rtment of transpor tation has issued requirement that the states must comply with the tsa requirements concerning background records checks for hazmat drivers or else face the loss of portion of their federal highway aid program moni fmcsa has issued regulation that prohibits states from issuing including upg rading transferring or renewing cdl with hazmat endorsement until tsa has determined that the applicant does not pose security threat warranting nial of the hazmat endorsement9 tsa has implemented its security threat assessment system in two major phases httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32740crs4 10 personal communication with tsa 2005the first phase the initial cycle of this first phase which was considered an interim or stopgap measure has already been conducted during 2004 tsa check ed the names and biographical data of some 27 million driver s with hazmat endorsement on their cdl against various government data bases including those concerned with terrorism more specifically tsa performed immigration and intelligencerelated checks on all drivers who hold hme one of the key questions tsa was essentially asking was do any of these drivers present potential terrorist threat one tsa official i ndicated that this namebased review yielded more than 100 leads that were given to the fbi10 tsa asserts that the terroristrelated data bases it searches are the best indication of an individuals predisposition to commit terrorist acts if it were discovered during the course of these namebased checks that an individual was suspected of posing or poses security threat tsa stated that it would initiate action to have the relevant state revoke that dr ivers hazmat endorsement the exact number of drivers that have been disqualified and had their endorsement re voked is classified according to tsa tsa has stated that it repeat s this namebased check periodically one key problem inherent in the initial cycle of the namebased checks is that it was not underpinned with biometric id entifier that would be needed to help confirm the identity of driver whose background is undergoing review without such an identifier namebas ed check of particular driver against terrorist watch list can be subject to question once fingerprintbased background record check is conducted and coupled w ith namebased check the overall accuracy of tsas threat assessment process would be enhanced considerably tsa is instituting such system in addition to this initial namebased check tsa also has instituted self reporting mechanism for drivers as of september 2 2003 tsa required any driver with hme that has committed disqualifying offense to surrender the hazmat endorsement some ve questioned the effectivene ss of this requirement tsa regulations specify that each state mu st immediately revoke drivers hazmat endorsement if tsa informs it that the aff ected driver does not meet specified tsas standards and issues an initial determination of threat assessment and immediate revocation second phase the first phase the namebased ch eck is being followed by second phase planned to start according to tsas regulations later than january 31 2005 as of that date state may issue new cdl with hazmat endorsement to driver unless that state receives determination of security threat notice from the tsa for that driver this notif ication in essence typically means that based on the results of its security threat assessment including namebased or intelligencebased data check and fingerprintbased criminal record review tsahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32740crs5 has determined that the dr iver does not pose security threat and should not be denied for security reasons the hazmat ndorsement on his or he r license thus this second phase consists of more comprehe nsive check than the first phase including fingerprintbased criminal history records review conducted by the fbi fingerprints help verify the claimed identity of the driver and are needed to conduct the fbis criminal background check when name is matched with fingerprint there is less chance of making mistake regarding the identity of particular driver with an identical name in sum durin g the second phase tsa determines whether the applicant initially obtaining including upgrading hazmat endorsement should be disqualified because he or she has been convicted of one or more specified offenses or does not meet other qualification standards detailed in title 49 code of federal regulations part 1572 as of may 31 2005 this second phase check will also apply to drivers seeking to renew and in some cases transfer to another state their cdl with hazmat endorsement during the last two years or so tsa fmcsa fbi the american association of motor vehicle administrators aamva an organization of state licensing and law enforcement officials and various state driver licensing officials have been working to specify the processes and institutional arrangements that will be needed to conduct the second phase of the tsa pro cess ie to conduct fingerprintbased criminal background check and to obtain th other information needed by tsa to complete its security threat assessment as specified in part 1572 although the mechanisms and procedures are almost finalized with some details still evolving it appears that the following generalized process will be used there are basically two options states can collect the fingerprints as well as the detailed security background information n eeded by tsa or st ates can let tsa agent contractor approved by tsa c onduct these functions tsa requires each state to specify whether it will obtain and submit fingerprints applicant information and fees itself or alternatively choose to have tsas agent complete those tasks tsa requires states to operate under their chosen system for several years unless change is otherwise approved by tsa with respect to the first option some st ates will collect fingerprints at their driver licensing agency some states will collect fingerprints at law enforcement agencies and still others will use statedesignated contractor to take the fingerprints on their behalf for those states that pa rticipate under the first option two types of information systems will need to be in pl ace communications link or infrastructure to submit fingerprints to the fbi and an improved information system to transmit all of the accompanying securityrelated background data to tsa according to aamva some of the key activities that these states will undertake include modifying their license application process for hazmat drivers to submit the needed securityrelated information sought by tsa modifying their commercial driver licensing information system cdlis program to ensure that this communications link can transmit to tsa the background data needed for the security check andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32740crs6 11 cdlis is the communications backbone of the cdl program and allows states to communicate with each other electronically regarding cdl records 12 personal communication with aamva 2004 13 personal communication with tsa 2004 14 according to tsa see httpwwwtsagov publicinterappeditorialeditorial_173 0xml generally drivers must renew their hazmat endorsement every five years although states may require more frequent reviews the driver will be required to submit new fingerprints at the time of renewal of the endorsement if driver has been convicted of disqualifying criminal offense or longer meets the sta ndards in the rule after obtaining the hazmat endorsement his or her endorsement will be revokedaltering state business processes pertaining to licensing drivers with the hazmat endorsement11 other states will instruct their cdl driv ers with hazmat endorsement that need to undergo security threat assessment to vi sit the designated tsa agent that agent will collect fingerprints and submit thes to the fbi for its criminal background check the tsa agent also will collect background information that will be submitted to the tsa for input into its secu rity threat assessment some industry managers and many drivers are concerned about how far drivers will need to travel to have their fingerprints and background information taken at tsa agent facilities all states will modify their cdlis to r eceive tsas determina tion as to whether specific driver should be nied hazmat endorsement based on the results of this agencys security assessment also all states will implement training programs regarding the new security assessment process for their licensing employees who deal with hazmat drivers thus even stat choosing to use tsa agent to collect fingerprints and background driver informa tion will have to make changes to their cdl process aamva acting on behalf of the states is to ensure that background information transmitted through cdlis to tsa includes the information required by tsa12 tsa must also conduct many other functions during its security threat assessment process tsa operates its credentialing screening gateway system an expert system that aggregates information from various sources and data bases and performs an initial screening as to whether an applicant should be allowed to obtain or upgrade renew or transfer hisher hazmat endorsement if red flags are raised as result of checking multiple data bases this system will notify the appropriate state that the driver shoul d not be refused based on any security concerns issuance including upgrade transfer or renewal of the cdl license with the hazmat endorsement this screening process also flags those drivers that need to be reviewed more carefully by tsa its adjudicators have access to various information systems and other means to further review such applications13 tsa plans to conduct complete secu rity threat assessment on each hme driver at least once every fiveyear period starting in 200514 fmcsa regulations specify that state may only issue hazmat endorsement for up to five years before it must be renewed thus if driver renews hisher license with the hazmathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32740crs7 15 dhs tsa federal register april 6 2004 17969endorsement on may 30 2005 it may not be until may 2010 before the license is renewed and the driver is subject to complete security threat assessment that includes fingerprintbased criminal b ackground check thus under its current schedule it will not be until sometime during mid to late 2010 before tsa completes the first cycle of its complete security threat assessments on essentially all drivers seeking to maintain or obtain hazmat endor sement it is important to point out that most drivers will undergo complete threat assessment before this outside date also during this fiveyear period tsa pl ans to conduct periodic namebased checks on all drivers holding th hazmat endorsement it will be huge and complex task to fingerprint some 20 to 27 million drivers seeking hazmat endorsement or its renewal every five years or so compare their background data to that found on criminal nd other data bases and then use this information to make decisions about who s hould be deemed security threat or risk for purposes of compliance with section 1012 of the usa patriot act numerous challenges have been faced and delays have occurred in settin g up and beginning to implement this entire process as discussed subsequently there are many uncertainties how efficiently will tsa be able to process the volume of requests it receives how much time will tsa take to respond to the numerous appeals and waivers that are likely to be initiated by driv ers when will all of the states be ready to comply with the various tsa requirements will additional delays occur in this program how will this program affect commercial drivers and hazmat carriers brief history of the program tsa originally wanted its fingerprint based security checks to start in 2003 however the agency has already delayed aspects of this program three times on may 5 2003 tsa issued an interim fina l rule ifr that required specified commercial drivers to undergo fingerpr intbased criminal history records check chrc and namebased check of federal and international databases related to terrorist activity in november 2003 tsa am ended its interim fi nal rule to extend the required start date for fingerprin ting from november 3 2003 to april 1 2004 the amendment also allowed the states to request deadline extension from tsa up until december 1 2004 on april 6 2004 tsa amended its regula tions again delayed various aspects of program implementation nd decided to require all st ates to begin fingerprint based background checks of specified hazmat drivers by january 31 200515 as stated in the rule tsa wanted to maximize flexibility for the states and sought to ensure that the issuance of cdl with hazmat endorsement would not be impeded by security requirements tsa expected that the cost of the background check to be paid by the driver or by the employer if they so chose will not exceed 100 tsa stated that it intended to issue regulation establishing fees to cover its costs and another regulation to codify back ground check processes and standards in setting up this program tsa and the st ates have faced many challenges and encountered delays tsa reportedly took substantial time to delineate the technicalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32740crs8 16 transport topics april 5 2004 29 17 personal communication with aamva 2004 and 2005design requirements for all of the co mmunication and information systems and protocols that will be needed for the states to interact with the tsa in the past uncertainties associated with the program including its requirements and procedures caused difficulties for some state officials for example georgias director of driver services is quoted as saying we cant go out and spec system when we dont know what its supposed to do theres lot of different hardware and software devices and until they spec out the standards we cant get cost proposal16 for considerable period of time it was difficult for the states to plan on how they were going to implement all of their responsibilities under the tsa program and integrate tsa s requirements with their state licensing processes without definitive and rele vant regulations and opera ting procedures many of which were not specified until late 2004 when tsa issued key interim final re gulations in november 2004 this agency gave the states tight deadlines to make im portant decisions about their role in the tsa threat assessment process states had to decide quickly on such matters as whether they wanted to use the tsa agent and how they might have to change their state licensing processes to adapt to the tsa requirements aamva reported in november 2004 that tsa had almost resolved the remaining technical issues that needed to be addressed before st ates could use their cdlis to communicate with tsa this association of state licensing and law enforcement officials stated that it could then begin to write the business and technical specifications that the states will use to change their information systems needed to participate electronically in this program however it should be stressed that the process of implementing the systems needed to electronically transmit critical data back and forth among the states and tsa is complicated and still will require additional time as all of the design requirements business and technical parameters are finalized aamva is writing its final specifications that provide guidance to the state licensing agencies on how to imp lement their responsibilities under the tsa program aamva estimates that this writing process may take two months to implement these final specifications states will need time to modify their driver licensing systems including informa tion and communication systems these changes are needed to transmit securityrelated information electronically to tsa and to receive information from tsa regarding its assessment of the security threat posed by particular driver after th final specifications are issued aamva estimates that an additional six months and maybe longer will be needed by most states to implement and test the changes to their cdlis in order to transmit information to and receive information back from tsa17 aamva states that each state cdlis and tsas cdlis will need to be tested before the association allows each state and tsa to use cdlis to communicate electronically with each other since tsa does not have an existing cdli s tsas link to the cdlis network or its node needs to be test ed and approved by aamva in order for tsa to sendhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32740crs9 18 ibid 19 states have been making many changes to their cdl programs to accommodate many other changes in federal regulations pertaining to cdl 20 personal communication with aamva and various state licensing officials 2004 21 such fees when they go back directly to the licensing agency may be used to cover the expenses for equipment training and informa tion systems needed to obtain fingerprints and receive and transmit securityrelated information to federal officials in some states the fees collected are deposited in the general fundelectronic messages to the states via cdlis completion of these processes will also take some time18 also institutional challenges affected the expeditious and efficient development and implementation of tsas program there are resource manpower challenges and procurement issues at some state licensing agencies that place limitations on their ability to implement in timely manner all of the changes necessary to participate efficiently in this program19 furthermore some states may need to obtain legislative or administra tive authority in order to collect the background securityrelated information needed by tsa or to charge additional fees beyond the amount they now assess for cdlhazmat endorsement states must make other necessary changes in their state licensing systems to accommodate various aspects of the tsa security threat assessment process20 some state motor vehicle agencies still do not have the stateapproved legislative or regulatory authority to collect securityoriented information or assess additional fees21 the lack of authority will likely force some states to require the hazmat drivers licensed in their states to use the tsa agent on the federal side many administrative changes have contributed to the challenges in implementing this initiative first of all the program was originally assigned to fmcsa and then later it was transferred to tsa new organization that required time to organize and staff once at ts there were personnel and organizational changes that affected c ontinuity of progra m management current status with respect to those states that c hoose not to use the tsa agent tsa and aamva recognized that not all states would be able to change their information systems fast enough to trans mit required data electronically with the tsa and the fbi by the january 31 2005 deadline consequently tsa decided to establish for short or interim peri od alternative means for the states to submit information these alternative means may include mail email and faxes thus different states will use different processes to transmit data to tsa the problem posed by this flexibility is that the methods used by all states ma not be as secure or as efficient as electronically transmitting information over the cdlis tsa plans to format or digitize the information submitted by the states into useable format until the states complete computer upgrades and are capable of transmitting data across the cdlis more specifically tsa stat if state knowshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32740crs10 22 dhs tsa federal register november 24 2004 68723 23 httpwwwtsagovpublicdisplaycontent09000519800d798f 24 27 million hazmat drivers reviewed over 60 month period would require processing an average of 45000 drivers per month tsa ggests that this number may be about 20 million drivers during this period the exact number of active drivers that will seek to continue having the hazmat endorsement is unknown 25 personal communication with tsa 2005that it will not be able to transmit the in formation electronically until after july 2005 however the state should formally elect to have tsa capture the fingerprints and driver information tsa can staff the da ta entry for short period of time until states computer system is upgraded but tsa does not have the resources to perform that task beyond july 200522 tsa expects that these alternative pathways will allow any state to process applications fo r issuance including upgrading of the cdl with the hazmat endorsement starting janua ry 31 2005 thus the states are expected by tsa to be compliant with tsa requi rements by january 31 2005 most of the states however will not be using their cdlis by this date to participate in the tsa threat assessment program as of december 28 2004 tsa reports that the following states will not use the tsa agent florida illinois indiana iowa kansas kentucky maryland mississi ppi new mexico new yor k pennsylvania south carolina tennessee texas ve rmont virginia and wisconsin23 on november 10 2004 tsa issued an exemption notice from its regulations found in 49 cfr section 15725c2i tsa gave the states another extension in the deadline to begin implementing two aspects of the security threat assessment program tsa now requires that only driv ers applying for the issuance including upgrading of the cdl with the hazmat endorsement not re newals or certain transfers will be subject to the finger printbased background checks starting january 31 2005 complete including fingerprin tbased security ssessments for those drivers seeking certain transf ers and all renewals of their hazmat endorsement will be required to start later than may 31 2005 tsas gateway screening process will need to process in timely manner roughly 33000 to 45000 applications per m onth expected from hazmat drivers required to undergo security threat assessment24 although this screening process has been tested it will need to operate efficiently unde r actual load conditions for sustained periods of time under its current plans tsa will have few more months to improve the efficiency of its operations before it begins to receive t housands of requests for security threat assessments from drivers seeking renewal and in some cases transfer to another state of their cdls with the hazmat endorsement one tsa official indicated that this additional assessment workload can be handled25 also tsa will need to respond to the appeals of perhaps hundreds maybe eventhousands of drivers each year that dis pute its decision to disqualify them from obtaining transferring or renewing cd l with hazmat endorsement tsa will also need to make numerous decisions regarding requests for waivers from disqualification decisionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32740crs11 26 ibid 27 based on discussions with tsa 2004tsa has built in some flexibility to the program its regulations specify that state may extend the expiration date of dr ivers license with hazmat endorsement for 90 days if tsa has not issued determination of security threat or final determination of threat assessment this provision is really safety valve in the process and is intended to deal with those cases when timely decision hasnt been reached this extension is s upposed to allow driver to keep operating while tsa conducts its decisionmaking however the difficulty with this tsa safety valve is that some states are prohibited by state law from simply extending the expiration date of drivers license although states can change their licensing laws or procedures this process can take considerable time tsa plans to fund the necessary resour ces to implement its hazmat driver security threat assessment program including adjudicators to handle appeals combination of additiona l federal personnel and c ontractors will be used nevertheless until this program has been functioning for at least several months beyond may 31 2005 when ll renewals must undergo security background check it remains uncertain how fast and efficiently tsas adjudication process will be able to respond if large number of drivers dispute and appeal initial tsa decisions or request waivers from tsa standards tsa expects that it will be able to address this challenge26 state funding and federal funding and fees for tsa funding has been and tinues to be challenge that some states face in program implementation for states the cost s of the program vary and depend in part on whether state uses the tsa agent costs are expected to be greater for those states that do not use the tsa agent tsa has never requested an d has never been provided with funds to directly help states pay costs to change their information and communication systems and other expenses associated with implementing this program27 however in pl 108 90 congress specified that for fy2004 and thereafter the secretary of homeland security is to charge reasonable fees for providing credentialing and background investigations in the field of transportation on november 10 2004 tsa proposed to tablish fees for drivers who apply for or renew cdl with hazmat endor sement and thus are required to undergo tsas security threat assessment this ag ency seeks to establish two new user fees the first called the threat assessment fee is to cover tsas costs of performing and adjudicating hazmat driver security threat assessments appeals and waivers associated with the program the sec ond called the informa tion collection fee is to cover the costs of collecting and

threat assessment fee 36 and fbi fee 22 if tsa agent collects or 24 if state collects thus the total federal fees per hazmat endorsement app licant would be roughly 83105 every five years or so these federal fees would be in addition to the existing licensingsafetyoriented fees now charged by the states state coll ecting applicant background information and transmitting driver fingerprints to the fbi without using the tsa agent would not charge drivers the federal information collection fee instead it might charge other additional state fees some states do not plan on charging any additional fee in its fy2005 appropriation congress gave tsa the authority to collect 17 million in fees to cover various credentialing programs including its hazmat security threat assessment program for fy2005 tsa also received 5 million in its appropriation to pay for its front end or start up costs for credentialing programs29 tsa indicated it does not have legal authority to share fees collected to pay for federal costs associated with the driver assessment program with state driver licensing agencies or to provide grants to states to help pay the costs of participation in the tsa process tsa notes that while state may not collect fee pursuant to tsas fee authority it is not prohibited from collecting fee determined by the state under its own authority from an individua l who applies for or renews hazmat endorsement tsas agent contractor approved by tsa does conduct many of the functions fingerprinting and securityoriented data collection that the states would otherwise have to undertake tsa estimates that its total startup co st for the program will be about 476 million the agencys total annual recurring costs is projected to be roughly 142 million for the first year ie from january 31 2005 to january 30 2006 and between 132 million and 136 million per year for the second through fifth years30 based on the number of drivers expected to apply for security threat assessments and various cost assumptions tsa estimates that the sum total of its startup and recurring costs for the first fiveyears will be about 724 million this agency notes that these estimates will be modified how will tsa use these collected fees the fees must be used to pay for program costs tsa has elaborated on the requirements of the program tsa must implement and maintain the appropriate systems resources and personnel to ensure that fingerprints nd applicant information are linkedand that tsa can receive and act on the results of the security threat assessment tsa will be required to have the necessa ry resources to perform the securityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32740crs13 31 dhs tsa federal register november 10 2004 65337 32 aamvas comments to the docket in response to tsas proposed fee

application in future years in the case of drivers who successfully appealed tsa background check or were granted waiver31 aamva takes issue with tsas projected costs of this program this association maintains that 1 tsas cost analysis failed to integrate operating costs and expenses to aamva and the states for their startup and maintenance costs associated with the hme security threat assessment process 2 tsa also has not included expenses for changes to the cd lis to accept and transmit hme application and threat determination da ta and 3 tsa does not addr ess the expenses to aamva and the states for the testing required to make sure the proce ss functions properly between each of the states and tsa32 this association recommended that tsa should recalculate the total costs of the pr ogram and provide funds to the states and aamva to help pay for establishing and maintaining the program33 on the other hand it should be noted that it may be difficult to determine the exact state costs specifically dedicated to this program but estimates of appropriate costs could be ascertained policy concerns some members of congress are concerne d that implementation of section 1012 of the usa patriot act has taken so l ong and dhs officials have acknowledged that this concern needs to be addressed34 some state officials also were concerned primarily until november 2004 that tsa took so long to detail key regulations specifications and deadlines pertaining to the state role in this program some states have praised tsa for the intensified ffort of late to move forward with implementation one official noted that their state licensing officials took the actions of congress to heart and moved w ith all deliberate speed to be ready to implement the law it is now time to do so and we are encouraged with the present efforts of tsa along with the efforts of the american association of motor vehicles to use the cdlis platform to communicat adjudication respons to the state mv jurisdictions35 tsa is also considering how security threat assessments might be conducted on canadian and mexicandomiciled hazmat drivers who transport specified hazmat loads or materials into the united states tsa has stated that all hazmat drivers will eventually have to meet eligibility and threat assessment standards that arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32740crs14 36 httpwwwtsagovpublicdisplaycontent09000519800d3fd3comparable to the standards that us hazmat drivers must meet36 specific requirement for background check on ca nadian and mexican domiciled drivers was proposed in key surface transportation reauthorization legislation hr 3550 as amended and passed by th senate and house c onsidered during the 108th congress this provision did not become law but th is requirement may be included in surface transportation legislati on considered by the 109th congress policy options other policy options that might be c onsidered pertaining to tsas hazmat security threat assessment program include option 1 help the states meet some of the costs of participating in tsas program by specifying that the fee collected by tsa must be shared with the states and that the states share reflect state costs option 2 conduct additional overs ight on tsas implementation of the program with the intent of encouraging timely progress in program implementation option 3 evaluate whether tsa should be required to combine its hazmat security threat assessmen t with its transportation workers identification credential discussed below at the earliest date possible or option 4 delay the fingerprin tbased portion of the tsa hazmat security threat assessment until the twic is ready for national deployment each of these options poses its own set of unique costs and be nefits that would need to be evaluated for example t hose supporting option 1 could assert that it is appropriate for tsa to help finance the states activities which are critical to tsas security threat asse ssment program for many years congress has provided funds to help finance other improvements in state cdl pr ograms on the other hand funds dedicated for threat assessments of hazmat drivers would drain resources away from other securityoriented activities furthermore some states are able to increase fees to pay for their program costs the costs of implementing this program for some states especially for those using the tsa ag ent are so small that an official from one state indicated that option 1 would not be of much ec onomic value with respect to option 2 it remains to be seen whet her additional oversig ht would have beneficial impact but increased attention on this program might provide the impetus for continued progress many in the zmat trucking industry would likely favor option 3 and even more so option 4 however tsa raises several key counterpoints to industry arguments discussion follows below on tsas view of the importance of moving forward with the security threat assessment for hazmat drivers as expeditiously as possible industry concerns regarding implemen tation of the tsa security background check are discussed in the next section httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32740crs15 37 tsa indicated that it plans to make such notifications selected industry and driver concerns regarding tsas program the trucking industry generally suppor ts background checks of those drivers transporting hazmat many industry mana gers welcome reliable information that provides background data regarding who is operating their trucks access to the results of tsas security thr eat assessment would help them screen their drivers in its november 24 2004 interim fi nal rule tsa stated that any notification the agency makes to an employer will relay whether the drivers endorseme nt has been revoked so that the employer knows that specific driver is not authorized to transport hazmat37 the desire of industry managers for background data is not surprising given the need to protect investments of 100000 or more per truck and loads that can cost several hundred thousand dollars to one million dollars or more some in industry have called for extension of the background check to all drivers holding the cdl regardless of the type of endorsement many trucking officials have concerns regarding tsas implementation of its security threat assessment program for specified hazmat drivers more specifically many in the hazmat trucking industry are ag ainst separate security check for hazmat drivers that is not conducted as part of the background check needed to obtain the transportation workers identification credential twic as discussed below those holding this view generally want th background check required for the hazmat endorsement to be layed until the twic program is fully implemented tsa is against this delay some maintain that tsas deadlines for implementing the complete security threat assessment program are unreasonable and that the fingerprintbased prog ram is not yet ready in order to understand the current conf lict on this issue among many hazmat carriers and tsa it is important to unders tand what the twic entails the twic when fully implemented would be an integral part of an identification system intended to prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to secure areas in the transportation system tsa intends to require the twic to be issued to broad array of transportation workers after comprehensive screening of the applicant for ties to terrorism for example the twic woul d be required for personnel working at secure transportation area as well as drivers delivering hazmat load to that area biometric identifier incorporated into the twic would be intended to enhance its reliability as security measure major purpose of the twic is to eliminate the need for transportation workers to obtain multiple credentials tsa is currently pilot testing this system those tests will take well into 2005 many hazmat carriers see need for tsa to require complete background check including fingerprintbased criminal records review for driver seeking hazmat endorsement and another but s imilar check on the same driver seeking twic many ask why is it necessary fo r hazmat drivers to undergo two background checks why cant these security threat assessment processes be integrated and the background checks combined wont obtainingrenewing both documents the hazmat endorsement and the twic take lot of time how many drivers willhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32740crs16 38 personal communication with ata

the co sts involved in the security clearances thus aggravating any perceived or actual shortages in available drivers what are the costs required to implement thes two security processes the american trucking associations inc ata has maintained that the background check conducted for the twic which would be required of hazmat drivers and many other transportation wo rkers entering secure area would be sufficient for the background check required to obtain hazmat endorsement ata argues against duplicative checks and reco mmends holding off on fingerprintbased checks solely for hazmat drivers until the twic program is fully deployed ata maintains that it does not make sense to establish fingerprintbased security check process centered around the state departme nt of motor vehicle administrations38 more recently ata requested that tsa reconsider the need for fingerprintbased check on the grounds that this agen cy had already conducted namebased background checks and had achieved the goal specified in the usa patriot act of added security this ssociation asserted that tsas implementation of state based fingerprint collection process unnecessarily increases the costs of performing background checks ata suggested that tsa continue with the namebased background checks and eventually combine its security threat assessment process for specified hazmat drivers with the agencys implementation of the twic39 the national tank truck carriers in c nttc recently petitioned the tsa and recommended that the secr etary of dhs should either 1 indefinitely postpone the proposed implementation dates for th fingerprintbased security threat assessment or 2 temporar ily substitute namebased background check in lieu of the proposed fingerprintbased check n ttc thought that tsas goals and latest target dates set in the interim rule were unreasonable this association stated to suggest that all of the individual states andor the yet unnamed tsa agent who might serve as proxy in any given state will have the required processes procedures equipment and tr ained personnel in place by either of those dates is folly40 tsa has stated that it will not delay its planned security assessment program for hazmat drivers until the twic is implemented there are several reasons why tsa is against combining the two backgr ound reviews at this time tsa is under substantial pressure to respond to section 1012 of the usa patriot act as well as the safe explosives act this agency does not want to furt her delay fingerprint based background checks on hazmat driver s until 2 006 or later when the twic system is fully operational one tsa official stated that there is significant security risk which compels them to move forward with the complete security assessment process for hazmat drivers more specifically tsa maintains that it would be mistake to delay security check as important as the background review of hazmat drivers by one year in order to combine it with the twic although there are differences in the two programs it wa s noted that there still will be opportunitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32740crs17 41 personal communications with tsa 2004 and 2005 42 beadle andrew d hazmat hassle traffic world november 22 2004 22for additional synergistic programmatic or administrative arrangements and efficiencies eg leveraging fingerprinting locations or adjudication processes in the future as the two programs evolve41 given the status of the twic program which is best characterized as an evolving ffort with substantia l unanswered policy and technical questions it is not surprising that tsa wants to decouple these two security measures at least initially tsa might be able to reduce or perhaps even solve some of the concerns that industry has posed for example if co mmon biometric identifier were used for both the hazmat security threat assessment process and for the twic program then some efficiencies might be gained furthe rmore if the factors that would disqualify someone from obtaining twic were identi cal or nearly so to those that would disqualify driver from obtaining or k eeping hazmat endor sement th background checks required for both documents could be identical or nearly so based on discussions with tsa officials specifyin g common disqualification factors appears to be the direction that the tsa is movi ng it does not appear that over the long term the agency wants to conduct two separate background checks on the same person as these two programs evolve ts may eventually issue regulations that merge these two background checks to the maximum extent possible when this will happen remains uncertain in addition to the fees that will be im posed tsas program will affect drivers in other ways as result of the decisi ons made under this pr ogram some drivers will lose their hazmat endorse ment some drivers will not want to be subjected to the security threat assessment process and will decide not to work for company requiring this endorsement some sugge st that up to 20 of the estimated 27 million drivers with the hazm at endorsement may not seek renewal of their endorsement42 such decisions would add to an perceived or actual shortages of hazmat drivers concluding observation the costs of successful and catastrophic terrorist attack using hazmat could include an incalculable number of lives nd dollars of damages or more most would agree that individuals posing security threat to the united states should not be given authority to transport explosiv highly toxic gases and other highly dangerous goods tsas security threat assessment process is viewed by some as prudent measure that when combined with many other layered security measures may help reduce some of the risks associ ated with hazmat transportation the output of tsas security threat assessm ent process however will not prevent determined terrorist from attempting to use specified hazmat shipments as weapon of mass destruction one of the outcomes of tsas process is yes or nodecision which then affects state licensing decision as to whether to allow driver to obtain or keephttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32740crs18 43 this yes or decision can be transmitted in the form of notification of security threat from tsa to the affected state hazmat endorsement43 tsas program also requi res federal decisions about waivers and appeals the complexity of the entire process underpinned by many detailed pages of federal and state regulations and procedures offers many opportunities for uncertainties and additional costs to dr ivers and commerce the various uncertainties associated with this program will eventually be addressed but some are problematic at this time carriers and drivers want to experience that the tsa security threat assessment process is efficiently and effectively implemented over the long term and is compatible with state licensing processes and the operating logistics of the industry
