d or 2002 31 oregon v ashcroft 368 f3d 1118 9th cir 2004 the court of appeals provided two independent reasons for finding the directive unlawful and unenforceable 1 the directive altered the usual constitutional balance between the states and the federal government in the absence of clear statement by cong ress that the csa authorizes such action and 2 the directive is contrary to the plai n language of the csa which is limited to combating conventional drug abuse and requires the secretary of health and human services not the attorney general to make decisions on medical policy id at 11241129 32 gonzales v oreg on 125 sct 1299 2005practitioners or others and regardless of the condition of the person whose suicide is assisted28 this directive thus attempts to accomplish three specific things29 declaring that the phrase legitimate medical purpose as it appears in regulation that interprets th csa does not include physician assisted suicide determining that prescribing dispensing or administering federallycontrolled substances to assist suicide is violation of the csa and cautioning that assisting in suicide may render physicians registration inconsistent with th public interest and thus subject to suspension or revocation on november 7 2001 the state of oregon joined by an oregon physician and pharmacist and several terminally ill patients filed lawsuit for

in the opinion of the court attorney general ashcroft had exceeded his st atutory authority under the csa when he issued the directive and his determination excluding physicianassisted suicide as legitimate medical purpose under the prescription re quirement of the csa is entitled to judicial deference standards of judicial deference as framework for analyzing the attorney generals directive throughout the opinion the court considered several different standards of judicial deference that might be applicable and ultimately concluded that only one woul d be appropriate judicial deference is the degree to which court will uphold and re spect the validity of federal agencys interpretive rules during judicial review of such ag ency decisions the court described the inquiries that determine the level of judi cial deference accorde d as they had been explained in earlier supr eme court jurisprudence auer v robbins 34 if the administrative rule interprets the issuing agencys own

congress did not confer upon the agency authority to promulgate the rules or regulations the interpretation is respected by the court only to th extent that it is persuasive as these standards indicate the degree of deference to which an agencys rule is entitled depends on two threshold matters 1 whether the interpretation at issue construes statutory text or the regulations promulgated by

resolve any challenges to an ad ministrative agencys rules and indeedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33120crs7 38 gonzales 126 s ct at 915 39 id at 916the gonzales court relied on this analysis to guide its opinion to the outcome it reached the relevant statutory text and regulations the court examined the following statutory provisions of th csa and the regulation at issue 21 usc 829a controlled substance in schedule ii may be dispensed without the written prescription of practitioner 21 cfr 130604a to be effective prescription for controlled substance must be issued for legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner acting in the usual course of his professional practice 21 usc 824a4 the attorn ey general may deny suspend or revoke physicians dea registrati on if the physicians registration would be inconsistent w ith the public interest the first provision was part of the csa as it had been enacted in 1970 the second provision is regulation promulgated by the attorney general in 1971 interpreting the word prescription as it appears in 21 usc 829 the third provision was added to the csa by amendmen ts made to the law in 1984 parroting regulation the government in gonzales claimed that the ashcroft directive issued in 2001 is an interpretation of the term leg itimate medical purpose in the regulation 21 cf r 130604a under the governments position the ashcroft directive woul d appear to be entitled to the auer substantial deference standard as purpor ted interpretation of an agency regulation rather than of statute however the gonzales court declined to accord the auer standard of deference to the directive in its vi ew the agency regulation 21 cfr 130604a does little more than restate the terms of the statute itself38 because the language of the directive comes from congress not the attorney general this near equivalence of the statute and the regulation renders auer deference inappropriate the court thus announced new principle fo r judicial review of agency rules and deference standard selection the existence of parroting regulati on does not change the fact that the question here is not the meaning of the regulation but the meaning of the statute an agency does not acquire special aut hority to interpret its own words when instead of using its expertise and experience to formulate regulation it has elected merely to paraphrase the statutory language39 because the court majority believed that the regulation at issue was mere paraphrase of the statutory language it exa mined whether the ashcroft directive was entitled to receive chevron deference as an interpretation of the csa rule not authorized applying the mead analysis the court refused to accord chevron deference to the directive after concluding that it was nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33120crs8 40 id citing mead 533 us at 22627 41 21 usc 821 42 21 usc 871b 43 gonzales 126 s ct at 916 44 21 usc 8025 45 gonzales 126 s ct at 917 46 id promulgated pursuant to the authority that congress delegated to the attorney general40 the court made the determination that the csa fails to provide the attorney general with the authority to issue this particular rule carrying the force of law after examining the language struct ure and purpose of the csa first the court explained that the csa delegates to the attorney general the power to make rules relating to registra tion and control of the manufacture distribution and dispensing of controlled substances41 as well as other rules he deems necessary and appropriate for the efficient execution of his functions under the statute42 the court noted however that the attorn ey generals powers under the csa are expressly limited to those func tions and responsibilities and that nothing in the csa authorizes the attorney general to make rule declaring illegitimate medical standard for care and treatment of patients that is specifically authorized under state law43 the directive was issued in excess of the attorney generals authority to make regulations for the control of drugs si nce the courts majority determined that control is term of art that is defined in the statute to add drug or other substance or immediate precursor to schedule under part b of this subchapter whether by transfer from anot her schedule or otherwise44 because the directive does not address the schedulin g of drugs the court found that it cannot be considered valid exercise of the attorney genera ls power to control drugs through the making of regulations45 in apparent response to the gonzales dissenting opinion that questioned the applicability of the statutory definition of control to the attorney generals authority to promulgate the directive and which argued instead for the use of dictionary definition of control the majority opi nion rejected giving control more expansive meaning stating that even if control in 21 usc 821 were underst ood to signify something other than its statutory definition it w ould not support the ashcroft directive the statutory references to control outside the scheduling context make clear that the attorney general can establish controls against diversion but do not give him authority to define diversion based on his view of legitimate medical practice the csas express limitations on the attorney generals authority and other indications from the statutor scheme belie any notion that the attorney general has been gr anted this implicit authority46 the directive is also not authorized under the attorney generals powers to register physician

the government argued however that the dir ective merely provides notice to physicians that facilitating patients death could potentially constitute being inconsistent with the public interest within the meaning of 21 us c 824a4 although this determination is not mandatory and in any event cannot be ma until there is an enforcement proceeding against physician to revoke or suspend his or her dea registration the gonzales dissenting opinion agreed with this characterization gonzales 126 s ct at 938 scalia j dissenting it would be improper indeed impossible for the attorney general to undertake the fivefactor analysis outsi the context of an actual enforcement proceeding but of course the attorney ge neral may issue regulations to clarify his interpretation of the five factors and to signal

at 909existing registration in conformity with the public interest47 the court asserted that the directive failed to undertake the fi vefactor analysis re quired by the statute in determining consistency with the public interest48 more importantly the directive reaches beyond the subject of registra tion to interpret substantive federal requirements for what constitutes valid pr escription and in effect declares that using controlled substances for physicianassisted suicide is crime an authority that goes well beyond the attorney generals stat utory power to register or deregister49 the court expressed concern about this unrestrained and extraordinary authority claimed pursuant to the attorney generals deregistration power since it criminalizes the actions of physicians who engage in conduct that the attorney general deems is illegitimate50 furthermore the court was unwilling to find that the csa implicitly delegates to the attorney general the broad authority to interpret the legitimate medical purpose provision congress does not alter the funda mental details of regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions it does not one might say hide elephants in mouseholes51 finally the court noted that the authority claimed by the attorney general to promulgate the directive is in tension w ith the overall structure and design of the csa which allocates decisionmaking power s between the attorney general and the secretary of health and human services medical judgments are to be made by the secretary who presumably possesses medi cal expertise and competence beyond that of the attorney general and the attorney general is required to defer to those decisions52 while the government had argued that the ashcroft directive reflects legal not medical decision the court di sagreed noting that the directive itself relies upon medical judgments and the views of the medical community53httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33120crs10 54 id at 922 55 skidmore 323 us

congress power under the commerce clause to regulate medical marijuana by todd b tatelman 59 oakland cannabis 532 us at 491 skidmore deference applies the remaining question facing the court was whether the ashcroft directive was correct interpretation of the csa and its regulations in case the attorney general c hooses to rely on the interpretation only for guidance in deciding when to prosecute or deregister physicians54 because the ashcroft directive was not promulgated pur suant to the authority the csa vests in the attorney general the court explained that the interpretive rule only receives skidmore deference the weight of an agency interpretation will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration the validity of its reasoning its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements and all those factors which give it power to persuade if lacking power to control55 the court first noted that its willingne ss to accord judicial respect for the directive is tempered by the fact that the attorney general lacks the medical expertise to decide what physician practices constitute legitimate medical purpose and that there had been an pparent absence of any consultation with anyone outside the department of justi ce who might aid in reasoned judgment concerning this issue56 then the court applying the skidmore analysis ruled that it did not find the directive persuasive nd thus the court was not required to uphold its validity in assessing the validity of the ashc roft directives reasoning the court considered whether the csa can be read as prohibiting physicianassisted suicide two recent supreme court cases are arguably relevant to this analysis united states v oakland cannabis buyers cooperative57 and gonzales v raich 58 at issue in oakland cannabis was california law that had created medical necessity exception to its marijuana prohibitions the supreme court held that medical necessity defense for the cultivation and di stribution of marijuana is at odds with the csa since marijuana is schedule i controlled substance that has been congressionally determined to have accepted medical use in the united states59 the supreme court ruled in raich that congress has the power under the commerce clause to prohibit the cultivation or possession of marijuana for medical purposes despite california law that permitted it

distinguish the use of controlled substances for facilitating physicianassisted suicide from the medical marijuana issue considered in oakland cannabis and raich this omission is perhaps explained in part by the fact that the gonzales court was presented with question of statutory interpre tation and not the extent of constitutionally permissible federal power60 however the court noted that congress has made an express determination that marijuana has accepted medical use by categorizing it as schedule i controlled substance61 in contrast physicians acting pursuant to the oregon death with dignity act prescrib schedule ii controlled substances to facilitate their patient s deaths drugs classified in this schedule have accepted medical uses such as alleviating pa in if prescribed in lower dosages examining the csas text and design the court concluded that the csa was intended to regulate medical practice insofar as it bars doctors from using their prescriptionwriting powers as means to engage in illicit drug dealing and trafficking as conventionally understood62 with nod towards the principle of federalism the court observed that the csa still permits the states to have considerable role in regula ting the practice of medicine under their traditional police powers this intent to preserve rather than displace the states regulation of the health and safety of their citizens is ev idenced by the inclusion of nonpreemption provision in the csa provision of this subchapter shall be construed as indicating an intent on the part of the congress to occupy the field in which that provision operates including criminal penalties to the exclusion of any state law on the same subject matter which would otherwise be w ithin the authority of the state unless there is positive conflict between that provision of this subchapter and that state law so that the two cannot consistently stand together63 in the opinion of the court the oregon death with dignity act is an example of state law concerning medical practice that congress has not enacted explicit language to regulate64 the court rejected the governments assertion that the csa impliedly criminalizes physicianassisted suicide since the csa is largely silent on the practice of medicine and include s the nonpreemption provision that permits continued state regulation of the medical profession65

directive the csa prohibits the dispensing of any schedule ii drug without the written prescription of practitioner66 as noted earlier in this report regulation promulgated by the attorney general in 1971 interp reted the term prescription to mean one issued for legitimate medical purpose67 thus according to the government schedule ii drug may only be prescribed to patient for legitimate medical purpose68 in the governments judgment the term medical c onnotes healing curing treatment or prevention of disease and therefore necessa rily excludes the intentional hastening of patients death69 the government also offered the opinion and positions of prominent professional medical organizations and the 49 other states that have not legalized physicianassisted suicide as evidence that such medical practice is not legitimate one70 although the court conceded the reasona bleness of this characterization of physicianassisted suicide the majority opinion rejected the governments reliance on the prescription requirement as an indepe ndent basis for such an expansive federal authority to regulate medicine practices the primary problem with the governments argument however is its assumption that the csa impliedly authoriz an executive officer to bar use simply because it may be inconsistent with one reasonable understanding of medical practice viewed alone the prescription requirement may support such an understanding but statutes s hould not be read as series of unrelated and isolated provisions71 the court noted that the legislative histor and statutory scheme of the csa suggests more limited understanding of the prescription provision72 first the csas legislative history reveals that congress intended to limit the csa to problems associated with drug abuse and addiction73 the csa statutory text requires that the attorney generals decisions to classify substance in schedules ii through v must be based in part on substances psychol ogical or physical dependence and abuse

rather should be considered general medical practice to be regulated by the states76 attempting to characterize physicianassisted suicide as drug abuse the court asserted is discordant with the phrases consistent use throughout th statute not to mention its ordinary meaning77 the court refused to believe that congress had the farreaching intent for the prescription requirement to delegate authority to single executive officer the power to effect radical shift of authority from the states to the federal government to define general standards of medical practice in every locality78 dissenting opinion justice scalia joined by chief justice roberts and justice thomas would have reversed th ninth circuits opinion and upheld the validity of the ashcroft directive on three independently sufficient grounds79 the attorney generals directive was entitled to deference under the auer standard because it is valid interpretation of the legitimate medical purpose phrase that is used in the attorney generals 1971 regulation 21 cfr 130604 even if the directive is entitled to judicial deference the validityof the interpretation is correct because it is by far the most natural interpretation of the regulation even if the attorney generals interpretation of the regulation isincorrect his interpretation of th csas statutory phrases public interest and public health and safety are entitled to chevron deference first justice scalia believed that this case should have been resolved with straightforward application of the auer standard of judicial deference 80 h questioned the majoritys actions in creating parroting exception to the auer rule without which auer would have determined the j udicial treatment of the case requiring the court to respect the attorn ey generals directive unless plainly erroneous or inconsiste nt with the regulation81 despite objecting to the newly announced parroting rule justice scalia asse rted that the rule would not even apply in this case he observed that the regulation at issue 21 cfr 130604 does not merely paraphrase the statutory language as the majority claimed the regulation clarifies the undefined term p rescription as it appears in the statutory language ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33120crs14 82 id at 928 83 id at 929 84 id at 931 85 21 usc 8025 provides that as used in this title the term control means to add drug or other substance or immediate precursor to schedule under part b of this subchapter whether by transfer from another schedul or otherwise emphasis added as justice scalia correctly observed section 821 is not included in part b of the csa subchapter but rather is located in part c thus justice scalia argued the majority opinion should not have made the definition of contro l applicable to the attorney generals powers under section 821 gonzales 126 s ct at 929 scalia j dissenting 86 id citations omitted21 usc 829a by explicitly stating th at any prescription to be valid under the csa may only be issued for legitimate medical purpose this regulation significantly clarifies the meaning of an otherwise ambiguous statutory provision adds content to the statutory text nd thus is not parroting regulation82 justice scalia thus concluded that since the regulation is not mere duplication of the statutory text and since the directive is the attorney generals interpretation of the regulation then the auer deference standard is appli cable using this standard justice scalia stated that the directive is controlling on the court because he did not find the interpretation to be plainl erroneous or inc onsistent with the regulation83 indeed he opined that the directiv is perfectly valid construction of legitimate medical purpose that is with in the attorney generals authority under the csa to make84 even if he were to accept the applica tion of the antiparroting canon to this case justice scalia argued that the directive would still be entitled to deference under chevron he rejected as manifestly erroneous the courts use of the csas definition of control as it ppears in one part of the statute 21 usc 8025 to restrict the attorney generals powers to control the manufacture distribution and dispensing of controlled substances under 21 usc 82185 he stated that we do not force termofart definitions in to contexts where they plainly do not fit and produce nonsense what is obviously intended in 821 is the ordinary meaning of control namely to exer cise restraining or directing influence over to dominate regulate hence to hold from action to curb86 justice scalia reasoned that if the court had not incorrectly adopted the artificially narrow definition of control the directive would likely have been deemed to be within the attorney generals interpretive authority and thus worthy of receiving chevron deference unlike the majority of the court justice scalia was not concerned that the directive effectively created criminal sanction for physician assisted suicide this was an inevitable consequence of the csas prescription requirement since the directive declared that assisting suicide is not legitimate medical purpose for controlled

repeatedly observed that congress often passes statutes th at sweep more broadly than the main problem they were designed to address statutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils and it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our gislators by which we are governed id quoting oncale v sundowner offshore servs

justice scalia opined that even in the absence of any judicial deference to it the directive is the most reasonable interpretation of the regulation and of the statute and is valid upon novo review88 his conclusion relied on the overwhelming weight of authority that has excluded intentionally assisting suicide from the definition of legitimate medical purpose89 in addition virtually every medical authority from hippocrates to the current american dical association ama confirms that assisting suicide has seldom or never been viewed as form of prevention cure or alle viation of disease whic h is the typical dictionary definition of medicine 90 furthermore justice scalia declared in dicta that if the term legitimate medical purpose has any meaning it surely excludes the prescription of drugs to produce death91 he also criticized the majoritys effo rts to limit the scope of the csa to only addiction and recreational abuse although conceding that drug abuse is principal concern of the statute he argued that such purpose is not its exclusive concern92 the majority opinion correctly noted that the csa requires that the attorney general must consider drugs addictive properties in making scheduling determinations93 but justice scalia asserted that the court had failed to discuss another factor that the attorney general must evaluate what if any risk there is to the public health94 in addition the attorney gene ral may refuse to register physician to prescribe controlled subs tances if such registration would be inconsistent with the public interest95 in determining the public interest the attorney general must consider such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety96 in his view the majority opinion erred when it apparently disregarded these

the courts exclusive focus on the explic it delegation provisions is at best fossil of our pre chevron era at least since chevron we have not conditioned our deferral to agency interpretations upon the existence of explicit delegation provisions 103 21 usc 821determining that the attorney general s authority under the csas prescription requirement applies only in the c ontext of preventing drug abuse97 justice scalia points out that the cs as nonpreemption clause does not support the courts declaration that the csa contemplates role for the states in regulating controlled substances rather the clause merely disclaims fi eld preemption and affirmatively prescribes federal preemption whenever state law creates conflict98 furthermore the ashcroft directive does not preempt the oregon state law because the oregon law does not require assisted suicide rather the directive interprets the csa to prohibit conduct that is permitted under oregon law99 finally justice scalia explained that even if the attorney generals interpretation of legitimate medical purpose is incorrect chevron deference should still be applied to the directive under yet another independent basis the attorney generals authority to interpret the term public health and safety as it is used in the csas grant of power to him to deregister physicians for conduct that is inconsistent with the public interest100 he criticized the courts mead analysis that had resulted in applying skidmore deference to the directive rather than chevron justice scalia suggested that congress by leaving the terms public interest and public health and safety ambiguous in the csa implic itly empowered the attorney general to interpret those factors101 although such delegation of authority to interpret these terms may not be explicit in the statute in his judgment chevron would be warranted because even an implicit dele gation of authority could still entitle an agency interpretation to substantial deference102 and in any event the csa explicitly delegates to the attorney general the power to promulgate rules and regulations regarding the registration and control of the manufacture distribution and dispensing of controlled substances103 that the design of the csa divides decisionmaking authority between the attorney general and the secretary of hea lth and human services failed to convince justice scalia of the majoritys claim that the attorney general has role in making determinations concerning the legitimacy of medical practices charged with the power to register and deregister physician s for prescribing and dispensing controlled substances and the power to prosecute those who violate the csa the attorney general should have discre tion over the substantive standards by which such

not fundamental lib erty interest protected under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment 107 the concerns of the court are evidenced by the words chosen to describe the powers claimed by the attorney general in promulga ting the directive extraordinary authority and unrestrained power gonzales 126 s ct at 918decision is made he reasoned such determination ultimately rests not on science or medicine but on naked value judgment104 he explained far from establishing general principle of secretary supremacy with regard to all scientific and medical determinations the fact that congress granted the secretary specifically defined authority in the areas of scheduling and addiction treatment without otherwis mentioning him in the registration provisions suggests to the contrary that congre ss envisioned role for the secretary in that area where as we have said interpretive authority was both implicitly and explicitly conferred upon the attorney general105 concluding observations however accurate as matter of statutory interpretation and administrative law that he felt his dissenting opinion may have been justice scalia evidently failed to convince the six justices voting in th majority justice kennedys opinion represents the judgment of the court in gonzales v oregon holding that the attorney general exceeded his legal authority when he proclaimed that it is not legitimate medical purpose under the contro lled substances act for physicians to prescribe controlled substances to facilitate an individuals death as noted earlier the courts opinion did not rule on the constitutionality of the oregon law that authorizes physicianassisted suicide practices106 the court also did not address the question of whether congress had the power to override such state law the narrow legal inquiry answered by the court was the authority of the attorney general under the controlled substances act to make decision that interferes with medical practice sanctioned by state law perhap s influenced in part by principles of federalism and the recognition that states have traditionally enjo yed the independent sovereign power to regulate the practice of medicine the court rejected an executive action that in its view was beyond the au thority that congress had granted to the attorney general107 however justice scalia in dissent observed the following the courts decision today is perhaps driven by feeling that the subject of assisted suicide is none of the federal governments business it is easy to sympathize with that position in washington v glucksberg the court had stated that throughout the nation americans are engaged in an earne st and profound debate about the morality legality and practicality of physicianassisted suicide our

presently undertaking extensive and serious evalua tion of physicianassisted suicide and other related issues in such circumstan ces the challenging task of crafting appropriate procedures for safeguarding liberty interests is entrusted to the laboratory of the states in the first instance109 the gonzales court also permits the debate over physicianassisted suicide to continue it is uncertain what role the federal government may play in the democratic process that resolves this contentious issue but the gonzales court made it clear that the controlled substances act as it is currently written cannot be used as basis for the attorney general to act unilaterally to prohibit this medical practice authorized by the state of oregon
