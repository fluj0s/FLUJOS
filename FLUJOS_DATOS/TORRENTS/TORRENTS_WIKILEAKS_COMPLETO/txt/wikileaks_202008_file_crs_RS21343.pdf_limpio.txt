united states bankruptcy code background in 1978 congress enacted the airline deregu lation act with the goal of returning the airline industry to competitive capitalism with many competing airlines where none could control the market and where all woul d have to actively participate in price competition1 prior to the enactment of the deregulation act airlines were heavily regulated by the federal gove rnment the government regu lated everything from ticket prices to routes to the number of airlines allowed to operate the regulatory scheme tended to favor the status quo and discourag competition and for the airlines lucky enough to be in existence regulation provided fairly co mfortable operating environment2 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21343crs2 3 id 4 id at 1023 5 for detailed

operate and an attempt is made to cure defaults generally the goals of successful reorganization are to provide continued employment to the debtors work force treat creditors in an evenhanded manner and attempt to ensu re fair return to stoc kholders on their investment6 there appears to be on ongoing debate within the industry as to whether allowing an airline to continue operations under chapte r 11 provides the airline with an unfair advantage over financially stronger competitors7 as noted above one of the express purposes of chapter 11 is to rehabilitate insolvent debtors those airlines not in bankruptcy argue that allowing airlines in chapter 11 to defer debt payments cut labor costs and lower operating costs over long period of time creates an unfair advantage8 however airlines operating in chapter 11 argue that there are major disadvantagesassociated with bankruptcy including the n eed to make cash payments on certain debts and consumer resistance to flying w ith company operating in bankruptcy 9 provisions specific to airline reorganization the bankruptcy code includes several provisions specific to bankruptcies by airlines generally the provisions provide
