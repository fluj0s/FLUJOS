congressional oﬃces since it was ﬁrst approved for use as food additive in 1981 aspartame has been linked by its critics to number of health problems however federal oﬃcials report that after more than decade of monitoring there is clinical evidence that this aspartame sweetener poses hazard to the average consumer individuals with phenylketonuria pku genetic metabolic disorder should avoid aspartame because it contains phenylalanine which they can not metabolize the food and drug administration fda has approved aspartame for use in all food and beverages following one of the most rigorous testing programs and regulatory reviews in food additive history food labels are required to identify the presence of aspartame both on the ingredient label and the warning statement for individuals with pku bills were introduced in the 98th and 99th congresses to address maximum concentrations labeling and consumer education issues but ﬁnal action was taken in 1987 the senate

and health problems since aspartame was first approved for use as food additive there have bee n concerns raised about the health problems associated with this artificial sweetener it s critics linked aspartame use w ith alzheimers disease various birth defects brain tumors diabetes gulf war syndrome lupus multiple sclerosis and seizures however thes assertions have not been borne out by clinical studies following accepted scientifi c methods to date the only condition for which aspartame use has been recognized as potential health problem is phenylketonuria pku pku occurs in individuals with genetic metabolic disorder in which the amino acid phenylalanine is not metabolized aspartame is composed of two amino acids aspartic acid and phenylalanine i fhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20218crs2 department of health and human services hhs food and drug administration fd a1 statement on aspartame fda talk paper t9675 november 18 1996 phenylalanine builds up in the b ody it can cause brain damage prenatal diagnosis is now possible in the majority of pku families and their newborns are tested within 48 hours of birth individuals with this condition generally follow fairly strict dietary regimen t minimize their intake of this amino acid while otherwise maintaining balanced diet phenylketonurics generally are advised by their health professionals on how to avoid food sources of phenylalanine including aspartame recent information broadcast on the internet has suggested that aspartame i s converted to formaldehyde then to formic acid which in turn causes metabolic acidosis as it is metabolized aspartame is split into its respectiv parts aspartic acid phenylalanine and methanol the internet report suggests that methanol to xicity results however there is evide nce in the scientific literature to support this contention in the extensiv literature on studies of aspartame metabolism methanol blood levels were unchanged by normal consumption of this additive other commonly consumed foods for example tomato juice result in significantly higher levels of methanol in the body without an adverse effects aspartame regulation the food and drug administration fda first approved as partame for use as food additive in 1981 since 1996 it has been approved for use in all foods and beverages1 the sweetener has been approved by more than 90 countries as sweetener it is 200 times sweeter than sugar enhances fruit flavors saves calories and does not contribute to tooth decay prior to its approval aspartame underwent one of the most extensive testin g programs and regulatory reviews in food additive history tests were conducted i n animals and humans including normal adults and children lactating women an d individuals with d iabetes obesity and special genetic problems aspartame was tested in amounts significant ly higher than individuals could normally consume in their diets this sweetener continues to be studied by scientists as is done for many other ingredients in the food supply fda also continues to monitor and evaluate all new research on thi s compound and other food ingredients there is scientific evidence that aspartame is linked to adverse reactions i n humans with the exception of pku as n oted above since 1981 fda has investigated all reported complaints and has reported gradual decrease in reports of adverse reactions to aspartame received since the 1985 peak ind ividuals who have concerns about possible adverse reactions from the consumption of aspartame are advised to contact thei r physician by regulation if aspartame is present in food product it must be listed on th ingredient label of the product in which it is used the following warning statement phenylketonurics conta ins phenylalanine is also required to appear on the product to advise consumers who have this genet ic defect this warning statement recognizes the potential health pr oblem to phenylketonurics from the use of aspartame early in its usehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20218crs3 the company used the trademark symbol for aspartame on the front panel of produc t packages containing the sweetener this trademark was not required by any regulatio n and seems to have been largely phased out it is relatively easy for consumers to avoid aspartame first if product is t marked as diet or sugarfree it probably does not contain any artificial sweetener regardless of whether product is marked as diet or sugarfree the ingredient listing can be checked to det ermine whether aspartame is present because all food products are required to provide complete list of all ingredients there are other approved artificial sweeteners that may be used alone or in combination with asparta to sweeten product the product can also be checked for the presence of the company trademark for aspartame on the label or the warning statement for phenylketonurics if consumers wish to avoid this sweetener congressional attention in the 98 congress hr 4112 was introduced by congressman gejdenson t oth require the secretary of the department of health and human services hhs to establish maximum concentration level for aspartame as food additive it was referred to the house committee on energy and commerces subcommittee on health and th environment but further action was taken in the 99 congress senator metzenbaum introduced s 1557 which would haveth provided for public inform ation concerning the use of products containing aspartame and the conduct of studies to determine the health effects of using this sweetener in foo d products entitled the aspartame safety act of 1985 this measure was referred to th committee on labor and human resources but further action was taken earlier in the session senator metzenbaum also sponso red an amendment that would have required soft drink containing aspartame to be labeled with statement of the total number f milligrams of the sweetener contained in the drink the amendment was defeated in the senate in recorded vote since then other bills have been introduced on aspartame the most r ecent hearing on aspartame identified was held on november 3 1987 by the senate committee on labor and human resources chaired by senator metzenbaum the hearing entitled nutrasweet health and s afety concerns included testimony from consumers who believed that they had experienced severe reactions to aspartame and physician who reported having observed reactions in his patients in addition several scientists on both sides of the controvers and the fda commissioner consumer attorney concerned about food safety in general and the president of nutraswee t aspartame manufacturer also testified additional attention to this food additive has been identified since the 99th congress the outcome of the 1987 hearing seemed to be that the ongoing clinical studies and postmarketing surveillance reported at that time were sufficient to address th concerns that had been raised with the understanding that fda would continue to monitor whether there was evidence of any pattern of adverse effects from the use of aspartame
