terms of nuclear arms is not straight line but is long and complex mcdonald said that for the last forty years the nuclear states have downplayed the obligation to spread civil nuclear power and to

own prime minister brown wants to refresh and refurbish the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt she said dg day said he was delighted that the us has resumed leadership on nonproliferation arms control and disarmament maintaining p3 and p5 unity 3 snf leslie stressed that the uk position is really very similar to your administration on nearly everything the uks goal is for the p5 to work well together but we should not scare the horses which means not scaring off the french and keeping the chinese and russians on board she acknowledged that it was hard to get everyone together for the

described the nuclear posture review npr which would replace the 2002 npr and would address questions such as extended deterrence and security assurances her uk interlocutors expressed considerable interest in both reviews and she made clear the us would consult bilaterally and with nato as soon as the reviews progress to that point political consensus on strategic defense review 8 snf day acknowledged that the next year will be pretty disruptive in the uk as the two major parties prepare for the next general election he stressed that both the labour and conservative parties are committed to strategic defense review after the election he predicted that neither political conflict between the two major parties nor the defense review would affect arms control policy although he advised that these factors may distract the attention of political leaders he predicted that defense will be bigger issue than it usually is during the british electoral period he cited intense debate over britains role in afghanistan and the defense budget crisis as two prominent issues 9 snf day opined that mobilizing nato allies after general mcchrystal released the results of his review would be very difficult our message to the us is bear with us we will continue to work closely with you day said he pledged to work closely with the us on the quadrennial defense review qdr and national posture review npr as well as on the uks strategic defense review in regard to the uk review day observed that he had worked on the last review in 199798 and he bemoaned the lack of institutional memory within hmg regarding the review process 10 snf day also promised that the uk had put measures in place to protect your interests during the uk inquiry into the causes of the iraq war he noted that iraq seems longer to be major issue in the us but he said it would become big issue feeding frenzy in the uk when the inquiry takes off iran 11 snf tauscher made clear that iran needed to respond to the p5 1 offer prior to the unga at which point there would be stocktaking absent progress attention would turn to substantially stronger sanctions fs milband opined that us administration is rightly trying to overcome deficit of prejudice and mistrust in relatively short time by diplomatic outreach to iran he continued that the iranian elections were bad outcome an outcome that had given extremists the upper hand and resulted in culling of reformists miliband said that in his opinion irans extremist government would not make concessions in short time nonetheless the us administrations support for diplomatic solution is very wise he praised the impact of financial sanctions spearheaded by treasury us levey leslie asserted that the iranian administration is in state of flux and not focused so probably unable to respond to overtures london 00002198 003 of 005 12 snf mcdonald stressed that the pm supports the presidents outreach efforts to iran but this outreach should not be open ended the uk view is that if iran is not responsive we have to get serious uk experts have concluded that stronger sanctions should be in place by the end of the year if iran is not significantly responsive by the end of september mcdonald observed that it would take some time to negotiate unscr in the meantime the uk is considering national steps it could take as well as possible steps the eu could take hmg shares nsa jones view that proliferation problems posed by iran and north korea should be addressed together not as separate unrelated issues mcdonald said comprehensive test ban treaty ctbt 13 snf uk interlocutors sought an update from us tauscher on the progress toward us senate ratification of the comprehensive test ban treaty ctbt and on the presidents leadership on ctbt ratification tauscher said the ratification of the ctbt had high priority start had certain urgency given the december 5 expiration we were working in parallel to prepare for ratification of ctbt including new national academy study new national intelligence estimate nie and funded program to modernize our nuclear infrastructure uk interlocutors made clear they would welcome us ctbt ratification which would be tangible sign to the world of us commitment to nuclear nonproliferation mcdonald noted that since the 1993 executive order the us has acted as if the ctbt had been ratified which he characterized as an argument that could persuade reluctant senators uk interlocutors also sought an update from tauscher on the progress of start negotiations and the status of the npr international atomic energy agency iaea 14 snf we need to put some steel in director generalelect amano miliband opined amano has key role and he must be leader and consensusbuilder who reports faithfully what experts tell him mcdonald observed that the iaea seems more prepared than it has in the past to address iranian conduct tauscher agreed we need to make amano success russiastrategic arms reduction treaty start 15 snf leslie commended usrussian progress on the strategic arms reduction treaty start talks she said that the uk was looking for the us to deal with russia since our relations with russia are very poor leslie said that despite ukrussia bilateral problems hmg would be able to work with russia through the npt process and she expressed hope that russia could do the right thing to address global proliferation she noted the russian proposal for conference that could help address egyptian concerns day opined that after start negotiations are successfully concluded russia might be inclined to seek another deal in regard to conventional forces in europe cfe since such discussions would keep them at the top table in terms of negotiations china pakistan 16 snf leslie flagged the inconvenient truth that china is building its nuclear arsenal she evoked an arms race in the pacific in light of indias nuclear program nonetheless leslie said she was optimistic regarding chinas commitment to multilateral cooperation and she suggested that the us and the uk should push china for progress until they say stop it she noted that the chinese had pretty much said year ago that if the us ratifies the ctbt china would follow suit further china has dumped pakistan in the conference on disarmament cd which is good sign tauscher urged p5 action to get pakistan to stop blocking progress in the cd on the fissile material cutoff treaty fmct 17 snf the uk has deep concerns about the safety and london 00002198 004 of 005 security of pakistans nuclear weapons and china could play big role in stabilizing pakistan leslie said pakistan has accepted nuclear safety help but under the iaea flag albeit british technicians the pakistanis worry that the us will drop in and take their nukes leslie said 18 snf day expressed support for the development of cold warlike relationship between india and pakistan that would introduce degree of certainty between the two countries in their dealings he noted that recent intelligence indicates that pakistan is not going in good direction pakistan sees the debate about afghanistan in the us and the uk as demonstrating that the allies lack the will to maintain their commitment there the pakistanis also believe that their recent successes against extremists in the swat valley validate their belief that they can deal with their own internal problems without changing their approach toward india day asked if the us would be obliged to cut relations with pakistan if the military took over again he said that the last time the military assumed power the uk had maintained militarytomilitary ties day also asked for the us perspective on nawaz sharif whom he described as potentially less venal than other pakistani leaders nonproliferation and public diplomacy 19 snf leslie opined that p5 states are losing the public diplomacy arguments about nonproliferation and civil nuclear power with the p3 and the p5 being portrayed as the bad guy day expressed similar sentiment noting that there is real recognition of what the uk has done in terms of nonproliferation and disarmament either in our own media or worldwide us tauscher agreed that we all need to do much better job of getting our narrative out and noted that the state department has brought in new people to help to do that 20 snf leslie acknowledged that there had been divisions within hmg about the strategy for addressing proliferation in leslies view the risk of proliferation is bigger threat than terrorism but it ranks lower than terrorism on the publics list of perceived threats she flagged efforts both by states and by terrorist groups to obtain nuclear weapons she cited former fs becketts speech at the carnegie international nonproliferation conference in june 2007 as setting out the uks commitment to nuclear free world in hmgs view president obamas prague speech expressed the same commitment disarmament alone without successfully addressing proliferation would not make the world safer so we need to manage disarmament leslie stated she rejected the french assertion that that the us and the uk are starting public debate that is not there by publicly addressing issues of nuclear disarmament civil nuclear cooperation 21 snf uk interlocutors noted hmgs commitment to civil nuclear power and that the nuclear weapons states have done poor job in terms of article iv of the npt fs miliband commented that the nuclear weapons states have credibility problem with the nonnuclear weapons states leslie said that the uk had demonstrated its commitment to moving forward civil nuclear issues citing the ukhosted and organized nuclear fuel cycle conference in march 2009 as an example tauscher agreed that we should support nuclear power and nuclear cooperation in manner that does not lead to the spread of dangerous technologies citing our agreement with the uae as an example arms trade treaty att 22 snf fs miliband asked about the status of the arms trade treaty att insisting we are not trying to keep people from bearing arms in the usa he asked if it was conceivable for the us to ratify the treaty tauscher stated she was not optimistic given the second amendment issues being raised by opponents but said the administration was planning to review the att and we are prepared to listen to the uk make its case on this issue fs miliband said that the uk launched its campaign in favor of the att in september 2008 with the support of some us companies london 00002198 005 of 005 23 snf day observed that there is sometimes sense that the fco pushes the att while the mod opposes it he stressed that the mod and the uk defense industry support strongly the att he said that he had personally seen the impact of manpads in sierra leone and stated that ground to air missile proliferation is major problem that the att could address given our operational deployments in afghanistan were focused on the att he said nato strategic concept 24 snf day raised the nato strategic concept review predicting major debate in the alliance about deterrence and its strategic dimensions major objective should be to minimize fallout on nuclear issues he noted that the secretary general syg would prepare the first draft the north atlantic council nac will need to review the final product since the first stage of work is done among small group of nations and many others will be suspicious the direction of natos debate will depend on the outcome of the german elections the social democratic party spd could force debate while the christian democratic union cdu would not day said day volunteered that he had been soured by the last two strategic concepts tauscher said that the usg would be addressing some of the issues in developing the strategic concept as part of our nuclear posture review 25 snf day said syg rasmussen must not take his foot off the accelerator of reform the syg must be strong leader needs some early wins and must have the kind of access in washington that former nato syg robertson had day said defense trade treaty 26 snf uk interlocutors sought an update from us tauscher on the status in the senate of the usuk defense trade treaty tauscher explained that we are working with the senate to resolve questions concerning implementation day emphasized that the treaty matters operationally this is the sort of stuff that saves lives mcdonald stressed that the treaty was not just an agreement between two leaders former president bush and former prime minister blair but an agreement between our two systems mcdonald expressed appreciation for tauschers affirmation that implementing legislation is not necessary for the treaty to go into force tauscher replied that the purpose of the treaty was to cut red tape and we dont want to put it back in the implementation leslie stressed that the uk did not want to complicate the administrations efforts to get the treaty fully ratified the uk interlocutors expressed appreciation for tauschers commitment to the treatys ratification and her explanation of the administrations steps to achieve that goal
