gives private sector workers the right to join or form labor union and to bargain collectively over wages hours and other working conditions an issue before congress is whether to change the procedures under which union is certified as the bargaining representative of union chosen by majority of workers under current law the national labor relations board nlrb conducts secret ballot election when petition is filed requesting one petition can be filed by union worker or employer workers or union may request an election if at least 30 of workers have signed petition or authorization cards ie cards authorizing union to represent them the nlra does not require secret ballot elections an employer may voluntar ily recognize union if majority of workers have signed authorization cards legislation was introduced in the 110th congress that if enacted would have changed current union certification procedures the employee free choice act of 2007 hr 800 and s 1041 would require the nlrb to certify union if ma jority of employees sign authorization cards the secret ballot protection act hr 866 w ould require secret ballot elections for union certification proponents of both measures sometimes use similar language to support their positions employers argue that under card check certifica tion workers may be pressured or coerced into signing authorization cards and may only hear the unions point of view unions argue that during an election campaign employers may pressure or coerce workers into voting against union supporters of secret ballot elections argue that casting secret ballot is private and confidential unions argue that during an election campaign employers have greater access to workers unions argue that card check certification is less costly than secret ballot election employers maintain that unionization may be mo re costly to workers because union members must pay dues and higher union wages may result in fewer union jobs requiring card check certification may increase the level of unionization while requiring secret ballot elections may decrease it research suggests that where card check recognition is required unions undertake more union drives and the union success rate is higher the union success rate is also greater where card check recognition is combined with neutrality agreement ie an agreement where the employer agrees to rema in neutral during union organizing campaign to the extent that requiring secret ballot elections or requiring certification when majority of employees sign authorization cards would affect the level of unionization the economic effects may depend on how well labor markets fit the model of perfect competition requiring card check certification may improve worker benefits and reduce earnings inequalityif more workers are unionized requiring secret ballot elections may increase inequality in compensationif fewer workers are unionized this report will be updated as issues warrant httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32930g14g138g139g152g155g561g23g151g146g152g151g561g5g142g155g157g146g143g146g140g138g157g146g152g151g561g18g155g152

for reaching first contract agreement within 10 days or longer period if agreed to by both the union and employer after receiving request to begin bargaining the employer and union must meet to begin

party may request mediation by the federal mediation and conciliation service fmcs if an agreement cannot be reached within 30 days through mediation or longer period if agreed to by both parties the

labormanagement relations in the private sector9 the act begins by stating that the purpose of the law is to improve the bargaining power of workers the inequality of bargaining power between employees and employers substantially burdens and affects the flow of commerce and tends to aggravate recurrent business depressions by depressing wage rates and the purchasing power of wage earners and by preventing the stabilization of competitive wage rates and working conditions within and between industries it is hereby declared to be the policy of the united states to eliminate the causes of certain substantial obstructions to the free flow of commerce and to mitigate and eliminate these obstructions when they have occurred by encouraging the practice and procedure of collective bargaining 10 the nlra gives workers the right to join or form labor union and to bargain collectively over wages hours and other conditions of employment through representative of their choosing under the act workers also have the right not to join union the act requires an employer to bargain in good faith with union chosen by majority of employees to protect the rights of employers and workers the act defines certain activities as unfair labor practices11 the nlra does not apply to railroads or airlines federal state or local governments agricultural workers family domestic workers supervisors independent contractors and others the definition of employee in the nlra does not exclude unauthorized workers thus unauthorized workers can engage in union activities12 9more specifically the nlra applies to employers engaged in interstate commerce 29 usc 1526 10 29 usc 151 many economists argue that there is not an inequality of bargaining power between employers and employees for example see morgan reynolds power and privilege labor unions in america new york universe books 1984 pp 5962 and morgan reynolds the myth of labors inequality of bargaining power journal of labor research vol 12 spring 1991 pp 168183 the argument that workers and employers have equal bargaining power is generally based on the premise that labor markets fit the economic model of perfect competition see the section later in this report on whether there is an economic rationale for protecting the rights of workers to organize and bargain collectively 11 national labor relations

relations act of 1947 pl 80101 commonly called the tafthartley act amended the nlra to add language that employees have the right to refrain from joining union unless collective bargaining agreement

the union to pay representation fee to the union ie an agency shop under section 14b of the tafthartley act states may enact righttowork laws which do not allow contracts to include union security

contract agreement has been reached after one year if an employer and certified union have not reached contract agreement the employer may w ithdraw recognition of the union if both parties have engaged in good faith bargaining and the employer doubts on the basis of objective information eg petition signed by majority of employees and given to the employer that majority of employees longer support the uni on under voluntary recognition if contract agreement has been reached after reasonable period of time an employer may withdraw recognition if the employer has reasonable doubt on the

secret ballot election the tafthartley act gave employers the right to request an election 55 soon thereafter us appeals court ruled that if majority of employees signed authorizati on cards an employer could only insist on an election if he had good faith doubt that the union represented majority of employees56 this approach was known as the joy silk doctrine57 an employer had good faith doubt if he believed that signatures on the authorization ca rds were obtained through misrepresentation or coercion 58 the board could find lack of good faith do ubt and order an employer to bargain if the employer committed unfair labor practices that were evidence of bad faith or if the employer rejected demand by majority of workers to bargain but did not have reasons for good faith doubt by 1969 the board said that it had largely abandoned the joy silk doctrine thereafter if majority of employees signed authorization card s an employer could voluntarily recognize the union or could insist on an election either by reque sting the union to file an election petition or by filing petition himself 59 in 1974 ruling the us supreme court said that if an employer insists on an election the union must take the next step and file an election petition 60

in june 2004 the board voted 32 to review two cases where bargaining unit employees filed decertification petition within weeks after the employer recognized union under card check agreement in the first case the united auto workers uaw and metaldyne corporation entered into card check and neutrality agreement in september 2002 metaldyne recognized the uaw as the bargaining representative of production and maintenance workers at its st marys pennsylvania plant in december 2003 in the second case the uaw and dana corporation entered into card check and neutrality agreement in august 2003 the company recognized the union at its upper sandusky ohio plant in december 2003 in both the dana and metaldyne cases the uaw and the employers entered into card check and neutrality agreements before signatures on authorization cards were collected the signatures were validated by neutral third party in both cases employees filed decertification petitions after the uaw was recognized by the employer but before an agreement was reached on contract regional nlrb directors dismissed both d ecertification petitions saying that they were inconsistent with the boards recognition bar doctrine under this doctrine following an employers voluntary recognition of union empl oyees or another union cannot file petition for an election for reasonable period of time employees at both dana and metaldyne corporations petitioned the nlrb to review the dismissals the employees were represented by the national right to work legal defense foundation the nlrb granted the request saying that the issue was whether voluntary recognition should prevent employees from filing decertification petition within reasonable time in cases where an employer and union enter into card check agreement 61 in september 2007 the board issued decision in both cases the board said that following voluntary recognition employees have 45 days to f ile petition to decertify the union similarly rival union has 45 days to file an election petition the petitions must be signed by at least 30 of bargaining unit employees employees must so receive notice of the voluntary recognition and their right to petition for decertification or representation election if petition is not filed within 45 days of notice of the voluntary recognition an election petition cannot be filed during the recognition bar period ie for reasonable period of time62

agreed to review the case and returned it to the regional office for hearing in its decision the board said the issues in this case include 1 whether the employer clearly and unmistakably waived the right to board election 2 if so whether public policy reasons outweigh the employers private agreement not to have an election the board went on to say we do not resolve these issues at this stage we merely hold that they are worthy of review65 after the hearing ordered by the board regional director in march 2005 again dismissed shaws petition for an election66 in march 2006 the board again

contract in january 1999 shaws supermarkets entered into fiveyear contract with the ufcw after three years majority of employees signed petition requesting decertification election instead of going forward with decertification election shaws withdrew recognition of the union the action was appealed to the nlrb the general counsel of the nlrb argued that shaws should not be allowed to withdraw recognition of the union during the term of the fiveyear contract the general counsel said that during the term of contract neither the employer nor the union can file an election petition but after three years of contract of more than three years employees or another union but not the employer or existing union can file an elect ion petition requesting decertification or representation by another union by vote of 21 the board disagreed with the general counsel the majority members of the board concluded that shaws had acted properly when it withdrew recognition of the union the

in favor of requiring secret ballot elections and the most common arguments made in support of card check certification the section also reviews research on the effects of different union certification procedures on union success rates the most common arguments made by the proponents of requiring card check certification and the proponents of requiring secret ballot elections are summarized in table 4 71 proponents of each view sometimes use similar lang uage in support of their positions employers argue that under card check certification employees may be pressured or coerced into signing authorization cards and that employees may only hear the unions point of view on the other hand unions argue that during an election ca mpaign employers may pressure or coerce employees into voting against union proponents of secret ballot elections argue that unlike signing an authorization card casting secret ba llot is private and confidential unions argue that during an election campaign employers have greater access to employees eg captive audience meetings and access to employees on company property unions argue that card check certification is less costly than secret ballot election but employers maintain that unionization may be more costly to employees because union members must pay dues and higher union wages may result in fewer union jobs

employers where union represented other workers some of the agreements were with employers with whom the union had existing bargaining relationship eaton and kriesky union organizing under neutrality

because in part employers have less of an opportunity to campaign against unionization unions may initiate more organizing drives under card check recognition because card check campaign costs less than secret ballot election secret ballot election may take longer than card check campaign and employer opposition may be greater requiring union to expend more resources79 unions may have higher success rate when card check recognition is combined with neutrality agreement because there may be less employer opposition to unionization under neutrality agreement some research has concluded that management opposition is key factor affecting union success rates in nlrb conducted elections 80 finally two surveys provide added information about secret ballot elections and card check recognition81 according to march 2006 survey conducted for the center for union facts business group 75 of 1000 persons surveyed said that they believe that secret ballot election is the most fair and democratic way for employee s to decide whether or not to join union by contrast 12 of respondents said that card check recognition is the most fair and democratic way to form union82 according to 2005 survey conducted by american rights at work labor group 22 of 430 workers who had gone through union organizing campaign said that they experienced great deal of pressure from management by contrast 6 of workers said that they experienced great deal of union pressure among workers who signed authorization cards in the presence of union organizer 5 said that the presence of the organizer made them feel pressure to sign the cards 83 requiring card check certification if majority of employees sign authorization cards may increase the union success rate whether or not requiring card check certification would reverse the decline in private sector unionization in the united states is not certain shrinking employment in unionized firms and decertifications may offset any increase in union membership due to requiring card check recognition in addition requiring card check recognition may increase employer opposition during the collection of authorization cards continued

working conditions it also requires employers to bargain in good faith with union chosen by majority of employees the act says that the purpose of the law is to improve the bargaining power of workers this section considers whether there is an economic rationale for protecting the rights of workers to organize and bargain collectively

markets for number of reasons one of these reasons is to improve competition84 according to standard economic th eory competitive markets generally result in the most efficient allocation of resources where resources consist of individuals with different skills capital goods ie buildings and equipment and associated technology and natural resources in turn an efficient allocation of resources generally results in greater total output and consumer satisfaction in competitive labor markets workers are paid according to the value of their contribution to output under perfect competition wages include compensation for unfavorable working conditions the latter theory called the theory of compensating wage differentials recognizes that individuals differ in their preferences or tolerance for different working conditionssuch as health and safety conditions hours worked holidays and annual leave and job security85 if labor markets do not fit the model of perfect competition increasing the bargaining power of workers may raise wages improve benefits eg for health care and retirement and improve working conditions to levels that would exist under competitive conditions in labor markets where firm is the only employer called monopsony unionization could within limits increase both wages and employment86 84 the following conditions are the general characteristics of competitive labor market 1 there are many employers and many workers each employer is small relative to the size of the market 2 employers and workers are free to enter or leave labor market and can move freely from one market to another 3 employers do not organize to lower wages and workers do not organize to raise wages governments do not intervene in labor markets to regulate wages 4 employers and workers have equal access to labor market information 5 employers do not prefer one worker over another equally qualified worker workers do not prefer one employer over another employer who pays the same wage for the same kind of work 6 employers seek to maximize profits workers seek to maximize satisfaction lloyd g reynolds stanley h masters and colletta h moser labor economics and labor relations 11 th ed

competitive labor markets may result in misallocation of resourcesand reduce total economic output and consumer satisfaction in competitive labor markets higher union wages may reduce employment for union workers below the levels that would exist in the absence of unionization87 if unions lower employment in the unionized sector they may increa the supply of workers to employers in the nonunion sector lowering the relative wages of nonunion workers88 it is difficult however to determine the competi tiveness of labor markets first identifying the appropriate labor market may be difficult labor markets can be local eg for unskilled labor regional national or international eg for managerial and professional workers second measuring the competitiveness of labor markets is difficult finally labor markets may change over time because of demographic economic technological or other changes89

labor markets may allocate resources efficiently but they may result in distribution of earnings that some policymakers find unacceptable unionization may be means of reducing earnings inequality some economists argue that during recession greater earnings equality may increase aggregate demand and therefore reduce unemployment g5g152g149g149g142g140g157g146g159g142g561g24g152g146g140g142g561 finally some economists maintain that unions give workers voice in the workplace according to this argument unions provide workers an additional way to communicate with management for instance instead of expressing their dissatisfaction with an employer by quitting workers can use dispute resolution or formal grievance procedures to resolve issues relating to pay working conditions or other matters 91 87 in competitive labor markets unions can offset the employ ment effect of higher wages by trying to persuade consumers to buy unionmade goods eg campaigns to look for the union label limiting competition from foreign made goods eg though tariffs or import quotas or negotiating contracts that require more workers than would otherwise be needed kaufman the economics of labor markets pp

if unions raise the wages of union workers and lower employment in the union sector the supply of workers available to nonunion employers may increase resulting in greater competition for jobs and lower wages for nonunion workers the spillover effect on the other hand nonunion employers in order to discourage workers from unionizing may pay higher wages the threat effect ehrenberg and smith

requiring card check certification or secret ballot elections may rest on the desired objectives of policymakers by bargaining collectively unionized workers ma obtain higher wages improved benefits and better working conditions than if each worker bargained individually92 but depending on how well labor markets fit the model of perfect competition collective bargaining may improve or harm the allocation of resources ie economic efficiency if labor markets are competitive increasing the bargaining power of workers may reduce economic output and consumer satisfaction but may increase equality on the other hand if labor markets are not competitive increasing the bargaining power of workers may improve the allocation of resources as well as increase equality 93 by requiring card check certification the number of organizing campaigns and the union success rate may increase conversely by requiring secr et ballot elections the number of organizing drives and the union success rate may decline thus compared with existing recognition procedures requiring secret ballot elections may lower the level of unionization whereas requiring card check certification may raise it accordingly depending on the competitiveness of labor markets requiring card check certification may either improve or harm economic efficiency similarly requiring secret ballot elections may either improve or harm efficiency if either change were enacted it may be difficult however to predict or measure the size of the effects regardless of the competitiveness of labor markets requiring secret ballot elections may increase earnings inequalityif fewer workers are unionized requiring card check certification may reduce inequalityif more workers are unionized again the size of the effects may be difficult to predict or measure g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 gerald mayer analyst in labor policy gmayercrslocgov 77815 92 bargaining between employers and workers includes the right of workers to strike in the private sector and the right of employers to lock out employees 93 the results of research on the wage differential between union and nonunion workers vary but in general most studies find that after controlling for individual job and labor market characteristics the wages of union workers are in the range of 10 to 30 higher than the wages of nonunion workers although the evidence is not conclusive some studies have concluded that unions reduce earnings inequality in the overall economy crs report
