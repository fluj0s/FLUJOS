access to house proceedings public acce ss initiatives have included thomas and the development of housewide web page as well as broad and narrowcasting of house floor and committee proceedings thomas one of the earliest efforts to provide public access to materials documenting congressional activity was the introduction of thomas httpthomaslocgov available through the library of congress named in honor of thomas jefferson the service went online in january 1995 thomas was the first comprehensive electronic legislative information system distributing house and senate information to the public

corner on the information age at httpwwwcongressonlineprojectorgwebstudy2003htmlnumber shortly thereafter the congressional record text and index and legislative status information were added later nhancements to thomas included links to house and senate voting files committee reports and selected hearing transcripts as well as improved search and display capabilities house public web sites concurrent with the debut of thomas the house oversight committee launched web site for the house httpwwwhousegov providing public acce ss to information about members of congress committees and organizations of the house of representatives and to other us government informati on resources by the end of the 104th congress 222 members of congress 27 committees and 11 other house offices had launched web sites on the house web server currently all members and committees ma intain web presence recent report by the congress online project suggests that the web sites maintained by member and leadership offices offers wide array of content in some cases functioning as virtual office for constituents to visit online according to the report the web offers the members and l eadership of the house the opportunity to take advantage of emerging technolog ies as tool of communication with constituents media and other interested parties43 broadcast and narrowcast audio and video capabilities in the house of representatives also play major role in public access to congress television coverage of the floor proceedings has existed for many years along with cspan coverage of selected hearings

to communicate their whereabouts and availability or receive instructions in the event of an operational interruption or other unforeseen contingency an example of the challenges of using networks designed to carry routine communications as emergency systems can be found in the limited nonsecure communi cations system accessed through blackberry portable digital assistant pda issued to each

third option used by some offices includes contracting with outside companies to create and maintain member web pages51 these developments lead to considerations about the possible need for dicated it

environment raises several issues it is not clear for example what constitutes document in an environment where paper and electronic versions are available in variety of formats the integration of clickable web links also raise concerns about the authenticity and reliability of some docum ents combining these linked pieces of information which may originate from seve ral sources both inside and outside the house of representatives ma be essential to conveying complete message thus far it is not clear in this context wh ether collections of linked web pages are considered documents for use in the activities of the house of representatives if they are documents there may also be concerns about how the information in those documents will be maintained in some cases the house of representatives may not have complete control over doc uments which circulate electronically because they contain information from data bases beyond the control of the chamber another element of complexity may be added by potentially integrating the video recording of house of representatives floor proceedings with the text to provide for multimedia version of the congressional record similarly as committees publish more of their hearings and markup information on the internet and release video coverage of their pro ceedings they may be faced with similar questions54 closely linked with the use of multiple information formats is the issue of determining what is considered the official version of congressional materials and whether online publication satis fies current chamber rules requiring the retention of house of representatives records55 ascertaining the authenticity and status of the various versions may be an increasingly im portant use of electr onic versions of the congressional record and other legislative materials within day there are three versions of the floor proceedings ava ilablethe daily printed version of the congressional record the online version

comprehensive analysis of legislative issues related to electronic signaturesbound version of the congressional record the final bound version is considered the official version but is generally not printed for several years after house of representative proceedings have occurred in contrast it is possible to make speedy corrections to the online version of the congressional record that give it the appearance of being final yet the appearance of correctly formatted document may mask the fact that there has been little time to analyze or validate the content the ability to cut and paste text from one document to another might improve the consistency of legislation over time but also could result in increasingly length documents also given the broad public access to the congressional record over the internet the need to make available an official version quickly becomes more critical on the other hand as external composition is forced to accelerate under th is process one loses the time between each stage that historically has been available for further consideration of wording and quality control this issue will likely be topic of discussion as it continues to evolve the printed version is generally considered the official version although it is the certification by the clerk of the house that actually makes the document official security and authentication implementation of new technologies will depend on their reliability and security increasing reliance on it systems raises questions about the trustworthiness of these technologies and the potential dependency of an institution such as the house of representatives on systems that may fail to operate as and when needed the requireme nts for adequate safeguards against unauthorized access and misuse of house systems present ongoing challenges to be addressed before new systems and capabilities are implemented related to questions of it management and security is the transparency of information management in this context transparency refers to the ability to accurately trace and verify the source of the information being used to create online databases and electronic documen ts issues of concern for policymakers in this area include the sources and control of in formation the accepta nce of electronic documents as policy instruments will be heavily dependent on their perceived authenticity and reliability to achieve these qualities characteristics such as their source author and version must be clearly established and veri fied in addition to contributing to the legitimacy of online info rmation transparency is also related to concerns of trust in it trust as it rela tes to it usually refe rs to ones confidence in the reliability and dependability of the physical infrastructure this is an important concern when considering shift to mo re technologically nhanced and dependent environment such as movement toward electronic government an issue related to document authentication is the use of electronic signatures57 an electronic signature is code that is attached to digitally transmitted message or document that uniquely identifies the sender the

congress to ca rry out some responsibilities electronically that they currently do in person or in written form however the potential use of electronic signatures may conflict with some assumptions regarding members actions and delegation of author ity issues of author authentication include whether current rules governing require ments for representatives signatures could apply to electronic documents who will have authority to use an electronic signatur or under what circumstances representative would need to actually sign documents and whether staff may use an electronic signature on behalf of member of congress in manner similar to employing signature machine or signing for the representative trust is also important to convince user s of the integrity of the information upon which they rely documents that have been submitted through the appropriate channels to be printed ultimately by gpo or other sanctioned printers carry an imprimatur of legitimacy that other electronic formats from other sources do not necessarily have the chief administrativ officer of the house of representatives recently conducted technical evaluations of electronic signatur systems and other electronic authentication met hods including biometrics managing email as email has become more typical means of communication the relatively high volume of electronic messages sent to the house has highlighted differences in perceptions of email and how it is handled between congressional constituent communications and citizen or customer communications with other public or private sector entities first the decentralized nature of the house of representatives means that ever members office attends to its email needs separately compared to federal ag encies or corporati ons which often have centralized offices for handling t echnical and resource requirements58 second difference is that while private sector entities may view email as costsavings measure it is mixed blessing for the house of representatives congressional concerns about security including message tampering and identifying constituents from nonconstituents are obstacles to implementing automa ted email response systems and broader shift to routine tw way electronic communications third difference is the perceived importance of email while many constituents view their email messages to congress as being as important as phone calls or postal mail many congressional offices do not share this view and assign lower priority to responding to email messages59 these concerns have been exacerbated by the

approach to managing the flow of email messages to maintain current service levels and decrease the vulnerability of its systems to collapse by sudden sharp increases in message volume the deliberative process the impact of electronic devices on the deliberative process of the house of repres entatives is of concern some observers fear that the transition to an electronic document system may have the effect of reducing time for deliberation throughout the legislative process the use of computers makes it possible to present draft material in format that appears to be final and complete yet the appearance of correctly formatted document may mask the fact that there has been little time to discuss analyze or validate the content as legislative text moves more seamlessly from initial drafts through final publication one may potentially lose the time between each stage of the process that historically has been available for further consideration of the wording for performing quality control and for informal deliberation d ecisions on integration of it in the house of representatives will likely be influenced by these factors document publication and

programming from other sites or be present on diskette or cd most viruses can replicate themselves all computer viruses are created by humans some viruses wreak their effect as soon as their code is executed other viruses lie dormant until circumstances such as the passing of date or time cause their code to be executed by the computer simple virus that can make copy of itself over and over again is relatively easy to produce even such simple virus is dangerous because it will quickly use all available memory and bring the system to halt an even more dangerous type of virus is one capable of transmitting itself across networks and bypassing security systems virus is not the same as worm but some newer viruses are hybrid of th two types of programs worm special type of virus that can replicate itself and use memory but cannot attach itself to other programs and does not alter files worms use parts of an operating system that are automatic and usually invisible to the user it is
