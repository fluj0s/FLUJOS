current status of the independent 2005 base realignment and closure brac commission it follows an earlier crs report that provided important details about the department of defenses internal base closure realignment selection process1 at this point the 2005 brac schedule is well along with congress having already approved dods final selection criteria february 2004 and its force structure plan base inventory and brac requirement certification march 2004 the next important step in the brac schedule has been the presidents appointment of nine members to the new independent commission congressional leaders have selected six 1 see crs report rs21822 military base closures dods internal selection process by daniel h else and david lockwood in addition see crs report rl32216 military base closures implementing the 2005 round by david lockwood congressional research service the library of congress crs2 individuals to be nominated with the president choosing the remaining three the completed list of nominees has been forwarded to the senate armed services committee as of march 15 2005 after considering the nominees credentials the committee will then make its recommendations to the full senate chamber where the final decision will be agreed to or not2 it is important at this juncture to emphasize the extent to which the current 2005 brac commission is likely to follow procedures similar to those used by past commissions in 1991 1993 and 19953 the reason for this degree of replication can be attributed to the widely held view that the 1990 brac statute pl 101510 as amended provides the most successful solution to an otherwise impossible dilemma namely how to avoid eternal wrangling over which bases should be closed or realigned appointment of brac commissioners although the president was entitled to appoint nine members to the new brac commission he also had the authority to ignore the directive in which case the 2005 brac round would have been cancelled4 the president will also have second httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22061 opportunity to terminate the process later when he forwards the list of brac actions to congress by november 7 2005 in other words the president exercises almost complete authority throughout the process with one possible exception after receiving the presidentially approved list of actions congress can pass joint resolution of disapproval in appointing members to the commission the brac law states that the president should first consult with top congressional leaders on six of the nine candidates the selection and allocation of the six candidates are outlined below house of representatives senate speaker of the house 2 majority leader of the senate 2 minority leader 1 minority leader 1 the president is under obligation to consult with the congress on the three remaining appointments in the past four brac rounds members of the brac commission have included former members of congress retired military

the 2005 commission commission staff fifteen permanent employees formed the core of staff support for the 1995 brac commission this cadre had maintained continuity throughout the various brac rounds providing legacy knowledge and experience to the augmentees brought in temporarily to perform the analysis required during brac they also maintained the brac library which consisted of the research and reference materials and analytical tools used during previous rounds within three weeks of the appointment of the brac commission chairman the staff was increased by factor of five to 75 by these temporary appointments the augmentees were drawn primarily from the military services and the defense logistics 5 john m donnelly hill leaders submit nominees for base closure commission cqcom january

analysis constituted the largest section analysts accepted dod generated data and information from other sources digested it and presented it to the commissioners who were responsible for deliberating upon it and accepting rejecting or amending the dod recommendations administration administration was small but critical to the commissions success arranging travel reimbursement payroll etc relieving the commissioners and the rest of the staff of these responsibilities and allowing them to concentrate on their httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22061 own duties embedded within the administration section was the executive secretary the executive secretary controlled public access to the brac library the library housed within single large office all dod and other documentation accepted by the commission in paper and electronic form the library was equipped with computers available to the public for review of brac documentation from the current and previous rounds this information was used by many communities and other outside organizations to gain an understanding of the process by which the department of defense had created its list of recommended actions and as means of comparing the information compiled on various military installations press relations this small section handled press inquiries congressional liaison congressional interest in the brac commissions activities was intense throughout the period of active analysis and deliberation this section was responsible for fielding all congressional inquiries hearings the 1995 commission conducted hearings in washington dc geared to the recommendations made by the department of defense invited witnesses were primarily representatives of the military services defense agencies and the office of the secretary of defense the commission also conducted series of field hearings grouped geographically by region witnesses who appeared at the field hearings usually represented communities affected by the dod list of recommendations and installations later added by the brac commission crs5 base visits commissioners were required to visit every installation added to the dod list of recommended actions in fact the commissioners visited every installation on the brac list6 representations from outside groups many communities submitted impact studies of various kinds to the commission in addition the commission received many visits by interested individuals and organizations who met with the staff and made use of the brac library commission deliberations in broad sense the commissions deliberations continued throughout its existence data regarding installations and communities was updated and analyzed as it was received the commissions list of recommendations was drawn up over twoday public markup at which each recommendation was read aloud by the staff and deliberated by the commissioners before making final determination majority vote was required to add an installation to the list of recommended actions7 submission to the president commission and white house staffs engaged in an extensive and continuing exchange of information throughout the process the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22061 commission submitted its list of recommendations to the white house after due consideration the president forwarded the list to congress congressional action in 1995
