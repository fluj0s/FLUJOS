analyzes number of policy issues that the 108th congress may consid er during debate school choice as federal policy option in the district of columbia during the past several congresses numerous proposals have been made to enact school choice programs through fe deral legislation number of these proposals have been enacted into law nd are being implemented across the nation3 during this time several proposals also have been made to enact school choice programs that would operate only within the district of columbia one the district of columbia school reform act of 1995 pl 104134 created the district of columbia public charter school law others failed to be enacted4 in 1998 president clinton vetoed the district of columbia student opportunity scholarship act of 1997 s 1502 which would have created federally funded scholarship program in the district of columbia for purposes of awarding scholarships to enable children from lowincome families to attend schools of choice in the washington dc metropolitan area there appear to be number of reas ons why proposals have been made to establish federally funded school voucher or scholarsh ip program unique to the district of columbia these include sire to bring about reform and improvement in the district of columbia public schools dcps the perception that publicly funded private school choice is missing but needed choice option for lowincome students in the district of columbia the opportunity to implement highly visible school voucher demonstration program in the nations capital and the belief that lowincome students should not be compe lled to attend inferi or public schools when students from families with greater resources have access to better schooling optionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32019crs3 5 some who value the independence afforded pr ivate schools see the prospect of increased regulation as an argument against federally funded scholarship program 6 according to federal income eligibility

additional family member see us department of agriculture child nutrition programs income eligibility guidelines available at httpwwwfnsusdagov cndgovernanceiegsiegs0304pdfpolicy arguments against the establishment of scholarship program for the district of columbia include it would be imposed on the district of columbia against principles of home rule existing voucher programs have demonstrated only limited success in improving student academic achievement if the establishment of voucher programs were tr uly promising education reform there likely would be widespread demand for them nationwide voucher program would divert resources and perhaps the most motivated and talent ed students away from public schools and voucher program would not hol d participating private school s to the same standards and requirements appli cable to public schools5 proposals to establish k 12 scholarship or voucher program in the district of columbia in the 108th congress the house and the senate

during consid eration of fy2004 district of columbia appropriations bills however the housepassed version of the appropriations act for the district of columbia hr 2765 authorized the establishment of

would not alter any provisions of the individuals with disabilities education act idea8 operators of scholarship programs woul d make scholarship payments to the parents or legal guardians of students selected to receive scholarships and scholarship payments would be deemed assistance to students and not federal financial assistance to the schools th students attend this has important implications with regard to certain federal laws and regulations that apply to organizations contingent upon their recei pt of federal funds the value of scholarships could vary according to student need however the maximum value would be limited to the lesser of the cost of tuition fees and transportation expenses to attend particular priv ate school or b 7500 the bill does not prohibit participatin g schools from charging tuition and fees that exceed the amount covered by the scholarships nor from wa iving or subsidizing tuition and feeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32019crs5 number of accountability

low and not improving17 while some reports show that students who attend private schools in some cases exhibit higher academic achievement than those who attend public schools18 there are mixed results when examining whether school voucher programs targeted at low income students lead to improved academic achievement for voucher recipients who enroll in private schools results from so program evaluations show statistically significant increased academic achievement for africanamerican voucher recipients but not for other students while results of other evaluations indicate that vouchers have little or positive effect on student achievement19 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32019crs8 20 clive r belfield and henry m levin the effects of competition between schools on educational

to attend private elementary and secondary schools in the district of columbia and to continue participating in the program so long as their family income in subsequent years does not ex ceed 200 of the poverty line data from the 2000 census show that in the district of columbia nearly 44 of families with related children aged 5 to 17 had income s at or below 185 of the poverty line thus it appears that relatively high proportion of students in the district of columbia would be eligible to participate in the program21 if 14 million were provided for the program after accounting for administrative costs academic assessments and evaluations more than 1600 scholarships valued at 7500 could be provided to eligible children representing over tw percent of current dcps enrollment22 if some students were able to attend private schools for less than 7500 scholarships could be pr ovided to more students it may be questioned whether existin g private schools in the district of columbia would be able to absorb an in flux of scholarship recipients especially schools with tuition low enough to be c overed by 7500 scholarship number of reports suggest that there currently are sufficient

institute estimates that private schools in the district of columbia could accommodate approxima tely 2925 additional students24 with approximately 1600 scholarships able to be funded under the proposed program on the surface it appear s that there are sufficient openings to accommodate an influx of students when analyzing the ability of private schools to accommodate scholarship recipients it is important to consider the priorities that would be applied in awarding scholarships to students under the proposed program in addition to limiting initial eligibility to students from families with incomes at or below 185 of the poverty line and that have limited resources the program also would give priority to students attending schools identified for improvement corrective action or restructuring under esea title ia in dcps 15 schools have been identified for school improvement three elementary schools f our middle and junior high schools and seven senior high schools25 in the current school ear approximately 9000 students attend these schools of these students approximately 20 attend the elementary schools approximately 20 attend the middle and junior high schools and approximately 60 attend the senior high schools26 all of these schools are located in relatively highpoverty neighborhoods in the district of columbia thus while the number of students attending these school s who would be eligib to participate in the program based on their lowincome status is unknown it is presumable that substantial proportion would be eligible given the existing education environment in the district of columbia and the substantial number of children from fa milies with incomes below 185 of the poverty line it may be useful to consid er the school choice options that might become available to scholarship recipients at the various grade levels figures 13 display maps of the district of columb ia showing the percentages of families with children aged 517 with

school websites schools offering educational programs that are not defined by graded level which primarily serve students with special needs are not included on the maps 28 this assumes that scholarship recipients generally will be unable to contribute any additional funds toward their education there also exists the possib ility that participating schools will offer scholarship recipients ition waivers or scholarships for tuition not covered under the proposed programcorresponding to the schools tuition level27 private schools that charge tuition of 7500 or less are depicted by light color bars and schools that charge tuition above 7500 are depicted by dark color bars ition at many private schools especially senior high schools is more than double the proposed scholarship amount the maps show that there potentially will be different private school options available to scholarship recipients at different grade levels school choice options will be dependent upon the num ber of private schools offering programs at the various grade levels their willingness to participate in the program the number of openings they make available and their ition levels at present it is not known how many schools would elect to particip ate nor how many openings they would make available however information is available on the number and location of private schools currently operating in the district of columbia and the tuition they charge of the private schools that offer pr ograms at the elementary school level see figure 1 35 out of 53 have tuition at or below 7500 of the private schools that offer programs at the middle nd junior high school level see figure 2 36 of 53 have tuition at or below 7500 most of the schools that serv elementary middle and junior high school students and that have tuition at or below 7500 are located in areas with greater proportions of lowin come families only 5 out of 20 private schools that offer senior high school programs see figure 3 have tuition at or below 7500 it appears that senior high school students would have rather limited private school options with most private senior high schools charging tuition above 7500 and being located the northwest quadr ant of the district of columbia based on the number of private schools ope rating in the district of columbia and their published tuition leve ls it appears that the greatest range of school choices will be available to the pproximately 40 of student s from schools identified for school improvement who are at the elementa ry middle and junior high school levels see figure 1 and figure 2 sizable proportion of these schools are located in lower income neighborhoods for the appr oximately 60 of students from schools identified for school improvement who are at the senior hi gh school level it appears that there would be relatively few options largely because most private senior high schools in the district of columbia charge tuition that exceeds 7500 see figure 328httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32019crs11 while it is not clear that sufficient sc hool choice options are available at the appropriate grade levels to accommodate the total number of students who might be eligible and seek to participate in the pr ogram it is possible that by providing 7500 scholarships to large number of lowincome families sufficient demand will be created to stimulate an increase beyond current private school options existing private schools might increase their rollments and over time new schools might open especially in the lowincome neig hborhoods of scholarship recipients still it is unclear whether scholarships limited to 7500 will be sufficient to cause noticeable increase in capacity at the senior high school levelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32019crs12

nationwide for federal formula grant programs were reduced to make funds availabl for scholarship program the district of columbia would lose its proportionate share of such funds however the district of columbia generally receives less than 1 of federal elementary and secondary education funding thus even if federal formula funds were reduced by the amount of f unding provided for district of

education for the disadvantaged overview of esea title ia amendments under the child left behind act by wayne riddlefunding federal education funding for th district of columbia questions might arise about whether the establishmen t of the proposed scholarship program would affect the amount of federal funds available for elementary and secondary education in the district of columbia funds appropriated to carry out the program might be characterized either as new spending or as displacing spending that otherwise would have occurred under one or more existing federal programs or that otherwise would have been earmarked for some other purpose such as funding for other projects in the district of columbia while it is not possible to ascertain whether and how funds ma available for the proposed program might be distributed in the absence of such program it does not appear that the establishment of scholarship program for students in th district of columbia would have any significant adverse effect on the amount of funds to be made av ailable to students in the district of columbia under federal ementary and secondary education formula grant programs29 in general under federal formula grant pr ograms the allocation of funds to state and local educational agencies seas and leas respectively is based on the number of eligible children re siding in states or leas or the total number enrolled in public and nonpublic schools30 thus the type of school in which child is enrolled generally does not impact the amount of federal funds state or lea is eligible to receive however since ligible children enrolled in private schools generally are eligible to be served under federal programs when the number or proportion of eligible children enrolled in private schools increases it results in smaller proportion of fe deral funds being available to serve students who remain in public schools this often results in concer ns being raised by states and leas about voucher programs that enable st udents to attend private schools esea title ia as the education for the disadvantaged program under esea title ia is the largest of the federal ementary and secondary education formula grant programs it might be useful to illu strate how the distribution of funds under this program might be impacted by scholarship program31 if the proposed scholarship program were

childs eligibility to be served under title ia note eligibility criteria for targeted assistance programs are used to identify children attending private schools for the receipt of title ia services however the majority of public school participants in title ia are now served through schoolwide programs in which the identification of particul ar children for the receipt of services is not required 35 perpupil funding is required under pl 104134 24012403scholarship recipients would be eligib for services unde r esea title ia32 as previously mentioned the number of st udents attending private schools would not affect the total amount of funds the district of columbia would be eligible to receive under title ia however the amount of funds available to rve students attending both schools in the dcps system and public charter schools would be reduced if eligible students transferred to private schools funds that previously would have been generated by the student for dcps or charter school would now be redirected to serve eligible students attending private schools under title ia not all schools in an lea receiving funding under title ia are eligible to receive funds to operate title ia programs funds are allocated within leas to schools for the operation of title i programs either for targeted assistance or for schoolwide programs based on the number of lowincome students residing within school attendance areas33 children enrolled in pr ivate schools are identified to be served under title ia on the basis of 1 residing in an eligible attendance area and 2 being identified either as failing or most at risk of failing to meet state academic achievement standards34 if upon being awarded scholarship under the proposed program lowincome child transf erred out of title ia school to attend private school the funds generated by th child would become available to serve eligible lowachieving childre n attending the receiving private school however the particular child who generate d the funds might not be elig ible for title ia services as eligibility to receive services is deter mined on the basis of child residing in lowincome attendance area and being lowachieving not lowincome local education funding in th district of columbia in the district of columbia local education funding is allocated to dcps and to public charter schools on perpupil

characteristics such as grade level special education limite d english proficiency and participation in summer school funds are then allo cated to individual dcps schools according to the weighted student formula wsf which similarly contains weights based onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32019crs17 36 for discussion of the upsff and the wsf see district of columbia board of education the dc board of

factor was 4269 37 see for example esea title ia 120ab and idea 613astudent characteristics the amount of funding provided to dcps schools under the wsf is noticeably less than the amount ge nerated under the upsff the difference between the upsff and the wsf amounts goes to central services these perpupil funding procedures are designed to ensu re accountability and transparency in the allocation of funds36 it appears that the transfer of st udents from dcps schools or public charter schools to private schools would affect ducation funding differently than has the transfer of students from dcps schools to ch arter schools as previously mentioned charter schools are funded on perpupil basis so when student transfers from dcps school to charter school funding follows the student from the sending school to the charter school if the pr oposed scholarship pr ogram facilitated the transfer of students from ither dcps or public charte r schools to private schools there would be requirement for local funds to follow the students to private schools still the prospect of over 1600 stude nts leaving public ly funde d dcps or charter schools to attend priv ate schools could have vari ed and possibly significant impact on the amount of loca l funds made ava ilable for public education in the district of columbia depending in part on decisions by local policymakers if for example the upsff foundati on level were maintained smaller amount of local funding would be allocated as public sc hool enrollment decreas ed conve rsely if local appropriations remained steady the upsff foundation level could be increased resulting in greater funding on perpupil basis re gardless of how the potential transfer of student s to private schools might impact local education funding expansion beyond existing choice programs in the district of columbia also likely would add additional uncertainty to local efforts to plan for facilities staff and other resources especially if continuation of the proposed program were not assured restrictions on the use of federal funds under many federal grant programs receipt of federal funds is conditioned on grantees assuring either that the federal funds they receive w ill not be used to f und activities that otherwise would have occurred in the absence of federal f unding or that they will match in whole or in part federal funds with nonfederal funds in genera l federal elementary and secondary education grant programs cont ain requirements that funds awarded to seas leas or other grant ees supplement and not s upplant funds received from other sources supplement and not suppl ant clauses are found in esea and idea programs37 the proposed scholarship program contains neither supplement and not supplant clause nor matching require ment thus if an entity currently funded through nonfederal sources nd which awards scholarships to allow students in the district of columbia to attend private sc hools were to be selected as the programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32019crs18 operator it does not appear that the entity would be required to fund only new scholarships with the fe deral funds it receives continued funding for the scholarship program according to hrept 108401 14 million would be authoriz ed and appropriated for the program for fy2004 and such sums as necessary woul d be authorized for subsequent years as previously mentioned this would llow for over 1600 students to be awarded scholarships to attend private schools per acad emic year as the program continues an annual appropriation of pproximately the same amount would continue to need to be provided to allow th is cohort of students to pr ogress with its private school education assuming that each year onl few students leave the program or graduate from high school few new students beyond the initial cohort would be able to receive scholarships in subsequent years wit hout substa ntial annual increases in appropriations nondiscrimination and civil rights the proposed program contains number of provisions addressing nondiscrimination scholarship organizations and schools participating in the program would be prohibited from discriminating on the basi s of race color national origin religion or sex they also would be required to accept eligible students through random selection pr ocess if oversubscribed re ligiously affiliated schools would not be considered to be discriminating on the basis of sex if taking sex into account such as through the offering of singlesex schools cl asses or activities were consistent with their religious tenets or beliefs religious ly affiliated schools also would be permitted to make empl oyment decisions such as employing individuals in manner consistent with fu rthering their religious purpose consistent with the requirements of t itle vii of the civil rights act of 1964 42 usc 2000e 1 participating sc hools would be permitted to requi re students to abide

legislation to establish the scholarship program would not affect any provisions of the idea the applicability of many other federal nondisc rimination and civil rights laws however is dependent upon recei pt of federal financ ial assistance and the proposal provides that scholarships provided through the program are to be considered assistance to the student and not assistance to the school that

religiously affiliated schools are require d to meet the childfind requirements of idea39 as noted above the proposal would not affect any of the provisions of idea in the district of columbia special

against individuals with disability in the provision of services it does not apply to private schools or organizations thus it appears th at its provisions would not apply directly to private schools that scholarship recipi ents might attend nor to private nonprofit organizations or consortia operating scholarship program however if an educational entity of the district of columbia government were selected to operate the scholarship program as public entity it appears that it would be subject to title ii requirements title iii of the ada prohibits private entities from discriminating against individuals with disabilities in the pr ovision of public accommodations and is applicable to private schools howeve r private schools that are controlled by religious organizations are exempted from

educational services discrimination on the basis of sex race color religi on or national origin applies generally and is not contingent upon r eceipt of federal fi nancial assistance43 as the proposal states that scholarships provided through the program are to be considered assistance to the student and not assistance to the school that enrolls the student it appears that these civil rights laws might apply differently to participating schools accepting applications from scholarship recipien ts than to grantees receiving federal funds to operate the scholarship program in general it appears that school pa rticipating in the scholarship program would not be considered recipient of federal financ ial assistance on the basis of accepting scholarship recipient and that civil rights laws would apply to participating school only if the school accepted federa l financial assistance through other sources however as previously noted the legislation does contain specific provisions addressi ng nondiscrimination with regard to entities selected to operate the scholarship program it appears that in general as recipients of federal financial assistance they would be subject to most federal nondiscrimin ation and civil rights laws to see how these requirements might apply under the proposed scholarship pr ogram it may be instructive to turn to an existing federally funded elementary and secondary edu cation school choice program supplemental educa tional services the depa rtment of education has adopted policy of requiring seas and as as recipients of federal financial assistance to ensure that discrimina tion does not exist in the supplemental educational services programs they operate44 it is not clear the extent to which operators would be required to ensure that discrimination did not exist in their scholarship programs for example with respect to students with disabilities would scholarship program operators only be required to ensure that such students were eligible to receive scholarships or would they be required to ensure that all scholarship recipients were presented w ith the opportunity to choose from among range of schools able to accommodate them

the scholarship program the independent entity conducting the evaluatio n would be required to measure the academic achievement of all participating students using the same academic assessments as are administered to student s in dcps the evaluation would compare the academic achievement of students par ticipating in the program students who applied but were not awar ded scholarships and stude nts who attend dpcs schools annually the secretary would be required to report to congress on the progress of the program and to make info rmation about the program pub licly available grantees operating
