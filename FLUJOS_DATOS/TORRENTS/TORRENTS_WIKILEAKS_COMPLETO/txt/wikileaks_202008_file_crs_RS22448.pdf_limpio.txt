program cost estimates9 data on states plans for adopting the 1915i hcbs option are limited but an october 2007 survey of states on their ltc plans indicat that two states planned to submit hcbsspas while 16 other states and territory guam were considering the option10 the remainder of this section discusses issues that could affect states utilization of the section 1915i option under 1915c waivers states may use higher income standards for determining beneficiaries eligibility for services than income standards under 1915i up to 300 of ssi for 1915c versus 150 of th federal poverty leve l fpl for 1915i11 the more restrictive income eligibility standa rds under 1915i limits states from converting beneficiaries in existing 1915 c waivers to 1915ispas because many states permit beneficiaries to have high er incomes than 150 of the fpl in 1915c waivers in addition to more restrictive eligibility standards 1915i is limited to covering only services described in s ection 1915c paragraph 4b12 the 1915i spa option prevents states from adding other services re quested by states on casebycase basis as permitted under 1915c waivers under 1915c waivers states have used the other services clause to address the needs of sp ecific beneficiary groups for example hcbs waivers have been used to expand services to include transporta tion apartment deposits and even home modifications necessary for community living under 1915c waivers states may define eligibility based on diseases or conditions such as brain injury or hivaids or geographic area such as city or county under 1915i however states must create different ways to measure qualifi cation for services that rely on individuals needs for service under hcbswaivers medicaid may use common medical measures such as diagnoses but assessing individuals support needs using activities of daily living can be more difficult to m easure for some populations httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22448 crs5 table 2 medicaid
