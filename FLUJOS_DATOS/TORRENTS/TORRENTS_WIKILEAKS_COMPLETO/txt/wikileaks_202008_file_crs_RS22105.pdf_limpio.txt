simple example of how it works in terrorism related case this report is an abridged version w ithout footnotes appendices and most of its quotation marks and cita tions of authority of crs report rl32846 how the federal sentencing guidelines work two examples introduction congress created the united states sentencing commission and authorized it to promulgate sentencing guidelines in order to eliminate and prevent unwarranted sentencing disparity the statutes that define federal crimes still identify the maximum penalties and in some cases the minimum sentences that may be assessed the guidelines howev er provide the standards th at most often speak to how federal criminals will be punish ed within those boundaries the guidelines assign most federal crimes to one of fortythree offense levels based on the severity of the offense every offender is assigned to one of six criminal history categories based upon th extent of his or her past misconduct the combination of offense levels and criminal history categ ories governs the seve rity of th penalties assessed under the guidelines this is walk through the guidelines using as vehicle terrorism related case with sentencing

rious immigrationrelated false statements in violation of 18 usc 1015a and 18 usc 1425a which the government unsuccessfully asserted had facilitated the s upport of overseas terrorist activ ity he was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment fine of 15000 100 special assessment and 3 years of supervised release base offense level the statutory index ussg appa identifies section 2l22 as applicable to both the 18 usc 1015a and the 18 usc 1425a violations section 2l22 carries base offense level of 8 with the possibility of increases for aggravating factors apparently not implicated in biheiris case the base offense level for each violation 18 usc 1425 and 18 usc 1015 was 8 adjustments victimrelated the guidelines allow for four socalled victimrelated offense level adjustments 1 hate crimes or vulnerable victims 2 official victims 3 restrained victims and 4 terrorism the government sought an adjustment only under the terrorism guideline in biheiri the terrorism adjustment guideline assigns an additional 12 offense levels if the offense or any related crime that constitutes relevant conduct is felony that involved or wa s intended to promote federal crime of terrorism establishes minimum offense leve l of 32 in such cases and tops out the defendants criminal history score at vi regardless of his or her prior criminal record the section has obvious application when the offe nder has been convicted of federal crime of terrorism but it may also apply when crime of terrorism has the necessary relationship to the crime of conviction to qualify under the guideline and constitute relevant conduct for purposes of the guidelin the government asserted that biheiri had engaged in financial trans actions with designated rrorist who had connections to hamas in violation of the internationa l emergency economic powers act ieepa the statute of limitations barred prosecution of the ieepa allegations directly but the government asserted that ieepa violations mig ht be used as the basis for an adjustmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22105crs3 under section 3a14 it failed first because it could not prove that the ieepa violations were committed in preparation for or in any other way relevant to the immigration violations that constituted th crimes of conviction and s econd because it failed to prove that the ieepa violations constituted federal crime of terrorism when crime is related to the obstruction of terrorism investigation or proceeding it may also warrant application of section 3a14 but th enhancement was unavailable in biheiri because the government could not show that the false stat ements obstructed its i nvestigation offense level adjustment 0 adjusted offense level for each violation 8 role in the offense there are five roleintheoffens adjustments 1 leadership 4 levels for organizer or leader of crime with 5 or more participants or that is otherwise extensive 3 levels for manager or supervisor of such crime 2 levels for an organizer leader manager or supervisor of any other criminal activity 2 minor players 4 levels for minimal participants 2 levels for minor participants 3 abuse of trust or use of special skill 2 levels 4 fagan enhancement 2 levels for the use of minor and 5 use of body armor 4 levels for the use of body armor during drug trafficking crime or crime of violence 2 levels for drug trafficking or violent crime involving the use of body armor the biheiri court refused to assess 4 level role in the offense increase under the theory that biheiri s activity involved the federal agencies and employees to whom the false statements were made thereby qualifyi ng as the supervisor in crime involving 5 or more participants but did concl ude that 2 level adjustment was appropriate in view of bi heiris supervision of two othe r participants in his scheme offense level adjustment 2 adjusted offense level for each violation 10 obstruction accepting responsibility obstruction of justice makes an increase of 2 levels appropria as does reckless endangerme nt during flight question of either obstruction of justice adjustment arose in biheiri the guidelines also permit an adjustment in cases where th defendant accepts responsibility decrease of 2 levels as general rule and decrease of 1 level in cas otherwise carrying an offense level of 16 or more where the defendant signals his intent to plead guilty before the government has had to invest major time and effort preparing for trial biheiri warranted such adjustments offense level adjustment 0 adjusted offense level 10 d multiple c ounts to account the conviction of defendant for more than one crime without pancaking charges involving essentially the sa misconduct the guidelines apply grouping procedur under which similar offenses are grouped together once the multiple crimes for which the defendant has been convicted have been collected in closely related groups the offense level applicable to each group is determined using the highest offense level attributable to the most serious crime within the group with one exception for the crimes whose offense levels depend upon the amount of money stolen or the extent of damage caused or the amount drugs manufactured or dealt the amounts are cu mulated the offense level for each group having been determined the group with the hi ghest offense level is assigned unit as is any group whose offense level is within 4 levels of the lead group any group within 5 to 8 offense levels of that of the lead group is assigned half unit other groups are disregarded the offense level for the lead group is then increased by the total number of units add 1 level for 15 units 2 levels for 2 units 3 leve ls for 25 or 3 units 4 levels for 35 to 5 units and 5 levels for more than 5 units the resulting total offense level of the lead group is the basis for the defendants final sentencing biheiris offenses were grouped together adjustment for multiple groups was necessary and the offense levels for the two violations were counted as one w ithin the single group had the offense levelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22105crs4 for the violation of either 18 usc 1015 or 1425 been higher it would have been used offense level adjustment 0 adjusted offense level 10 criminal history category as general rule an offenders criminal record determines his or her criminal history cat egory for each offense level there are six permissible sentencing subcategories arranged according to the seriousness of the defendants criminal history points are assessed for past convi ctions for misconduct committed while under judicial supervision ch as bail or parole and for crimes of violence by operation of ussg 3b 14 terrorism adjustment results in the assignment to criminal history category vi regardless of the offenders criminal record there are past criminal activities which not only determine defendants criminal history category point total but also provide the ba sis for increasing defendants offense level as in the case of career criminals professional criminals armed career criminals and recidivist sex offenders biheiri would appear to have had little if any criminal record of prior convictions adjusted offense level 10 criminal history category i v departures in the interest of uniformity the guidelines seek to limit the circumstances under which sent ence outside of the ranges otherwise called for by the guidelines may be recommended the gu idelines countenance departure from the sentence otherwise called for 1 upon the request of the government in recognition of the defendants cooperation with authorities 2 where the cr iminal history provisions do not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendants past criminal record and 3 in cases where there exists an aggravating or in cas other than those involving child crimes or sex offenses mitigating circumstance of kind or to degree not adequately taken into consideration by the sentencing commission in formulating the guidelines the government sought an upward departure in biheiri but the court decided that none of the circumstances or consequences of biheiris offenses of conviction appear to be atypical so as to take the case out of the heartland of the applicable guideline final offense level 10 criminal history category i sentencing table imprisonment the guidelines sentencing table below indicates that the permissible sentencing range for offense level 10 criminal history category i is not less than 6 nor more than 12 months imprisonment although the guideline ranges must fall within the statutory maximum and any stat utory minimum for the crime of conviction the range in biheiri was well within the maximum for the statutes of conviction 18 usc 1015 carries 5 year maximum 18 u sc 1425 10 year maximum biheiri was sentenced to 12 months imprisonmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22105crs5 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22105crs6 probation substitute incarceration probation eligibility under the guidelines is very limited it extends only to defendants for whom the maximum permissible sentence of imprisonment under the guidelines is more than 6 months zone or to defendants whose maximum is more than 1 year if the court imposes some form of incarceration rather than imprisonment ie weekend or nighttime imprisonment home confinement etc zone b the ma ximum permissible term of probation for defendant with an offense vel 6 or higher is 5 years below offense level 6 the maximum term of probation is 3 years defendants sentenced at offense level 19 or above zones c and d are ineligible for probation with an offe nse level of 10 biheiri would have been eligible for probation coupled w ith some form of incarceration other than imprisonment but the court elected to sentence him to imprisonment at the top of the applicable range in cases when the offense level carries maximum term of imprisonment of not more than 16 months zone b or c the sentencing court may impose term of substitute incarceration intermittent confinement community confinement or home detention again with an offense level of 10 the court might have sentenced biheiri to some form of substitute incarceration but elected not to supervised release unless otherwise provided by statute defendants sentenced to imprisonment for more than year must also be sentenced to term of supervised release to be served after they leave prison the court may impose term of supervised release upon defendants sentenced to imprisonment fo r year or less maximum terms of supervised release range from 1 to 5 years depending on the seriousness of their offense biheiri was sentenced to 3 ear term of supervised release restitution fines ot her economic sanctions the court may also order defendants to make restitution or unless required by statute the court may forego restitution order if the number of identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable or b determining complex issues of fact related to the cause or amount of the victims losses would compli cate or prolong the sentencing process to degree that the need to provide restitution to any victim is outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process there was evidence of restitution order in biheiri the guidelines establish fine schedule according to offense level for th crime of conviction the court need not impose fine where the defendant is unable nd unlikely to be able to pay any fine imposed if the court does not impose or waives the fine imposed it may impose alternative sanctions in biheiris case the guidelines call for fine of not less than 2000 nor more than 20000 the cour t imposed fine of 15000 in addition federal courts must impose special assessmen t of 100 for felony vi olations of federal law and lesser amounts for misde meanors biheiri was asse ssed special assessment of 100 criminal forfeitures which become operable upon conviction for certain offenses are announced as part of the sentencing process there were criminal forfeiture provisions implicated in biheiri several tax statutes and few others authorize the court to assess the costs of prosecution against defendants convicted of violating their commands the statutes under which biheiri wa s convicted are not among them section 3555 of title 18 authorizes sentencing courts to order defendant to pay for the cost of victim notification up to maximum of 20000 the guidelines permit the court to set off the cost against any fine imposed the issue does not appear to have arisen in biheiri
