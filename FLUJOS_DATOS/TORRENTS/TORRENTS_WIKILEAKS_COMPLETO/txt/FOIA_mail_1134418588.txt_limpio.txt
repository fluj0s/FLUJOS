from tom wigley wigleycgducaredu to phil jones pjonesueaacuk subject hadcrut2v date mon 12 dec 2005 151628 0700 cc tim osborn tosbornueaacuk ben santer santer1llnlgov xflowed phil why is there so much missing data for the south pole the period jan 75 thru dec 90 is all missing except dec 81 july dec 85 apr 87 apr sept 88 apr 89 also from and including aug 2003 is missing also more seriously but correctable the s pole is just represented by single box at 875s n pole ditto i suspect this screws up area averaging it would be better to put the s pole value in all boxes at 875s i have had to do this in my code but you really should fix the raw gridded data for area averages the difference is between having the s pole represent the whole region south of 85s and having as now it represent one 72nd of this region it is pretty obvious to what is better this affects the impression of missing data too of course tom xflowed
