president george w bush announced new 720 million research and velopment rd initiative to promote hydrogen as transportation fuel the hydrogen fuel initiative is intended to complement the freedomcar initiative1 which focuses on cooperative ve hicle research between the federal government univers ities and private industry the freedomcar initiative replaced relate d clinton administration initiative the partnership for new generation of vehicles pngv announced in 19932 while both initiatives aimed to increase fuel efficiency of the automotive fleet freedomcar extended the time frame by another 10 to 15 years and focused research on hydrogen fuelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21442crs2 3 for more information on fuel cell and hybr id vehicle technology see crs report rl30484 advanced

focused mainly on dieselfueled hybrid vehicles3 through fy2003 the overall level of funding for pngv nd freedomcarrelated research at the department of energy doe remained relatively constant with some of the funds for hybrid vehicles transferred to fuel cell research4 for fy2004 however overall funding for research within the office of energy efficiency and renewable energy into hydrogen fuel fuel cells and vehicle technol ogies increased by about 30 some of this increase was offset by funding reductions in other programs but the major portion of the increase was new funding for fy2005 through fy2008 funding for hydrogen and fuel cell rd steadily increased however for fy2009 the bush administration has requested 30 below the fy2008 appropriation for hydrogen fuel cell and vehicle technologies programs much of that decreas would be offset by an almost doubling of related basic science researc h overall the request is roughly 4 below fy2008 levels for all related research

2003the mission of the hydrogen fuel initiativ is to research develop and validate fuel cells and hydrogen produc tion delivery and storage t echnologies for transportation and stationary applications7 fuel cell rd areas include transportation systems stationary systems fuel processing fuel cell components and tec hnology validation the focus of hydrogen fuel rd includes hydrogen production and delivery fuel storage hydrogen infrastructure safety codes nd standards and trai ning and education partnership goals the freedomcar and the hydrogen fuel in itiatives have each set four goals for 2015 and share one additional goal between them the shared goal is to produce hydrogenfueled engine systems that achieve double to triple the efficiency of todays conventional engines at cost comp etitive with conventional engines freedomcars individual goals mainly fo cus on reducing system costs for various technologies the freedom car goals are to develop electric drive systems with 15year life and significantly reduced hardware costs advanced internal combustion engine systems with double to triple theefficiency of current systems at greater cost and higher emissions than conventional engine systems electrical energy storage with improved life and lower cost than currentsystems and materials and manufactur ing technologies that achieve 50 weight reduction in vehicle structure while maintaining affordability and increasing the use of recyclablerecycled materials the four goals for the hydrogen fuel initiative focus on improvements in fuel cell technology and improvements in the storag and delivery of hydrogen fuel the initiatives goals are to develop hydrogen fuel cell power systems th at are durable and deliver higher efficiency at lower cost than todays systems transportation fuel cell systems that deliver greater efficiency and lowercost and meet or exceed emissions standards hydrogen refueling systems that are highly efficient and deliver fuel at themarket price of gasoline and onboard hydrogen storage systems with improved energy density andcost over existing systemshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21442crs5 8 j l laws budget ii bush ups an on

2002 p a2 13 carol cole freedomfuel only first st ep more needed to advance hydrogen octane week february 10 2003debate over the initiatives the creation of freedomcar and the presidents hydrogen fuel initiatives have raised debate over seve ral issues these issues include the proper role of the government in rd as well as the proper level of funding and concerns over energy efficiency and fuel consumption some environmental groups incl uding the sierra club have cr iticized the initiatives they argue that while funding has increased for efficient technologies the initiatives do not require auto manufacturers to make fuel cell vehicles available to customers by any specific time8 also groups such as the natural resources defense council argued that the initiatives were put in place to forestall significant increases in national fuel economy standards9 however in 2007 congress enacted mo re stringent fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light truc ks as part of the energy independence and security act of 2007 pl 11014010 the administration argues that the high er rd funding will provide significant impetus for advancements in hydrogen and fu cell technologies and that without those advancements the technology woul d be unaffordable for consumers11 further some engineers argue that freedomcars efficiency and cost goals may be difficult to attain in the time frame of the program and that any sort of sales goal would be unrealistic12 moreover industry groups argue that an exp licit sales goal could force manufacturers to abandon rd on other promising technol ogies like gasolineelectric hybrids even among supporters of the program th ere is criticism that freedomcar and the presidents hydrogen fuel initiative are underfunded and that dditional government commitments to hydrogen and fuel cells must be made accordin g to some proponents these commitments could take the form of increased rd funding expanded demonstration programs vehicle and fuel sales or production incentives and other incentives to make these vehicles attractive to customers13 finally some critics argue there are too ma ny technical and economic hurdles to the development of affordable practical hydrogen and fuel cell technology especially for automobiles and that federal research should focus on more realistic goalshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21442crs6 research at other agencies in addition to doe other government agenci are also involved in fuel cell vehicle rd although this funding is considerab ly lower for example the national automotive center nac part of the armys tankautomotive research development and engineering center tardec coordinates fuel cell vehicle research between the department of defense dod and private contractors and partners with doe the department of tran sportation dot the environmental protection agency epa academia and industry current legislation the appropriations processes over the next few years will directly affect the future of freedomcar and the presidents hydrog fuel initiative between fy2004 and fy2008 the administrations stated goal wa s funding increase for both initiatives of 720 million above fy2003 levels for fy2004 th rough fy2008 in total congress appropriated an additi onal 450 million in total between fy2004 and fy2008 for hydrogen fuel cell and advanced vehicle pr ograms congress appr opriated an additional 145 million for other programs mainly basic sc iences for total increase of roughly 600 million over that fiveyear period in addition to appropriations legislation hydrogen nd fuel cell vehicles are addressed by other recent gislation on august 8 2005 president bush signed the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 among other provisions pl 10958 authorizes appropriations for hydrogen and fuel cell research at higher levels than requested by the president 33 billion over fi ve years in addition to rd funding the bill provides tax incentives for the purchase of new fuel cell vehicles issues for congressional consideration freedomcar and the presidents hydrogen fuel initiative raise several key issues for congressional consideration some of these issues are given rising federal defi cits and the potential for increased defense costs can the federal government afford the recent increase for hydrogen and fuel cell rd should the federal government be pick ing hydrogen and fuel cell vehicle technologies over other tec hnologies such as hybrid vehicles and lean burn engines would the designation of target deadline for commercialization of fuelcell vehicles help focus the prog ram and make bette r use of funding resources alternately would such deadline force manufacturers to abandon other promising technologies or create an unfair burden on the industry should the government focus on longt erm research or should it focus on technologies closer to commercialization or both is the widespread use of hydrogen and fuel cells technically and economically feasible or is the gove rnment taking too large risk on unproven technology
