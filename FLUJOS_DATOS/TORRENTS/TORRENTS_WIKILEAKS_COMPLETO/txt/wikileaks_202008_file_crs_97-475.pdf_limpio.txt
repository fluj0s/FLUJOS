sfor forc requirements will be reviewed every six months in conjunction with evaluations f progress in implementing the dayton accords and troop levels may be reduce d depending upon the stability of the region an independent factor which ma influence nato decisions on troop levels in bosnia is the ongoing conflict in th serbian province of kosovo though kosovo is not contiguous to bosnia and n

reserve forces and the national guard continue to play significant role i n bosnia particularly in the army and the air force about 16000 army reservist s and 10000 air force reservi sts have participated in or supported bosnia operations while most of the army personnel have been involuntarily activated under th presidential reserve call up authority 10 usc sec 12304 most of the air force personnel have been volunteers one notable change in the sfor force structure has been the addition of th multinational specialized unit msu created in response to us initiative the msu is comp osed of about 600 paramilitary police they are to serve as tw battalio n rapid response force to deal with outbreaks of civil violence thereb relieving sfor combat troops of the responsibility of dealing with relatively low level crowd violence unlike the existing international police task force n unarmed trainingobserver group the msu is armed with automatic weapons and light armored vehicles they are under nato command and are authorized to deploy throughout bosnia tactical command of their activities will fall to th nato sector headquarters in which they are operating currently italy an d argentina are contributing personnel to the msu and talks are underway with spain poland the czech republic hungary and the netherlands concerning thei r participation in early 1999 the united states is unlikely to contribute to this unit because it has comparable paramilitary police forces perhaps the most critica l role for the msu will be working to assist the safe return of refugees to their

the administration and forwarded to congress in the presidents report n bosnia operations as required by the fy1998 defense authorization act house document 105223 they are divided into two categories key military tasks and key supportin g tasks with latter to be undertaken depending upon available means and capabilities key military tasks maintaining deterrence of renewed hostilities preventing removal of weapons from cantonment maintaining the operation of the joint military commissions ensuring force protection freedom of movement and continued complianc with the ceasefire and zones of separation monitoring the military components of the dayton accords and if required enforcing compliance controlling the airspace over bosnia contributing within means an d capabilities and in manner similar to sfors previous approach to secure environment within which civi l implementation can continue key supporting tasks supporting the high representative supporting phased and orderly returns of refugees by contributing to saf and secure environmen t but not forcible returning of refugees or undertaking to guard individual locations supporting the conduct of elections and the installation of elected officials supporting the international police task force in assisting local police b providing backup support and secure operating environment but withou t undertaking civil police tasks

implementing the regional arms control regime contained in the dayton accords supporting the implementation of the brcko decisions presently in effect contributing to the co ntinued improvement of

incidents of civil violence or the pursuit of war crimes suspects on what often appeared to some observers as ver conservative interpretation of their mission nato commanders focused almost exclusively on separating and disarming the ethnic faction armies with these tasks accomplished and facing increasing pressure to acknowledge that the dayton accords civil implementatio n efforts required greate r level of nato military support sfor commanders began to play more active role in 1997 upon assuming command nato saceur gen wesley clark played leading role in increasing sfors participation in nonmilitary stabilizatio n activities this trend wa s reinforced when it began to be evident that nato would not withdraw its forces w ith the expiration of the original sfor mandate in june 1998 in considerin g the extension of the deployment the question of mission duration was paramount ther had been considerable criticism of ifor and sfors fixed deadlines noting that those i n bosnia who opposed the accords were encouraged by these withdrawal deadlines to simply wait it out rather than cooperate even strong critics of us openended commitment s who had supported fixed dates for withdrawal objected to politically palatable deadlines that then came and were facto ignored as operations continued under new mandates and names in response to these and other criticisms nato political leaders decided in jun 1998 that sf or should have date certain for withdrawal rather its withdrawal would depend upon the ext ent of progress made in implementing the dayton accords with specific benchmarks of progress outlined and semiannual force requirement evaluations mandated the nato allies formally approved these benchmarks see p 12 and the sfo r operation plan call for sfor to develop in coordination with international civilia n agencies criteria to evaluate progress in addition sfor headquarters is also preparin g estimates of how long it will take to achieve each benchmark nato saceur gen wes clark expects sfor to report the criteria and timelines in september the administration has affirmed that it will in turn provide this report to congress with the decision to e3 length of deployment to the civil implementation of the dayton accords it has becom incumbent upon nato military commanders to pay greater attention to the supportin g tasks the s ooner these are accomplished the sooner sfor forces will be reduced r withdrawn this change has however heightened concerns that tying sfor s duration to success ful civil implementation could result in very lengthy deployment given th continued animosity among ethnic groups and while casualties have been extremely low 4 the financial costs for bosniarelated operations since 1992 have totaled an estimated 9 4 billion through fy1999 presenting significant challenges to both lawmakers and do d5 officials in period of budgetary restraint the concept of mission creep is one that has attracted much attention the term i s generally accepted to refer to the incremental broadening of mission objectives and th addition of mission tasks to point where they move beyond the original purpose of th operation or deployment this concern comes to the fore primarily when costs either in dollars or us casualties are significant or when an operation is judged failure often cited is the experience in somalia in 1993 where what began as humanitarian aid escor t mission escalated over time into combat search and capture raids against local factio nhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97475crs9 us cancels plans for raid on bosnia new york times july 26 1998 p 1 hunt6 for karadzic time august 10 1998 p 68leaders the highly pu blicized failure of one of these raids in which us forces sustained 18 comba t fatalities brought strong criticism of the administration for allowing suc h mission creep to occur and led to the withdrawal of us troops the issue was of s concern du ring recent us operations in haiti where armed opposition was encountered and costs were relatively lower while the last two and half years of nato operations in bosnia have seen n escalation to combat indeed iforsfor have been remarkable for the lack of casualtie s attributabl to hostile action the emphasis of sfor activities has undeniably changed i t can be argued that sfor has not experienced mission creep but has simply shifted it s focus from primary to secondary tasks of the original mission statement nevertheless the types of activiti sfor troops are undertaking and the level of resources dedicated to them have altered over the last year perhaps the most notable change has been the increased efforts to detain war crime s suspects though approximately 30 suspects remain at large out of 67 as of april 1998 british dutch and us troops have been noticeably more active in detaining or capturin g individuals for transfer to the international war crimes tribunal and this activity has been credited with in turn encouraging other suspects to surrender voluntarily on july 29 th however press r eports indicated that usbritish plans to seize the two most important war crimes indictees former bosnia serb president karadzic and military leader gen mladic have been suspended owing to lack of cooperation by french militar command ers and us commanders concerns about potential civilian and militar casualties there appears therefore to be some continued selflimiting by nat o6 commanders in this area of activity one of the more challenging mission areas for both civil and military authorities is the safe resettlement of refugees in regions of continued ethnic tension yet this task is critical to the overall success of the dayton accords even the new mission statement of sfo r notes limits to t he extent to which sfor will become involved see key supporting tasks above to assist in this task nato has created and placed under sfor command th paramilita ry police multinational special unit msu this unit is expected to serve as rapid reaction force to deal with incidents of lowlevel violence and crowd disturbances thereby freeing sfor combat troops from these responsibilities though the creation of the msu was us initiative the united states has paramilitary police to contribute to the unit consequently any escalation of msu activities that occur will not involve us personnel in general it appears that nato officials and us officials in particular whil accepting some greater responsibilities in civil activities are remaining sensitive to the issue of mission cre ep they are likely to have to continue to balance the desire to accelerat implementation of the dayton accords with concerns over increased combat troo p involvement in noncombat roles particularly within the us

administration policy on sfor part of the clinton administrations early strategy on the nato force in bosnia was to focus on the force completing its mission within set time frame until th implementation forces 12month mission was nearly completed the administratio n avoided making any firm pronouncements on possible successor missions to ifor r possible us participation in such mission emphasizing rather ifors schedule d completion and full withdrawal by the end of 1996 throughout that year administratio n officials had reiterated the presidents pledge to keep the us troop commitment to ifo r to about one year administration officials acknowledged the probable need for some sor t of international military presence to remain in bosnia after ifor but would not commit to position on us participation on november 15 1996 president c linton announced that the united states would take part in nato followon force in bosnia he estimated that the us troop contributio n to the successor sfor would amount to about 8500 troops or less than half the number of us troops in the original ifor he recommended an 18month mandate for the nat force with further reductions envisaged at sixmonth review intervals natos late r decision s formally establishing sfor upheld these principles the principal rationale fo r continued us military engagement in bosnia developed by the administration was that notwithstanding the many achievements of ifor peace efforts in bosnia still neede d additional time to consolidate an outside security force would be able to provide th stability for economic reconstruction and political reconciliation to continue administration analysts assessed that hostilities were likely to resume in bosnia after full withdrawal of international forces at the same time the administration rejected simple extension of ifors mandate instead it emphasized that ifor had indeed completed its mission within 12 months an d that the stabilization force and its mission were distinct from ifor the administratio n differentiated sfor from ifor in response to charges that it had broken its promise f completing ifors mission in 12 months president clinton also made the claim that th sfor mission was far more limited than ifors thus requiring fewer troops plans t steadily reduce the forces size indicated that sfor was expected to do less rather tha n more than ifor as it turned out nato refrained from drawing down sfor force levels during its 18month tenure already in early 1997 some administration officials began to offer predictions tha t another successor force may well be required to follow sfor after june 1998 in contrast defense secretary william cohen strenuously emphasized the firmness of th administrations commitmen t of us troops to sfor for 18 months only secretary cohen stated that he would pursue the possibility of having the europeans develop postsfo r operation many observers expressed skepticism about this

parties the senate approved an amendment by senator hutchison expressing the sense of congress that declining defense budgets and expanded missions including the ongoing openended commitment of us forces to bosnia have eroded the readiness of us forces to execute the national security strategy of the united states congressional debate president clintons announcement in december 1997 that us troops would sta in bosnia until selfsustaining peace takes hold has sparked congressional debate many members have expressed co ncern that us troops are engaged in an openended deployment to bosnia with an everexpanding mandate they say that the benchmarks laid out by th administration are very broad in scope and will take many years to achieve if they can b achieved at all many members favor pullout of us ground troops from bosnia in th relatively near future turning the bosnia mission over to the uss european nato allies with the united states providing logistical intelligence and other support many members have also expressed concern that the bosnia mission was absorbing limited dod funds that should go toward such areas as research and development readiness and weapon s procurement while mos t members have expressed strong desire to have us ground troop s leave bosnia in the near future there is more controversy on how to achieve this goal senator carl levin senator john warner and other members have pushed th administration to provide timelines for the achievement of the benchmarks laid out by th ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97475crs16 admini stration and have stressed the need for the administration to press the european s to take over the bosnia mission within reasonable amount of time these ideas wer incorporated in s 1768 which provided fy 1998 supplemental appropriations for th bosnia operation and s 2057 the fy 1999 defense authorization bill other members while supporting these efforts express great skepticism about the concept of the benchmarks saying it is unlikely that it is unwise to tie the withdrawal f us troops t benchmarks that cannot be achieved in the foreseeable future if at all they favor stronger measures to compel us troop reductions these arguments were made b senator byrd and senator hutchison during senate debate on the fy 1999 defens authorization and app ropriations bills however during the debate on the fy 1999 defense authorization bill senator cain said that while he shared the frustration of many members with the open ended nature of the us presence in bosnia he believed that it was the rol of the president as commanderinchief and military commanders in the field to set troo p levels in bosnia not congress in addition to concerns about the wisdom of administration policy in bosnia some members hav expressed constitutional objections to the bosnia mission saying that it was started without explicit congressional authorization and should be terminated unles s congress passes legislation giving specific approval to the bosnia deployment thi s viewpoint was reflected in h res 227 and the craig amendment to the ratification of protocols to the north atlantic treaty while many members emphasize their desire to see pullout of us troops fro m bosnia in the relatively near future some members stress the need for continued us military presence on the ground to ensure that progress continues during debate on s 2057 senator joseph biden said that while he favored pressure on the uss europea n allies on the issue of the bosnia mission it would be mistake to push for the withdrawal of us ground troops from bosnia as long as natoled peacekeeping force remained in the country because such move could undermine us leadership in natohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97475 crs17
