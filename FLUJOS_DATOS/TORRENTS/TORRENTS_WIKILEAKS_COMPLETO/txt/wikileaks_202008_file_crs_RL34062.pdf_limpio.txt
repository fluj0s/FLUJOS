reducing its reliance on fossilbased aviation fuel issues for congress summary the department of defense dod is factor in the nations discussion about national energy security as the largest single consumer of fuel in the united states dod has the potential to make important c ontributions to the national effort to reduce the use of and reliance on fossil fuel aviation fuel makes up the largest portion of fossil fuel consumed by dod and therefore represents the area of greatest potential energy savings this report examines dods use of aviation fuel and possibilities to reduce that use by examining related issues and presenting options congress may choose to consider reducing dods consumption of aviation fuel could by itself significantly reduce the departments overall reliance on fossil fuel in fiscal year 2005 dod consumed roughly 125 million barrels of il approximately 12 of the nations total about 74 of that was used to pow er mobility vehicles air force aircraft navy ships and army ground vehicles ov er half roughly 52 was aviation fuel note aviation fuel is also used in nonaircraft systems such as tanks and generators in order to reduce logistics requirements on the battlefield there are several ways in which dod can reduce its use of fossilbased aviation fuel each has advantages and disadva ntages and single option provides the perfect soluti on advanced tec hnologies such as synthetic fuels offer potential alternatives but further development nd study are required before dod can employ them on large scale dod can also take measures to decrease its use of fuel possible options include upgrading aircra ft engines and modifying operational procedures many of these measures however are costly and must compete for funding with other operational priorities congress also recognizes that dod has ro to play in the nations quest for alternative energy sources langua ge contained in the fy2007 defense authorization and appropria tions acts requires dod to report to congress on their actions to reduce consumption of fossil fuel increase the energy efficiency of their weapon platforms and explore the use of sy nthetic fuel made from coal additional proposed legislation would require dod to further study coal as fuel source and would remove certain dod cont racting restrictions viewed as potential obstacle to synthetic fuel development dod has publically expressed its intention to devote resources to this issue air force leadership has stated goal of using domestically produced synthetic fuel for half of its domestic aviation fuel by 2016 at the present time however dod does not seem to have comprehensive longterm energy strategy or centralized leadership focused on energy issues for the department this may affect the departments

presenting options congress may choose to consider dod the largest single consumer of ener gy in the united states recognizes the need to reduce its reliance on fossil fuel for number of years the department has been making steady progress at decreasing their use of fossil fuels on their installations and in their facilities1 but following the sharp rise in oil prices after hurricane katrina in august 2005 dod ste ppedup its examination of fuel use in weapon systems2 the largest portion of fossil fuel used by dod is in the form of aviation fuel although formulated for use in aircraft

significantly among the different types of aircraft for example the b52h one of the oldest aircraft in the services inventory has maximum takeoff weight of 488000 pounds runs on ei ght tf33 turbine engines and burns approximately 3500 gallons pe r flight hour that is 138 pounds of aircraft for each gallon per hour by contrast the c5b signed with 1980s technology is larger aircraft with four engines has maximum takeoff weight of 769000 pounds and also burns about 3500 gallons per flight hour that is 219 pounds of aircraft for each gallon per houran increase of 59 ove r the b52 capabilities the t38 highperformance jetengine ai rcraft used for training has maximum takeoff weight of 12000 pounds and burns only about 395 gallons per flight hour that is only 30 pounds of aircraft for each gallon per hourmuc h less than either of the above the lower fuel efficiency of the t38 compared to either the b52h or the c5b is reflection of the smaller aircrafts aerody namic

acquisition maintenance and operating costs of an aerial refueling tanker and the crew that flies it the cost of gallon of fuel delivered to an aircraft on flight line is relatively straightforward computation and generally ranges between 2 and 3 per gallon on the other hand the fully burdened cost of gallon of fuel delivered to an aircraft in flight is estimated to be around 20 per gallon1011 the complexity of measuring fuel use and costs for aircraft is one of the many challenges dod has to becoming more efficient user or making other changes in its fuel us such as using alternative fuels studies on dod fuel use as fuel costs rose dod recognized the need to understand factors that contribute to the departments heavy usage and examine ways to mitigate them consequently dod has conducte d or sponsored number of studies in recent years to examine dods fuel use determine the ex tent to which that use is problematic and recommend actions to decrease its use12 two general conclusions seem to emerge from various government studies th first is that there does not appear to be one ideal alternative fuel with which to replace or augment the fossil fuel already although different technologie s are being pursued to varying degrees the second is that there appears to be veral methods currently ava ilable to dod with which it can decrease fuel consumption the earliest comprehensive dod study on fuel use conducted by the defense science board in 2001 focused on the fuel fficiency of weapon systems and was the first to suggest that the true cost of fuel the fully burdened rate was not sufficiently understood by decisionmakers13 two other comprehensive studies werehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34062crs5 13 continued platforms washington dc office of the unde r

unlikely in the near term to hinder dod operations and emphasi zed the value of optimizing the energy efficiency of weapon systems over pursu ing alternative fuels at this time14 the defense task

consulting inc lmi iden tified areas in which dods energy goals are not synchronized with their current pr actices and recommended actions to address the misalignment16 each of these studies is more fully examined below 2001 defense science board task force in 2000 the under secretary of fense acquisition technology and logistics directed the defense science boar d dsb to form task force to examine how dod could improve the fuel efficiency of their weapons systems the task force would also identify institutional barriers that impeded the departments understanding of and ability to capture the full advantages of more fuel efficient systems the task force was not asked to look at possible sources of alternative fuel and they did not address that topic in thei r report they reported five significant findings finding 1 although sign ificant warfighting logistics and cost benefits occur when weapons systems are more fuelefficient these benefits are not valued or emphasized in the dod requirements and acquisition processes when buying new weapons dod placed perfo rmance as its highest priority and seemed to overlook how fuel efficiency could result in improved performance furthermore when developing new systems the department did not seem to take into account how the fuel use of particular sy stem could have farreaching effects on the total force eg systems logistical requirements may create vulnerable delivery chain finding 2 the dod currently prices fuel based on the wholesale refinery price and does not include the cost of delivery to its customers this prevents comprehensive view of fuel utilizatio n in dods decisionmaking does nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34062crs6 17 dsb report pp 3133 18 wargaming as defined by dod is the simulation by wh atever means of military operation involving two or more opposing forces using rules data and procedures designed to depict an actual or assumed real life situation 19 winglets for example are vertical extensions that can be fitted on wingtips to reduce drag the air force recently sponsored study to assess the utility of applying winglets to dod aircraft see page 24 of this report for further information reflect the dods true fuel costs masks energy efficiency benefits and distorts platform design choices the dsb pointed out that overl ooking the true cost of fuel also masks the real benefits of fuel effici ency as consequence fuel efficiency is not regarded as relevant factor in th acquisition of weapon systems or in other logistics related decisions for example in 1997 using an average fuel price of 97 cents the air force estimated that reengining the b52h would generate savings of just unde r 400 million over 40 years based on that calculation the service concluded that retrofitting was not costeffective the dsb reworked the equation using an average fuel cost of 150 per ga llon the board estimated that 10 of the fuel would be delivered via aerial refu eling at cost of 1750 per gallon and calculated savings of 17 billion17 finding 3 dod resource allocation and accounting processes the planning programming and budgeting system ppbs dod comptroller do not reward fuel efficiency or penalize inefficiency the task force found that dod interest in fuel efficiency had been mainly limited to meeting goals established by legislation or executive order since those goals mainly applied to installations including their nonwarfighting vehicles th ere was little incentive to improve the fuel efficiency of weapon systems add itionally the department had way to quantifyand therefore valuethe be nefits of conserving fuel finding 4 operational and logistics wargaming18 involving fuel requirements are not crosslinked to the service requirements development or acquisition program processes the task force found that in dod combat simulation exercises each military rvice emphasized mission execution while adequate fuel supplies were considered c onstant dsb asserted that doing so left dod unaware of the potential effects of fuel efficiency on combat operations and of the vulnerability of the fuel supply chain furthermore with model of efficient or inefficient fuel use dod could not analyze fuel relate d logistical requirements as part of the acquisition process finding 5 high payoff fueleffici ent technologies are available now to improve warfighting effectiveness in current weapon systems through retrofit and in new systems acquisition the task force found that there were existing technologies that could increase weapon syst ems fuel efficiency however without the tools to analyze the collective benefits of fuel efficiency to warfighting capability the value of improvement s could be misjudged and not fully appreciated19httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34062crs7 20 jason report pp 17 76 81 21 dod task force overview of findings p 4jason report jason an independent sc ientific advisory group for dod was asked by the director defense research and engineering ddre to assess ways in which dod could reduce its demand for fossil fuel using advanced technology including alternative energy sources the group was asked specifically not to conduct detailed analysis of us air force fuel use the jason report contained three relevant findings finding 1 dod fuel costs though high represent only about 253 of the dod budget and should not be primary decision driver at present jason determined that other fuel related issues such as lifecycle costs of weapon systems and the supply chain in terms of both money and human life were more significant and compelling factors but that th cost of fuel may become significant issue in the future they further noted that the number of air force aircraft the largest source of fuel consumption in dod is expected to decline significantly in the next several decades which should result in corresponding d ecrease in fuel use20 finding 2 although revolutionary opti ons in weapon system design exist in their early stages the technologies that currently promise the most significant fuel savings are lightweighting and modernizing diesel engines jason saw little use at the present for most alterna tive ground vehicle designs such as hybrids allelectric or fuelcell vehicles in the case of the first two military use patterns would not allow optimal use of the technolog ies in the case of fuelcells jason found that the technology was not sufficiently mature and that there was not good way to transport hydrogen to theater jason suggested lightweighting vehicles by decreasing the weight of manned vehicles and using more unmanned vehicles jason recommended upgrading the gas turbine engine in the army m1 abrams tanks to modern diesel and th at the army in particular install fuel consumption tracking devices in vehicl the resulting data will allow dod to gauge use patterns and provide data with which to make informed decisions on engine selections and optimal efficiency finding 3 the department of defe nse uses less than 2 of the oil consumed in the united states and is therefore not large enough consumer to drive the market for conventional or alternative fuels jason and others have suggested that finding substitutes for fossil fuels must be national endeavor according to dod it uses roughly 340000 ba rrels of oil day whereas the daily consumption rate for the united states is approximately 21 million barrels21 dod agrees that it plays significant role in testing certification and demonstrating the use of synthetic jet fuel but is not rge enough consumer to drive the market httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34062crs8 22 stranded natural gas is natural gas that has been discovered but not recovered because it was not economically or physically feasible to do so 23 jason report p 87jason contended that in the search for alternative fuels the most economical and environmentally sound method is to us fischertropsch technology to produce liquid fuel from stranded natural gas22 they further reported that ethanol was not suitable as dod fuel due to its low energy density and high flammability23 dod energy security task force in spring 2006 former secretary of fense donald rumsfeld formed dod task force with fourpart charter 1 examine the issue of energy security 2 devise plan for lowering dods fossil fu requirements 3

creati on of new dod energy strategy lmi identified three areas where dods current pr actices were not aligned with its stated energy goals recommended three main acti ons that dod needed to take in order to address the misalignments nd provided other energy re lated options that could enable dod to improve their cor porate energy related processes the three areas of strategic operational and fiscal considerations lmi identified where dods practices and stated ener gy goals produced some friction and limitations were as follow 1 strategic dods dependence on foreig n supplies of fuel limits its flexibility in dealing with certain producer nations 2 operational dod seeks greater mob ility persistence and agility for its forces but the energy requirements of its forces limits the departments ability to attain those things and 3 fiscal dod seeks to reduce the operating costs of its forces and of future procurements but increased energy c onsumption and increased prices are causing energy associated operating costs to grow the three actions lmi recommended dod take to address the areas noted bove were as follow 1 incorporate energy considerations energy use and energy logistics support requirements in the departments ke corporate decision making strategic planning analytic agenda joint concept and joint capability development acquisition and planning programming

aviation fuels presentation by william harrison senior advisor assured fuels initiative us department of defense4 make reducing energy vulnerability focus area of the next strategic planning cycle and quadrennial defense review reducing the use of petroleumbased aviation fuel the government sponsored reports seem to indicate with limited exceptions that dod should consider various options for reducing its reliance on fossil fuels aviation fuel in particular is viewed as primary target of that reduction as it accounts for the largest share of fuel cons umed by the depar tment generally dod has several available methods for decreasing its use of petroleumbased aviation fuel they can be placed in two categories 1 increasing the use and supply of alternative fuels and 2 decreasing the dema nd for petroleumbased fuel in the first category options include pr oducing synthetic fuel from coal natural gas and biomass as well as hydrogen fuel cells in the second category dod can use various existing technologies to increas the fuelefficiency of weapon systems and modify operating procedures and polices to use less fuel all the options have limitations and none provide perfect solution whether it is more prudent to aggressively pursue alternative fuels or concentrate resources on decreasing the departments fuel demand is matter of debate there are many who suggest that dod can spur the development of viable domestic coaltoliquid industry others ggest that developing such an industry would contribute to carbon emissions and divert funds from the development of alternative fuels produced from renewable s ources as well as from efforts to increase the fuelefficiency of wea pon systems the following is discussion of the most frequently cited options increasing alternative fuel use alternative fuels are often divided into two categories synthetic fuels derived from nonrenewable sources such as coal and natural gas and biofuels produced from renewable feedstocks such as corn suga r cane and prairie grasses both offer advantages and disadvantages as substitutes for petroleumbased fuel an issue that may affect dods search fo r alternative fuels is the departments desire for single battlespace fuel cu rrently there are seven to nine different types of fuel used in theater25 ultimately dod would like there to be just one in part to decrease risks associated with the elaborate and vulnerable fuel delivery system now in place however that ma be several years away although dod has been exploring the use of synthetic fuel for aircraft there is indication that dod is actively pursuing alternative fuels for battlefield ground vehicles there is speculation that this is due to the difficulty of altering the current logistical systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34062crs11

that produces liquid hydrocarbons eg synthetic jet fuel and other usable products such as diesel fuel alcohol and lubricants car bon dioxide and water are byproducts of the fischertropsch process 28 on april 12 2005 in testimony before the senate energy and natural resources committee mr mark maddox principal deput assistant secretary for fossil energy department of energy stated it was estimat ed in the early 1980s that the united states contains approximately 18 trillion barrels wo rth of oil shale approximately 300 billion of which is readily accessible the oil shale is concentrated primarily in utah colorado and wyoming in alberta canada oil is produced from oil sands at rate of over 1 million barrels per day the rate of production is expected to exceed 2 million barrels per day

and biodiesel4950 pros many cite as one of the advantages of biofuel that the feedstocks are renewable also unlike synthetic fuel from coal and natural gas biofuel can theoretically be carbon neutral that is the carbon dioxide emitted during the burning of biofuel is offset by the car bon dioxide consumed during the feedstocks growth however current production thods involve the use of some carbon emitting sources which detracts fro m the claim of carbon neutrality cons in its present state of technologi cal development the energy density of biofuel is too low to make it suitable substitute for

for example is four times the volume of conventional fuel either carrying capacity on the ship for hydrogen fuel would need to be expanded four times especially difficult on ship s that are already space restrictedor the ship would have to refuel four times as often also since hydrogen is highly flammable there is practical way at the present time to carry it aboard ship similar obstacles preclude its use as an aviation fuel60 trash to gas current research indicates potential way to convert solid waste at deployed dod locations into fu source power demands of todays military basecamps

technologies vary in efficiency rates and range from incinerationthe l east efficient conversion methodto pyrolysis which is the chemical decomposition of organic matter and has an efficiency rate of

geerlightweighting light weight composite materials could greatly increase the fuel efficiency of all dod plat forms lighter vehicles can travel faster on less fuel in one effort to lightweight dod is strivi ng for lowcost titanium alloy to replace the heavy steel used in many weapon system s titanium is valued for military applications because of its high streng thtoweight ratio and its resistance to corrosion at approximately 30 per pound titanium alloys are too costly for largescale military applications and are generally reserved for select aviation and space applications darpa is sponsoring program to devel op an environmentally friendly production capability for titanium alloy under 4 per pound72 another way to reduce fuel consump tion is to use more unmanned aerial vehicles uav which are inherently light er than manned vehicles the absence of an operator precludes the necessity of incl uding on an aircraft many elements that increase its weight including added protective armor seating communications and other lifesustaining equipment73 pros uavs are becoming increasingly sought after by dod for surveillance activities since they preclude having to put service member in danger and are low cost relative to the manned systems cons uav provide dod with several dvanced capabilities however they are less than universally applicable as many operations still call for the judgement and flexibility of onscene human operators increase landing weights dod policy dictates maximum takeoff and landing weight for all aircraft based on their individual structural limitations the weight for takeoff and landing may be the same or an aircrafts landing weight may be less than that with wh ich it may take off the kc135 refueling tanker has one of the most restrictive landing weight re quirements in the air force fleet if kc135 approaches landing too heavy the crew must rid the aircraft of excess fuel by either continuing to fly or by releasing it from the aircraft while inflight the air force recently by changing their policy increased the safe landing weight of kc135 thus allowing it to keep more fuel onboard when it lands however changing the landing weight is only an ava ilable options for some aircraft the c5 for example one of the heavier fuel users in the air force fleet has the same take off and landing weight negating the need to get rid of excess fuel weight pros simply changing policy to negate the need to discard excess fuel is an expedient way to save there may be ot her weapon systems for which similar re evaluation can be made cons by simply changing policy to allow an aircraft to land with more weight the air force has accepted greater risk to the aircraft and its crew the service has evidently made the decision that the greater risk is within acceptablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34062crs21 74 headquarters united states ai r force a35 staff af aviation operations january 22 2007 3 75 distance flown out and backlimits however the longterm affects of the added wear and tear to the aircraft are unknown at this time more direct flights using the most direct routes between points means flying shorter distances and burning less fuel however conditions such as military overflight restrictions imposed by some foreign governments may prevent dod from using the most direct route between destinations the air force is reviewing flight paths and reevaluating where it may be able to use more direct routes the service has claimed that by doing so it saved 46 million in fiscal year 200674 pros saving fuel by eliminating unnece ssary miles seems to one of the more simple efficiency measures it requires modification to the aircraft and can be put in place wherever applicable regardless of the weapon system involved it therefore makes sense to employ this method of costsaving wherever possible cons routing aircraft on more direct flights may seem uncomplicated in theory but in practice other factors may make shortening routes less than optimally efficient circuitous routes may use more fuel than dir ect ones but circuitous flights may take advantage of other efficiencies for example particular route structure though perhaps circuitous may exist to transport people and materiel between military locations and thus negate the need for multiple direct routes between points furthermore direct routes may not always be possible due to weather and changes in diplomatic relations betw een the united states and other governments relocate aircraft aircraft stationed close to the front lines require less fuel to reach the battlefield than those stationed at distance with fuel savings as consideration the air force repos itioned b1 bombers supporting military operations in iraq from base in diego garcia to udeid air base in saudi arabia assuming an approximate flying distance saved as 2400 nautical miles an approximate cruising rate of 450 nautical miles per hour and fuel usage rate of 3874 gallons per flying hour the move save s over 40000 gallons of fuel per sortie75 pros moving aircraft closer to the front lines is another way to decrease fuel use with out the expense of modifying ai rcraft and may be pplied to number of weapon systems fewer miles flown may so eliminate the need for refueling thus saving the cost of fuel and flying hour s involved in the tanker refueling mission cons in some cases relocating aircraft may be costly it may require changes to basing infrastructure and movement of personnel and accompanying support structure additionally the cost to lease space may increase other less tangible factors may also come into play such as the diplomatic and strategic value of maintaining military installati on in particular country or region despite its distance from the front linehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34062crs22 76 af aviation operations 3 77 see gao06830 contract management service c ontract approach to aircraft simulator training has room for

reassessed the number of time certain air force wings needed to rotate and concluded that fewer rotations would not adversely th eir ability to support combat operations pros for some air force wings keeping the aircraft in theater longer while rotating personnel is an expedient way to cons erve fuel and aircraft flying hours cons one of the reasons aircraft get rota ted back to the united states is for scheduled maintenance at large logistics centers located here in rapidly aging fleet routine maintenance becomes increasingly important furthermore the climate and environmental factors present in the current theater of operations causes intense wear and tear increasing their need for upkeep it is also worth pointing out that for some flying disciplines flights between the forw ard bases and the perm anent bases in the united states is not all wasted time those flights may in some cases be used to accumulate flight training hours needed by pilo ts to remain proficie nt in their aircraft

acting as the coordinator for the task force continuedcons any time aircraft are taken out of the fleet for retrofitting it is an additional expense and takes an aircraft out of commission for period of time furthermore it is possible that the cost of the research and development of winglets combined with their installation may be more than the actual savings other other strategies may further redu ce fuel use one borrowed from the commercial aviation industry is to remove extraneous weight such as unnecessary or redundant gear and provisions another strategy is to instill awareness in the operational community of the necessity of using fuel smartly in fall 2006 air force leadership communicated to its flying units the importance of adopting fuelsaving culture and the services goal of reducing aviation fuel consumption by 10 over the next five years pros removing excess items from aircraft and promoting fuelsaving within the department are costeffective measures that are relatively easy to implement cons redundancy in potentially dangerous situations is not by itself negative commercial airlines have taken efforts to minimize the weight of their aircraft in order to conserve fuel and increase profits the military is not concerned with profits but with ensuring the safety of its crew members maintaining healthy supply of safety and other equipment onboard airc raft may reduce risk and increase the survivability of the crew and although instilling fuelsaving awareness in dod personnel is worthy endeavor the extent to which individua l operators will make difference

strategy for energy initia tives likely reflects the departments placement of energy in its priorities according to ddre 18 billion of dods fy2007 fy2011 budget is intended for energy related projects86 some may argue that 18 billion over five years is small portion of researc h development test and evaluation budget that received appr oximately 755 billion in just the fy2007 defense appropriations act p l 109289 however othe rs might contend that in the currently tight defense budget envi ronment limiting the amount spent on future concepts is prudent decision as re sult funding for energy efficiency and alternative fuel initiatives may continue to fall behind other priorities without departmentwide strategy that outlines goal s and places energy within larger set of dod priorities if dod chooses not to allocate funding to energyrelated research congress may elect to legislate certain funding stra tegies for example legislation proposed in january 2007s154 s155 and hr370 see appendix for relevant legislative language would provide 10000000 to th air force research laboratory to continue the testing qualification and proc urement of synthetic jet aviation fuel from coal external expectations another issue is the degree to which dod can take on an energy leadership role in the federal government uncertainly regarding dods role in government energy strategy may contribute to the departments seeming reluctance to lay out its own strategy and committing the necessary resources and organizational structure to carrying it out some outside dod seem to view it as potential leader in the effort to develop and use alternative form s of energy particul arly synthetic fuel87 although dods fuel purchasing power is sm all relative to the collective purchasinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34062crs27 88 the honorable michael wynne secretary of the air force address air force energy forum arlington va 8 march 2007 mr wynne stated that the buying power of the commercial airlines constitutes approximately 85 of the market 89 for example see james bernstein pow erful mission at congressmans behest li defense contractors agree to seek alternative fuels

of the commerc ial aviation industry88 the departments tradition of being technologically forwardthinking is fre quently cited as basis for expecting leadership in the energy arena as well89 however dod seems to eschew attempts to impose upon it role beyond facilitatora catalyst for the development of new technologies testbed and potential market when questioned by the house armed subcommittees on terrorism unconventional threats and capabilities and readiness regarding dods role in developing new technologies for alternative fuels dod witnesses consistently responded in language that drew clear boundaries around dods role90 mr john young ddre so across the board i think the department is partner with other agencies in the government and the commercial industry which is helping to drive this space and push the technology forward both on revolutionary spaces and then in areas where we see or evolutionary spaces and then places where we see chances at revolution mr philip grone dusd ie so i do think theres synergy between activities of the department activities of the broader federal family and industry both in research and development and the actual application of the technologies the vehicles where we can have an effect on understanding and ultimately of markets in terms of demonstrating the viability of certain technologies mr michael aimone deputy chief of staff air force installations logistics and mission support the air force has the ability to certify fuel for aviation airworthiness mr richard connell director desc i think its the role of the services and the department dod to give us desc the go ahead and the operational supply chain manager to go ahead and mo ve forward in these markets you did mention mr chairman earlier the percentage of domestic consumption internationally that translates to some thing less than onehalf of one percent of total fuel consumed so while we are probably the biggest single purchaser of fuel in the world and certainly voice to be heard in the marketplace were not going to move the market but we can try to exhibit some leadership within dod the air force is viewed as being on the frontline in the development of alternative aviation fuel the service has received much attention for its initiative to test and certify synthetic fuel blend in its b52 but even as it continues to announce its intention to acqui re 50 of its domestically purchased fuelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34062crs28 91 wynne address to the air force energy forum 8 march 2007 92 civil aviation gets green lightby marion c

and later acknowledging dods 2016 goal added and i want secretary wy nne and all of you to know that the commercial side will be right there with you92 options for congress considering the issues discussed there appear to be at least six options for congress these potential options may be mutually reinforcing and not eitheror options mandate the establishment of an dod office of energy security dods progress in energy security may be enhanced with clearer lines of authority currently different offices within dod share responsib ility for the departments various energy related initiatives the office of the director defense research and engineering seems to have ta ken on something of leadership role but notwithstanding its leadership of the dod task force on energy security ddres mission is to ensure that the warfighters today and tomorrow have superior and affordable technology to support their missi ons and to give them revolutionary war winning capabilities93 its mission does not encompass many other possible aspects of energy strategy such as acquisitions installations finances and operations on the other hand it may be argued that dding another layer of bureaucracy is unnecessary when functions are already in place to handle individual issues there are also those who express concern that enthusiasm for recent energy initiatives will wane once sense of urgency regarding energy availability and prices has subsided without dedicated dod focal point to ensure consistent progress of the various energy related activities within the department this concern may have some merit in light of the financial demands put on dod by ongoing operations it is possible that without dedicated advo cate funding for energy related initiatives may be discontinued or post poned indefinitely conversely others argue that the nature of todays energy crisis is unlike that which faced the nation in the 1970s and 1980s information available today re

systems and established the requirement for report to congress on the departments progress toward that goal guidance concerning specific weapon systems was not provided allowing dod to implement the language at their discretion possible complication to this may be the continual deliberations over the most costeffective way to spread finite fense acquisition budget some contend that updating the oldest and largest of the air force inventory such as the b52 would save the most fuel according to the rocky mountain institute reengining one of the bombers would make it 35 more efficient95 others assert that modernizing more heavily used aircraft such as the c5 transporters makes more sense in reality neither the b52 nor the c5 are likel to be upgraded soon prattwhitney manufacturer of the b52hs tf33 engines has proposed engine upgrades to the air force but the service has thus far declined the offer96 c5 aircraft are currently the center of debate over the relative costeffectiveness of upgrading the large transporter versus purchasing smaller but more versatile c17s the air force has expressed desire to retire some older c5s while others feel that the need for large transporter compels the service to modernize the aircraft and maintain it in the inventory modernization of the c5 centers on overall aircraft reliability and not specifically energy efficiency mandate fuel

this may be first step to modifying acqui sition guidelines if dod modifies its acquisition policies in such manner future evaluations of ai rcraft proposals could be based on the fully burdened cost of fuel leading to closer examination of aspects of the aircraft eg maintenance costs weight in addition to engine efficiency amend title 10 to allow dod to enter into contracts for synthetic fuel beyond five years sixth option for congress is to pass legislation that would grant dod the authority to enter into contract for fuel for more than five years recent proposed congressional legislation s 154 s 155 nd hr 370 would allow dod to enter into contracts for synthetic fuels for up to 25 years this option may make it possible for dod through lengthy contracts to pr ovide potential synthetic fuel developers an incentive to invest in this capital in tensive venture on the other hand the proposed legislation would not mandate that dod use this contracting option and the department may not

synthetic fuel it intends to use recent tests with fischertropsch gastoliquid gtl fu might lead one to believe dod is targeting coal or gasbased synthetic fuel for its future purchases an approach that would likely invite opposition from those w ho object to ctl and gtl plants because of their carbon emissions however dod has also awarded contract for the development of synthetic aviation biofuel which may eventually prove successful enough to make mandate for the use of fu from renewable sources viable option possible drawback to synthetic fuel mandate is that domestically produced alternative fuels may not be available for seve ral years the high cost of constructing the plants and the unresolved issue of how to address carbon emissions from them are two possible limitations the fact that biofuels are not currently compatible with jet aircraft engines is another issue further it is unclear that sufficient quantities of biofuel could be

notes that initiatives such as reengining aircraft modifying inflight profiles and revising aircraft ground operations cont ribute to decreased fuel consumption and increased lifecycle savings the committee is aware that winglet technolog exists for aircra ft to increase fuel efficiency improve takeoff performance increase cruise altitudes and increase payload and range capability the committee notes that winglets are currently used on commercial aircraft and result in five to seven percent increase in fuel efficiency on september 16 1981 the national aer onautics and space administration released the kc 135 winglet program review on the incorporation of winglets for kc135 aeria l refueling aircraft however the air force concluded that the cost of adding winglets to the kc135 did not provide sufficient payback in fuel savings or increased range to justify modification although the air force did conclude that modifying aircraft with winglets could increase fuel efficiency the air force determined that reengining the kc135 aircraft produced greater return on investment the committee believes that incorporating winglets on military aircraft could increase fuel efficiency on certain platforms and that the air force should reexamine incorporating this technology onto its platforms httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34062crs36 therefore the committee directs the secr etary of the air
