and paperbased payments systems consist of the various means buyers and sellers use to tr ansfer monetary value among themselves electronic payments have been playing critical role on the wholesale side of the payments system for decades trillions of dollars pe r day have been transferred routinely and securely through the wholesale payments system among parties such as banks corporations the federal reserve the department of the treasury and other government agencies more recently electronic payment technologies have migrated to the retail side of the system to households and individuals in retail however the most popular methods of paym ent remain the more costly paperbased cash and check payments in 2000 by one estimate paperbased transactions accounted for twothirds of all consumer payments despite the promise of cost savings and convenience nevertheless the volume of electronic retail payments has increased more rapidly during the last decade the increase in the volume of electronic payments using credit and debit cards grew from 14 of total consumer transactions in 1990 to 31 in 2000 still by 2010 consumers w ill still be making about 50 of their payments with paper according to th nilson report an industry publication with the great majority of wholesal banking transactions institution to institution being c onducted electronically the cost savings and convenience of electronic payments are normal part of wholesale banking major step towards widespread electronic retail payments was the evolution of the automated clearing house ach system to process wholesale and retail payments the prevalent deployment of automated teller machines atms and pointofsale pos terminals has supported the progress the intern et and other technologies have also encouraged the use of electronic ba nking by individuals and households the migration of electronic banking to th retail side of the payments system raises concerns about whether current laws and regulations will adequately cover new technologies and new paym ent methods current statutes address consumer protections in financial tr ansactions involving cred it cards and electronic funds transfer the regulatory agencies have focused on fostering safety and soundness while minimizing their intrusion into the innovation process so as to allow the marketplace flexibility for product developm ent in november of 2001 federal regulators jointly issued report ma ndated by law pl 106102 that reviews regulations affecting the deliv ery of financial products nd services including online

introduction the payments system consists of the various means buyers and sellers use to transfer monetary value among themselves electronic banking has played critical role on the wholesale side of the payments system for decades trillions of dollars per day have been transferred routinely nd securely through the wholesale payment system between parties such as the federa l reserve the department of the treasury other government agencies as well as financial institutions and corporations now this technology has migrated to the retail side of the system to households and individuals where the most popular met hods of payment remain paperbased cash and checks electronic delivery of financial services provides the promise of cost savings and convenience the vast majority of wholesale payment transactions are conducted electronically the cost savings and conve nience of electronic pa yments are normal part of wholesale operations however th ere remains strong reliance on traditional paperbased methods by individuals and hous eholds in the united states based on one estimate in 2000 cash and checks still accounted for 65 of total consumer payment transactions at the same time the volume of electronic retail payments has increased rapidly during the last decade the increase in the volume of card transactions including credit debit and storedvalue grew from 14 of total consumer payments in 1990 to 306 in 2000 according to the same estimate1 congressional interest in new technologies developm ents in electronic banking and changes to the payments system has been expressed mainly through oversight rather than legislation c ongress has held number of hearings on specific issues of concern and what actions might ensure orderly development2 most of the laws protecting consumer financial transac tions were passed in the 1960s and 1970s these laws addressed credit cards and ectronic funds transfer more recently congress passed legislation to facilitate the use of electronic financial services and products the debt collection improveme nt act of 1996 p l 104134 requires federal payments other than irs refunds to be made by electronic funds transferhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31476crs2 in the grammleachbliley act of 1999 p l106102 congress addressed the issue of privacy and safeguarding customer information the act also required four regulatory agencies feder reserve federal deposit insurance corporation office of the comptroller of currency and office of thrift supervision to conduct study of banking regulations regarding the deliver of financial products and services the act also required that the regulators report on recommendations on adapting existing legislative or regulatory requirements to online banking and lending in 2000 the electronic signatures in global and national commerce ac t of 2000 pl 106229 was enacted to facilitate the use of electronic records and signatures the federal financial regulators operate on the belief that the marketplace will provide the flexibility needed for the evolution of retail payment systems the regulators have closely monitored electronic banking activities to ensure the safety and soundness of financia l institutions in general th regulators have been trying to hold electronic payments products to ex isting consumer prot ections and revising the regulatory standards of the paperbased payments system to meet electronic banking operations this report provides framework for understanding the paperbased and electronic components of the cu rrent us payments system it begins with basic overview of the payments system explaining the relative size and growth of various methods of payment the report discusse s paperbased payments and then examines the operations of wholesale and retail ectronic payments finally the report discusses some of the major policy issues concerning the regulation and supervision of electronic payments the us payments system an overview trillions of dollars through billions of payments between consumers businesses and governments are conducted each year in the united states the us payments system participants and opera tions are often divided into two broad categories wholesale and retail the whol esale systems transfer funds often large value payments for financial institutions corporations and government agencies moreover wholesale operations are almo st totally electronic the number of transactions is largest on the retail side but these are generally smaller dollar value transactions currency coins and paper checks still dominate retail payments electronic transfers of funds through both traditional systems g credit and debit cards and new systems eg smart cards and internet banking have had an increasingly important part in retail payments estimates of the total monetary value of the transactions in the payments system and the exact number of them vary consid erably among different sources the data are usually gathered through surveys conduc ted at irregular intervals using different methods us government agencies regularly collect data on the payments system the federal reserve plans to commission regular payment systems surveys as followups to its survey for 2000 see below recently for regulatory purposes it has become more critical to have accurate and consistent estima tes of the different modes of payment without better estimates of the grow th of electronic paymentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31476crs3 3a snapshot of the retail payments system re search results from the federal reserve federal reserve system november 2001 21p 4 jennifer kingson checks may be losing dominance the american banker november 14 2001 p 2 5 the nilson report figures are considerably smaller than the federal reserve commissioned study the nilson estimates are based on consumer expenditures data while the fed studys estimates are based on survey of banking institutions transaction data see consumer payment system the nilson report issue 753 dec 2001 p 5 which has rapidly changed the mix of electronic and paperbased payments regulating and supervising financial institutions could be less effective in november 2001 the federal reserv published the results of three commissioned surveys of the us retail payments system3 data were collected on checks and electronic payment instruments the studies did not include cash payments or transactions at atms mainly cash withdrawals which is significant omission according to the surveys 80 b illion noncash payments were made during the year 2000 with total value of 547 trillion checks accounted for an estimated 60 of all noncash payments compared to 85 in 1979 electronic payments accounted for 38 of all noncash paymen t or about 30 billion payments in 2000 even though checks have declined from bout 85 to 60 of all noncash payments the number of checks written has increas ed from an estimated 32 billion in 1979 to 496 billion in 2000 like most estimates of payments within the system this study is faulted for most likely underestimating the number of payments further the study does not clarify whether or not the growth of check payments has begun to decline4 it also does not clearly distinguish between wholesale and retail transactions for example it classifies automated clearinghouse ach pa yments as only retail despite the lack of universal acceptance of the accuracy of these estimates they clearly indicate that the mix of electronic payments and paperbased payments is changing retail electronic payments are growing faster than paperbased payments still paperbased payments remain dominant particularly if cash payments are included an alternative overview an alternative to the federal reserve study is the nilson report this study is narrower in some respects but broader in others and is based on the personal consumption expenditures reports of the bu reau of economic analysis of the us department of commerce5 the nilson study is narrow because its focus is on consumer payments and therefore misses most but not all business and government payments at the same time it is broader than the fede ral reserve study because it includes cash payments but not atm cas h withdrawals moreover the nilson reports are based on regula rly conducted government rvey and they have been published periodically since 1990httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31476crs4 6 electronic payments are defined as remote and preauthorized transactions and card payments include credit debit and storedvalue 20406080100120140160

of the size of the payments system and make projections to 2010 the figures show that electronic and card 6 forms of payment have become more popular and are an increasingly important part of the retail payments system however figure 1 shows that the paper transactions cash and checks accounted for 85 of consumer payments in 1990 in 2000 cash and checks accounted for 65 of total consumer transactions in the more recent federal reserve study mentioned above checks alone accounted for 60 of all retail noncash payments and by 2010 the nilson report expects consumers will be making about 50 of their payments by paper and only 14 of all consumer payments with paper checks figure 1 also shows distributive shift in paperbased transactions in 2010 it projects that the growth in cash and check payments between 1990 and 2000 will turn into decline between 2000 and 2010 mostly because of 34 drop in check payments the report suggests that payment cards will be used instead in addition the figure shows the number of card tran sactions growing rapidly while other electronic transactions increase at more moderate rate the dollar value of the transactions in figure 2 tells similar story even though there was 12 growth in dollar value of check payments between 1990 and 2000 the dollar value of checks in 2010 is expected to decline 20 figure 2 also shows that the dollar volume of transacti ons using cards is expected to accelerate partly based on demographic changes cash use is expected to increase which may indicate that cash may be substituted for the expected decline in check use while it is reasonable to expect that cards and electronic payments will continue to grow many in the past have overestimated the decline in the use of paper checkshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31476crs5 7 us news and world report august 5 1974 8 the bank administration institute checking account usage in the united states research and literature survey

seems ready to blossom into reality7 however the introduction to 1979 repor t by the bank administration institute recognized the failure of such predic tions by making the following point in the 1960s predictions of the growth of eft electroni c funds transfer services were such that sizable reductions in cash transactions and check transactions were expected within decade and cashless checkless society seemed to be on the horizon this as everyone now knows has not been the case8 closer examination of the operations of the paperbased payments system followed by similar examination of electronic payments may explain their relative positions in todays system paperbased payments major factor behind the slow penetra tion of electronic payments into retail payment transactions is the high level of comfort and confid ence the public has in using paperbased payments in the united states cash and checks are tested payment instruments accepted and used by governments businesses and consumers while the volume of retail electronic payments is rapidly increasing it is still difficult to attract customers away from timetested and trusted paperbased systemshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31476crs6 9 edward gramlich remarks at the electronic payment symposium ann arbor michigan september 17 1999httpwwwbog frbfedusspeecheshtm 10eft data book atm debit news september 13 2001 p3cash and checks also function as sometimes selfimposed restraint on spending compared say to credit cards ce they do not involve debt creation cash the use of coins and currency to pay for goods and services in the united states has been extensive in 1999 the amount of circulating coin and currency in the country was about 183 billion or approximately 670 per capita9 the use of cash is expected to continue to grow steadily with population growth because it will remain the most efficient and convenient way of making many types of payments cash is legal tender which means that if debt is paid with cash the debt is legally settled the treasury depar tment has the responsibility for money production in the united states the us mint manufactures the nations coins and the bureau of engraving and printing produces the cu rrency the federal reserve system distributes coins and currency to the banki ng system for circulation payment is carried out by the physical transfer of fixeddenomination coins and currency notes access to cash through electronic banking terminals has become increasingly commonplace over the last couple of d ecades by march 2001 there were 324000 atms automated teller machines operating in the united states10 thus an electronic delivery system has made cas h conveniently available throughout the country should the use of checks decline as many expect cash cards and other electronic payments are expected to replace those check payments paper checks paper checks are the oldest and most frequently used noncash method of payment in the united states the infrast ructure supporting check transaction is reliably well established according to the nilson reports in 2000 there were more than 30 billion transactions in which pers onal checks were used with value of 23 trillion with almost half of all consum er expenditures payments by dollar value made by checks it would be helpful to review how payments by checks are cleared and settled to understand how this critical part of the system works figure 3 graphically represents the process lets say angela the payer pays ba rry the payee by check then barry deposits the check in his bank it is possi ble that angela and barry have accounts in the same bank in which case the check woul d be settled as an onus item in the case of an onus item the depository ins titution would simply debit angelas account and credit barrys account in the amount of th check it is more likely that angela and barry have accounts in different deposito ry institutions in the united stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31476crs7 11 the 2001 federal reserve study on the payments system estimated that 30 of the checks written in the united states are onus items 12 the rules for interbank check settlement are governed by articles 3 and 4 of the uniform commercial code and by the federal reserve regulations j and cc figure 3 check clearing through the federal reserve systemthere are almost 20000 depository instituti ons banks saving associations and credit unions11 source federal reserve bank of atlanta there are number of ways that depos itory institutions may clear and settle checks among themselves by the rules of interbank check settlement12 over time the large volume of checks and check settlement demands has resulted in the creation of complex infrastructure of processing mechanisms including some that are electronic and procedures after barry deposits angelas check in his bank bank b or the collecting bank bank b can return the check to angelas bank by mailing the check directly to bank or by sending it through an intermediary there are three categories of intermed iaries clearing house associ ations correspondent banks and the federal reserve banks banks joining clearing house have central collection site to exchange checks with one another correspondent banks collect and settle checks for other depository financial institutions the federal reserve system has nationwide system operated by the reserve banks for clearing and settling checks whichever of these methods is selected by bank b according to the rules of interbank check settlement in most cases the check must be physically returned to bank before the bank makes good on the ch eck this means that checks must be physically transported to the bank they were drawn on before they are settled consequently the checking clearing process is subject to travel delays another legal requirement is that checks that are presented for payment must be paid at par value angelas

insurance premiums and mortgages are handled electronically through an automated clearing house collection that cost cannot be deducted fro m the amount of the check as it once was in the distant past the float an important byproduct of the ch eck clearing process is the float the float is income earned by the writer of the check between the time check is received as payment and the time it is settle d the writer of the check earns interest on the funds in the account on which the check is written during the time the check is being cleared and settled writer of large check with long clearing and settlement delays is likely to find checks preferable to less costly means of payment with faster clearing time in the example bove if bank and bank b are in the same city most likely angelas check would clear in the same day however if angelas bank is in remote location it ma take several days before angelas check gets back to bank as result angela gains several days of interest while barry loses several days of interest due to the delay in th process if in addition barry delays in depositing the check angela gains interest income with each day he delays electronic payments predictions of checkless cashless society have not been realized but the figures above suggest the influence of elect ronic banking will continue to grow and play larger role in the payments system

mentioned earlier ach operations are suited for repeat ed periodic payments every transaction has four participants an originator receiver an or iginating depository institution and receiving depository institution in an example of debit transacti on homeowner authorizes her insurance comp any to take monthly payment from her bank bank deposit account the insurance company will do this by having its bank bank b send withdrawal request fo r the funds each mont h via an electronic file to bank bs ach operator bank bs ach transmits the debit to bank as ach operator which presents the debit to bank bank would deduct the payment from the homeowner and send the transaction in an electronic file back through bank as ach for settlement which is final wh the insurance companys account is credited an example of credit tran saction is direct payroll deposit ach payment instructions are usually executed over the computer networks members prepare files detailing all the payments to be made to customers andor employees accounts in different depository institutions after the ach receives these files it collates them with their files of the depository institutions on their computers and deducts or credits the cal banks account at the fed the amount of the payment transactions are valuedated which means the originator of an ach transaction includes the settlement date in the payment instructions when it originates the transactions the network is also often used as the underlying settlement mechanism for credit card debit card and atm transactions net settlements between

purchase once the switches determine that the credit ba lance at the cardholders or issuing bank covers the purchase the merchant bank reimburses the merchants account for the purchase minus fixed discount fee ie 190 for the 100 purchase the bank immediately credits the merchants account 9 810 the issuing bank submits payment of 10000 minus interchange fee of 130 to the visa or master card network the network immediately deducts its fee of 10 cents for the exchange rvices it provided both banks and forwards payment of 9860 to the merchants bank thus the merchants bank paid the merchant 9810 but received 9860 from the network which could mean profit of 50 cents how the credit card process works cardholder hands the credit card to the merchant to make purchase once the switches determine that the credit balance at the cardholders or issuing bank covers the purchase the merchant bank reimburses the merchants account for the purchase minus fixed discount fee based on percentage of the purchase the bank immediately credits the merchants account the discounted amount of the purchas the issuing bank submits payment of the full purchase minus interchange f ee for the use of the visa or mastercard network the network immediately deducts fee based on negotiated arrangements for the exchange services it provided both banks and forwards payment of the net discounted amount to the merchants bank21 the cardholder pays the issuing bank the price of the purchase or at least the minimum payment it requires and the remaining balance is paid over time it must be noted that the exchange fees are sometimes not calculated on per transaction basis but are negotiated fixed at various levels of transaction in these cases the cost may fall over certain the number of transactions the regional credit card interchanges are now consolidated into two international interchanges owned by visa and master card clearing is done by using settlement banks over fedwire and

united states25 the federal reserve has proposed legislation to congress that would allow for universal adoption of electronic check presentation ecp26 process that electronically clears checks thus eliminating the need to physically present checks electronic check presentation is collection process that settles payment transaction by using electroni c information encoded on the check instead of the paper check itself another way to describe ecp is that each check is truncated at the institution where it is first deposited the information on the check is converted into electronic form and the check remains at that institution only in cases of suspected fraud and accounting inaccuracies would this check leave the first depository institution27 today roughly 20 of the checks processed by the federal reserve are presented electronically either in truncated form or with checks to follow the ecp process in the case of checks to follow the paper check is eventually sent to the paying bank negating some of the cost sa vings that result from full truncation but still making the check collection process more efficient and certainly much faster however the fed handles only 25 to 30 of the checks processed nationally the majority are processed by private cleari nghouses and large fi nancial institutions many of these checks are onus transac tions businesstobus iness merchantto bank or banktobank transac tions which are less costly to clear and settle recent financial institution mergers have also decreased check clearinghouse activities as more check transactions are conve rted into onus transactions28 thus even though the number of checks being written remains high the number of checks being cleared by the fed and other clearing houses has fallen if the check truncation act that is bein g proposed by the fed becomes law and electronic check presentation is universally adopted only the coins and currency part of the paperbased system would remain but ecp would also eliminate major consumer advantage of paying with checks the float that benefits the payer that means that the banking industry as whole would be the main beneficiary of the lower processing cost

resistance to them because of the concerns regarding identification theft regulating and supervising electronic payments federal financial regulatory agencies have traditionally exercised restraint in regulating innovative changes in the financia l services industry this policy has not changed with the ongoing migration of elect ronic payments to the paperbased retail side of the payments system but some analysts believe that the regulatory agencies should take more proactive role than they have because changes in the current electronic payments environment are occurring at increasingly rapid cycles31 corrective enforcement actions in case of financial stress might be too late to preventserious damage to the payments system if regulators and supervisory agencies are too removed from the market devel opment of electronic payments on the other hand premature regulation could stifle innovation by locking the industry into technologies that may be ss efficient convenient and safe for example if regulatory agencies had developed regulations tailored strictly to telephone lines those regulations might not be fully applicable to wireless financial transactions while either system could be made to operate successfully they might be subject to different priv acy and security concerns for example wireless banking transactions could introduce the necess ity for protecting radio
