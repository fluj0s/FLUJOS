at risk of not making firm commitment to the formal labor market they appear to include young single mothers who rely on governme nt benefits for time as well as their families and partners young ma principally with crimin records that make it difficult to obtain steady j obs upon release from incarcer ation youth sporadically employed in lowwage jobs who also participate in the underground economy and youth with disabilities key attribute of these disengaged or disconnected youth is their limited educational attainment high school dr opouts and graduates which argues for strategies that encourage youth to conti nue their studies eg mentoring programs for elementary and secondary school stude nts and pell grants as well as other financial aid for postsecondary school st udents being outofschool and outof work appears to be more prevalent among young females than males and among black and hispanic than white youth in addition to these pers onal attributes other risk factors for youths marginal att achment to the labor force include the characteristics of the neighborhoods in which they live eg area poverty and employment rates the proximity of those neighborhoods to jobs and the characteristics of their families eg labor force status and incarceration of parents these relationships indicate that while education and training policies meant to raise the human capital of youth may play necessary part in promoting their integration into the labor force they are not likely sufficient ones the results of empirical research suggest that comprehensiv youth employment policy would include training programs that provide among other things work experience to young students raised in poor i nnercity neighborhoods delinque ncy prevention measures particularly for lowincome children with incarcerated family and friends changes to public transportation and to housing patterns to give atrisk youth greater access to areas of job growth enhanced forcement of

force and attempt to shed some light on these matters youth unemployment some consider the labor force status of youth to be of even greater consequence than that of other age groups because the early experiences of 1624 year olds eg sporadic employment could set the tone for their subsequent working lives eg failure to develop good work attitudes and to accumulate sk ills the statistic usually cited to support the perspective that oung persons have chronically had more difficulties than others in the labor ma rket is the groups comparatively high unemployment rates indeed ab sent cyclical fluctuations2 the unemployment ratehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32871crs2 2continued workers youth are among the first let go when employers respond to reduced demand for their goods and services during recession the unemployed youths must then compete with experienced laid off adults for the dw indling number of available jobs another reaction of firms to recessions is to stop hiri ng which presents more of problem for labor force entrants who are disproportionately young the unemployment rate of 1624 year olds thus increases to greater extent than that of adults during cyclical downturn in contrast good economic times operate to the relative advantage of oung workers when product demand is high and labor is in short supply firms become more willing to hire those they consider less

2024 year olds has been about twice that of adults in addition youth account for disproportionate share of all unemployed persons 1624 year olds comprise 151 of the labor force but they are twice that share of the unemployed 3243 the high incidence of youth unemployment is partly related to their comparatively frequent movements into nd out of the labor force in 2004 379 of all unemployed persons versus 633 of unemployed 1624 year olds were seeking their very first jobs or were searching for positi ons after having been out of the workforce4 not surprisingly such individuals are very likely to encounter some spell of unemployment while they learn how to get job and gather information on the kinds of jobs available to them the educational calendar exacerbates the probability of unemployment for young labor force reentrants they ty pically flood the labor market in may and june searching for summer jobs after the sc hool year has ended or seeking initial jobs upon dropping out or graduating while th regularly occurring swell in the labor supply of youth coincides with increased demand for workers in some seasonal industries this is not the cas for most firms in the economy the high unemployment rate of youth also is associated with their relatively frequent job changes with each transition potentially involving spell of unemployment about twothir ds of all job changes occur

reluctance to hire inexperienced workers for career ladder positions and of young workers in deadend j obs having little reason to form lasting attachment to any particular firm anal yses of data from the national longitudinal survey of youth generally have found that while the typical young worker does not get longterm job of three years durati on immediately after leaving school heshe does by about age 226 educational attainment appears to greatly influence the length of time it takes for young sc hoolleaver to find st able position despite high school dropouts joining the workforce several years before graduates the typical dropout takes much longer to settle into hisher first longter m job 108 years versus 58 years or at age 29 versus age 247 the typical youth with some postsecondary sc hooling takes less than onehalf the time of high school gra duate to find good job match 27 years the typical youth with at least bachelors degree takes less than onefourth the time of high school graduate pe rhaps partly reflecting the gr eater specific skills already acquired by those with more schooling nd their superior knowledge of the job market in their chosen fields

inverse relati onship between age and unemployment rate holds true as well for older as opposed to younger teenagers and within the age range of young adults further according longitudinal survey of

statistics bls data from the current population survey cps factors contributing to youth joblessness implications for public policy the preceding analysis is not meant to imply that youths early experiences in the labor market can safely be ignored because most will settle into better circumstances or even that all youth will participate in the workforce indeed for some 1624 year olds eg teenage males employment in the civilian noninstitutional and military sectors of the economy has become less common at the same time that their presence in such institutions as correctional facilitieswhere they largely are unavailable for work nd which depresses th eir job opportunities after releasehas become more common9 policymakers therefore may want to determine which individual characteristics incline youth to become less firmly attached than others to the labor market and the kinds of initiatives that could facilitate the transition of these atrisk youth from the classroom to the workplacehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32871crs5 school enrollment whether young sters are enrolled in school has considerable effect on their connection to the labor market young students are

longitudinal study of adolescent health add health is nationally representative study that examines the causes of healthrelated behaviors of adolesce nts in grades 7 through 12 and their outcomes in early adulthood the study is intended to explore how social contexts eg families friends and neighborhoods affect youths health and risk behaviors the national institute of child health and human development issu ed grant cofunded with 17 other federal agencies in 1994 to begin the study information at the individual family sc hool and community level were collected in two waves between 1994 and 1996 third wave undertaken in 2001 and 2002 involved the rei nterview of 1826 year old add health respondentsserving inschool nd outofschool youth given these figures it could be argued that government resour ces should be more focused on outofschool youthparticularly since they unlike stude nts do not have socially acceptable alternative to participation in the labor force it was estimated for example that time spent out of the workforce by 1821 year old nonstudents and intermittent lowwage employment when they are in the labor force increases the chance of youth engaging in criminal activities10 the risk of criminal invol vement was found to be lower among students which perhaps reflects th eir making an investment to enhance future stability much like the outo fschool yout h with good jobs were occupationally stable and hence less likely to engage in criminal activities these results led the researchers to conclude that it is the stability that goes with good work or with academic involveme nt that inhibits criminality11 positive individual and societal outcomes thus might flow fro m providing services to both outofschool and inschool youth if outofschool youth receive skills training that enables them to obtain good jobs they might become more strongly committed to the formal labor market and be less inclined to engage in illegal activities nd helping youngsters continue their studies through outreach programs of the higher education act pell grants and other scholarships and works tudy programs for example might enable them to later enter the workfo rce better qualified for good jobs another analysis based upon representa tive sample of 1120 year olds from the national longitudinal study of adol escent health determined that the relationship between the quality of future job opportunities and violent delinquency begins even earlier in the life course as individuals move through adolescence it is here that impressions about the future begin to form when that future does not appear promising adolescents are more likely to become disinterested in formal education and perhaps seek out alternativ sources of status among peer cliques or possibly gangs12 the estimated effect of future of low paying jobs on adolescent delinquency was dampened when school attachment and ach ievement were take n into account the result appears to reaffirm the desirability of dr opout prevention strategies particularlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32871crs9 13for more information see crs report rl32633 mentoring programs funded by the federal

established another grant program for dropout prevention and reentry for students in grades 612 that includes counseling and mentoring atrisk students among other activities the importance of intervention early in childs life to facilitate subsequent labor force participation is underscored by the findings from longitudinal analysis of 321 year olds in dunedin new zealand the researchers noted that the results from their study are applicable to ot her developed countri based upon cross national comparisons of social problems holding education variables constant among those in the nationally representative sample at the typical ages of movement from the classroom to the workplace the authors estimated that the probability of unemployment during the transition was greater if the youth had failed to develop good reading skills been uninvolved in school engaged in antisocial behavior and had grown up in singleparent families b ecause these risk factors for unemployment upon entering the labor force were found to span multiple domains school home and society and to be present early in childrens lives the authors suggested that the most effective preventive measures are multimodal strategies implemented during the preschool years such as headstart pr ograms that have significant social and economic benefits that can endure through young adulthood14 other studies have shown that workin g while student helps to ease the transition to the labor force shortly af ter leaving high school the inverse relationship estimate d between neighbor hood poverty rates and high school students employment rates suggests that poor adol escents could have particular difficulty entering the labor market15 publicly sponsored work experience programs for students living in lowincome communities might consequently enhance their employment prospects upon exiting high school eg the summer employment opportunities program under the wo rkforce investment act having job can be important to stude nts and to the households in which they live for more immediate reasons over onehalf of students enrolled fulltime in two or fouryear colleges also are in the workforce as are

responses to the oct 2004 supplement to the cpsenrolled parttime the absence of paychecks among the 517000 unemployed college students might hamper their pursuit of additional education see table 2 wage loss due to unemployment among students might impose hardship on their families as well even the fairly small paychecks of teenagers attending school 694000 of whom were unemployed in oct ober 2004might contribute substantially to the economic wellbeing of singleparent families in which the parents themselves hold lowwage jobs for example althoug h virtually all res pondents in nationally representative sample of hi gh school students surveyed in early 2000 indicated that they worked to get extra spending mone 16 also reported that their families needed their earnings and 59 said their wa ges were going toward saving for college or other longterm goals16 hence government support of student employment could have shortterm and longt erm effects that extend beyond the youths themselves educational attainment typically the unemployment rate of individuals varies inversely with their educational attainment in the case of outofschool youth unemployment rates range from 204 for those with less than high school diploma to 66 for those with at least bachelors degree see table 3 moreover 1624 year olds who do not complete high school and those who stop their education upon obtaining high school diploma or the equi valent contribute dispropor tionately to total youth unemployment outofschool youth who lack high school diploma and those who graduate but do not pursue postsecondary ducation comprise about onehalf of all unemployed 1624 year olds which greatly surpasses their representation in the youth labor force at 36517 accordingly dropout prevention programs directed toward elementary and sec ondary k12 school students might lower the incidence of unemployment among youth g vocational education conversely as shown in table 3 the employment rate varies directly with educational attain ment little over half of all out ofschool youth in the civilian noninstitutional population who do not comp lete high school are employed compared to at least four of every five youth with some postsecondary education although young females empl oyment rates are below thos of males at each level of schooling the disparity becomes progressively less as educational attainment rises for those without high school diplom 407 among young females versus 623 among young males the difference in employ ment rates is more than four times that of youth with at least bachelors gree 852 among young females versus 904 among young males18httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32871crs11 similarly the equalizing effect of educational attainment is evident in the narrowed gap in the employment rates of outofschool youth by race among high school dropouts 578 of white youths have jobs compared to just 352 of black youths the gulf is half that among young high school graduates at 739 for whites and 623 for african american s the difference in employment rates of 1624 year old whites 891 and blacks 810 long er attending school diminishes further for those with at least bachelors degree this pattern is repeated when educational attainment data from the cps are further disaggregated by geographic locati on for example the employment rate of outofschool youth who lack high school diploma is lower on average for those living in central cities 679 versus s uburbs 732 yet regardless of place of residence there is near equality of employment rates among 1624 year olds with at

explain little of the decline in employment among young less educated black males the researchers postulated that greater efforts in recent years to establish paternity and to enforce court ordered

1824 year olds with high school degree or less who had been unemployed for one or more years at any point during the 19972001 period the researchers estimated that 7 or almost 18 million young adults

subseque ntly move appears to partly operate through limited accumulation of work experien ce this finding led the researchers to suggest that training programs might enable these youth to gain experience and acquire both the skills needed to accomplish work tasks and the more intangible soft skills needed for effective relationships with employers other employees and perhaps clients andor customers35 further the provision of mentors might compensate for the paucity of adult innercity residents with jobs who can serve as role models to youngsters in poor comm unities and the provi sion of labor market information might compensate for the dearth of job referral channels that rely on personal contacts these strategies might most benefit young females because more of the neighborhoods negative impact on employment outcomes was estimated to function through work experience for them th an for males the analysts speculated that the labor market disadvantages of 1422 year old males growing up in impoverished inner cities might more often operate throug h such other channels as placerace discrimination by employers nd encounters with the criminal justice system kith and kin ethnographic research illustrate s that the nature of youths personal contacts can influence their participation in the informal rather than formal labor market juveniles membership in gang may extend into an adulthood of illegal activities or of joblessness due in part to the stigma of their own criminal records and lack of family or communitybased networks to steer them toward opportunities in the legal rather than underground economy while noting that studies of the relationship between crime and social networks in the united states often are empirically and ideologically confounded by issues of race researchers who utilized panel data on ma adolescents 821 year olds in poor nonminority neighborhood of london estimated that early embeddedness among delinquent friends and in continuing delinquent behaviors leads to adult unemployment it indicates further that parental criminality plays more salient role in the development of early adult unemployment than parental

role models nd job referral networks geographic isolation from fastgrowing jobrich areas has b een shown to affect youths employment outcomes some analyses estimated that limited social access has more adverse impact than transport access nonetheless the proximity of jobs to youths place of residence still was found to affect their labor market involve ment independent of other factors40 consequently forging closer connections between suburban labor markets and inner citiessuch as throug h changes to public transportation and housing patternsmight raise the workfo rce participation of atrisk youth implicit in this prescription however is the assumption that once minority workers gain physical access to suburban employment centers they will be on an equal footing with white workers racial employment discrimination may in fact be more severe in suburban job markets where larger percentage of firms clientele is white and relatively lower share of businesses are minorityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32871crs19 41ibid p 519 42ibid 43for more information see crs report rl31930 section 8 housing choice voucher program funding and related issues by maggie mccartyowned than in the inner city any be nefit to minority workers from improving physical accessibility may be offset by intensified employment discrimination if this is the case residential integr ation or public transportation improvements may be less effective in boosting minority youth employment than policies that focus on rooting out discrimination or investing in the skills of minority youths41 further the urbansuburban distincti on may understate the isolation from the labor market that some youth experience study estimated that the average african american 1621 year old gains less th an the average latino asian and white youngster from proximity to fastgrowing job centers in the suburbs in addition the researchers determined that the subur ban neighborhood in which the average black youth lives has more poverty higher proportion of minority residents lower educational attainment and higher yout h dropout rate compared to the suburban neighborhoods of the average lati asian and white adolescent42 accordingly residential mobility programs that enc ourage poor families to move from the inner core of sprawling metropolitan areas to improve their childrens educational and employment opportunities ma be stymied by housing segregation within the suburbs better enforcement of policies to eliminate discrimination in the suburban housing market and in mortgage lending might thus be considered part of comprehensive approach to improving th connection of atrisk youth to the workplace the success of residential mobility programs also is likely to depend upon sufficient supply of affordable housing in higher income communities the federal government has tested ways to deconcen trate poverty through the section 8 voucher housing program eg the moving to oppor tunity fair housing demonstration and the moving to work demonstration43 given the imbalance between the supply of and demand for affordable housing in higher income communities as well as the reluctance of municipalities to lose population neighborhood workforce deve lopment and communityeconomic development policies might be brought to bear as well for example the us department of housing nd urban development help s to fund youthbuild an initiative featuring numerous communitybased programs that train largely low income 1624 year olds with limited educations in construction skills while they gain work experience by building affordable housing and take classes to obtain high school or equivalent diploma some youthbuild programs also receive support from americorps other workforce and communityeconomic development programs that do not have youth as their focus could none theless mitigate the adverse neighborhood effects previously discussed but imp rovements to an area that increase its attractiveness as business location might not lead to greater employment of area residents regardless of age consequently at the federal level an income tax

educational system also seems to be failing substantial share of the youth population human capital development appears to be only partial albeit an important strategy in ameliorating ouths classroomtoworkplace transition however policies to directly or indirectly addr ess the different dimensions of youth development tend to operate in comparative isolation from one another some analysts support training initiatives over ducational initiatives and vice versa with both groups contending that improvements to youths skills could lead to fewer pregnancies among unwed teenagers fewer juveniles with criminal records and more youth contributing to the na tions revenue base others are more supportive of for example delinquency and pregnancy preven tion programs which they argue could lead to greater educational attainment and enhanced employment outcomes for youth as most young people grow up in familie s spend much of their time in schools and are surrounded by communities it woul d seem that incorporating opportunities for developmental outcomes into their lives demand coordinated efforts among these stakeholders46
