providing access to scientif ic and technical information st for legitimate uses while protecting it from potential terrorists poses difficult policy choices federally funded extramural academic resear ch is to be classified if it poses security threat otherwise it is to be unrestricted since the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks controls increasingly have been placed on some unclassified research and st information including th at used to inform decision making and citizen oversight these controls include sensitive but unclassified sbu labels restrictive contract clauses visa controls controlled boratories and wider legal restrictions on access to some federa l biological transportation critical infrastructure geospatial environmenta l impact and nuclear information some professional groups have s upported voluntary controls on the conduct or publication of sensitive research federal agencies do not have uniform definitions of sbu or consistent policies to safeguard or release it raising questions about how to identify sbu information especially st information how to keep it from terrorists while allowing access for those who need to use it and how to develop uniform nondisclosure policies nd penalties on december 16 2005 president bush instructed federal agencies to standardize procedures to design ate mark and handle sbu information and to forward recomme ndations for governmentwide standards to the director of national intelligence dni the information sharing environment implementation plan sent to congress in n ovember 2006 reports that final action will occur durin g the lst quarter of cy2006 following the 2001 terrorist attacks th bush administration issued guidance that reversed the clinton administrations presumption of disclosure approach to releasing information under freedom of information act foia and cautioned agencies to consider withholding sbu in formation if there was sound legal basis to do so some agencies contend that sbu information is exempt from disclosure under foia even though such information per is not exempt under foia the 2002 enactment of the federal informati on security management act fisma rendered moot the definition of sbu that some agencies had used since the passage of the computer security act of 1987 which identified sensitive information by content fisma requires agencies to categorize the criticality and sensitivity of all information according to the security cont rol objectives of conf identiality integrity and availability across range of risk levels and to use safeguards based on risk of release many federal agencies have not yet fully implemented these new procedures during the 109th congress pl 10990 and pl 109295 focused on management oversight and appropriate use of the sens itive security information ssi category legislative proposals focused on standardiz ing concepts of sensitive information modifying penalties for disclosure and clarifying foia during the 110th congress additional topics likely to be controversial include limiting the number of persons who can designate sbu widening the use of riskbased approaches to control

april 2003sensitive but unclassifiedinformation and other controls policy and options for scientific and technical information introduction to the issues federal agencies have long confronted the need to balance the release of information for public use with the need to withhold information that could be used to threaten privacy or security the term sensitive but unclassified sbu information was used before the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 even though there is statutory definition for it ce 911 more agencies have started to use the term sbu or some variant of it nd to implement security systems to identify and protect nonclassified information whose release might benefit terrorists many questions have been raised about how to design uniform policies and controls for sbu information this report focuses on c ontrols for two kinds of scientific and technical information information used in research and scientific publication and information used to serve broader public policy purposes such as in regulatory decisionmaking and citizen oversight both public and privately controlled information are included and in some resp ects private profe ssional groups responses are being defined by public pressures and decisions two divergent perspectives are discernabl from one perspective broadening controls to deny public acce ss to federal sbu informati on will constrain terrorists who might use it to threaten buildings infrastructure people and services it has been estimated that our adversaries derive up to 80 of their intelligence from opensource information1 another source put this at 90 referring to information about local energy infrastruct ures water reservoirs dams highly enriched uranium storage sites and nuclear and gas facilities moreover some say that the potential for terrorism is heightened if terrorist s can aggregate seemingly innocuous bits of public information2 although many agencies ve begun to limit public access to sensitive information from this perspec tive these efforts are inadequate in contrast to those who seek to wide n controls another view contends that inadequate and insufficient sharing of in formation with the public and among first responders potentially weakens efforts to prot ect the nation from terrorist attacks related perspective is that as government policy on sharing information shifts to

and current controversy by genevieve j knezo which describe d the history of governmental controls on sensitive unclassified information 5 national security decision directive189 nsdd189 titled national policy on the transfer of scientific technical and engi neering information and issued on sept 21 1985 says that if federally funded basic scientific and technical information produced at colleges universities and laboratories is to be controlled for national security reasons it should be classified but to the maximu m extent possible the products of fundamental research remain unrestricted it is also the po licy that where the national security requires control the mechanism for control of in formation generated during federally funded fundamental research in science technology and engineering at colleges universities and laboratories is classification fundamental research is defined as basic and applied research in science and engineering the results of which ordinarily are published and shared broadly within the scientific community this policy is reflected in executive order 12958 nsdd189 is still in effect as stated in letter from the national security advisor to the center for strategic and international studies issued by national security advisor condoleezza rice on november 1 2001need to know rationale that has become more prevalent since the 911 terrorist attacks the imposition of more controls will deny ordinary citizens information relating to research envir onmental protection transporta tion and so forth that they need in order to be informed3 and to hold accountable government and industry decisionmakers some say new contro l policies unduly limit access to information needed to advance the progress of scie nce and technology and the development of technologies to counter threats arguing that if scientific and technical information needs to be restricted it should be classified this report traces the evolution of sburelated

things scientific technological or economic matters relating to the national security or cr yptology may require classification there may be cases when an nsf grantee originates info rmation during the course of an nsfsupported project that the grantee believes requires cl assification under eo 12958 in such case the grantee has the responsibility to promptly 1 submit the information directly to the government agency with appropriate subject ma tter interest and classification authority or if uncertain as to which agency should receive the informati on to the director of the information

if it requires classification the performing organization may wish or need to discontinue the project dissemination of findings may also be controlled 13 the federal government exercises prepubli cation review of some privately published scientific and technical information by curre nt and former employees and contractors who worked for federal agencies and who had ac cess to classified information the defense department dod typically includes prepublication review clauses in government contracts for extramural research these contro ls are used if classified information was used in research or when the government seeks to prohibit release of information deemed sensitive because of the way it is aggregated beginning in 1980 all academic cryptography research is to be submitted on voluntary ba sis for prepublication review to the national security agency the us government may enter into contracts to purchase exclusive rights to commercial satellite imagery and may stop the

this category it would be difficult to deliver such agents and decreasing the yield for some crops in the united states might succeed only in reducing the surplus nearly all of the threats of potential highimpact event should be considered serious and information related to these threats should be controlled grey area where information w ould have to be carefully evaluated forms when costs are high and convenience is low for example information on how to create vaccines for highlycommunicable diseases coul d fall into this category as the method for creating vaccines now in use first increases the virulence of normal diseases and then finds inhibitors to block or antibodies to combat the strongest variants of the diseases increasing controls significantly could slow the developm

alamos national laboratory 30 to 50year old hist orical records at the national archives orbits of earth satellites aeronautical maps and data previously available from the national geospatial intelligence agency214 some of the critiques of information control policies in specific scientific and technical arenas have already been described in this report in addition number of criticisms have been made that cut across sensitive information controls broadly and may influence decisions about balancing security and access to sensitive unclassified information these cr iticisms which are discussed next focus on allegations that some controls can exacerbate vulnerability or stifle scientific research and technological innovation vaga ries in nondisclosure require ments the relationship

and recommendations for better governance of sbu information procedures these sections also identify legislation that has been introduced and action cong ress has taken on some of these issues allegations that some controls can exacerbate vulnerability and stifle scientific research and technological innovation sensitive information controls may protect vulnerable buildings and public

such information puts the public in greater danger of lethal accidents215 some say that protections on information access and dissemination are especially burdensome to scientific resear ch and academic research and that the scientific communitys poten tial to generate knowledge nd innovations to assist in combating terrorism could be compromised by overzealous information security controls for instance terrorists w ill obtain knowledge one critic emphasized216 our best option is to blunt their efforts to exploit it keeping scientists from sharing information damages our ability to respond to terrorism and to natural disease which is more likely and just as devastating our best hope to head off both threats may well be to stay one step ahead217 on october 18 2002 the three presidents of the national academies issued statement that sought to balance security and openness in disseminating scientific information it summarized the policy dile mma by saying that restrictions are clearly needed to safeguard strategic secrets but openness also is needed to accelerate the progress of technical knowledge and enhance the nations understanding of potential threats the statement encouraged the government to reiterate government po licy that basic scientific resear ch should not be classified that nonclassified research reporting should not be restricted and that vague and poorly defined categories of research informati on such as sensitive but unclassified should not be used the inevitable effect is to stifle scientific creativity and to weaken national security the statement outlined action points for both government and professional societies to consider when developing dialogue about procedures to safeguard scientific and technical inform ation that could possibly be of use to potential terrorists an american civil liberties union acl u report addressing governmental restrictions on science observed that the sensitive but unclassified and equivalent categories that effectively bar public access to information must be eliminated all information should either be properly cl assified or unrestricted218 similarly the american association of university professors recommended we should resist or seek to rep eal efforts to regulate unduly or to make secret the results of lawful research projects under novel us of the sensitive but unclassified rubric219 the national academies held wo rkshop on this subject early in 2003 in cooperation with the center for strategic and internati onal studies subsequently the csis and the

information clauses in contracts is constitutionally suspect especially with regard to universityconducted research that is supported as an esse ntial public good use of the term sbu raises the possibility of government censorship of private speech the primary danger addressed by the free speech clause222 and imposes prior restraint on private speech223 even though there may not be enoug h of threshold level of national security danger to overcome the right to free speech these considerations suggest that sbu secrecy controls th at reach into university discourse pose particular danger because of the spec ial role of the university in promoting innovation and expression outside of government control and because with respect to scientific information in par ticular the university has special role in conducting research for the purpose of expansion and dissemination of knowledge although the government shapes expression on university campuses in many ways the expectation is that expression not identified as the governments will be unconstrained the special role of the university thus must weigh in the constitutional balance224 according to this author government may have legitimate constitutional right to protect sbu information in contracts if there is sufficient national security reason if uniform definitions linked to specific leve ls of national security danger are used if there are review procedures and if the method used to control information is the least restrictive necessary to fulfill the governments legitimate interests225 some say that placing

checks dhs and dot pr ocurement rules involving sensitive information specify background checks fo r prime or subcontractors and that nondisclosure forms have to be signed226 there is also the view that scientists who voluntarily agree to preresearch and prepublication reviews of research articles could harm universitys ability to conduct fundamental research involving fore igners as permitted by national security decision directive189 nsdd189 and re lated regulations for additional information see previous section of this report entitled summary of federal policies to classify or cont rol scientific and technical information according to robert hardy of the nonprofit c ouncil on government relations by placing restrictions on publishing the department of homeland securityfunded centers of excellence could risk losing the privileges that universities enjoy because they do fundamental research defined work whose results are published and shared broadly within the scientific community one important privilege is being able to involve foreign nationals in any research project without obtaining government license227 critique of nondisclosure requirements number of agencies require employees contractors and users of sensitive information to sign nondisclosure agreemen ts or impose penalties for disclosing sbu and related information so critics contend that lang uage relating to penalties is often vague varies from agency to agency and that some agencies mandatory nondisclosure provisions and associated penalties for disclosure might weaken federal employee rights and whisteblower protections some agencies policies are illustrated in appendix elsewhere in this report and in other reports228 for example nondisclosure agreem ents are authorized in pl 107296 relating to sharing of shsi with state and local governme nt personnel sec 892 and for handling ssi sec 1601 section 214 of the law allo ws penalties consisting of imprisonment fines administrative penalties

information security oversight office isoo at the nara for example should federal empl oyee disclose certain unclassified information specifically critical infrast ructure information in an unauthorized manner that individual now is subject to criminal sanctions under section 214f of the homeland security act at the same time an unauthorized disclosure of certain types of classified informa tion by that same employee would not necessarily be subject to criminal sanctions the reason for such disparity is not readily apparent231 the project on government oversight watchdog group

federal information systems and automated identification processes used for sens itive information recognition of federal agency use of the category sbu is illustrated by the need often mentioned in gao reports for agencies to share sens itive information especially relating to homeland security251 and the fact that agencies are developing implementation policies and information systems to

punished for violations of transmittal to third parties for add itional information see appendix b on illustrations of federal information systems created to transmit sensitive but unclassified

agencies use variety of different concepts of sbu information and methods to restrict public access to it labels include such terms as f ouo ssi shsi ceii ouo limited official use l ou law enforcement sensitive and controlled unclassified information cdc manual identifies at least 14 such labels that federal agencies use and other inventories contain 50 or more such categories255 as illustrated by the descriptions in appendix while some agencies use the fismamandated processes to categorize information and implement information security protections based on the level of risk associated with unauthorized access some agencies continue to use definition of sensitive that is based on the csa definition which leads to identification nd implementation polic ies that are based on type or content of information or th reat for instance the department of homeland security in its sbu mana gement directive 110421 included the computer security act and its definition of sensitive as the first item under the heading policy and procedures that govern the directive but said with the exception of certain types of information protected by statute specific standard criteria and terminology

information on the same page it says the computer security act requires that security plans be developed for all fe deral computer systems that contain sensitive information given the expansi on of

acknowledges the need for agencies to use broader nist riskbased procedures and gu idance to provide information security for all information258 it does not mention the fisma act or the specific concepts it embodied the appendix continues at times to refer to the narrower csa concept of sensitive information that was rendered moot with passage of fisma for instance it continues to refer to the csas requirements for agencies to protect computer systems containing sensitive information and for the secretary of commerce to develop and issue appropriate standards and guidances for the security of sensitive information in federal computer systems259 in somewhat obscure document note of july 3 2003 the omb gave specific guidance to agency chief information officers to use fisma

ask why have they not complied yet agencies may not know that the csa sensitive information definition was rendered moot especially because major agencies including omb and dhs still reference csa and use the term in various documents and guidances the csa definition may be easy to use since it is broad and has been used for almost 20 years it is possible that some agencies may not be fully aware that the government act extends to ndling of all types of information including what they categorize as sbu or sensitive informa tion slow compliance with the fisma guidance may also be due to the facts that it took several years for nist to prepare and release the volumes in its fips seri and for agencies to accept and adjust procedures to adopt the riskbased nist information control procedures these procedures may be more difficult to implement that traditional information control procedures that apply labels based on the content of information also according to gao inspector general re ports and testimony in vari ous congressional hearings many agencies have not yet formally incorporated an overall risk management program into their information security policies because they are slow to implement the legislative mandates or are finding it too expensive to comply with the mandates of the egovernment act291 some information handlers may be wary of the nist processes because they believe that riskbased standards prescribed by nist are too loose for their circumstances the threats and the potentially malevolent uses of information confronting their agency they may believe that the use of such standards would permit the release of sensitive information th at should be protected or that riskbased analysis may not be rigorous enough292 also agencies may be aware of nist risk based standards but may choose to use other procedures since the law allows agencies to use more stringent procedur to protect information if in their determination agencies recognize the nist standards as mandatory minium standards despite the fact that omb does not require formal detailed risk analyses to be conducted some agencies may not be eager to comply with fisma because they might believe that riskbased analyses mig ht be expensive to conduct or might lead to categorizing lot of information whose impact levels might be mixed for the three categories of confiden tiality

security responsibilities congress may seek to oversee updating of the appendix document recommendations to institut better governance of sbu information procedures number of recommendations have been made relating to improving procedures used to administer sbu controls it is possible that some of these issues may be addressed by the executive branch pursuant to the presidents memo of december 16 2005 limit the number of persons who can designate sbu as noted above especially in the comments of i sso director leonard and others many governmental officials can stamp document sbu it was reported that although limited number of government personne l estimated at more than 4000294 can stamp classified documents top secret which can be declassified after review according to regular schedule or whose classification can be appealed many more employees can stamp documents sbu whose designation is not on schedule to be reviewed or changed and for which there are appeal process specific comments in this regard were made about dhss sbu policies the new fouo information policy is actually more farreaching than national security classification policy thus cla ssified information can only be generated by officials who have been authorized by the president either directly or indirectly by delegation but any dhs employee or contractor can designate information fouo if it falls within eleven broad categories moreover managers and supervisors can also designate additional information as fouo even if it falls outside of those categor ies further the classification system provide for an oversight mechanisms through the information security oversight office provision for oversight of the new fouo policy is included295 one option for policymakers may be to consider limiting the number

the center for strategic and internati onal studies concluded that centralization perhaps in omb could assist in inventorying which information might be sensitive and in developing st andardized

of american scientists report concluded that oversig ht of sbu information signations and policy might benefit from coverage in isoo or iscap it recommended that the president could direct the isoo to expand its portfolio to encompass such sensitive but unclassified information though to be effective this would require an infusion of new personnel and resources to an organization that is stretched thin similarly the president could task iscap to receive and evaluate challenges to controls that have been imposed on unclassified information in addition to its current oversight of cla ssified information to avoid diluting or diverting the efforts of these existing tities it may be preferable to devise new organization or interagency panel th at can tackle controls on unclassified information while bolstering the work already being performed on oversight of classified information300 an appeals process the need for an appeals process for sbu information has been stressed by critics who allege that the sbu labeling system is more restrictive than federal national security information classification systems for instance in testimony hammitt contended that remedies to challenge the designation of such information must be made available requesters must not be forced to go to court as their only alternative instead process akin to mandatory declassification review should be institute d he also argued along these same lines time limits for protection should be considered and imp lemented sensitive information may well be sensitive for period of time and lose its sensitivity thereafter once information is long er sensitive it should be made publicly available the national archives usually declassifies most material after 25 years except for nuclearrelated

communication between the intelligence community and the scientific community good enough to enable researcher s to identify information that should be protected to prevent terrorists from gain ing knowledge to harm the united states do sbu controls constitute another type of classification system just how much scientific and technical information is being w ithheld under various sbu designations and how has such withholding affected the conduct of research and development and the use of scientific and technical information in policymaking should special considerations be given to allow access to scie ntific and technical information especially that produced by universities since the academic sector has unique role as generator of knowledg as public good and as significant engine of industrial innovation w ill dhss sbu controls on developing technology or current technology aff ect information generated by dhsfunded research and development grants and contr acts can riskbased procedures be used effectively to control access to and di ssemination of scientific and technical information and can they effectively bala nce access and control would the use of riskbased procedures generate control procedures different from those used in existing sbu information control systems what is the cost administrative and financial of sbu information control regimes the actions needed to implement them and to safeguard sbu information i ndefinitely would there be significant difference in costeffectiveness calculations for implementing riskbased analysis procedures versus some of the currently used sbu procedures should there be monitoring of the use and effects on scie ntific communication of governmental and private sector voluntary information cont rol procedures who should conduct such monitoring the president the congress and the scientific community have initiated steps to answer some of these questions the ongoing activities to inventory agency activities to oversee agency policies and procedures to clarify terminology and to develop professional groups codes of conduct and voluntar control procedures may foster practices that are compatible
