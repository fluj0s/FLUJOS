counselor delivered demarche on the upcoming nonaligned movement nam foreign ministers meeting scheduled for tehran from july 2730 reftel to saudi mfa deputy director for western affairs department mojahid ali alwahbi 2 s alwahbi informed us that saudi minister of state for foreign affairs mfa deputy secretary equivalent dr nizar bin obaid madani would lead the saudi delegation he assured us saudi arabia did not want the nam meeting to become an iranian propaganda event adding he had seen the proposed agenda and did not expect it to develop in such manner alwahbi agreed irans continued nuclear enrichment was grave sag concern with regional security implications reftel b 3 s alwahbi strongly advised against taking military action to neutralize irans program rather establishing usiranian dialogue was the best course of action asserting that the usg opening an interest section or reopening our embassy in tehran would be positive step alwahbi was heartened by the usgs initiative for under secretary burns to meet with the iranians last week in geneva he added that in his view irans position was shifting and wanted to avoid escalation of tensions he noted his belief that the russians had recently been effectively pressuring iran to be less provocative alwahbi concluded that he expected iran to keep tensions relatively low at least until after the us presidential election 4 s comment these comments are typical of saudi mfa bureaucrats who take pacific stance towards iran but diverge significantly from the more bellicose advice we have gotten from senior saudi
