privacy and security to comme rce and taxation and from the federal role in funding and developing the internet to the private sector role in advancing new technologies and applications since some of these issues are still unreconciled it is likely that the 106th congress will continue to address wide range of it issues many directly connected to fede ral it policies and programs federal it policy and the programs th at support the policy can have wide range of benefits for us citizens federal government it policy can improve how services and information are provided to americans increase the timeliness and quality of federal agencies res ponses and save federal tax dollars by improving government efficiency those are ll reasons why the federal government increasingly relies on it applications nd services protection and security of individuals privacy as well as making appr opriate federal data more transparent and available for its citizens are the ultimate goals of federal agency it policies many have questions and concerns regarding federal it policy as well they view the rapidly expanding types of it t echnologies and the ma ny applications of these technologies and ask are the progra ms that support federa l policy appropriate is enough being done to safeguar d and protect citizens from both immediate and longterm threats what is the proper federal role for enhancing all forms of it applications and development it is important to remember that just over two decades ago federal government it policy usually meant the acquisition nd use of one mainframe computer per federal agency the number of qualified professionals who c ould use and maintain mainframe databases was relatively small the subsequent mushrooming of new technologies and applicati ons has ranged from the omnipresent use of personal computers in the federal workplace to the explosive growth of the internet often federal policymakers have had to react to these changes as they attempt to fit new it technologies and applications into existing policy frameworks the following summaries of current federal it policy issues provide broad view of how the federal government is addressi ng

general services administration gsa and statistics on federal it pr ocurement and use came from one source since 1997 as authority has become more decentralized at individual agencies there has been less centralized reporting of total federal information technology however some figures are available from the office of mana gement and budget omb on federal it procurement and acquisition omb

about computers httpwwwcscmueduafs csuserbamwwwnumbershtml the year 2000 computer problem2 many computers in the united states nd throughout the world will not be able to store or process dates correctly beyond december 31 1999 unless they are modified the problem is the result of common computer design in which dates are stored using only the last two digits for the year eg 98 for 1998 the two digit year field is very common among older systems designed when memory storage was more expensive but is also used in many systems built recently under the twodigit format for storing the year the year 2000 is indistinguishable from 1900 the year field in computer progra ms can perform various functions such as calculating age sorting information by date and comparing dates when years beyond 1999 are entered in the twodigit format those functions will often fail to operate properly and in so cases systems will completely shut down although the year 2000 problem is primarily in comput er software the problem also exists in some hardware components in which integrated circuits also called embedded chips store or process data without correc tion computer malfunc tions will cause many costly problems in commerce and government although some may still doubt the serious ness of the problem most government officials and business managers are now c onvinced that tending to it is critically important to continue opera tions fixing computer systems for the year 2000 will in general be very difficult and costly due to the large number of computers in use their high degree of interdependence and the difficulty in finding all of the date fields in the software all of the year 2000 conversion work including testing for errors and testing interfaces between systems must be completed before january 1 2000 to avoid disruptions in system in addition many report shortage of skilled programmers to perform the year 2000 conversion over 50 gao reports have conc luded that many

easier for companies to disclose information on the year 2000 r eadiness of their products and services the year 2000 information and readiness and disclosure ac t pl 105271 was enacted to encourage companies to disclose information on the status of the year 2000 renovations and testing of their products and services to protect companies the act prohibits year 2000 readiness disc losures from being used as evidence in state or federal courts it also prot ects companies from year 2000 statements in liability suits unless the statement is known to be false intended to deceive or made in

encryption and decryption are methods of using cryptography to protect the confidentiality of data and communications when encrypted message only can be understood by someone with the key to decrypt it businesses and consumers want strong encryption products to prot ect their information while the clinton administration wants to ensure the law enforcement communitys ability to monitor undesirable activity in the digital age th administrations policy promotes the use of strong encryption here and abroad as l ong as it is designed with key recovery features where key recovery agent holds spare key to decrypt the information the administration would requi re key recovery agents to make the decryption key available to duly authorized federal and state government entities privacy advocates are concerned that law enforcement entitie s will have too much access to private informationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98845crs6 encrypting messages so they can be unde rstood only by the intended recipient historically was the province of those protecting military secrets the burgeoning use of computers and computer networks in cluding the internet now has focused attention on its value to much broader gment of society government agencies seeking to protect data stored in their databases businesses wanting to guard proprietary data and consumer s expecting electronic mail to be as private as first class mail all want access to strong encryption products while encryption is uncommon for telephone users today th advent of digita l telephone services particularly personal communication services pcs digital form of cellular telephony is expected to make encryp ted voice and data communications over telephones more common the national institute of standards nd technology nist in conjunction with industry developed an encryption standa rd using 56bit key in 1977 called the data encryption standard des it is widely used today in the united states and abroad nist is currently working to tablish new stronger standard than des referred to as the advanced encryption st andard aes the need for stronger standard was underscored in june 1997 when des was broken the administration uses the export control process to influence whether companies develop key recovery encrypti on products by making it easy to export products with key recovery and difficult for those products without there are limits on domestic use or import of any type of encryption the clinton administration has tried to influence what is available for domestic use through export controls since most companies w ill not develop one pr oduct for domestic use and separate product for export us co mputer companies argue that us export restrictions hurt their market share and help foreign companies that are not subject to export restrictions many businesses and consumer gr oups agree that key recovery is desirable when keys are lost stole n or corrupted however they would like market forcesnot government directivesto drive the development of key recovery encryption products many also object to g overnment having any role in determining who can hold the keys all parties agree that encryption is ssential to the growth of electronic commerce and use of the internet but ther is little consensus beyond that seven bills on encryption or computer security have been introduced in the 105th congress fundamentally the contr oversy over encryption concerns what access the government should have to encrypted stored computer data or electronic communications voice and da ta wired and wireless fo r law enforcement purposes among the major issues facing congre ssional policymakers are the following key recovery the clinton administration wants law enforcement access to keys for encrypted data stored by computers transmitted between computers or other types of elect ronic communications not only does the administration view this as critical for us users but it seeks creation of global key management infrastructure kmi to ensure confidentiality for the growth of global electronic commerce and monitoring undesirable activity by terrorists drug cartels or child nographers for example some contend that market forces will drive the development of kmi for stored computer data without government involvement others ve concerns that thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98845crs7 4prepared by john d moteff specialist in science and technology policy science technology and medicine divisiongovernment will have unfettered entry to private files and communications in september 1998 the administrati on announced new encryption policy that will allow companies to expor t 56bit encryption products without demonstrating they have plans for creating or developing key recovery systems export restrictions the clinton administration defending its export control policy points to threats to national security and public safety that would arise if criminals and terrorists used encryption that the us government could not decrypt pponents of the administrations policy counter that the united states cannot prevent access to strong nonkey recovery encryption by criminals and terro rists because it is already available elsewhere in the world they argue that the current policy of restrictions on domestic use or import of encrypti on means that domestic threats likely would not be affected in july 1998 the administration announced plans to relax export controls for strong cryption software without requiring provisions for key recovery for financia l institutions in the 45 countries that currently have laws acceptable to the united states outlawing money laundering the administrations ne w policy announced in september 1998 expands the export of 56bit encryption to insurance companies health and medical organizations excluding biomedical and pharmaceutical manufacturers and online merchants for client server applications that secure electronic commerce transacti ons some in industry and congress question whether the administrations po licy since many longer consider 56bit encryption strong encryption method domestic use current us policy allows any type of encryption to be used in or imported into the united states administration concerns that attempting to change this policy would be unsuccessf ul was factor in its choice of using export controls to influence what encryption products are available for domestic use in 1997 some experts det ected change in government policy when fbi director freeh informed the senate judiciary committee of the possibility of requiring that key rec overy be built into products manufactured in or imported into the united states key recovery could possibly be enabled by the manufacturer not only the us er

regularly information infrastructu re and national security 4 information technology pervades many if not most of the systems used to create and distribute the many public and private services upon which our societyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98845crs8 now depends from ploying and operating military units to providing local 911 service these systems or infrastructures are becoming more interdependent by the increased use of telecommunications th at link the information technology of one system with those of others national security defined in the broadest sense to include not only military security and fense capability but also economic security and social cohesion increasingly depends on the integrity of the information technology operating and managing those systems and the connections between them the country has typically thought of the integrity of its infrastructure in terms of the physical vulnerability to natural fo rces eg earthquake s and to manmade threats eg sabotage but the security community also is concerned about the electronic vulnerability of its infrastructure or more specifically the data and the software used by these system s electronic threats too can be natural or manmade of particular interest is the manmade threat posed by hackers who might enter the information infrastructure of particular system and corrupt it in the past hackers may have been inquisitive or mischievous individuals motivated by the challenge of breaking into the information infrastructur of an organization today there is concern that hackers may include groups of individuals working toward more nefarious ends while the public and the private sectors have long been worried about spies hacking into sensitive info rmation the concern now is that hackers may soon represent the vanguard of hostile attack by foreign entities in way that is difficult to detect this issue was ra ised during four day conference on national information systems security october 5 8 1998 sponsored by the national institute of standards and the national security agencys national computer security center individually system operators have sp ent varying amounts of time and resources protecting and policing their information sy stems the telecommunications industry and the military and emergency preparedne ss communities have c ooperated for years to assure the integrity of the nations civil and military telecommunication systems 90 of the militarys communications travel on the civilian system against both physical and electronic threats but as telecommunications link the information infrastructure of various othe r systems and as disruption in one system can lead to cascading disruptions in other systems th national security community would like to expand that cooperation to other sectors of the economy in july 1996 the president established through executive order 13010 the presidents commission on critical infrast ructure protection pccip among its tasks the commission was to assess the scope and nature of the vulnerabilities of and threats to critical infrastructures b determine what legal and policy issues are raised by efforts to protect critical infrastructures c recommend comprehensive national policy and implementation strategy for protecting critical infrastructures and d propose any statutory or regulato ry changes necessary to effect its recommendations the commission examined the following systems information and communication energy including ectrical power gas and oil banking and finance physical distribution personal and commercial road rail and air transport and vital human services including wate r local emergency services and federal services such as weather disease control and social securityconcentrating on the electronic vulnerabilities and threats httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98845crs9 in october 1997 the commission rel eased an unclassified report critical foundations protecting americas infrastructures generally while the commission did not find any immediate threat it did report that the critical infrastructures examined were vulnerable to attack with tools now available there were several specific findings they include information sharing is the most immediate need currently there is co mprehensive body of knowledge available for effective analysis of overall vulne rability and threats responsibility for protecting and responding is shared among owners and operators and the government the capabilities nd response of diverse fede ral agencies need to be coordinated adequate response must occur in changing environments the federal government should lead by protecting its own systems the legal framework is imperfectly attuned to deal with electronic threats and research and development is presently inadequate to support protection among its recommendations the commission suggested the establishment of national structure for assuring the integrity of critical infrastructures such structure would include set of councils nd offices meant to bring together various stakeholders to share information and velop protection strate gies and responses the commission also recommended that among the laws that should be reviewed are the defense production act the stafford actfederal response plan the nunn lugardomenici program which focuses federal resource on training and access to equipment for local first responders and criminal statutes the commission estimated that the federal government spends about 250 million year on research and development to protect its infra structure about 150 million of which goes toward protection of information system s the commission recommended that the investment be doubled in 1998 and increased to 1 billion year for the next 5 years on february 27 1998 the department of justice announced the creation of the national infrastructure protecti on center nipc its manda is to detect prevent and respond to cyber and physical attacks on u s computer systems the center has links to other government partments such as defense state and treasury as well as to local and international police ag encies on may 22 1998 president clinton signed presidential directive 63 it expands the fbis authority to operate the nipc and to facilitate and coordinate the federa l governments response to any incident and to investigate threats the center also serves as clearin ghouse for information shared among agencies and with the private sector the commerce department has been named the lead agency for overseeing an information and communications center each federal agency will be in charge of protecting its own critical infrastructure particularly its electronic systems and must develop critical infrastructure

one of the key purposes of gpra is to improve congressional decision making by provi ding more objective information on the relative effectiveness and efficiency of federal programs and spending the act essentially mandates strategic planning nd performance measurement in the federal government pl 10362 re quires federal agencies to develop strategic plans describing their overall goals and objec tives annual performance plans containing quantifiable measures of their progress and performance reports describing their success in meeting those standards and measures each agencys strategic plan is required to contain the following elements comprehensive mission statement covering th major functions nd operations of the agency general goals and objectives including outcomerelated goals and objectives for the major functions and ope rations of the agency description of how the goals and objectives are to be achieved incl uding description of the operational processes skills and tec

of the general goals and obj ectives and description of the program evaluations used in establishing or revi sing general goals and objectives with schedule for future program evaluations performance plans are prepared in conj unction with an agencys annual budget submission to congress the performance plan should establish tangible link between the long term strategic goals presented in the strategic plan and an agencys program activities pl 10362 requires agency performance plans to establish performance goals to define the level of performance to be achieved by program activity express such goals in an objective quantifiable and measurable form briefly describe the operatio nal processes skills and technology and the human capital information or other resources required to meet the performance goals establish performance indicator s to be used in measurin g or assessing the relevant outputs service levels and outcomes of each program activity provide basis for comparing actual program results with the established performance goals and describe the means to be used to verify nd validate measured values in cases where performance goals for program activity cannot be expressed in an objective quantifiable and measurable form the ag ency may with omb approval express performance goals by using descriptive stat ements or other ppropriate alternate forms performance reports will discuss the extent to which performance goals and objectives are met strategic plans were submitted to congress and omb on september 30 1997 and are required to be updated at least once every

starting in march 2000 each of these plans and reports are to be shared with congress which is expected to use the material s to help guide budgetary decisions while pl 10362 does not di rectly address fe deral information technology it can be expected to play key role in determining whether agencies can successfully implement gpra in many cases the ability of agencies to collect and measure program performance data and to verify and validate results will depend on efficient and effective it systems in its review of agency strategic plans managing for results critical issues for improving federal agencies strategic plans gaoggd97180 gao concludes that inform ation gathering is major obstacle to gpra implementation the gao suggest s that the questionable capacity of many agencies to gather performance in formation has hamper ed and may continue to hamper efforts to identify appropriate goals and confidently assess performance not surprisingly information systems become critical factor in enabling agencies to effectively implement gpra without reliable it systems says gao agencies will not be able to gather and analyze the information they need to measure their performance as required by the results act yet despite the criticality of it systems gao determined that most of the 27 agency strategic plans did not cover strategies for improving the information management needed to achieve their strategic goals the plans provided few tails on how agencies plan to upgrade or utilize their it systems in order to better gather and measure performance data in parrticular gao cites opms fa ilure to discuss year 2000 despite the fact that many of its critical information systems are date dependent and exchange information with virtually every federal agency the gao also criticizes dods plan which did not specifically address information secu rity even though dod recognizes that information warfare capability is one of number of areas of particular concern especially as it involves vulnerabilities that could be exploited by potential opponents of the united states finally says gao in order to ensure that federal it systems can adequately support gpra implementation it is important for agencies to follow through with implementation of the chief financial officers act pl 101576 the clinger cohen act pl 104106 and the paperwork reduction act pl 10413 indeed gpra can be viewed as part of the st atutory framework put in place during the 1990s to address weaknesses in the management of federal programs including itrelated programs in particular the clingercoh act requires agencies to consider how information systems will help them carry out their missions and the performance they can expect from those investments ultima tely the success or fa ilure of federal it initiatives is likely to be viewed not only within the context of the clingercohen act but also within the context of gpra and the extent to which agencies meet their overall strategic goals and performance standards see alsogenevieve j knezo government performance and results act implementation and issues of possible concern crs report 971028 14 july 1998

part of c ongressional debate reform was rooted in changing or repealing the 1965 automatic data proce ssing act or as it was more popularly known the brooks act the brooks ac t was intended to address problems of passive partial or informal types of leadership in the purchasing leasing maintenance operation and utilization of automatic da ta processing adp by federal agencies federal agencies had reported that they were having difficulty complying with regulations for annual agencywide adp budget reviews the brooks act was intended to cen tralize and coordi nate this process by giving the general services administrati on gsa operational responsibi lity for adp management utiliza tion and acquisition over the past three decades however dvances in information technology and applications created new environment for federal agencies many viewed the brooks act as causing procurement delays im posing one size fits all standardized technology solutions and mismatching technology solu tions with agencies missions policymakers sought to redress these problems and reform the centralized federal acquisition procurement nd financial accounting system the clingercohen act or as it was passed the information t echnology management reform act was incorporated into the national defense au thorization act for fiscal year 1996 pl 104106 the clingercohen act named after its principal cosponsors was intended to provide the executive branch flexibility to acquire technologies and services incrementally enter into modular rather than more costly longerterm contracts and obtain inform ation technologies and services to fit agency needs the major provisions of the clin gercohen act are the following it eliminated gsas central role for setting information technology

omb broad role in coordinating and facilitating interagency it communication on policies to date many in government and the private sector are encouraged that the acts provisions have provide d overall cost reductions fo r the federal government many contend that the law has greatly impr oved the efficiency of individual agencies as information technology purchases and applications are more tailored to each agencys need and mission the longterm savings to the federa l government could be significant yet wideranging fede ral information technology reform is still relatively uncharted territory supporters also contend that the laws provisions based on successfully proven pr ivate sector initiatives also have decentralized and reduced the bureaucracy inherent in fe deral information technology management policy and will likely result in improved federal services in the near future supporters also contend that the creation of federal agency cios and the nascent pilot programs will provide federal agencies with the expertise and the procedures for evaluating success and failure several federal agencies have made significant inroads in changing federal informati on management through their cio offices yet it is unclear whether total dollar fi gure in savings can be determined under this law some are concerned that because federal agencies may be too focused on serving their own needs and missions st andardized information technologies applications and services may be lacking across the government they are not convinced that federal agencies will derive all of the benefits s upporters claim they argue that such benefits adopted from th private sector may not necessarily work where the mission is the public good not profit what policies w ill guide federal information technology managers use when forceful marketpl ace mechanisms such as profit and loss are not av ailable to purge failure finally some contend that simply provi ding for cios and pilot programs will not solve or perhaps even address the fundamental issue of developing good and responsive government can the clinge rcohen act live up to expectations that government reforms will produce better rvices some experts contend that without talented personnel federal information resour ces management irm will not fully benefit from the act some even state that the federal government is so far behind the private sector in attracting nd keeping irm expertise that amount of reform will reverse this trend according to an expert at th gao federal agencies are not identifying the skills they need and they can not afford to pay for the skills they need yet supporters are optimistic that the clingercohen act may create an environment where bright and skillful people are challenged by the flexibility and responsiveness arising from the law many hope that the act will usher in new age in which the best and the brightest in irm will enter the government and serve the

specialist in biomedical policy science technology and medicine divisionmedical records and privacy 7 the ability to ensure privacy of health recordsincluding those in federal agency databasesincreasingly is at risk due to several trends these include the growing use of information technologies in health care structural changes in the health care delivery and payment systems and information gathered from genetic testing these factors accentuate the fact that existing legal safeguards to protect patient confidentiality are limited in particular concer ns are raised about the increasing number of parties who have routine access to personally identifiable health records in institutions involved in health care treatment payment and oversight the growth in the application of information technologies in all aspects of health care delivery also creates new vulnerabilities for patient confidentiality the passage of the health insurance portability act of 1996 hipaa pl 104 191 has placed deadline pressure on congre ss to consider medical records privacy legislation hipaa requires the secretary of hhs to make recommendations to congress on ways to protect individually id entifiable information and to establish penalties for wrongful disclosure for health care transactions the secretary presented those recommendations on september 11 1997 congress has until august 1999 to enact privacy law or the act requires hhs to promulgate regulations on privacy protection within the following 6 months the concept of code of fair inform ation practices wh ich was recommended in early studies on privacy and is embe dded in the privacy act of 1974 remains fundamental to all proposals today for maintaining confidentiality of personal records fair information practices in clude among others establishing conditions for disclosure of personally identifiable information providing individuals with access to records held and the right to ma ke corrections and forcing penalties for noncompliance while consensus exists on the need to implement fair information practices for health records number of unresolved issues remain for example there was much criticism of the hhs recommendations for allowing law enforcement officials to gain access to personally identifiable health reco rds without additiona l safeguards beyond existing law finding the appropriate balance between access to health records for research purposes and individual privacy ri ghts continues to be the subject of much debate whether state law should be preem pted by uniform national law is highly contentious reliance on patient consent as the primary mechanism for protecting privacy versus establishing legal and regulatory mechanisms that provide baseline protections also is key question over dozen bills have been introduced in the 105th congress to provide protection for medical records confidentiality and to ensure that individuals are not discriminated against based on genetic information in addition medical records confidentiality provisions are included in much broader legislation intended to regulate health insurance through mana ged care plans hr 4250 and s 2330 hrhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98845crs15 4250 passed the house on july 24 1998 and has been placed on the calendar in the senate even as policymakers consider this legi slation several key i ssues remain they include the following federal preemption of state laws the question is the desirability of enacting federal medical privacy legislation that preempts either in whole or in part state privacy laws in some areas of law certain states are generally regarded as either having stronger privacy protections for certain types of information or as having acted in an area in the absence of federal law examples include the areas of mental health public health reporting and privileges such as the physi cianpatient privilege patient identifiers the provisions of the health insurance portability and accountability act direct the secretary of hhs to promulgate standards for identifiers for certain purposes advantages might include administrative simplification potentially reduced cost s for institutions and reimbursement systems and facilitating the linkage of valuable health da ta about patient that might be useful in providing improved care at the same time personal identifiers raise serious privacy concer ns perhaps linking federal government medical data with fi nancial data or empl oyment information patient rights to access fundamental element of code of fair information practices is the right of individuals to know about information being maintained about them and the right to amend incorrect records or supplement information there appears to be strong consensus that these principles should be part of any legi slation proposed to provide protection of medical records privacy health research efforts to restrict the access of researchers to information in medical records may conflict with the goal of improving patient care for example observational outcome studies rely on existing medical records data many research projects including those at federal research facilities require the use of identifiable records sometime s without the explicit consent of the individual researchers are concerne d that legislative proposals seeking to provide strong privacy

with simple location name for computers on the internet rather than using the more complex unique internet protocol i p number that designates their specific location as the internet has grown th method for allocating and designating domain names has become in creasingly controversial the internet originated with research funding provided by the department of defense advanced research projects agency darpa to establish military network as its use expanded civilia n segment evolved with support from the national science foundation n sf and other science agencies while there are formal

information sciences institute and has been funded primarily by the department of defense prior to 1993 the national science f oundation nsf was responsible for registration of nonmilitary generic top level domains gtlds such as com org net and edu in 1993 the nsf entered in to 5year cooperative agreement with network solutions inc nsi to operate internet domain name registration services in 1995 the agreement was modified to allo w nsi to charge registrants 50 fee per year for the first two years of which 70 went to nsi to cover its costs and 30 was deposited in the intellectual infrastructure fund to be reinvested in the internet since the imposition of fees in 1995 critic ism arose over nsis sole control over registration of the gtlds in addition th ere was an increase in trademark disputes arising out of the enormous growth of regi strations in the com domain with the cooperative agreement between nsi and nsf due to expire in 1998 the administration through the department of commerce doc began exploring ways to transfer administration of th dns to the private sector in the wake of much discussion among in ternet stakeholders and after extensive public comment on previous proposal the doc on june 5 1998 issued final statement of policy management of internet names and addresses also known as the white paper the white paper states that the us government is prepared to recognize and enter into agreement with new notforprofit corporation formed by private sector internet stakeholders to administer policy for the internet name and address system in deciding upon an entity with which to enter such an agreement the us government will assess whether the new system ensures stabilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98845crs17 competition private and bottomup coordi nation and fair repr esentation of the internet community as whole in effect the white paper endorsed pr ocess whereby the divergent interests of the internet community would come toge ther and decide how internet names and addresses will be managed and administered accordingly internet constituencies from around the world calling themselves the international forum on the white paperor ifwp held series of meetin gs during the summer of 1998 to discuss how the new corporation newco might be constituted and structured in september of 1998 iana in collaboration with nsi released proposed set of bylaws and articles of incorporation for new entity called the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers icann the proposal was cr iticized by some internet stakeholders who claimed that icann does not adequately represent consensus of the entire internet community accordingly other competing proposals for newco were submitted to doc on october 20 1998 the doc tentatively approved the icann proposal pending the satisfactory resolution of several remaining concerns raised by the competing proposals including accountab ility transparent decisionmaking processes and conflict of interest the doc will begin work on transition agreement with icann on november 6 icann announced that it had submitted revised set of corporate bylaws to doc which are intended to address doc concerns meanwhile nine members of icanns interim board have been chosen four americans three europeans one from japan and one from australia the white paper also signaled docs intention to ramp down the governments cooperative agreement with nsi with th objective of introducing competition into the domain name space while maintaining stab ility and ensuring an orderly transition on october 6 1998 doc and nsi announced an extens ion of the cooperative agreement between the federal govern ment and nsi through september 30 2000 during this transition period government obligations will be terminated as dns responsibilities are transferred to the ne wco specifically nsi has committed to timetable for development of shared registration system that will permit multiple registrars including nsi to provide registration services within the com net and org gtlds by march 31 1999 nsi will establish test bed supporting actual registrations by five registrars who will be accredited by the newco according to the agreement the shared registration sy stem will be deployed by june 1 1999 and fully implemented and available to all accr edited registrars by october 1 1999 nsi will also continue to administer the root server system until receiving further instruction from the government during the 105th congress number of dns hearings were held by the house committees on science on commerce and on the judiciary the hearings explored issues such as governance trademark issues how to foster competition in domain name registration services and how the administration will manage and oversee the transition to private sector ownership of the dns most recently the house committees on commerce and on science held hearings on june 10 and october 7 1998 respectively on october 15 th chairman of the house committee on commerce sent letters of inquiry to doc and the white house reflecting concerns that the process which produced the icann proposal was insufficiently open and responsive to the interests of all internet stakeholders httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98845crs18 one of the thorniest issues surrounding the dns is the resolution of trademark disputes that arise in designating domain names in the early years of the internet when the primary users were academic in stitutions and government agencies little concern existed over trademarks and domain names as the internet grew however the fastest growing number of requests fo r domain names were in the com domain because of the explosion of businesses offe ring products and services on the internet since domain names have been available fro m nsi on firstcome firstserve basis some companies discovered that their na had already been registered the situation was aggravated by some people registering domain names in the hope that they might be able to sell them to companies that place high value on them and certain companies registering the names of all their product lines the increase in conflicts over property rights to certain trademarked names has resulted in several lawsuits under the current policy nsi does not determine the legality of registrations but when tradem ark ownership is demonstrated has placed the use of name on hold until the parties involved resolve the domain name dispute the white paper calls upon the world inte llectual property organization wipo to convene an internati onal process including individua ls from the private sector and government to develop set of r ecommendations for trademarkdomain name dispute resolutions wipo is developi ng recommendations and is scheduled to present them to the newco in march 1999 meanwhile the next generation internet research act of 1998 pl 105305 direct s the national academy of sciences to conduct study of the short and longterm effects on trademark rights of adding new generic toplevel domains and related dispute re solution procedures another dns issue relates to the disposition of the intellectual infrastructure fund derived from domain name registration fees collected by nsi the fund grew to 56 million before nsf and nsi disconti nued collecting fees for the fund as of april 1 1998 number of suggestions we re offered for use of the fund including returning money to registrants setting up nonprofit entity to allocate funds or using it for global administrative projects such as internet registries in developing countries the vahudindependent agen cies fy1998 appropriations act pl 10565 directed nsf to credit up to 23 milli on of the funds to nsfs research and related activities account for ne xt generation internet ac tivities class action suit filed by six internet users against nsf and nsi in october 1997 questioned the legal authority of nsf to allow nsi to charge for registering internet addresses and requested 55 million in refunds the suit so sought to prevent the government from spending the money as directed by congress on april 6 1998 us district judge thomas hogan dismissed the charge that nsf lacked authority to permit nsi to collect fees but let stand another ch arge challenging the portion of the fee collected for the infra structure fund however the fy1998 emergency supplemental appropriations act pl 105174 enacted on may 1 1998 contains language ratifying and legalizing the infra structure fund accordingly judge hogan reversed his decision thereby allowing nsf to spend the 23 million from the fund through fy1999 on the next ge neration internet program see also jane bortnick griffith and lennard g kruger internet domain names

gy and medicine division electronic commerce 9 on july 1 1997 the clinton administration released its report framework for global electronic commerce this report provi ded several policy recommendations for enhancing electronic commerce on the internet and outlined where the us private sector should tinue to develop electronic commerce and those areas where federal government po licies are appropriate for oversight and regulation of electronic commerce the re port provided four ove rarching principles to guide federal policy and nine specific policy areas where the principles would be applied congress has res ponded to many of these principles and policy areas including taxation of electronic commerce the clinton administrations interest in global electronic networks was addressed in president clintons first rm in 1994 vice president gore gave speech in buenos aires argentina calling for the establishment of global network of networkswhat he descri bed as global information infrastructure gii the gii would be the international counterpart to the administrations national information infrastructure nii the nii was introduced in 1993 as policy platform in which the clinton administr ation would use public and private sector partnerships to strengthen and expand the nations information networks vice president gore drew upon the nii when pr oposing the gii expanding national policy to global policy the vice president stated that three major developments could arise from the creation of gii its applications could result in greater democracy worldwide it could act as catalyst for economic growth and more global trade among all nations and it could become an important element for sustainable growth for lesser developed nd developing nations the administration repeated these principles at g7 meeting in brussels belgium in february 1995 the topic of this g7 meeting was to address what international policies could result in greater liberalization of global telecommunications policies and connections while the representatives of many nations supported the us gii position others raised concerns about the reciprocity of global commerce without multilateral agreements to ensure compliance by all nations subsequent internationa l telecommunications conferences and agreements brought more discussion on the best way to further open global electronic commerce on february 5 1998 an agreement reached by 70 countries under the auspices of the world trade organization wto went in to effect the wto telecommunications services agreement is expected to liberalize trade in basic telecommunications services benefit us telecommunications companies by permitting them greater entry into foreign markets and facilitate ec onomic growth this agreement came almost two years to the day after the telecommunications act of 1996 pl 104104 was signed into law by president clinton significantly deregulating much of the us telecommunications market and opening it to greater competitionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98845crs20 still some concerns remain regarding security and privacy taxation and export control policy in global networ ks many contend that since the internet already is global cooperative network of networks with multitude of users there is little need for government or governments to further regulate or oversee commercial development others howev er contend that as electronic commerce expands new framework will be needed to help ensure the integrity and safety of transactions on global networks the july 1997 administration report used the gii policy as the foundation for establishing four principles to guide us policy on electronic commerce they are the private sector should lead for electronic commerce to flourish the administration stated that the private sector should lead in the continued innovation services partic ipation and pricing of electronic commerce on the internet governments should avoid undue res trictions on ectronic commerce parties should be able to enter into legitimate agreements to buy and sell products and services across the internet with minimal government involvement or interference government involvement if needed should be predictable minimalist and consistent there may be instances where regulation of the private sector may be needed or national interest s supersede commerce however the administration contends that gove rnment policies should establish predictable and simple legal environment not topdown administrative regulation the internet is uniqueand this quality should be maintained governments should recognize the uni qualities of the internet which includes its decentralized nature and its open access regulatory frameworks that may not fit these qualities should be reviewed and possibly revised rather than constraining electronic commerce possibilities on the internet in turn the clinton administration advocat ed that these four principles should be applied to nine policy areas taxati on payments uniform commercial code intellectual property rights privacy security infrastructure content and standards like the gii and g7 discussion in brusse ls these principles and policy areas are intended to be global in sc ope and application the administration cautions against handful of nations making electronic commerce policy decisions without broad consensus from the rest of the world in the 105th congress some of these issues such as privacy and security were already being addressed within the context of the existing debate of us policies for medical records and encryption which also had significant globa l ramifications in other areas such as standards and intell ectual property protec tion the congress has examined the use of multinational organi zations like the world trade organization to both address these issues and to seek reformshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98845crs21 10prepared by rita tehan information research specialist congressional reference division and glenn j mcloughlin specia list in technology and telecommunications policy science technolo gy and medicine division one area however which did not fit cleanly into an existing domestic or international policy issue was the issue of taxation of electronic commerce on the internet during the 105th congress this has become very contentious issue the clinton administrations report recommends that there be new taxation of electronic commerce on the internet by federal state or local governments the administration has contended that ec onomic growth from electronic commerce would offset any losses of federal revenue and that u ltimately successful electronic commerce will mean higher corporate profits which are taxed generally the us industry has supported this position howe ver many us state governors have contended that sales tax revenue from ectronic commerce could be an important part of states revenue base and have opposed th administrations position the 105th congress considered six bills that would either temporarily or permanently suspend taxation of internet access and electronic commerce one bill the internet tax freedom act hr 4105 was passed by both houses of congress and was included as part of the fy1999 omnibus appropriations act pl 105277 this law creates three year moratorium on the ability of state and local governments to tax electronic commerce during this time an advisory commission on electronic commerce would examine this issue and report within two years back to the congress and the president on its findings of tax policy and electronic commerce it is likely that the 106th congress will monitor this issu and conduct add itional oversight hearings in the coming

department of defense staff working on defense projects to communicate electronically and to share the computing resources of the few powerful but geographically parate computers of the time by 1983 the term the internet came into use to describe the concept of interconnecting networks in 1985 the national science foundati on nsf funded veral national supercomputer centers with the intenti on of making these supercomputer centers available to the research community in universities across the country many state and regional universities had already developed local and regional networks the nsf funded network linking the five orig inal supercomputer centers and offered to let any of the regional and university computer centers that could physically reach this network connect to it this was the seed of the internet network as we know it today and the original reason to connect to it was for remote access to supercomputer facilities in november 1987 nsf awarded contract to several private sector firms and the state of michigan to upgrade and ope rate the nsf networ k nsfnet backbone the purpose of the nsfnet backbone by this time was to link the growing regional networks set up by various university systems in 1990 arpanet ceased operation because nsfnet and various midlevel networ ks sponsored by nsf made the internet viable for commercial traffic dod tinues to run military
