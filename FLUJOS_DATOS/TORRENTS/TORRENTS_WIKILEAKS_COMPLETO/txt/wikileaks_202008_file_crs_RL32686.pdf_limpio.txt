have become significant negative factors in afghanistans fragile political and economic orde r over the last 25 years afghan us and coalition efforts to provide viable economic alternatives to poppy cultivation and to disrupt corruption and narcoterrorist linkages succeeded in reducing opium poppy cultivation in some areas during 2004 and 2005 however escalating violence particularly in helmand and widespread corruption fueled surge in cultivation in 2006 and 2007 pushing opium output to alltime highs cultivation has decreased in northcentral afghanistan and skyrocketed in the southwest in spite of ongoing efforts by the afghan government the united states and their partners afghanistan is now the source of 93 of the worlds illicit opium across afghanistan militia commanders criminal organizations and corrupt officials have exploited narcotics as reliable source of revenue and patronage which has perpetuated the threat these groups pose to the countrys fragile internal security and the legitimacy of its embryonic democratic government officials estimated that incountry illicit revenue from the 2006 opium poppy crop reached over 3 billion sustaining fears that afghanistans economic recovery continues to be underwritten by drug profits the trafficking of afghan drugs also appears to provide financial and logistical support to range of extremist groups that continue to operate in and around afghanistan including the resurgent remnants of the taliban and some qaeda operatives although coalition forces may be less frequently relying on figures involved with narcotics for intelligence and security support many observers have warned that drug related corruption among appointed and electe d afghan officials may create new political obstacles to further progress president bush personally stated in february 2007 that narcotics are direct threat to free future for afghanistan and warned that the taliban uses drug money to buy weapons and they pay afghans to take up arms against the government afghan president hamid karzai has identified the opium economy as the single greatest challenge to the longterm security development and effective governance of afghanistan in august 2007 the administration unveiled plans to strengthen counternarcotics efforts through renewed focus on promoting rural development coordinating counterinsurgency and counternarcotics and building political will members of the 110 th congress may be asked to consider options for further strengthening counternarcotics efforts the administration requested 154 billion

produced in afghanistan during the 20062007 season that supplied 93 of the worlds illicit opium1 afghan us and international officials have stated that opium poppy cultivation and drug trafficking constitute serious strategic threats to the security and stability of afghanistan and jeopardize the success of post911 counterterrorism and reconstruction efforts in light of the 911 commissions recommendation that the united states make longterm commitment to the security and stability of afghanistan counternarcotics policy has emerged as focal point of recurring debate in the bush administration and in congress concerning the united states strategic objectives in afghanistan and the global war against terrorism concerns include the role of us military personnel in counternarcotics activities and strategies for continuing the simultaneous pursuit of counterterrorism and counternarcotics goals which may be complicated by practical necessities and emerging political realities coalition forces pursuing regional security and counterterrorism objectives may rely on the cooperation of commanders tribal leaders and local officials who may be involved in the narcotics trade similarly us officials and many observers believe that the introduction of democratic system of government to afghanistan has been ac companied by the election and appointment of narcoticsassociated individuals to positions of public office efforts to combat the opium trade in afghanistan face the challenge of ending highlyprofitable enterprise that has become deeply interwoven w ith the economic political and social fabric of wartorn country afghan us and international authorities are engaged in campaign to reverse an unprecedented upsurge of opium poppy cultivation and heroin production they continue to implement multifaceted counternarcotics initiative that includes public awareness campaigns judicial reform measures economic and agricultural development assistance drug interdiction operations and more robust poppy eradication the bush administration and c ongress continue to consider options for upgrading us support for counternarcotics efforts in afghanistan in order to meet the challenges posed by the afghan opium economy to the security of afghanistan and the international community questions regarding th likely effectiveness resource requirements and implications of new counternarcotics strategies in afghanistan are likely to arise during the first session of the 110 th congress as such options continue to be debated

periods of insurgency civil war fundamentalist government and recently international engagement figures 1 and 2 during the 20062007 poppy growing season afghanistan produced world record opium poppy crop that yielded 8200 mt of illicit opiuman estimated 93 of the worlds supply this continued the significant reversal of the slight downward trend in national poppy cultivation and opium output that occurred from 2004 to 2005 afghan government and united nations reporting finds that downward trends continue in many nor thern provinces while remote areas in eastern provinces and the conflictridden southern provin ces continue to provide growth opportunities for traffickers and farmers in relation to this trend the united nations office on drugs and crime unodc concludes that opium cultivation in afghanistan is longer associated with poverty but rather is now closely linked to insurgency as the taliban have started to extract from the drug economy resources for arms logistics and militia pay 3 narcotics experts describe afghanistans opium economy as the backbone of multibillion dollar drug trade that stretches throughout central and southwest asia and supplies heroin to consumption markets in europe russia the midd east and the united states millions of afghans remain involved with various aspects of the opium trade including farmers laborers traffickers warlords and government officials some experts have warned that the consolidation of existing relationships between these groups threatens to transform afghanistan into failed narcostate

afghan ministry of counternarcotics mcn opium poppy cultivation took place in 21 afghan provinces in 20062007 see figure 3 the land area under poppy cultivation rose by 59 to 165000 hectares in 20052006 equal to 365 of afghanistans arable land the increase was concentrated in conflictridden helmand province which produced over 69000 hectares of poppy42 of the national total and an area greater than or equivalent to the entire countrys poppy cultivation for most of the 1980s and 1990s the us government estimates that 172600 hectares were cultivated in 2006 the 20062007 opium poppy crop produced 8200 mt of illicit opium 34 increase from the prior season crop yields improved 15 due to better weather conditions range of accepted opium to heroin conversion rates indicate that this

afghan families cultivated opium poppy in 20062007 64 increase from 2005 and equal to roughly 33 million people or 143 of the afghan population over 500000 laborers and an unknown number of traffickers warlords and officials also participate the estimated 1 billion farmgate value of afghanistans 20062007 illicit opium harvest is equivalent in value to approximately 13 of the countrys licit gdp trafficking proceeds may exceed 2 billion many licit and emerging industries are financed or supported by profits from narcotics trafficking 5 the 2007 unodcmcn report identifies insecurity and poor governance as the major factors that fueled the large growth in poppy cultivation and opium production during the 20052006 season the report echoes previous assessments that significant sustainable declines in opium poppy cultivation occurred in provinces and districts that were economically integrated and politically stable and in those that received alternative livelihood assistance and where effective eradication took place other observers have pointed to the steady increase in opium production volume that has occurred since late 2001 and argued that excess opium supply has reduced raw opium price levels table 1 and may undercut price incentives for farmers to cultivate poppy price levels have declined across afghanistan as poppy cultivation and opium production have increased since 2004 6 note the following figures display trends in poppy cultivation and opium production in afghanistan over the last 25plusyears the sharp declines in the 20002001 growing season are related to the taliban decision to ban opium poppy cultivation according to us officials opium trafficking continued unabated 5 edouard martin and steven symansky macroeconomic

following the soviet invasion of 1979 and during the civil war that ensued in the aftermath of the soviet withdrawal opium poppy cultivation expanded in parallel with the gradual collapse of state

further fueled afghan opium poppy cultivation and narcotic production as taliban officials coopted their military opponents with promises of permissive cultivation policies and mirrored the practices of their warlord predecessors by collecting tax revenue and profits on the growing output 11 in 1999 afghanistan produced peak of over 4500 mt of raw opium which led to growing international pressure from states whose populations were c onsuming the end products of seemingly endless supply of afghan drugs in response the taliban announced ban on opium poppy cultivation in late 2000 but allowed the opiate trade to continue fueling speculation that the decision was designed to contribute to their marginalized go vernments campaign for international legitimacy under the ban opium poppy cultivation was reduced dramatically and overall opium output fell to 185 mt mainly because of continued cultivation and production in areas under the control of northern alliance forces individual northern alliance commanders also taxed opium production and transportation within their zones of control and continued producing opium and trafficking heroin following the taliban prohibition 12 although us and international officials initially applauded the taliban policy shift many experts now believe that the ban was designed to increase the market price for and potential revenue from stocks of afghan

cultivation in afghanistan opium trade field researcher david mansfield argues that the great diversity in the socio economic groups involved in opium poppy in afghanistan and the assets at their

patterns and motives vary from district to district g8g138g155g150g142g155g156g561 field studies have identified several structural barriers that limit the profitability of opium poppy cultivation for the average afghan farmer many afghan farming households cultivate opium poppy in order to improve their access to land water agricultural supplies and creditinputs that remain in short supply in many of the rural areas where opium poppy is grown experts have identified high levels of household debt as powerful structural determinant of the continuation of opium poppy cultivation among some afghan farmers an opiumforcredit system known as salaam allows farmers to secure loans to buy necessary supplies and provisions if they agree in advance to sell future opium harvests at rates as low as half their expected market value crop failures that occurred as result of severe fouryear nationwide drought 19982001 reportedly caused many farming households to accumulate large amounts of debt in the form of salaam loans based on future cultivation of opium poppy in some cases the introduction of strict poppy cultivation bans and crop eradication policies by the taliban in 2001 and the afghan interim authority in 2002 and 2003 increased the debt levels of many afghan farmers by destroying opium crops that served as collateral for salaam arrangements although the afghan government issued decree banning opiumbased loans and credit in april 2002 the 2005 unodcmcn opium survey reported that salaam lending had continued increased debt has led some farmers to mortgage land and to agree to cultivate opium poppy in 15 analysis in this report relating to the motives and methods of afghan farmers land owners and traffickers is based on the findings of the unodcs strategic studies ries on

farmers have reportedly been forced to accept the crop selection choices of landowners who control their access to land and water and who favor opium poppy over other traditional crops according to experts this combination of droughtinduced debt predatory traditional lending systems and the unintended sideeffects from government cultivation bans and eradication programs has fueled opium poppy cultivation in afghanistan the 2005 unodcmcn opium survey warned that in areas where farmers carry high salaam and other loan debt significant decreases in opium poppy cultivation and associated revenue may be potentially problematic and could have created severe financial pressure on to farmers to resume opium production in 2006 in order not to default g14g138g151g141g561g17g160g151g142g155g156g561 afghan land owners are better positioned to profit from opium poppy cultivation because of the labor intensive nature of the opium production process land owners who control vital opium cultivation inputs like land water and fertilizers enjoy an economic advantage in the opium production cycle which places heavy demands on afghanistans rural agricultural labor market during annual opium poppy planting maintenance and harvesting seasons wealthy land owners secure the services of skilled itinerant laborers to assist in the complex opium harvesting process which improves their crop yields and profits itinerant laborers in turn contribute to the spread of opium cultivation expertise around afghanistan 17 although opium prices have fallen since reaching peak of 350kg in 2002 farmers have experienced greater profit loss than land owners18 land owners also have benefitted from consolidation of property related to rising debt levels among afghan farmers land valuation base d on potential opium yields also benefits land owners g22g155g138g143g143g146g140g148g142g155g156g561 international market prices for heroin and intermediate opiates such as morphine ensure that individuals and groups engaged in the shipment and distribution of refined opium products earn substantially higher profits than those involved with cultivating and producing raw opium gum19 according to the unodc most of the opium produc ed in afghanistan is converted to heroin within the country20 although opium refining facilities that produce morphine base and heroin traditionally have been located in tribal areas along the afghan border with pakistan the growth and spread of opium cultivation in recent years has led to corresponding proliferation of opiate processing facilities the large proportion of heroin in the composition of drugs seized in countries neighboring afghanistan reflects this proliferation and suggests that the profitability of opiate trafficking for afghan groups has increased significantly in recent years although afghan individuals and groups play significant role in trafficking opiates within afghanistan and into surrounding countries relatively few afghans have been identified as participants in the international narcotics trafficking operations that bring finished opiate products 17 see unodc an

poppy eradication measures for the 20042005 growing season to provide strong deterrent to future cultivation the afghan central poppy eradication force cpef carried out limited operations with support from uk intelligence officers us advisors and international contractors in early 2005 field reports indicated that cpef personnel met violent resistance from farmers in some instances and largely failed to meet their eradication targets for the 20042005 season 89 state department officials identified the failure of 20042005 eradication activities as one factor behind the surge in poppy cultivation that occurred during the 20052006 season and made similar judgments with regard to the 20062007 crop the centrally organized and executed eradication plan in 20042005 marked departure from previous eradication campaign strategies which largely relied upon governors and local authorities to target and destroy crops most governors pledged to support president karzais eradication initiatives in 2005 and us officials report that areas where governors and local leaders embraced and enforced the central governments eradication demands saw significant reductions in poppy cultivation in response to these trends poppy elimination programs peps have been established in select afghan provinces as part of change toward governor led and centrally monitored eradication the

identified rural security and national rule of law as prerequisites for effective counternarcotics policy implementation while simultaneously identifying narcotics as primary threat to security and stability91 although an increasing number of afghan police security forces and counternarcotics authorities are being trained by us and coalition officials the size and capability of afghan forces may limit their power to effectively challenge entrenched drug trafficking groups and regional militia in the short term specifically questions remain as to whether afghan security and counternarcotics forces alone will be able to establish the security conditions necessary for the more robust eradication interdiction and alternative livelihood programs planned by us and afghan officials as of september 2007 new us initiatives were planned to strengthen afghan force protection capabilities from political perspective us officials maintain that parliamentary and provincial elections contributed to the political legitimacy of the central government and by extension its counternarcotics initiatives however the creation of sufficient political and military stability for effective counternarcotics operations is likely to remain significant challenge local police and officials are considered to be the best positioned to create conditions of security necessary for full spectrum counternarcotics activity they also are considered to be the most susceptible to narcotics related corruption the death of several local contractor employees working on usaid alternative livelihood projects in may 2005 brought renewed urgency to concerns about the provision of security as prerequisite for nonenforcement related counternarcotics programs

local militia commanders with alleged links to the opium trade played significant roles in coalition efforts to undermine the taliban regime and capture qaeda operatives particularly in southeastern afghanistan since late 2001 some of these figures have been incorporated into government and security structures including positions of responsibility for enforcing counternarcotics policies 92 according to afghanistan scholar barnett rubin the empowerment and enrichment of the warlords who allied with the united states in the antitaliban efforts and whose weapons and authority now enabled them to tax and protect opium traffickers have provided the opium trade with powerful new protectors 93 pragmatic decisions taken since 2001 to prioritize counterterrorism operations and current plans to enforce counternarcotics policies more strictly may conflict with each other forcing afghan and coalition authorities to address seemingly difficult contradictions tactical coalition allies 91

eradication argued that destroying large portion of the 2004 2005 opium poppy crop was necessary in order to establish credible deterrent before opium production in afghanistan reaches an irreversible level critics of widespread nearterm eradication argued that eradication in the absence of existing alternative livelihood options for afghan farmers would contribute to the likelihood that farmers would continue to cultivate opium poppy in the future by deepening opium based debt and driving up opium prices99 us and afghan authorities maintain that the central poppy eradication force and governorled eradication programs were effective in deterring and reducing some opium poppy cultivation in 2005 however given recurrent clashes between eradication forces and farmers and accounts of selective politicized eradication efforts by local authorities some observers and officials have expressed concern about the safety and effectiveness of current groundbased eradication efforts during the 2006 season poppy elimination program teams were partially introduced to key opium poppy growing provinces to monitor and direct early season locallyexecuted eradication activities this strategy

the government has also decided that eradication must only be delivered by manual or mechanical ground based means101 us officials have argued for more widespread and nonnegotiated eradication operations and have stated that while herbicides may be efficient and safe us officials will follow the decisions of afghan officials concerning their potential use proponents of aerial eradication argue that the large amount of rural land under poppy cultivation in afghanistan and poor road infrastructure makes groundbased eradication inefficient subjects eradication teams to unnecessary security threats and raises associated costs critics of aerial eradication argue that the mixedcrop cultivation patterns common throughout afghanistan will expose legitimate food crops to damage and warn that aerial spraying may produce widespread possibly violent resistance by villagers with vivid memories of centrally directed soviet military campaigns to destroy food crops and agricultural infrastructure the senate report on the fy2005 supplemental appropriations bill hr 1268 specified that none of the funds recommended by the committee may be available for aerial eradication programs within afghanistan absent formal request by the president of afghanistan seeking such support manual herbicide spraying by afghan eradication teams may be under consideration for future introduction as means of improving efficiency herbicidebased eradication whether aerial or manual remains politically sensitive reports of unauthorized aerial spraying in eastern nangarhar province in midnovember 2004 angered afghan officials and led to an investigation by the afghan ministries of agriculture and health of claims that crops had been sprayed with herbicides by unidentified aircraft the government investigation reportedly revealed that unidentified chemicals were present in soil samples that nonnarcotic crops had been destroyed and that an increase in related illnesses in local villages had occurred afghan officials cited us control of afghan airspace in their subsequent demands for an explanation us and british officials have denied involvement in the spraying and assured afghan authorities that they support president karzais position 102 in early december 2004 then us ambassador to afghanistan zalmay khalilzad suggested that some drugassociated people may have sprayed the crops in order to create the sort of distrust and problem between afghanistan and some of its allies 103 observers noted that the vocal negative reaction of the afghan population and government to an alleged isolated spraying incident illustrates the type of popular opposition that may accompany any future herbicide spraying eradication program in january 2007 president karzai announced that any herbicidebased eradication efforts would be delayed until 2008 at the earliest and presidential spokesmen repeated their criticism of herbicides in september afghan government officials would have to approve any future herbicide spraying operations undertaken by us or afghan personnel in af ghanistan any future aerial eradication in afghanistan also would require significant funding and the introduction of airframes and military support aircraft that exceed current us capabilities in the region herbicidebased eradication programs if employed in the future could feature the use of the
