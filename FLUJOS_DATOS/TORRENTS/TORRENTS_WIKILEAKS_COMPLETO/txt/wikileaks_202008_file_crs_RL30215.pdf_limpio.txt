other charges that could be used for conservation management and enforcement other prominent i ssues may include how to define fishing community whether to revise the fishery management plan review process and how best to manage highly migratory species because of the major changes that have occurred in marine fisheries since the msfcma originated in the mid1970s some suggest that the underl ying management structure of us fisheries should be reviewed to reassess whether fisheries s hould be managed at the regi onal or nationa l level in addition both the pew oceans co mmission and the us commission on ocean policy have recommended ma jor changes in us fishery management policy potential participants in the reauthorization debate anticipate extended negotiations on some of these issues and on concerns that have arisen as the 1996 msfcma amendments in the sustainable fisheries act have been implemented in the house the committee on resources has jurisdiction over any msfcma

concerns2 congress has been active in and s upportive of fishery conservation and management issues for many years responding primarily to concerns of environmental interests native americans and commercial and recreational fishing groups congress generally seems to view the msfcma as working well while possibly needing certain changes to address concerns that have arisen since the 1996

disagree about how best to achieve these goals and use our common resources and conflicts arise the following descriptions are general characterizations there is enormous variability and crossover of membership among these groups which often blurs the distinction among the concerns within each group for example fishery scientists may act as objective indepe ndent analysts or serve as advocates for specific sector with the same scientist performing multiple roles on different issues as congress considers reauthoriz ation of the msfcma these diverse groups will advocate wide variety of policies recreational fishing interests3 in 2002 more than 105 million anglers fished in marine recreational fisheries accounting for 73 million fishing trips4 the marine finfish catch was estimated to be 421

in decisions affecting access to and participation in us fisheries they are concerned that the substantial economic benefits to the nation of recreational fishing are not ade quately recognized moreover for fish conservation and habitat pr otection recreational inte rests would like federal managers to distinguish between the impacts of recreational fishing and those of commercial fish harvesting the balance between commercial and recreational interests varies widely among issues speci and regions with many regulations that restrict the activities of commercial fishermen such as closed areas and quota restrictions having little parallel for the recreational sector commercial fishing sector in 2001 there were more than 64000 commercial fishing boats and vessels operating in us marine fisheries9 and 3410 processing and wholesale plan ts employing 71533 individuals10 in 2002 the total catch of marine fish in the 50 states was 94 billion pounds with an estimated ex vessel

species which are typically discarded often dead because they are eith er illegal to retain or of an undesirable species size or sex 15 critics contend that subsistence is nonissue because groups or communities in the united states are starving or are likely to star ve as result of fishery harvest restrictions others however point out that subsistence lif estyle refers to traditional and

frequently maintain that there has been nationwide failure to protect habitat from fishing and nonfishing harm native americans because of their cultural traditional and subsistence15 needs many tribes and indigenous groups are deeply concerned about the management of marine fisher ies some tribes and indigenous groups are guaranteed access to certain fishery resources by treaty with the federal government obliged to protect and maintain these rights16 some tribes and groups are represented by fishery commissions that coordinate fishery management with federal agencies the longterm goals of tribes and indigenous groups generally include safeguarding cultural traditions promoting economic stab ility encouraging res ource sustainability and attaining regulatory certainty of particular concern during msfcma reauthorization will be cooperative management of mari ne fisheries ie partnership with the federal government in establishing policy and determining management goals which they believe fosters economic vitality environmental health and rational management of natural resources fishery scientists scientists from academia the private sector and state and federal agencies are principally invol ved in analyzing the ecologicalbiological social cultural and economic effect s of msfcma provisions and fishery management policy like the other groups they are concerned with the health and integrity of marine ecosystems the rati onal use of marine re sources and community sustainability specifically they are interest ed in the availability of adequate funding and accurate data to perform the necessary analyses many fishery scientists at some point in their careers may be employ ed as fishery managers since sound management is promoted by scientific understa nding of the resource fishery managers federal and state fishery managers are charged with implementing the msfcma and complementary state programs because of this responsibility their interests and concerns are more keenly focused on the pragmatic aspects of the msfcma specifically they are interested in clarity in the intent of management requirement s and in authorizations and re

proclamation aimed at implementing conservation measures outside and adjacent to american territorial waters17 the 1945 truman proc lamation cla iming us jurisdiction over us continental shelf resources adjacent to the u s coast has been viewed as the advent of coastal nations extending territorial seas and declaring fishery and economic zones president truman did not declare an exclusive economic zone nor claim rights to exclusive fishing but his unilateral proclamations on the seabed its subsoil and certain conservation zones served as the conceptual underpinnings of subsequent extensions18 in the late 1940s and early 1950s severa l latin american nations proclaimed marine jurisdictions extending 200 miles off their pacific coasts this action was denounced by those within the united states19 and other distantwater fishing nations who sought to preserve and expand access for farranging fishing vessels beginning in the 1950s atlantic and 1960s pacific incr easing numbers

revised fmps and draft implementing regulations are submitted to the secretary of commerce for approval approved plans are implemented through regulations published in the federal register together

changes to the goals and objectives of the msfcma and full implementation of these pr ovisions has been of great concern to many groups accordingly there has been considerable interest in the acti ons of regional councils and nmfs in implementing the sfa of particular concern to environmental groups and some members of congress is the progress of nmfs and regional c ouncils in implementin g sfa requirements in their review of proposed fmp amendmen ts some of the more critical interests suggest that regional councils have instituted only incr emental changes to current management practices thes critics contend that regi onal councils have satisfied only the minimum requirements and in some cases failed to comply with the law rather than fully embracing the new goals and objectives moreover they suggest that nmfs precipitated the poor perform ance of regional councils by delaying implementation guidance and by allowing substantial latitude in how regional councils implement the sfa provisions some commercial fishermen contend that the standards established by nmfs guidelines are unrealistic given the dearth of scientific inform ation they contend that this has resulted in assumptionbase d and modelbased goals that are at odds with implementing meaningful protecti on moreover some commercial fishing interests contend that given the magnitude of tasks set before regional councils and nmfs the timetables established by the sfa were unrealistic and hence delays were inevitable nmfs has not formally commented on the criticisms they indicate that their efforts have focused on accomplishing the myriad tasks set forth in the sfa and implementing the law rather than on addressing the concerns of citizens who disagreed with their strategy or progress subsequent

ocean commissions ocean policy review and outlook table in the appendix to this report compares the reports recommendations relating to marine fisheries as is normally the case crs takes position with respect to ither reports recommendationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30215crs11 34 an example can be seen with the bycatch issue where concerns for sea turtle survival although turtles are not bycatch as defined in the msfcma and more recently finfish bycatch reduction in shrimp trawls make this issue much more controversial in the gulf of mexico and south atlantic regionsissues for congress the remainder of this repor t discusses issues that ma be considered during any reauthorization debate on the msfcma ho wever few fishery issues are national in scope and regional concerns vary grea tly what may be major concern in one region may be inconsequen tial or entirely different in character in another34 thus many of these issues are likely to be debated in regional rather than national context some of the more controvers ial issues that may be addressed during reauthorization include 1 whether to fu rther specify the approaches to address bycatch and bycatch mortality 2 how to define manage and protect unique habitats 3 whether to legislate the desi gnation of marine protected areas 4 how to assure that necessary data are collected 5 how to manage marine ecosystems 6 how to assure that regional council deci sions are fair and balanced 7 how to implement and finance fishing capacity reduction programs 8 whether to establish national standards for individual fishin g quota management programs and 9 whether to authorize user fees and other ch arges that could be used for conservation management and enforcement many of these issues were addressed in 1996 additional issues have been prompted by the recommendations from the pew oceans commission and the us commission on ocean policy see oceans commissions above another matter of likely debate is the cu rrent management structure of regional councils and agency regulation and how they affect fisheries management the issue before congress is whether fisheries management could be improved through increased legislative control over regiona l council decisionmaking or by providing regional councils greater autonomy over thei r management activities those in favor of increased legislative control argue that it could quiet criticisms that fishery managers misinterpret the intent of c ongress and decrease pe rceived conflict of interest in regiona l council decisionmaking conve rsely local communities would likely be concerned that na tional management would lose sight of local issues others contend that increased congressional involvement in managing fisheries could lead to increased politicization and furt her increase the time it takes to respond to problems and concerns other prominent issues may include whether and how to increase fishery management data collection efforts how to define fishing community whether to revise the fmp review process how best to manage highly migratory species and whether to increase emphasis on preserving ecosystem health and longterm resource productivity these issues have arisen re peatedly and the msfcma often has been amended in attempts to address them to increase the usefulness and readability of this report the issues and concerns that follow are grouped according to similarity in subject matter although aspects ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30215crs12 35 16 usc 18022 36 16 usc 18029 37 16 usc 180233 38 the marine fish conservation network and the center for marine conservation missing the boat washington dc 1999 p 2many issues transcend this artificial grouping the order in which this information is presented does not represent ra nking or hierarchy of importance biological issues various constituencies have voiced concern regarding the need to clarify andor modify how the fishery resource is vi ewed under the msfcma these concerns range from narrow suggestions for impr oving aspects to reflect increasing understanding in fishery science to broa d commentary on what actions are necessary to achieve the overall msfcma goal of sustainable resource productivity bycatch bycatch is fish harvested in fishery but not sold or kept for personal use and include s economic discards and regulatory discards35 economic discards are fish that are targeted by the fi shery but are not retained because they are of an undesirable size sex or qua lity or for other economic reasons36 regulatory discards are fish harvested in fishery that fishermen are required by regulation to discard whenever caught or to retain but not sell37 the msfcmas definition of bycatch explicitly excludes fish released alive under recreational catchandrelease fishery management progra m section 2c3 of the msfcma encourages development of measures to minimize bycatch to the extent practicable and avoid the unnecessary waste of fish section 3019 establishes national standard that requires conservation and management measures to minimize bycatch and bycatch mortality environmental groups assert that many regional councils dr aft fmps generally do not meet the sfa requirements related to bycatch38 they charge that at best regional councils have concentrated thei r efforts on developing strategies and procedural measures rather than taking direct action to minimize bycatch and bycatch mortality environmental interest s also contend that many regional councils eg new england mida tlantic gulf of mexic and caribbean regional councils neglected to submit fmp ame ndments that addressed sfa bycatch requirements some environmental groups contend that most regiona l councils ve failed to assess the adequacy of current bycatch reporting methods and identify what is necessary to establish standardized bycatch reporting methods specific recommendations include accurately quantifying bycatch of target species fish discarded because they ar not marketable and nonta rget species fish caught incidentally accounting for catch and bycat ch before catch is sorted and expanding the use of nmfs observers to measure total catchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30215crs13 39 bycatch by its msfcma definition does not in clude incidentally caught sea turtles sea birds and other nonfish organisms 40 concerns about vessel bycatch allowances vbas include the following 1 some fishermen contend that vbas are both effici ent they provide the proper incentives for continuedsome fishery managers suggest that the msfcmas definition of bycatch may need to be reviewed as it is important to the practical implementation of bycatch controls in the msfcma these managers assert that while these definitions may seem clear in practice they are quite problematic bycatch in essence pertains to fish that are discarded39 thus one direct way fo r regional councils to reduce discards would be to require retention nd utilization of all catch however these managers and environmental groups suggest that this does not address the incidental catch of nontargeted species moreover th individuals suggest that the definition of economic discards is of little practical use contending that it might better be described as any discard that is not regulatory discard they also note that in many fisheries it is difficult to accurately determine the amount of regulatory discards for example nmfs fishery observers in north pacific groundfish fisheries collect data on total catch weights and estimate the percent of catch retained the difference being an estimate of the amount discarded the accuracy and reliability of these estimates are often questioned as means to better estimate total fishing mortality the sfa mandated standardized reporting to assess bycatch many fishery managers assert however that collecting accurate data may pose substantial financial burden and may be infeasible as an alternative these managers suggest that the msfcma definition of bycatch should be amended to include retain ed and discarded inci dental catch of fish and nonfish species eg sea birds and that the terms economic and regulatory discards should be eliminated additionally congressional consid eration of how best to discourage bycatch might also include initiating and monitoring full retention of catch with requirements for donating prohibited species to charitable organizations similarly some commercial fishing interests contend that the concept of regulatory discards needs to be addressed to better encourage the commercial sector to support fishery management st rategies they assert that the principle that fish are better discarded dead than brought to ma rket undermines any possibility of industry support for management actions they poi nt to the summer flounder fishery where as much as half of the total allowabl catch quota has been discarded because of minimum fish size limits and quotatrip limits despite the legislative and regulatory efforts of congress nmfs and the regional councils to ddress bycatch and waste these i ssues are still of great concern to the public environmental organizations recreational anglers and commercial fishermen during reauthorization these groups may suggest that congress consider creating additional incentives for commercial and recreational fishermen to avoid bycatch or reduce bycatch mortality of incidentally caught species g individual or vessel bycatch allowances40httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30215crs14 40 continued reducing bycatch and equitable they reward individuals who avoid bycatch or reduce bycatch mortality 2 conversely some environmental groups and other fishermen assert that vbas provide guarantee that bycatch will be reduced below what is currently allowed because the allocated bycatch effec tively becomes right to continue taking bycatch and 3 some scientists point out that individual observer data can be highly variable with potentially disparate effect on fishermen with vbas who may be saddled with incompetent lazy or dishonest observers 41 64 federal register 4030 jan 27 1999 42 person or vessel may use fishing gear or participate in fishery commercial and recreational not included in the list wit hout giving 90 days advance notice to the appropriate regional council or the secretary 64 federal register 4031 jan 27

fisheries or penalize individuals for high levels of bycatch and bycatch mortality and to incr ease funding for enforcement funding research for innovative fi shing gear that reduces bycatch andor bycatch mortality creating tax incentives for using bycatch reduction devices allowing nonprofit utilization of fish that would otherwise be discarded and increasing funding for nmfs to research and develop bycatch reduction measures some additional options to create incentiv for avoiding bycatch might be to increase funding to place more nm fs observers on board vessels to obtain reliable bycatch data strengthen the definition of bycatch to directly address the problems of nonselective fishing practices and correct the misinterpretation that equates dead discards of non target fish with voluntary release of target fish and require that all sources of mortality including dead discards becounted against total allowable catch quotas some fishery scientists suggest that the use of new fishing gear could greatly reduce bycatch and bycatch mortality currently the use of new gear is regulated by the list of fisheries and gear 50 cfr 600725v and notification guidelines 50 cfr 600747h 41 t h notification guidelines establish process for notifying regional councils or nmfs in the case of atlantic hms of the intent to use new gear42 and guidelines for approving new gear43 some fishery scientists are concerned that this proce ss is burdensome and discourag the development and use of new fishing gear they may suggest th at congress review the process by which regional councils authorize the use of ne w fishing gear and consider ways tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30215crs15 44 experimental fisheries are regulated under 50 cfr 6796 which allows regional administrators to authorize experimental fi sheries for groundfish in manner that would be otherwise prohibited some note that nmfssnoaa fisheries centralized control of scientific experimental and exempted permits has resulted in long delays in processing applications they recommend making permits available on regional basis 45 50 cfr 600815 46 50 cfr 600815a8 47 however critics of this approach suggest that any distinction between essential and continuedencourage the development and use of innovative fishing technologies44 specific to the development of innovative fishing g ear these scientists may suggest that congress require regional counc ils to discuss several add itional concerns in fmps including requirements for developing nd implementing bycatch reduction plans specific funding to study

statisticallyvalid studies for assessing the ffectiveness of bycatch reduction devices essential fish habitat section 305b of the msfcma establishes requirements for identifying describing c onserving

efh regulations provide some guidelines as to how efh is to be identified in fmps 45 including provisions for designating habitat areas of particular concern hapc that may be especially important to the longterm productivity of populations of one or more managed species46 fishery scientists environmental gr oups and commercial and recreational fishing interests are concerned about how nmfs the regional councils and others have interpreted these efh provisions additionally the paucity of tangible scientific data has been widely viewed as hindrance to identifying describing and conserving efh environmental groups commend the regional councils for their success in identifying and describing ef h however these groups suggest that while there have been some strides in ddressing the harm caused by fishing and nonfishing activities most regional councils ve yet to establish measures to reduce the harmful effects of fishing activities on habitat some envi ronmental groups view this lack of action as major shortco ming of efh implementation and suggest that congressional action might be required to force re gional councils to act the msfcma defines efh as those waters and substrate necessary to fish for spawning breeding feeding or growth to maturity there is considerable debate about how to distinguish between essential and none ssential habitat47 the aquatichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30215crs16 47 continued nonessential is substantially based on highly anthropogenic view of animal behaviorenvironment has few clearly defined boundaries thus bitat necessary to support fisheries is not easily recognizable or qua ntifiable for example salmonids use wide range of aquatic environments from ope n ocean to estuaries to inland rivers and lakes it has been argued that each of these areas is essential to salmon during some point in their life therefore any activity that occurs in this range of habitats could harm those waters and substr ate necessary to fish in cluding fishing shipping farming timber harvesting and hydropower production others contend that only portions of these environments may be essential to salmon the distinction between essential nd nonessential hab itat however is problematic managing an unbounded natural environm ent often necessitates drawing imaginary lines to regulate human activities within that environment to protect fish and other marine life from harmful human activities the msfcma required regional councils to describe and identify efh however the unlimited ocean environment combined with limited sc ientific information about fish life histories and habitat needs can result in somewhat arbitrary definitions of essential this ambiguity raises concerns among c onstituents about how regional councils are distinguishing efh some fishery scientists express concern that regional councils have defined efh for some species in overly broad terms for example the p acific regional council defines efh for salmonids to include all waters of the eez and all freshwater areas that contain or have contained salmonids these scientists are concerned that regional councils have not distinguished between essential and nonessential parts of range of habitat choosing instead to define all habitat as essential these scientists suggest that by perhaps modify ing the definition of efh congress could better direct how regional counc ils are to make efh deter minations some scientists suggest modifying 305b to include simple statement that fish habitat is divided into areas that are essential and those th at are nonessential that an explanation be included in the fmp of the criteria by which these determinations are made and that actions that damage efh be described other scientists believe that attempts to divide habitat into esse ntial and nonessen tial components woul d be unworkable most notably because of the lack of scientific data and create further delays in implementing efh provisions they suppor t efh designations based on available data and believe that nmfs and regiona l councils have appr opriately used precautionary approach in identifying efh in their opinion regional councils did not define efh arbitrarily ra ther regional councils used fish distribution as proxy for efh in defining the efh boundaries th ey assert that the controversy lies in where within the bounds of efh fish distribution should be defined as essential because data are not available to ascertain the exact relationship between fish and habitat they believe that most regional councils have correctly used stock distribution and density data to identify efh moreove r they note that as more and better data become available efh can be narrowed by revising the efh provisions in fmps other suggestions for identifying and describing efh include the following 1 because of its critical importance to fish survival include all substrate areas thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30215crs17 48 living near deposited on or sinking to the bottom of the sea 49 as noted above the efh regulations encourage regional councils to identify habitat areas of particular concern ie rare or ecolo gically important areas of efh to focus efh protection effortsa demersal48 or nondemersal species uses during any part of its life history as efh and where possible divide into prima ry secondary and rtiary habitats 2 distinguish between efh and critical habitat with critical habitats defined as those areas where significant ecological harm could imperil the species or stock in question49 and 3 increase the strength of ef h provisions relating to state waters nonfishing activities and landuse practices that influence efh in addition to addressing the definition of efh some commercial fishing interests recommend that congress define the context for judging harm they note that in north pacific regional council di scussions about efh each species may be viewed as part of the habitat for other species because of predatorprey relations and other life history needs thus they conte nd that plankton is part of the habitat for herring herring is part of the habitat for salmon salmon is part of the habitat for sea lions etc and the harvest of any species might constitute harm to another species moreover they note that successful predat ors inevitably modify their environment to some degree and fishermen function as predators in the marine environment fishing is not benign activity it causes change within the marine environment in their opinion these changes inevitably harm some species and benefit others these commercial fishing interests believe that sustainability of the overall system should be the goal and that congress might consider clarifying the definition of harm especially in terms of harm to efh caused by fishing as referred to at 307a7 while not specifically addressed in the msfcma data are critical for identifying and describing efh whether constituencies perceive the efh provisions as beneficial to fishery management or as re stricting fishing opportunities virtually all believe more research is re quired to better define the linkages between habitat and fishery pr oductivity determine the extent of harm caused by fishing and nonfishing activities and assess the need for protected areas to protect habitat and conserve fish stocks various interests commend ongoing effort s to describe and identify efh but note that additional research is needed to understand the habitat requirements of fish at various life history stages the role of submerged aquatic ve getation reefs and cover in salmon streams mangrove fore sts and wetlands nd the linkages between habitat fishery production and ecosystem hea lth as well as to map different habitats thus it is likely that fishery scientists environmental groups and commercial and recreational fishing interests will ask congress to consider authorizing research

combination with traditional fishery management tools as one approach to rebuilding fisheries and protecting efh see 304e and 305 b respectively of the msfcma mpas may enhance fisheries by protec ting fish spawning aggregation and nursery areas such as seagrass beds mangrove communities and reefs mpas may play role in rebuilding fish stocks by providing haven for fish to grow and reproduce adult fish may then move from mpas into adjoining areas enhancing fishery production proponents of mpas claim that protected areas may be beneficial in curbing overfishing rebuilding depleted stocks preserving ecosystem integrity and protecting efh specifically they ggest that mpas can prevent overfishing by providing hedge against uncertain st ock assessments rebuild ing depleted stocks by allowing older and more reproductive individuals to survive alleviating the impacts of fishing on habitat providing reference sites to assess fishing and non fishing impacts and providing refuge for bycatch species53 some environmental groups believe th at mpas are promising management tool but one highly subject to political mani pulation these interests assert that forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30215crs19 54 certain areas of the marine environment have been closed to all or specific activities for variety of reasons eg marine sanctuar ies designated under the marine protection research and sanctuaries act 16 usc 1431 et seq regulatory closures in the bering sea and aleutian islands to protect crab sa lmon herring and marine mammals the oculina banks experimental reserve established by the south atlantic regional council and the tortugas shrimp sanctuarympas to be effective significant porti on of efh should be included in protected area they contend however that commerc ial and recreational fi shing interests will use political pressure to restrict mpa classification to suboptimal habitat to ensure that mpas provide real benefits for fi sh production and habita t protection some of the more vocal mpa proponents recommend th at exploitation of fish stocks in protected areas be eliminated or limited to catchandrelease sportfishing other respondents suggest that all seag rass beds mangrove areas and reefs should be considered for listing as mpas they believe that core areas can be identified and should be closed to all activities except car efully monitored scientific investigation54 for coral reefs some responde nts contend that one of the most detrimental activities to fish populations is spear fishing with the aid of scuba gear they recommend that this activity be eliminated if heavily fished coral reefs are to recover some commercial and recr eational fishing interests are likely to counter proponents claims by noting the weakness of scientific proof that mpas accomplish what their supporters contend they nd other opponents are likely to ask congress to consider the economic losses that may result from designating mpas and closing areas to fishing and other uses these groups will likely ask for more scientific research before closing areas reducin g fishing opportunity and imposing economic costs on users these groups also are concerned about the permanence of mpa designations and desire the flexibility through adaptive management to change mpa boundaries and regulations in response to an evolving understanding of mpas they also note that while mpas may be useful tool within traditional management system regional councils should not be mandated to use mpas moreover some critics of mpas contend that while establishing reserve to protect and maintain sessile or largely nonmobile stocks or species may be prudent in certain circumstances highly mobile animals do not recognize protected area boundaries thus they argue that extrem protective measures such as notake zones may be ineffective for migratory fish finally some scientists note that alt hough mpas may initially benefit depleted stocks by allowing rebuilding additiona l research is needed on the management problems created by overcrowding and increased density of concentrating fishing vessels in the remaining sm aller open areas when fishin g grounds are closed for an extended period of time they note that scientific studies already suggest that overcrowded and highdensity fishing can lead to health problems and poor reproduction in marine species they conc lude that periodic and monitored fishing in closed areas may be appropria after rebuilding has occurredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30215crs20 55

ecotourism in association with mpas eg displaced fishermen might become involved in nonextractiv dive trips 2 closures should affect all sectors equally some commercial fishermen assert that current closed areas have resulted in highly unequal treatment among gear sectors 3 mpas and their regulations should be carefully evaluated for their pot ential to displace subsistencetraditional and customary use fishermen and 4 signations of mpas should be made by regional councils not cong ress ie local decisions not national control discussions about efh include continui ng debate over situations where mpas might be an appropriate mean s to conserve stocks and pr otect habitat the level of protection can vary among different types of mpas some mpas allow wide range of activities including fishing while others are more stringently regulated possibly prohibiting all human activities the size of an mpa depends on its intended purpose mpas created to protect shipwrecks can be quite small while those that aim to protect whole ecosystems may be much larger issues that congress may face include whether the mpa concept should be codified in law the rationale for crea ting mpas and methods for selecting which areas to protect the types of activities that would be permitted or prohibited and why review of existing closed areas including assessing their effectiveness and research to determine the sociocultural and economic benefits and costs of creating mpas the difference between notake marine reserves areas closed to all resource extraction and multipleuse areas areas with geartype or timearea restrictions but where limited fishing is permitted is one of the more controversial issues in the debate over the merits of signating mpas fishing groups would be likely to ask for consideration of the differences between recreational and commercial fishing and the relative effects of various type s of commercial g ear and operational characteristics

miss deadlines and dela actions to end overfishing and rebuild stocks56 environmental groups contend th at rather than using 10 years as an upper limit on stock recovery region councils have uni formly adopted 10 years as standard recovery period envi ronmental groups also suggest that fishery rebuilding plans in some instances do not account for overfishing caused by recreational harvest57 the midatlantic regional councils fmp for summer flounder for example contains additi onal management meas ures to address overfishing in the recreational fishery nmfs has taken public comments on proposed regulatory revisions to guidelines on overfishing58 but final rule has been published in light of the continued struggles with this issue congress may ultimately decide to review the msfcmas requirements for rebuilding and recovery of overfished stocks59 other concerns include 1 continued fishing above the rate that produces maximum sustainable yield 2 lack of status assessments for many managed species 3 failure of some regional councils to establish criteria to identify when stock is overfished 4 failure of some re gional councils to ensu re overfished stocks will be rebuilt within the time frames established by the msfcma 5 delay of rebuilding plans for stocks needing immediate protection and 6 lack of overfishing definitions that are based on the biology of each stock additional comments include 1 the only way to rebuild stock is to declare moratorium and wait for the natural rebuilding cycle to occur and then resume fishing and 2 regional councils should be penalized for failure to m eet targets to curb overfishing harmful nonnative species because of the potential for harm to fishery resources some believe that prevention and control of harm ful aquatic nonnative species such as the european green crab carcinus maenas should be given some consideration during reaut horization of the msfcma for example potential invasive species concerns might be identif ied as discretionary issue for discussion in fmps for more information on nonnative species see crs report rl30123httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30215crs22 60 however socioeconomic data collection may have disparate impact upon small entities while larger companies can spread such costs over diversified operations in this respect data collection efforts may conflict with the msfcmas national

congress by m lynne corn eugene h buck jean raws on alex segarra and eric fischer management issues commercial and recreational fishing in terests environmental groups and fishery scientists voiced concern regarding the need to clarify andor modify the scope and goals of fishery management under the msfcma these concerns range from narrow suggestions for improving as pects of fishery management to broad commentary on the overall goal s of msfcma management data collection and management section 402 of the msfcma provides authority for regional counc ils to develop and impleme nt information collection programs that would be beneficial in deve loping fmps or determining if fishery needs to be managed recreational and commercial fishing interests express an interest in more data including sociocultural data to improve fishery management in their view more information would promote better understa nding of the economic and sociocultural contributions of commercial and recreational fishing enterprises as well as the businesses and industries that support both sectors60 the absence of adequate data makes it difficult for fishery managers to rrive at fair and equitable decisions about matters that affect commercial and recreational fishing some environmental groups believe th at the present state of knowledge regarding catch in recreationa l fisheries and bycatch in ll fisheries is poor and needs to be greatly improved to prevent overfi shing and to minimize bycatch these groups assert that many regional c ouncils use the lack of data to justify postponing action in number of areas such as identifying maximum sustainable yield msy or optimum yield oy determining the status of many stocks and proposing measures to minimize bycatch and the harm caused by fishing gear on efh these groups suggest that additional funding is necessary to support these research efforts so that the msfcma can be properly implemented and fisheries can be sustainably managed these groups are specifically c oncerned with identifying and quantifying the amount and type of bycatch occurring in all fisheries fishery managers suggest that if more information is going to be collected particularly on sociocultural and economic aspects creative ways will need to be developed to collect useful informa tion with minimal additional burden they believe that programs that collect unveri fied data from the industry are likely to impose high burden but result in lowvalu information ie da ta of questionable validity61 they assert that the paperw ork reduction act 44 usc 35013520httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30215crs23 61 continued data bias and have developed methods for dealing with these concerns 62 others argue that multitude of these needs assessments have been completed in the last decade and the types of information needed are well known any add itional needs assessments would simply delay needed data collection 63 others argue that the time has come to shift the burden of proof to the resource users and away from fishery managers and scientistsoften hinders efficient collection of info rmation moreover in their opinion because the msfcma ties data collection to specific fmp fragmented and inconsistent data result they posit that future ve rsions of the msfcma should encourage interagency and interregional cooperation on data collection satisfying specific fmp needs within an overarching plan th at results in useful information another source of information suggest ed by some commercial fishermen is fishermen themselves they believe that fishermen offer largely untapped source of data especially about how many of what species are found when and where they contend that these anecdotal data are just as useful as annual or triennial trawl surveys and that fishermen should be inte grated into data co llection and management efforts the types of information collection and analysis that all of these groups may request include 1 needs assessment of the types of data required to manage recreational and commercial fisheries 2 needs assessment of the types of economic and social data i ncluding data on industries that support recreational and commercial fisheries needed to make management decisions62 3 increased collection of commercial and recreational fish harvest data including bycatch and 4 increased collection of information to support development implementation and management of individual fishing and bycat ch quota programs moreover variety of fishing interests are likely to ask congress for increased attention to collecting information on the indirect but significant impacts of fishery management policy on such related businesses as gear manufacturer s local restaurants ice houses and other businesses that support recrea tional fishing contrary to these suggestions some commercial and recrea tional fishermen may object to expanded data collection citing their belief that fishing is already heavily regulated and that increased reporting requirements would add unnecessa ry costs and other burdens the scientific basis for policy commercial fishing interests suggest that weak fishery data hinder decisionmaking and result in flawed regulations while protecting habitat and ecosystems are reasonable objectives they assert that there is way to implement management objectively with inconclusive scientific information about ecosystems and the impacts of fishing on habitat they suggest that congress modify the msfcma to focus on gathering more tangible information upon which to base regulations the envi ronmental community would likely use this same argument to promote even more stringent fishery regulations noting that the precautionary approach prescribes more conservative management in the face of uncertainty63 the crux of the issue is what is meant by this phrase and how precautionary management ought to be when dealing with imprecise data and variable fish stockshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30215crs24 64 agegrowth analysis uses fish scales and otoliths ear bones used for balance and orientation to assess age relative to length these hard structures have annual growth rings much like rings in tree trunk that can be used to estimate the age of fish however some fishery scientists note that traditional agegrow th research using hard parts to discern fish age is not applicable in tropical regions b ecause fish growth is not subject to discrete seasonal changes in tropical regions lengthbased methods are usedsome in the environmental community agree that there is serious lack of fishery data and that steps should be take n to obtain more and better data however they generally are concerned that this lack of data not be used as an excuse to delay conservation measures in their opinion lays to obtain more data have caused declines of some managed fish and ot her marine species to population levels requiring endangered species act protecti ons they believe that inaction premised on lack of information is unsound contending that the data are sufficient for nmfs and regional councils to take steps to protect efh and ecosystems and concluding that precautionary approach makes the use of the best available scientific information others contend that nmfs currently advocates riskaverse decision making nonetheless they recommend that congress specifically endorse riskaverse decisionmaking especially where limited data and information are available finally other scientists note that best available scientific information should also include sociocultural information however in their opinion there are rigorous social and culture impact assessments in current fmps they assert critical need for sociocultural and socioec onomic data that must be collected before social impact analyses can be conducted therefore these scientists might ask congress to consider authorizing research programs to collect and analyze sociocultural information reliability of mana gement models section 404c1 of the msfcma establishes requirements for the secretary to initiate and maintain fishery research to carry out the purposes policy and provisions of the act some fishery managers note concern re garding the need for additional data to verify the assumptions used in stock assessment models particularly they assert that the management analyses garnered from virtual population analysis vpa models could be improved by expanding the use of agegrowth64 information to address these concerns some fishery managers suggest that congress might consider authorizing funds for expanded age and grow th research for example regional age and growth research centers could coordi nate information among state and federal agencies fishery managers suggest that central data clearinghouse would provide consistent fishery data avoid duplication of effort and reduce costs some environmental groups are concerne d that fishery managers do not have the necessary information to determine valid msy values and the status of many stocks they are concerned that assump tions made by regiona l councils may not be scientifically justifiable and may theref ore result in riskprone management that increases the likelihood of overfishing in addition some fishery scientists note that it is not just biological or population dyna mic models that are problematic but that social and economic impact assessment mode ls also have seri ous deficiencieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30215crs25 65 national research council

simultaneous need to recognize the many small ecotones that would benefit from be ing considered as semiseparate units rather than simply parts of great wholethe national academy of sciences committee on fish stock assessment methods reviewed existing stock assessmen t methods and consid ered alternative approaches65 the committee found that while s imple models are useful more complex models are needed to better qua ntify unknown aspects of the system and to address the longterm consequences of speci fic decision rules their retrospective analyses showed that persistent over or underestimation can occur over number of assessment years regardless of the assessment model in their simulations model performance became more erratic as more variability or rrors were introduced into the data they recommended that different assessment models be used to analyze the same data as means to identify poor quality data in addition the committee suggested that greater attention be devoted to including independent estimates of natural mortality and its variability in assessment models specifically they recommended 1 using bayesian methods and other statistical techniques to incorporate realistic uncertainty into stock assessment models 2 developing better assessment models for recrea tional fisheries and methods to evaluate the impacts of the quality of recreational data on stock assessments 3 accounting for effects of directional changes in environmental variables eg climate change in new models and 4 developing new means to timate changes in average catchability selectivity and mortality over time rather than assuming that these parameters remain constant ecosystem vs singlespecies management fishery scientists suggest adopting ecosystembased management notably for defining efh they argue that habitat use by various species is compos ite and involves more than the life cycle of single species these scientists s ee the need to develop fundamentally new concepts for dealing with transboundary fishery management and efh issues in moving toward ecosystem management scie ntists suggest that congress transform efh regulations into national guidelines for instituting ecosystembased management currently the msfcma divides the us eez into eight regional management areas these areas generally extend from 3 miles off the coast out to 200 miles offshore and are managed by the eight regi onal councils fisher ies within 3 miles of the coast are managed under state authority fishery scientists suggest that because of the difficulty in subdividing ecosy stems for management purposes congress should redefine these manage ment zones these scientists suggest that unifying fishery management across state and federal waters is the most important step in moving toward ecosystembased management66 additionally they suggest that artificial boundaries such as those dividing the atlantic portion of the nations eez into three regional fishery management

fina l report of noaa fisheries ecosystem principles advisory panel67 in 1996 congress requested an assessment of the extent to which ecosystem principles are curre ntly applied in fishery research and management and reco mmendations for how best to in tegrate ecosystem principles into future fishery ma nagement and research68 the panel noted that comprehensive ecosystembased fishery management approach would require managers to consider all interactions that target fish stock has with predators competitors and prey species the effects of weather and climate on fishery biology and ecology the complex interac tions between fishes and their habitat and the effects of fishing on fish stocks and their habitat69 the panel considered full implementati on of the overfishing bycatch and efh provisions of the sustainable fisheries ac t to be prerequisites to ecosystembased fishery management in their report the panel described the enormous ta sk of managing at the ecosystem level and recognized that in most cases thencurrent data were insufficient however it stressed that there are practical ways to use the information that is available and recommended the use of fishery ecosystem plans feps to further incorporate ecosystem principles into fmps the fep would document the structure and function of the ecosystem in which fishing activities occur as well as provide information to managers about the effects of their decisions on other components of the ecosystem and the ffects of other ecosystem components on fisheries70 the primary purpose of the fep w ould be to allow regional councils to prescribe how fisheries will be managed from an ecosystem perspective71 the panel recommended that congre ss require nmfs to develop fep guidelines and each regiona l council to develop an fep for the ecosystems under its jurisdiction it stated that each fep should require at least eight actions by regional councils 1 delineate the geographic extent of the ecosystem including

might not be marine ecosystem management rather it could be way to formally include ecosystem knowledge and document how this information is used to manage living marine resources according to panelists feps could also help achieve the requirements of the sustainabl fisheries act to develop comprehensive understanding of the limits of renewable reso urce and use that knowledge to design socially and economica lly stable fishery balancing shortterm minuses with longterm pluses recogniz ing that great deal of knowledge about how fisheries function within an ecosyst em may be currently underused feps may offer ways to better use what is known and to incorporate new knowledge the panel believed that while much of what it recommended could be accomplished under current mandates di rectives from congress would hasten application of these principles and ensu re universal application by the regional councils the pane l concluded that if fishery management is to further in

process requiring regional councils to prepare feps provides mechanism to focus and inform fishery management to measure progress toward implementation of ecosystembased fishery management to identify

necessary to promote sustainable fisheries and to protect nonco mmercial species that may be affected by fishing ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30215crs28 73 msfcma 313a defines the term fishery as one or more stocks of fish which can be treated as unit for purposes of conservati on and management and which are identified on the basis of geographical scientific techni cal recreational and economic characteristics however several other uses of fisher eg msfcma 3032 3035 and 303b6 and more indirectly msfcma 39 and 305 a3 broaden this definition to include elements of the fleet such as gear and vessels these inconsistencies could merit attention during reauthorization 74 stock assessments 75 stock assessments p 4a means to protect marine ecosystems these groups might request that congress require regional councils to prepare ecosystem management plans and to ensure that fmps are consistent with ecosystem plans critics of current management contend that singlespecies management especially with different daily allowable cat ch rates increases regulatory discards they also suggest that the definition of fishery73 could be amended to one or more stocks or interrelated species of fish which can be treated as unit some believe that this modification would facilitate the shift from singlespecies to ecosystem based management it should be noted that the national acad emy of sciences conc luded that single species assessments currently provide th best approach for assessing population parameters and providing shortterm forecasting and management advice74 the nas committee stated that recent interest in bringing ecological and environmental considerations and multispecies management interactions into stock assessments should be encouraged but not at the ex pense of reducing the quality of stock assessments75 decisionmaking by regional councils section 302 of the msfcma establishes eight regional fi shery management councils nd defines requirements for membership

recuse themselves from decisions in which they have financial stake as in previous reauthorizati ons of the msfcma pe rceived conflicts of interest by regiona l council members is cause for concern among recreational and commercial fishermen some groups believe that because of the close relationship with the fishing industry regional councils are unable to take the necessary steps to prevent overfishing rebuild stocks in timely manner and properly regulate gear that catches large amounts of bycatch and damages efh at issue is whether decisionmaking by individuals with vest ed financial interest in fishery can be impartial in addition to current disclosure nd recusal requirement s congress may be asked to consider other measures to minimize conflictofinterest concerns suggestions for

resource advisory councils see httpwwwblmgovrac visited on aug 26 2004decisions to requiring regional council memb ers to swear compliance with federal tax and banking laws commerc ial fishermen suggest that regional counc il membership be limited to individuals with practical knowledge of fi shing operations specifically excluding industry representatives such as executive directors lawyers and lobbyists however increasing financial disclosure requirements or limiting the type of individual allowed to serv on regional councils could make it difficult to obtain knowledgeable and willing nominees for regional council membership some fishery scientists contend that conflict of interest is not the problem rather it is that private and public interests ar in conflict instead of mandating an unattainable impartiality they suggest empowering decisionmakers who share the public interest that is decisionmakers should bear the consequences of their decisions in ways consistent with the public interest this can be achieved they suggest by reconfiguring the incentive st ructure for decisionmakers in their opinion the misalignment of public and private interests is in large part due to 1 shortsightedness on the part of resource us ers elected representatives and agency heads and 2 the decoupled costs and be nefits of fishery po licies and programs they contend that shortsightedness on the part of resource users can only be overcome by giving them more secure claims to future outcomes in fisheries ie some form of property rights the effects of shortsightedness by politicians and agency heads they contend can be overc ome by insulating fishery decisionmaking from political influence finally they suggest that the benefits and costs of fishery policy can be more closely coupled by the use of costrecovery mechanisms such as fees and taxes some also support review of msfcma provisions relating to regional council membership to ensure that all parties interested in us fisheries are adequately represented specifically environmenta l groups expressed concern that their interests are inadequately represented on most regiona l councils and suggest that congress should consider legislative changes to the msfcma to ensure that regional councils are more broadly representative of the public interest in making fishery management decisions that bene fit the nation others suggest that there is need for greater representation of nonfishing inte rests such as seafood consumers and environmentalists as well as increased ove rsight by independent scientists the bureau of land managements resour ce advisory councils may provide an alternative model for balancing various constituencies and their influence76 closely related to the issue of financial conflict of interest is the issue raised by some commercial fishermen who questione d whether regional c ouncil members who work only parttime on regi onal council matters are able to make impartial and knowledgeable decisions aff ecting management of the nations marine fisheries they contend that regional council members who work in the fishing industry are likely to make decisions that favor the interests of their employers to prevent this bias they suggest making regional c ouncil membership fulltime position with members solely dedicated to managing fisherieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30215crs30 conversely other fishermen argue that regional councils ready have fulltime administrative and professiona l staff to assist and suppor t council members and that council membership should not be fulltime position they assert that individuals actively employed in the fishing indus try tend to be the most knowledgeable concern was also expressed regarding who the pool of potential regional council members might include if membership became fulltime profession it was suggested that successful fishermen and bus inessmen would not be as interested in becoming regional council memb ers were it fulltime job another concern is that the judgment of fulltime regional council members coul d become clouded if they were constantly worried about keep ing their position on the regional council furthermore some social scientists ggest that there is greater likelihood of compliance if user groups participate in th regulatory process they suggest that making regional council membership fulltime position would preclude user gr oups from participating on the re gional council moreover regional counc il membership is currently limited to term of three years this termlimit some suggest provides sufficient means for different perspectives and experience to be involved in the fishery management process the msfcma provides for nmfs to have voting seat on each regional council with the noaa general counsel pa rticipating in regi onal council business however the msfcma lacks provisions for independent legal dvice or counsel for regional councils some comme rcial and recreational fish ermen express concern that the noaa general counsel who represents the interests of nmfs often dictates fishery policy in its legal advice to regional councils on measures under consideration they contend that the pub lic interest would be better served by independent legal advice and suggest that congress amend the msfcma to authorize independent legal counsel for regional councils others doubt that authorizing independent legal counsel would lead to better decisionmaking they assert that this could unnecessarily delay decisionmaking and increase the involvement of the cour ts in fishery management they also contend that it could be costly to cha nge the process and that the noaa general counsel provides objective lega l interpretations some also noted that regional councils are not currently prohibited from hiring lawyers to work on the regional council staff providing gal advice as necessary additional comments concerning regiona l council decisionmaking include the following 1 the role of state governor s in the regional counc il appointment process should be reduced and atlarge nomin ations should be solicited through an application process directly to the secret ary of commerce 2 many user groups feel that they are underrepresented on regional c ouncils and that their expertise is under used 3 fishermen should act as paid c onsultants to the regi onal councils providing advice but not voting and 4 regional c ouncils are not adequately funded for their workload and need more staffhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30215crs31 77 highly migratory species

promote the achievement of optimum yield of such species throughout their range both within nd beyond the exclus ive economic zone78 fmps for atlantic hms ar developed by nmfs in consultation with advisory panels created by nmfs and composed of constituents from the recreational commercial environmental and scientific communities some recreational fisherme n and environmental groups are concerned about the effectiveness of the current management system they observe that secretarial management has allowed continued declines in atlantic hms this concern stems from the perception that nmfs lacks th funding and staff to properly manage atlantic hms and that current management favors commercial fishing these groups may suggest that congress review the effectiveness of nmfs management of hms others in the recreational fishing community may suggest returning management of all hms fisheries especia lly billfish tuna and swordfish to regional council jurisdiction some fi shery managers note that if congress decides to return hms management to the regi onal councils more efficien t and effective guidelines for developing joint regional council fmps might be needed others suggest that congress author ize regional councillike process for managing hms they assert that nmfs routinely ignores the advice of its advisory panels and nonnmfs scientists they also contend that giving authority back to the regional councils would be problematic as well give n how poorly the regional councils have worked together in the past some recreational fisherme n and environmental groups express the need for special management zones along the entire atlantic and gulf of mexico coast where longline gear would be prohibited for specific distance from shore this is necessary in their opinion because longline fisheries have depl eted atlantic hms moreover they stress that the dimensions of the management z one should be set by fishery scientists not fishery managers commercial fishermen would likely oppose such management zones stressing that geararea prohibitions could cause them economic harm they believe that hms fishery declines are the result of foreign fishing and environmental factors recreational and commercial fishing interests note that an issue at nmfs hms advisory panel meetings and one that continuously seems to frustrate us efforts to rebuild hms stocks was the lack of clear relationship between the msfcma and existing international treaties eg international convention for the conservation of atlantic tuna the united nations convention of the law of the sea specifically these groups question the prac ticality of domestic efforts to rebuildhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30215crs32 north atlantic swordfish st ocks in 10 years or less when the us fisheries account for only 22 of fishing mortality they suggest that it would be beneficial to study international fishing treaties and their relationship precedence and impact on and with the msfcma the national standards and the precautionary pproach moreover they contend that definitive domestic fishery policy is needed to decide on actions to be taken in the period between recognizing that an international fishery is overfished and implementing international management to rebuild those stocks review of fishery management plans section 304a of the msfcma establishes the process whereby the secretary of commerce and nmfs review and approve fmps some fishery managers and commercial fishermen express concern about the accuracy and efficiency of the fmp appr oval process they contend that frequent and lengthy delays in pproving and implementing fm ps have damaged both the industry and fish stocks and reflect poor ly on the performance of nmfs these groups may ask congress to give regional councils final author ity on fmp approval to streamline the process others counter that improving the review process is an administrative concern and thus legislative action is not needed additionally others suggest that it may be unconstitutiona l for regional councils which are nongovernmental agencies to have final decisionmaking authority about how best to use and manage the publics marine fishery resources some federal fishery managers note that some of the delays in the approval process are the result of the regional counc ils failure to produce fmps that satisfy all of the legal requirements specifically they note that the time between regional council action and final rule publication can be attribut ed to 1 assuring compliance with other applicable laws 2 inadequately prepared supporting documentation from regional council staff primarily related to compliance with other applicable laws and 3 insufficient legal review staff in noaa general counsel another problem in their view is noaa fisheries review of fmps and amendments separate from their review of the regulations that will implement these fmps and amendments as possible solutions these managers suggest 1 requiring regional councils to take final action votes only on fully comp leted analyses including the preferred alternative and draft propos ed rule notices 2 closer linking of noaa fisheries review of fmp and plan amendments with the review of implementing regulations and 3 providing more funding for noaas office of the general counsel some environmentalists cont end that strong nmfs review of fmps is crucial to statutory compliance and to balancing regional interests with national priorities they suggest that nmfs be authorized to modify an fmp to bring it into compliance with the msfcma if regional council s not acted within reasonable period of time to revise their fmp they assert that providing regional councils multiple opportunities to comply with the msfcma delays implementation and note that currently the act imposes deadline for regional council revisions of fmps that were partially appr oved or rejected furthering delayshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30215crs33 79 msfcma 328 80 the term optimum with respect to yield from fish ery means the amount of fish which will provide the greatest overall benefit to the nation with particular reference to food production and recreational opportunities and b which is prescribed as such on the basis of the maximum sustainable yield from such fish ery as modified by any relevant economic social or ecological factor msfcma 321 aug 1994some suggest that fmps should be ex empt from many of the requirements of the national environmental policy ac t 42 usc 43214347 the regulatory flexibility act pl 96354 and the pa perwork reduction ac t 44 usc 3501 3520 which they believe dela the review process unnece ssarily others however question such exemptions expressing concer n that the rights of fishermen might not be assured in such situations management based on maximum sustainable yield currently the msfcma requires fmps to achieve th optimum yield oy from each fishery optimum yield is defined as msy as re duced by economic social and ecological factors79 some fishery scientists suggest that congress modify this definition they argue that the concept of msy is ineff ectual for management and decisionmaking because msy is longterm average yield while the po litics of fishery management tend to focus on much shorterterm results as an alternative to msy some fishery scientists suggest that the msfcma incorporate the concept of an ecosystem stainable yield esy these scientists suggest that an ecosystembased yield is preferable to attempting to simultaneously manage several species at their msys at minimum congress might acknowledge or recognize the multispecies tradeoffs in interacting food webs within marine and aquatic ecosystems some in the commercial fishing industry suggest that congress should return the term optimum yield to its pre1996 definition80 this group believes that the current definition that reduces rather than modifies msy hinders management especially when contending with variati ons in stock size caused by environmental conditions they state that while msy is difficult if not impossible to estimate industry groups likely would support the use of longterm averages conversely some environmental groups and fishery scientists support the 1996 definition of oy believing that linking oy to msy ideally prevents overfishing they assert that the prior definition llowed regional councils to set oy above msy for shortterm economic reasons at the risk of overfishing in their opinion this approach led to boomandbust cycles and pulse fishing in many fisheries additionally many environmental groups believe that linking oy to msy would facilitate ecosystembased management however they contend that many regional councils have not implemented the stat utory requirements to reduce oy based on economic social and environm ental factors eg predato rprey relationships or the role of fish in the ecosystem in th eir opinion regional counc ils have set oy with little justification except for maximizin g catch this group may request that congress require regional councils to consider ecosystem relationships in establishing optimum yieldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30215crs34 other fishery scientists and managers suggest that neither msy nor esy are practical concepts for optimum yield they suggest that oy be defined in terms of the optimum level of fish removal that ta kes into account the longterm reproductive capacity of the stock species composition of the catch ecosystem concerns catch capacity of the fleet operational characteristics of the fishery economic concerns and how the fishery is managed coordination and oversight of statemanaged fisheries section 306 of the msfcma states that the act neith er extends nor diminishes the authority or jurisdiction of any state within its boundari prior to 1976 states had management authority over all fisheries in waters adjacen t to their states and there was little or federal jurisdiction over living marine resources in these waters with enactment of the msfcma marine fishery resources within the us eez came under federal jurisdiction while states retained jurisdic tion of marine fishery resources from their coastline out to the us eez generally three nautical miles offshore the msfcma attempts to balance state authority with federal conservation and management goals principally through coordination activities and the advice of the secretary and nmfs rather than direct oversight of state fishery management fishery managers suggest strengthening the relationship between federal and state fishery management they assert that greater federal oversight is needed to improve decisionmaking by interstate fishery commissions currently the practice of managing interstate fisheries is based on equivalency provisions wherein states choose management measures they prefer as long as the measures comply with federal conservation re quirements fisheries in whic h management is coordinated by interstate commissions are often very diverse and management approaches vary from state to state commissioners from one state often know little about another states fisheries fishery managers suggest that this hinders states ability to make informed decisions about its c onservation plans the result they allege is continued overfishing and delays in stock rebuilding some interests suggest that congress authorize an independent entity either to oversee or to directly manage interstate fisheries one suggestion for strengthening coordination with states is to delegate fmp management authority to states specifically deleting the last sentence in 306a3b which states for fishery for which there was fishery management plan in place on august 1 1996 that did not delegate management of the fishery to state as of that date the authority provided by this subparagraph applies only if the council approves the delegation of management of the fi shery to the state by threequarters majority vote of the voting members of the council decentralized fishery management some commercial fishing interests would oppose more centralized management at the federal level they perceive the need for increasingly decentralized manage ment at the local level consistent with federal objectives because they believe local individuals are more knowledgeable about specific environmental and economic conditions in this view fishing communities are readily able to adapt mana gement to prevailing conditions and often are best suited to manage local fisheries these interests may suggest that congress amend the msfcmas management authority to emphasize local management andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30215crs35 81 additionally some note that the jurisdiction ov er the 200mile eez of some of the pacific island insular areas is disputed between federa l and local governments in some instances federal jurisdiction spans the entire 200 miles in contrast to other us regions where the first 3 miles of coastal water is generally under state jurisdiction they contend that decentralization is the favored option in these disputed areasdecisionmaking81 such dramatic change from the current management structure likely would require major amendment to the msfcma and additional funding at the state and local levels some environmental organizations nd other commercial and recreational fishing interests while recognizing the need for local expertise would oppose further decentralization of the nations fish eries generally these groups oppose an increased emphasis on decentralized manage ment especially if it decreases the ability of those interested in fishery management but unable to attend regional council meetings to participate in the decisionmaking process they are also concerned that management of fisheries could become local issue controlled and managed to maximize benefits to local interests rather than benefits to the nation decentralized management in their opi nion might put shortterm local economic needs above longterm sust ainability and productivity comanagement and the role of native americans previous reauthorizations of the msfcma adde d significant language to encourage exploration of the role of indige nous peoples in fishery management fishery scientists suggest that greater emphasis be placed on incorporating traditional ecological knowledge into fisher management these scientists suggest that congress consider ways to incorpor ate the wisdom of indigenous cultures into contemporary management prot ocols examples of this approach include the community development programs which benefit native alas kans and hawaiians and create role for them in their resp ective regional councils these interests suggest that congress add language to the msfcma to ensure the longevity and success of these ventures in considering comanagement of marine fisheries congress could look to co management provisions in the marine mammal protection act 16 usc 1361 as model these provisions authorize the secretaries of commerce and the interior to enter into cooperative agreements with alaska native organizations to conserve marine mammals and comanage native subs istence use through these cooperative agreements native organizations may receive grants to facilitate data collection and analysis monitor subsistence harvests par ticipate in research projects and develop comanagement arrangements with federal and state agencies aquaculture some in the commercial fish ing industry assert that public demand for fishery products is driving the exploitation of marine resources contending that sustainability is not just local or coastal problem but rather that national longterm solutions are needed they suggest encouraging the development of variety of methods to provide the re quired quantities of fish ery products to meet us demands especially aqu aculture and hatcheries for example they point to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30215crs36 82 this is the popular name for 27 of the rchant marine act of 1920 46 usc 883 19 cfr 480 and

open ocean aquaculture by rachel borgatti and eugene h buck review of american fisheries act provisions some commercial fishermen may seek review of the provisions of the american fisheries act aimed at protecting fishermen who do not belong to cooperative from having their access to harvestable fish preempt ed by those who do they suggest that congress might consider instructing regi onal councils to modify expand or limit the role of cooperatives depending upon the results of this review national research agenda some suggest that national research agenda is needed to effectively coordina and fund fishery research they suggest that congress consider authorizing r esearch council specifically focused on marine resource issues others suggest that the recent work of the pew oceans commission and the us commission on ocean policy see oceans commissions previously may be adequate to stimulate more attention to these concerns observer status although not an msfcma issu this concern is relevant to msfcma activities the uncertain stat us of fishery observers under the jones act82 is reportedly causing insurance cerns for both observer contractors and fishing vessels making it necessary for bot h parties to carry ex orbitant insurance coverage one approach may be to recogn ize observers such that they are covered by workmens compensation experimental fishing permits the msfcma currently does not allow research to develop or improve fishing gear even when conducted by state or federal scientists to be considered as scientific research thus requiring that scientists complete lengthy process to receive an experimental fishing permit if the msfcma were amended to remove this exclusion simple letter of acknowledgment might be adequate to authorize gear research

the maximum sustained reduction in fishing capacity at the least cost and in minimum period of time how best to reduce fishing capacity especially using vessel buyback program84 is likely to be an issue during re authorization some recreational and commercial fishermen as well as environmental groups want only buyback programs that effectively and completely remove vessel from all us fisheries85 without this these groups fear that individuals or groups of individuals could be compensated for exiting one overcapitalized fishery and then entering another fishery in which entry is not limited this movement from one fishery to another displaces current participants and could result in other over capitalized fisheries other fishermen favor the buyback of only fishing permits allowing vessel owners to continue using vessels they own for other nonbuyback fisheries nmfs has been criticized for delays in developing guidelines for fishing capacity reduction programs the proposed rule for fishing capacity reduction programs was publishe d february 11 1999 64 federal register 6854 but has not been finalized us national plan of action for the management of fishing capacity was released in august 200486 critics suggest that these delays have resulted in the implementation of inconsistent fishing vessel and license buyback programs and that nmfs has duty to provide an overall framework to guide capacity reduction programs in contrast other respondent s note that 1 there is statutory mandate requiring nmfs to produ ce capacity reduction guidelines and that priority is given to producing statut orily mandated guidelines 2 buyback programs have been implemented under ms fcma 312 and therefore delays could not have resulted in inc onsistent implementation and 3 the msfcma does not require national cons istency and provides for vari ety of mechanisms to fundhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30215crs38 87 fishermens reasons for choosing fishing including being on the water independence income potential and other factors should be considered in proposing possible alternatives 88 some believe that this argument is count erintuitive contending that the commercial fishing industry lobbied in favor of the subsid programs and that these subsidies were not foisted on an unwitting industrycapacity reduction programs additionally some fishery scientists and environmental groups state that efforts shoul d be made to reduce effort in fisheries before they reach overfished status they suggest proactive reductions in capacity aimed at preventing further declines rather than waiting to react to stock collapse additional considerations for ve ssel buyback programs include benefits may be minimal if only marginal operations ie least efficient operators or fishermen who fish only occasionally are bought out but the buyout cost would likely be lower individuals who hold fishing permits but do not currently use themlatent effort may enter fishery as others exit offsetting reductions in capacity social and economic costs to the community as well as otherrequirements under the regulato ry flexibility act pl 96 354 may outweigh the benefits to the resource compensation for boat owners may financially harm the captain or crew who lose source of income appropriate educationa l and vocational programs for the newly unemployed or boughtout mar itime personnel may not be readily available87 broader unemployment and other economic implications for the community eg marine businesses that may suffer substantial income loss as the number of fish ing vessels and processing plants declines may become evident and buyback programs may be criticized as ineffective if they areinefficient at reducing fishing capacity nmfs notes that capacity reduction cost s could be paid by harvesters who remain in postreduction fishery or by taxpayers or others in essence three funding options could come before cong ress for capacity reduction programs 1 government funding taxpayers 2 i ndustry funding or 3 joint government industry funding some in the fishing industry strongly be lieve that because government subsidy programs in the late 1970s and 1980s encour aged vessel construction which lead to the overcapitalized fishery the gove rnment should subsidize the buyback 88 that is fishermen should not have to pay to re move capacity effort that the government was partly responsible for creating fi shermen are divided as to whether buyback programs should be industry or gove rnmentfunded fishermen who support an industryfunded program argue that more cont rol would then have to be given to the industry regarding the procedures for vesselreduction program fishermen whohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30215crs39 89 some argue that fishermen are largely res ponsible for overcapitalization contending that while nmfs did administer the capital constr uction program the decisions to build or modify vessels were business decisions of the owners these critics argue that blaming the government for overcapitalization is nonsense particularly for overcapitalization in the new england fleet new englands groundfish fish ery was declared conditional fishery in the early 1980s and vessels participating in this fishery were longer eligible for the fisheries obligation guarantee program authorized by title xi of the merchant marine act of 1936 archived crs report 95460 enr summaries of major laws implemented by the national marine fisheries service by eugene h buck available from the author they also contend that fewer than 3 of new englands groundfish vessels benefitted from this loan program 90 for example harvesters in postreduction fishery will benefit from 1 increased catch both as percent of the total allowable catch nd larger total catch for their vessel and 2 the likely increased value of their permit or license 91 however subsistencetraditional and customar use fishermen are also currently reported under the recreational category for whom catch may be as or more important than the experience of fishingsupport governmentfunded program argue th at it adds insult to injury to make fishermen pay for programs designed to put them out of business other respondents posit that because harv esters reap benefits from improving the fishery and contributed to the depleti on of some stocks harvesters should bear the brunt of the cost for reducing fishin g capacity these observers contend that many of the vessels used to exploit us marine resources were subsidized through the capital construction fund as such th government should not be expected to pay for vessels second time by paying owners not to fish89 they assert that because buyback programs chiefly benefit those who remain in the fishery after capacity is reduced90 postreduction harvesters should fund the buyback recreational fishing interests suggest that in considering the capacity reduction issue the law should distinguish between commercial and recreati onal fishing they contend that recreational fishing is distinctly different from commercial fishing in that recreational fishing is tied to the experience of fishing rather than catching fish91 reducing fishing mortality and bycatch in recreational fisheries might be betterachieved through public education and outr each initiatives such as catchandrelease programs use of hooks that ease release of fish and increase survivability eg barbless widegap circle and other ways of reducing rm and stress to fish eg hook extractors and handling techniques that minimize harm by avoiding removal of the protective mucous layer and scales and by eliminating pressure on internal organs other respondents be lieve that owners of recrea tional fishing vessels eg charter boats are under enormous pressure to provide their customers with successful experiences and that recreational fishing does have significant impact on sustainability in some fisheries they contend that reductions in recreational capacity funded by the recrea tional industry also should be considered at least in fisheries where recreational harvest is significant

legislation enacted to establish national standards to gu ide new ifq programs92 the nas report93 recommended that the moratorium on individual fishing quota ifq programs be lifted and ggested that congress consider allowing fees for initial quota allo cations first sale of ifqs and leasing of initial shares as well as an annual tax on quota shares recognizing differences among regions and allowing regional councils flexibility in designing new and adjusting existing ifq programs requiring regional councils to define excessive share and to limit accumulating quota shares and ensuring that funding is availa ble to nmfs and the states for collecting relevant socioeconomic data94 in detailing its recommendations to congress the nas committee asserted that most decisions about ifqs are appropriate ly made at the regional level the committee recommended to congress that the design of any limited entry program in relation to concentration limits transferability and distribution of shares will depend on the objectives of each speci fic fmp which underscores their recommendation to provide flexibility to regional councils in designing ifq and other limited entry programs some commercial fishermen and fishery scientists are concerned that problems such as overcapitalization waste and bycatch can only be remedied through individual quota management meanwhile r ecreational fishermen are likely to seek assurances that the recreational sector is considered in the development of ifq programs especially in initial quota allocation other commercial fishermen suggest th at congress authorize regional councils to use alternative approaches to if qs such as cooperative arrangements95 some commercial fishermen have formed fish harvesting cooperatives under the american

in fishery to divide up the available harvest quota and to catch th fish in tempered manner while cooperative fishing is evidence of the bene fits of individual quot management there are significant differences between fede rallymandated ifq pr ograms and private cooperative arrangements as an alternative to ifq programs some commercial fishermen suggest that nmfs and regional councils be authorized to allocate quota to cooperatives some environmental organi zations assert that enha nced conservation measures must be incorporated into ifq programs as they are developed these groups do not wholly accept the belief that ifqs will re sult in enhanced conservation and seek stricter measures they posit that ifq prog rams should be held to higher standards for monitoring and accountability to ensu re that conservation is enhanced additionally some environmen tal and fishing groups have several concerns with ifq programs and argue that 1 the federal government should not award the right to exploit national resource without appr opriate compensation to the public 2 allocation of an ifq may engender propert right which may be difficult to reduce or rescind in the future without compen sating the quota holder ie subject to the constitutional takings clause 3 quota consolidation may dr ive smaller operators out of business 4 ifqs may reward dir ty fishermen those with high levels of bycatch and discards because initial allocati ons are often based on catch history and 5 ifqs may encourage fishermen to highgrade their catch keeping only the most valuable fish several respondents note that the nature of the rights available through ifq programs should be carefully specified for instance if ifqs were issued for an area would that mean that ifq holders would become eligible for compensation for the loss of their rights to harvest if the area was reduced by the establishment of an mpa or through major port developments nd reclamations would native american fishery claims need to be settled before issuing ifqs should ifqs be permanent rights or temporary privile ges similar questions have arisen about permits and leases for federal grazing lands the federal government has explicitly stated that private livestock grazing on federal lands is privilege and not right nor interest in property nonetheless ranches with access to federal forage often sell for higher price than they would without access to fede ral rangeland the resulting value of the grazing preference is capitalized into the ne t worth of the ranch base property and is considered an asset by the rancher97 other comments include the following 1 ifqs could be useful tool for managing certain recreational fisheries ch as atlantic bluefin tuna where long history is available and

north pacific regional council has authority for feebased observer program but has not yet implemented the program the authority for feebased program includes cap on obser ver fees of 2 of the unprocessed harvest value under the current pay as you go system many smaller vessels are paying in excess of 2 of revenues while other larger ope rations pay fraction of that amount this disparity undermines support for the observer program they suggest that nmfs develop the best observer program they can within th budget constraints of 2 fee equitably distributed over the whole fleet this might be model for how user fees could function but until this program is implemented and monstrates success authority for further feebased programs will meet significant resistance from commercial fishermenallocation of quota shares and 3 reducti ons in processing capacity may also be necessary to match reductions in fishing capacity thus fishing processors may seek processor quota program and other means to allow paced reductions in processing capacity without sudde n or severe economic impact on local communities98 individual processor quotas we re specifically provided in 801 division b of pl 108199 as part of bering sea and aleutian islands crab rationalization program whether to ma ndate the considera tion or prohibition of processor quota in any ifq program may be an issue during reauthorization and the unfolding experience with processor quota in the alaska crab fishery provides potentially useful background information in another development related to if qs the north

residents on an annual basis the council design ated 42 communities within the gulf of alaska who are elig ible to participate in this program99 whether to specifically authorize the granting of ifq shares to communities may be another issue for discussion during reauthorization fees cost recovery and economic rent section 303b1 of the msfcma establishes requirements for collecting fees for

208 her eafter sharing the fishcost recovery could be an important issue during r eauthorization the overall performance of fishery is often influenced by how fishery management is financed the typical practice where 100 of mana gement and enforcement costs are borne by the general treasury101 is alleged to inefficiently use resources for research decisionmaking and enforcement when resource users do not share some of the cost for resource management they are allegedly less attentive to the need for efficiency the cost of this inefficient use accrues to the management agency and increases the overall cost of managing the resource fishery economists suggest that such inefficiencies are reduced when users of natural resources especially commercial users bear some of the costs for managing these resources thus they suggest that congress consider user charges to recover significant portion of fishery management and enforcement costs some fishery managers assert that the cost recovery authority currently in the msfcma 304d 16 usc 1854d for ifq and cdq systems is too restrictive they contend that statutor specification of when where and how fees are collected introduces administrative ineffi ciencies that reduce the benefit of the fees and actually prevent consolidation of fee collection with existing state fees further any specific limitation of the fees to percent of exvessel value and the specific deductions and exceptions in th eir opinion prevent nmfs from recovering reasonable management and enforcement costs these managers suggest that the language at 304d could be amended to allow nmfs more flexibility in working with the industry to develop simple wcost effective fee collection system some fishery scientists suggest that beyond recovering the costs of management and enforcement the public should receive share of the economic rent garnered from private use of public resource these advocates maintain that congress should consider imposing fees on quota or rvest to provide source of revenue and compensate the public they believe that establishing fee system for harvesting fish would put fisheries on par with other public resources eg timber and energy resources102 these funds could contribute to recovering management and enforcement costs as discussed above th scientists note that rent extraction beyond cost recovery could support fishery research or assist fishing communitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30215crs44 103 sharing the fish p 209 104 sharing the fish p 207 105 others perceive danger in tying fees generated by region to expenses in that region as this approach could create incentives for managers to keep catch limits artificially or inappropriately high to protect budgets they feel it would be much better to assure that science and management are objective by not connecting budgets with harvest levels in addition lowrevenue fishery may require significant research perhaps because it affects other target fisheries such situation coul d lead to irrevocable closures if funds for monitoring required to open fishery were lacking 106 collaborative management options for local research and management involving industry cooperation eg stock assessment surveys conducted aboard commercial fishing vessels might help shift some costs to industry as well as engage those dependent upon management decisions without imping ing upon the objectivity of the scienceor fishermen displaced by ifq programs103 those supporting this approach explain that in an ifq fishery compensation coul d occur through capturing portion of the windfall gains generated fro m the initial transfer of the public resource into private hands ie the initial alloca tion of fishing quota shares104 some commercial fishermen claim that extracting economic rent from fisheries managed under open access w ill impoverish fishermen because there are incentives to constrain effort openaccess fisheries tend toward overcapitalization which dissipates economic rent and on average reduces profit they suggest that economic rent should be extracted only from fisheries where access is limited and harvesters have secure right to certain quantity of the total allowable catch eg individual fishing quota programs additional comments about fees cost recovery and econo mic rent include nmfs has history of using funds collected from specific region or specific purpose for general expenditures instead fees cost recovery and economic rent shoul d be used in the region that generates the funds specifically for data collection management and enforcement105 user fees should be tied to comanag ement of the resource if user pays the user should have voice in how the money is used and how the resource is managed106 by tying user fees to research those paying may have stronger voice in how research is c onducted potentially reducing the independence and quality of the science quota sales typically underestimate the longt erm value of resource rights and only fraction of the di scounted value of expected future economic profit is realized by the first transaction congress might consider fees and rent capture in

capacity and capacity utilization needed to consider the fishing activity of recreational anglers and recommended that specific modifications be made to the capita l construction fund fisheries obligation guarantee and other assistance programs environmental organizations active in the federal investment study note that fishery subsidies have emerged as significant fishery management issue as evidence they note that policymakers are increasingly recognizing the direct relationship between subsidies fleet over capacity and overfishing as well as their effects on international trade in fish pr oducts for example in february 1999 the united nations food and agriculture organi zation fao adopted the international plan of action ipoa for the management of fishing capacity which recognizes fishery subsidies as an impor tant driver of overcapacity108 moreover the need to address the problem of fishery subsidies s been recognized by the world bank the asian development bank the commi ssion on sustainable development the world trade organization wto the or ganization for economic cooperation and development oecd and the asiapaci fic economic cooperation forum apec in the months and years ahead the management of fishery subsidies will likely be the subject of continuing technical and diplomatic discussions within fao oecd wto and apec environmental groups note that the united states has played leading role in bringing attention to the fishery subsidies issue and add that fishery subsidies in the united states are far smaller than in many other major fishing nations in their opinion congress will lik ely be called upon to act on this issue through us domestic policy and international efforts to reduce fishery subsidies in addition some fishery scientists ggest that subtle relationship exists between subsidies and the collection of fees as discussed below by not recovering the costs of management and enforcemen t the united states in their opinion is effectively subsidizing fishing opera tions in essence they define subsidy as sale or transaction for good or service by gove rnment at less than the fair market price where fair market is defined as willing buyer and willing seller thus they contend that because the nations fishery resources managed by the federal government are more easily available than if private owner controlled access the fishery market is by definition not fai r hence subsidy exists moreover others note that the uruguay round of wto negotiations defined subsidies as having three basic elements 1 financial cont ribution 2 by government or any public body within the territory of mber 3 which confers benefit fishing communities section 316 of the msfcma 16 usc 180216 defines fishing community as community

reside in that port 111 national academy of sciences sustaining marine fisheries washington dc 1999 p 97 112 however virtual communities may be di fficult to marry to economic analysis particularly when indirect impacts are to be analyzed for limited access systems 16 usc 1853b6 does allow virtual communities to be assessed in conjunction with placebased communities creating more complete view 113 however potential tools to protect placeba sed communities are being implemented eg regionalization in the bering sea and aleutian islands crab rationalization programdependent on or substa ntially engaged in the harvest or processing of fishery resources to meet social and economic n eeds and includes fishing vessel owners operators and crew and united states fish processors that are based in such community noaa has further interpreted fishing comm unity to mean social or economic group whose members reside in specifi c location and share common dependency on commercial recreational or subsistence fishing or on directly related fisheries dependent services and industries for ex ample boatyards ice suppliers tackle shops109 noaas expanded interpretation of fishing community recognizes that more businesses depend on fishing activities than just fishing vessels processors and wholesale plants for instance businesses that sell supplies and gear and those devoted to marine services such as financial settle ments and bookkeeping often depend totally on fishing activities and could be considered part of the fishing community this interpretation recognizes that every change in meshsize regulations changes the inventory value in ship supply stores every reduction in the number of vessels reduces bookkeeping servi ces such an interpretation recognizes that the fishing community extends beyond actual fishing activities and the processing of product and that social and economic problems associated with the decrease in support services can seriously degrade the quality of life and economic health of communities some commercial fishermen are concerned that the geographicallybased interpretation of fishing community could harm fishing communities that are based on shared interest rather than shared place110 congress may be asked to modify this definition to clarify how this term should be used in social and economic analyses of fishery management actions specifically commercial fishermen and fishery scientists may suggest that congress include virtual communities111 in the definition of fishing communities112 conversely recognition of virtual communities may be opposed by rural communities wh ich are likely to favor geographic definition these groups tied to pl ace and often with limited economic opportunities may feel threatened if virt ual communities displace what they perceive to be their traditional fisheries113httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30215crs47 small boat fleets and family fishermen although small boat fleets and family fishermen are not given general consideration in the msfcma these individuals are mentioned specifically in 303d4ai that governs aid in financing the acquisition of individual fishing quota the theme of small versus large fishing operations whether vessels or service providers is very important i ssue in fishing communities and the industry where many small operators perceive msfcma bias towa rd consolidation and large operations to address these concerns some commercial fishing interests suggest amending the msfcma to incorporate sp ecific provisions to foster and support smallboat and family fishing operations these interests are alleged to have strong commitment to resource sustainability and possess culturally derived desires to pass along their fishery to future generati ons one proposal to provide additional support for small boat and family fisherman is to restrict us imports to fish harvested by fishing fleets that use cons ervation measures comparable to those required in the united states however so fishery scientists note that providing additional support to small fishermen by restricting access to us markets might violate world trade organization obligations and international w and violate us commitment to remove subsidies that support overcapitalization transfer pricing commercial fishing interest s are concerned about transfer pricing especially in north pacific fisherie s this is not currently addressed in the msfcma transfer price is the price charged by one company to related company for allocating income and expenses among themselves these intrafirm transfers are covered under the internal revenue tax code at 26 us c 482 some us fishing companies allegedly are not properly reflecting income attributable to their operations within the united states while some foreign parent companies may be using pricing strategies to avoid higher u s taxes in addressing abusive transfer pricing congress could cons ider amending the msfcma to require full disclosure of all financial documents and transfer pricing criteria to us authorities others believe that this issue is not germane to reauthorizing the msfcma and suggest that this tax and trade issue is more appropriate to the jurisdiction of other congressional committees such as house ways and means and senate finance the definition of recreational fishing some note that clarifying the definition of recreational fish ing would be beneficial to fishery management they suggest that congress define recreational fishing as any fishery for which catch is not sold in their opinion this small chan ge would clarify the distinction between commercial and recreational fisheries others however caution that defining recreational and subsistence fishermen who sell small amount s of catch to cover trip expenses as commercial might result in substantial administrative and enforcement expenses to deal with the potentially rge number of individuals who sell small quantities of product the private cost of resource management the msfcma requires that overfished stocks be restored within 10 years some assert that 10 years is long time for an individual or company depe ndent on

environm ental groups believe that many commercial fishermen share their interest in rebuilding overfished stocks and promoting longterm resource sustainab ility to rebuild fish stocks these groups would like congress to consider significant reductions in fishing effort coupled with federal assistance for fisher men to relieve the economic burden of reduced fishing opportunities fishing vessel and crew safety some commercial fishermen contend that it is imperative that fishery management explicitly considers whether or not regulations will compel fishing captains and crew to work under unsafe conditions although one of the national standards 16 usc 1851a 10 already requires that conservation and manage ment measures promote the safety of human life at sea these fishermen suggest that additional congressional action may be necessary to more specifically address this issue adequacy of appropriations an issue that nmfs might raise during reauthorization discussions is that in an era of reduced federal appropriations and shifting federal priorities its responsibilities and duties tinue to expand specif ically implementing the provisions of the sustainable fisheries act is major undertaking requiring the coordination of nmfs headqua rters and regional offices the eight regional fishery management councils and state agencies nmfs may claim that delays in implementation were di rectly tied to budgetary constrai nts congress might consider number of options to address these concer ns as noted previously fees or other forms of rent extraction could be used to fund at least some management and enforcement congress might also consid er increasing appropriations to nmfs or including specific instructions bout how funds are to be used for fy2005 the national oceanic

very supportive of measures to conserve and manage living marine re sources including specifically the magnusonstevens fishery conservati on and management act while the history of the act includes court challenges to agency interpretation of congressional intent these groups believe that congress has been generally understanding of the difficulties in balancing re source conservation sustai
