policy developments in the apparel and textiles sector summary the apparel and textiles industries together employed just under 14 million workers in 1998 accounting for almost 7 of all manufacturing employment in the united states over the past dozen years however there has been marked downward trend in employment for these industries this trend has accelerated in recent years with over 275000 jobs lost since 1993 this job loss is the most important issue facing these industries much of this job loss has been linked to increasing domestic consumption of imports concerns about these industries have influenced recent trade negotiations involving the united states most notably the uruguay round of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt and chinas accession into gatts successor the world trade organization wto the wto whose membership is made up of 132 nations including the united states is an organization committed to the dismantling of trade barriers between nations related to the issue of importinduced job loss is the debate over renewal of programs aimed at helping workers displaced by trade find new jobs the trade adjustment assistance taa program less crucial than these issues but still relevant is the effect on these industries of federally sponsored programs aimed at spurring innovation the manufacturing sector as whole probably the most important unresolved issue that will influence the ability of these industries to maintain employment in the coming decades will be the impact of chinas prospective accession into the wto china is already the leading exporter of apparel into the united states so the future growth of uschinese apparel trade will in large part determine employment numbers in the industry also important will be the continued efforts by the industries to remain internationally competitive through innovation here federal policies like the research and experimentation re tax credit and cooperative

questions on the apparel and textiles industries should be directed to bernard gelb 77738 2us department of labor bureau of labor statistics employment and earnings march 1994 and march 1999economic and policy developments in the apparel and textiles sector1 the apparel and textile industries at sector hereafter constitute significant part of the production chain responsible for providing consumers with clothing and other fabricbased products textile mills manufacture fabrics generally intended for use in apparel production although other products are also made in textiles mills rugs carpets and material for seatbelts and automobile seats are some examples apparel factories turn the textiles into clothing to be sold in the retail market the at sector while experiencing declining employment over the past quarter of century and frequently asserted by many observers to be in permanent decline remains an important source of employment in the manufacturing sector of the united states as of 1998 these industries employed just under 14 million workers about 7 of all manufacturing employees and more than either the aircraft or automobile industries and almost as many as these two combined 137 million vs 15 million in recent years however this sector has experienced largescale job losses over 275000 since 19932 this significant job loss and the concomitant problem of re employing former workers of this sector make up the most important issues facing these industries much of this job loss is related to international competitiveness and recent import surges in the sector making the status of ongoing international trade negotiations an important issue regarding the future prospects of the at sector concerns about this sector have influenced recent trade negotiations involving the united states most notably the uruguay round of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt and chinas possible accession into gatts successor the world trade organization wto related to this the outcome of the debate over renewal of the trade adjustment assistance taa program is also important less crucial than these issues but still relevant is the status of several programs aimed at enhancing the international competitiveness of the manufacturing sector as wholehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30291crs2 3the output measure used here is gross product originating in the industry the industrys contribution to national gross domestic product for further explanation and data see us department of commerce bureau of economic analysis survey of current business november 1997 and november 1998 4these output multipliers are department of commerce estimates for 1987 based upon input output tables for 1982 for discussion of and more information on output multipliers see crs report 93370 manufacturing industry its impact on the us economy by david cantor 5ibidthe at sector recent performance employment productivity and international trade it often is asserted that the at sector in the united states is sunset industry one that will perform poorly in the future in providing employment trade shares and productivity growth common view of the at sector is that it mass produces standardized output and seems to have poor prospects for technological progress meaning that competition will fall predominantly along laborcost lines as the united states becomes economically integrated with countries whose average wage is fraction of that for us workers some analysts believe it will be impossible for usmade at to remain competitive in the world market much of this perception probably stems from rapid import penetration into the us market over the last two decades primarily from countries with substantially lower national wage rates than the united states however while the us at market has seen rising share of imports the output of the domestic industry has increased modestly over the last dozen years combined apparel and textiles account for 4 of all manufacturing output their gross product roughly equals those of the instrument paper and primary metal manufacturing industrie s individually3 additionally the output multipliers for the apparel and textiles industries are among the highest in manufact uring output multipliers measure the stimuli given to the aggregate economy by money spent in individual sectors the average sectoral output multiplier for the overall economy is 189 meaning that 1 spent in the average sector will induce 189 in total economic activity4 an explanation of these multipliers is that if money is spent on the output of an industry this money will go to wages of employees who will be able to demand more goods of other sectors to investment in plant equipment and inventory or to profits which may be reinvested in the firm increasing demand for capital goods for the at sector 1 spent in the textile industry generates 277 and 1 spent in the apparel industry generates 2515 while often lumped together as one sector and sharing many commonalities the textiles and apparel industries are distinct in some important respects in 1998 total employment in the apparel industry averaged 771000 while textile industry employment was 596000 employment in the apparel industry peaked at 13 million in 1973 and has generally declined since falling especially fast during the recessions of 198182 and 199091 without gaining much ground after each between 1978 and 1998 apparel industry employment fell by 544000 41 textile industryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30291crs3 6employment and earnings march 1974

fallen as fast as in the apparel industry with 314000 jobs lost in this period or 35 both industries have suffered large losses since 1993 with apparel losing 207000 jobs and textiles losing 700006 these large employment decreases occurred during time that production levels were essentially unchanged rapid employment losses combined with stable output necessarily implies gains in labor produc tivity defined as output produced per worker labor productivity growth in the economy as whole determines how fast living standards can rise thus industry labor productivity gains are very important economists generally attribute many of the increases in labor productivity to two separate phenomena investment in laborsavin g machinery that makes each worker more productive called capital deepening and technological advance both means of increasing labor productivity are extremely important and many economists have posited that each is equally responsible for rising living standards labor productivity growth in the textiles industry has actually outstripped that of the economy as whole increasing at 28 per year from 1970 to 1996 compared with 12 per year for the aggregate economy textiles productivity growth was fast even compared to the rest of the manufacturing sector 28 vs 23 and this higher rate of labor productivity growth has been maintained in the 1990s 4 vs 357 much of the increase in the textiles industrys productivity was due to capital deepening that occurre d beginning in the 1970s over this decade capital expenditures by textiles producers outstripped their profits with about 3 billion annually invested in new plant and equipment8 labor productivity in the apparel industry grew more in line with the rest of the manufacturing sector at just under 25 annually from 1970 to 1996 capital deepening occurred but was not nearly as dramatic as in the textiles industry even while investing more in the 1970s than in the previous two decades combined the rate of capital formation was less than half that of the textiles industry the main reasons for this investment disparity are probably 1 that the flexibility needed for apparel production makes mass production less feasible and 2 that apparel firms tend to be smaller and hence less able to finance major capital improvements many observers of the sector believe that prospects for further productivityenha ncing capital improvements are dim many textiles factories have become almost completely machinedriven leaving little room for further laborsaving and the apparel industry seems illsuited to such mechanization however increases in multifactor efficiency are much harder to predict and information technology improvements that allow better communication between retailers and

international trade administration home furnishings industrial uses and automobile interiors are three examples of nonapparel markets for textiles 11ibid 12it should be noted that this labor savings lowering of unit labor costs may not result solely from low wages per but rather depends on the relationship between wages and productivitysome clothing lines may have the potential to provide further productivity increases to both parts of the at sector while considerable part of textiles employment losses can be explained by productivity increases increased imports also played small role mostly through the indirect impacts of apparel imports in the 1970s the us textiles industry was the only one in major industrialized country that kept its domestic market share stable providing over 95 of domestic consumption by 1992 the share of imports had increased to 119 while direct imports did not significantly affect the industry it was affected greatly by increasing apparel imports the largest market for domestically produced textiles is the domestic apparel industry as apparel imports gained market share fewer domestic textiles were demanded the us textiles industry has made considerable efforts in trying to locate alternative markets besides the domestic apparel market by 1991 63 of textiles production was for the nonapparel market up by 20 from 15 years earlier10 this ability to find and keep new markets will be crucial for the future success of domestic textiles manufacturers exports grew 121 in the textiles sector from 19891996 but have shrunk very slightly 12 since 1997 due probably to lingering effects of foreign currency devaluations induced by the asian crisis apparel production did not experience the same rapid productivity gains as the textiles industry and probably partly as result experienced higher levels of import penetration into the domestic market for apparel and higher rate of employment loss imports grew from 5 to 26 of the apparel market from 1970 to 1988 many of these imports came from developing countries by 1995 china hong kong taiwan and mexico accounted for fifth of all apparel sold in the united states and imports as whole accounted for over half11 many of the apparel imports entered the united states under special provision in us trade law heading 9802 of the harmonized tariff schedule hts hts 9802 henceforth that allows imports that have been assembled from us materials to enter the united states and be assessed an import duty only on valueadded generated abroad the assembly and subsequent return export of foreign materials is generally called production shared trade pst the economic rationale for pst is to allow producers greater opportunity to lower costs these savings can be realized through 1 enhanced access to lowercost labor for certain aspects of production often referred to as slicing the value chain 12 or 2 economies of scale that arise from greater specialization across plants pst has been especially prevalent in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30291crs5 13statistics on pst from united states international trade commission report production sharing use of us components and materials in foreign assembly operations publication number 3146 november 1998apparel industry pst imports as percentage of total imports have risen 50 in the 1990s from 14 to 21 of total imports almost all apparel 83 entering the united states under hts 9802 comes from the countries targeted by the caribbean basin economic recovery act cbera13 apparel is wellsuited to pst with the cbera nations because of easy access to lowcost apparel assembly workers there and generally high import duties on apparel entering the us following the passage of the north american free trade agreement nafta much of this trade was diverted from cbera countries to mexico as nafta eliminates all duties on mexican imports while cbera imports still had to pay duty on valueadded generated offshore in addition to the hts 9802 program apparel imports from cbera countries that have been produced with usmade textiles are counted at less than full value when figuring quotas for these countries apparel production has long been one of the first industries that developing countries establish as it requires far less initial capital investment than many other manufacturing industries critics of the hts 9802 program contend that it provides incentive for us employers to move production offshor to lowwage countries thus adversely impacting the wage and employment prospects of us workers especially the unskilled these criticisms however point out another difficulty in forecasting the future prospects of the domestic at sector imports of apparel can adversely effect the domestic textiles industry by decreasing demand for its output however not only the level but the origin of these apparel imports are important the cost of transport ing textiles long distances combined with the existence of competitive textiles factories in east asia may mean that apparel imported from these areas could be wholly made with foreign textiles products however the close proximity of the cbera nations and mexico combined with these regions relative dearth of competitive textiles plants means that apparel imports from these nations may well add to the demand for the us textiles industrys output in fact apparel imports from cbera nations and nafta grew during the same period that textile exports grew efforts to expand nafta and create larger regional trading bloc may then perhaps unexpectedly be helpful to the textiles sector if much apparel trade is diverted from asia to countries in the western hemisphere the apparel sector however seems quite vulnerable to lowwage competition whatever the originhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30291crs6 14for more complete discussion see kletzer lori trade and job displacement in us manufacturing 19791991 imports export and the american worker collins ed brookings institution press 1997 15grennes thomas the multifiber arrangement and the management of international textile trade cato journal vol 9 1 these estimates are based on how much more consumers have to pay for textiles and apparel due to tariffs levied on imports or due toissues in the 106th congress international trade and adjustment phaseou t of quotas fears of employment loss brought on by import penetration originally led to the adoption in 1974 of the multifiber arrangement mfa series of bilateral quota restrictions on apparel and textiles imports into industrialized economies and has slowed full liberalization of the at sector even today the uruguay round of 1995 produced treaty calling for the gradual phasing out of quota restrictions on apparel and textiles imports into developed countries the agreement on textiles and clothing atc the atc mandate s that signatories quotas be progressively eliminated by product line over 10year period when in 2005 all quota restrictions will lapse as it is up to the importing countries to decide in what order to eliminate product line quotas it may well be the case that the full economic effect of the atc will not be felt until late in the agreement proponents of managed trade arrangements like the mfa and more gradual quota reduction agreements like the atc argue that these agreements reduce substantial labor adjustment costs that would be incurred if the industry was abruptly opened to foreign competition it has been posited that workers laid off due to pressure from foreign trade have longer layoffs and lose more income than those laid off for other reasons14 much of this difficulty in reemployment stems from the generally poor skills profile of the labor force in many importsensitive industries and the fact that unlike jobs displaced because of cyclical fluctuations or the closing of an individual plant within an industry international trade represents structural shift in an economy meaning that these jobs and the opportunities for workers to exploit jobspecific skills will likely be permanently lost further proponents of managed trade and more gradual liberalization point to evidence showing that adjustment costs caused by layoffs in the at sector are substantially higher than those in many other sectors as at workers generally are not college educated have developed skills that are specific only to the at sector and are disproportionately female andor minorities textile workers also tend to be clustered geographically in areas where there are fewer alternative job opportunities generally in isolated communities in the south meaning that community disruption is another factor related to tradeinduced job displacement proponents of more rapid move towards liberalization in the sector claim that these adjustment costs will have to be incurred eventually and that such measures are inefficient tools for saving jobs for example estimates of the cost to american consumers for each textile industry job saved ranged as high as 52200 per year and 46000 per year for each apparel industry job saved15httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30291crs7 higher prices caused by supply shortages resulting from quotas imposed on foreign goods 16the range of estimates is wide due to uncertain ty regarding future uschina trade relations and the effect of trade liberalization on foreign demand

march 25 1999 by senator hollingsby 2005 the atc will expire and apparel and textiles will be subject to the rules and regulations of wto which forbid the use of quotas estimates of the impact of this on the us at sector vary widely but most studies project employment losses from 200000 to 65000016 the apparel industry is projected to bear most of these losses while the textiles industry will suffer mainly from the indirect effects of smaller domestic apparel industry17 china and the wto the biggest unresolved issue regarding the at industry and the wto concerns chinas possible accession and how fast quotas on chinese apparel and textiles may be expanded or eliminated18 while the atc is set to expire in 2005 10 years after it was first implemented some advocates for the at sector assert that the 10year phaseout of quotas on chinese apparel imports should not begin until the date of chinese accession to the wto chinese apparel including hong kong already makes up 15 of the us market with expanding quotas this could grow very rapidly in the future perhaps inducing large employment shifts in the united states presently uschina trade relations are governed by title vi of the trade act of 1974 the jacksonvanik amendment to this act mandates that the status of us trade relations with china be reviewed annually by the administration if china is accepted as member of the wto this review would be contrary to existing wto obligations as acceptance into the wto requires the granting of unconditional most favorednation mfn status to the products of all wto members hr 557 introduced in the 106th congress aims to rectify this conflict by exempting china from the jacksonvanik review in the event of that country s accession into the wto there is legislative requirement

administration by the urban institute november 1998adjustment programs the taa and naftatransitional adjustment assistance program taap initiatives were developed to meet the challenge of structural adjustment to the pressures of international competition both programs are generally twopronged they provide technical assistance to firms to help them reorganize and become more competitive and they provide extended benefits to workers who have been displaced by imports the technical assistance provided to firms is coordinated through the economic development assistance eda program of the commerce department firms that believe that they have been adversely affected by imports petition to the eda for certification of eligibility for assistance if this eligibility is granted then the firm may receive assistance in drafting an adjustment proposal plan for how the firm can remain competitive within the industry if this proposal is accepted the firm may then apply for taa grants that assist the firm in enacting the measures enumerated in the proposal to receive the award the firms plan must demonstrate viable adjustment program provide proof that its economic resources are devoted to adjustment and give consideration to the employees of the firm the taa program is unusual compared to other government programs in that it allows grant money to be spent on private sector consultants many proponents of the taa program for firms point to this as strength arguing that private sector consultants allow greater range of advice and flexibility than do strictly governmental assistance programs comprehensive review of the program has found that firms that receive taa funding generally perform better in terms of sales and employment than similar firms who do not20 this

1962 many critics claim that there is economic difference between trade competition and domestic competition consequently offering assistance to firms impacted by trade pressures is tantamount to preferential treatment others believe that taa only serves to distort the normal market adjustment processes impeding the benefits gained from trade liberalization proponents of the program argue that it is an essential complement to trade liberalization allowing the adjustme nt process to proceed less painfully and giving firms fair chance to adopt to changed business

experimentation re tax credit the funding of manufacturing extension partnership program mep and regulations affecting cooperative research and development agreements crada between the industry and the federal government re tax credit the re tax credit allows firms across industries to claim credit against their federal income tax liability for qualified spending on research and experimentation private sector research and development rd is vital to aggregate economic growth yet individual firms may be reluctant to fund high levels of rd because of uncertainty about the private returns to such spending the re tax credit is aimed at spurring higher levels of private rd perhaps surprisingly comprehensive study of the manufacturing sector found that the ownprice elasticity of companyfinanced rd does not vary much from industry to industry27 meaning that efforts to make research and development cheaper the purpose of the re tax credit spur almost the same amount of additional rd activity in every industry including the apparel and textile industries in fact the measured elasticities in the study for the at sector were higher than elasticities in those industries considered more technologyintensive such as scientific instruments this implies that for the purposes of inducing rd efforts the re tax credit may be more important for the at sector28 this probably is because more technologyintensive industries consider rd spending fixed cost of their sector activity that must be undertaken to remain competitive regardless of public policy while for the at sector the amount of rd engaged in is variable depending on the expense recent technological advances in the at sector range from computer aided design cad in the preproduction phase to chemical advances in dyes and coloring to communication efficiencies linking retailers and factories the future of the re tax credit may determine to large degree the rate of continued technical progress in

employ 13 million workers while the apparel industry seems to exhibit consistent downward trend in employment the textiles industry may well have stable employment for the foreseeable future the at sector already running substantial trade deficit will almost surely see its international position worsen in coming years especially if china joins the wto and cberanafta parity proposals are enacted making these issues probably the most important the industry will face in the 106th congress the extent of this erosion of the industries international performance will depend in large part on the success of the textiles industry in finding export markets to compensate for the declining demand from domestic apparel producers the size and labor force profile of the at sector implies that the adjustment costs incurred by relatively sudden job loss would be substantial both the taa programs and the general competitiveness policies assisting manufacturing enterprises could reduce these costs the 106th congress has shown little interest in substantially changing the character of these programs but it seems safe to say that the historical controversy over their precise configurations will continuehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30291
