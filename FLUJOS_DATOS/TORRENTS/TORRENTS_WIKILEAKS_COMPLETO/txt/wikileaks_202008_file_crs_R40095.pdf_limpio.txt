north korea with over 12 billion in assistance about 60 of which has paid for food aid and about 40 for energy assistance us aid fell significantly in the mid2000s bottoming out at zero in 2006 the bush administration resumed energy aid in the fall of 2007 after progress was made in the sixparty talks over north koreas nuclear prog ram the sixparty talks involve north korea the united states china south korea japan and russia the united states and other countries began providing heavy fuel il hfo in return for pyongyang freezing and disabling its plutoniumbased nuclear facilities in yong byon by the second week of december 2008 the united states had provided all of the 200000 mt of hfo it had promised under this phase two of the sixparty talks process the talks themselves came to standstill in december over disagreement on verification procedures the othe r countries that agreed to provide hfo are continuing their shipments as they appear to be calibrating their assistance to north koreas progress in disabling yongbyon which continued to take place as of middecember 2008 the united states also provides technical assi stance to north korea to help in the nuclear disablement process role that could be expanded should north korea move to dismantle its nuclear facilities in 2008 congress took legislative steps to legally enable the president to give such assistance for over decade north korea has suffered from chronic massive food deficits foreign assistance largely from china the united states and south korea has been essential in filling the gap throughout 2008 united nations officials issued increasingly urgent calls for international donations of food to avert serious tragedy in north korea as hunger has deepened and expanded in may 2008 the bush administration announced it would resume food assistance to north korea by providing 500000 metric tons mt of food 80 of which is to be channeled through the united nations world food programme wfp the rest is to be sent through consortium of nongovernmental organizations food aid to the dprk has been scrutinized because since the end of famine conditions of the mid1990s pyongyang has resisted taking the steps that many experts feel would help the country distribute food more equitably and pay for food imports to make up for its domestic shortfall additionally the north korean government restricts the ability of most donor agencies to operate in the country placing some areas off limits and restricting monitoring activities in the past various sources have asserted that someperhaps substantial amountsof the food assistance going to north korea is routinely diverted for resale in private markets or other uses compounding the problem china north koreas largest source of food aid has little to monitoring systems in place the bush administrations latest food aid pledge came after pyongyang agreed to loosen its restrictions on access and monitoring however as of mid december 2008 the wfp portion of the program had been virtually suspended due to differences between the us and north korean governments over implementing the agreement finally in 2008 the bush administration began new 4 million program to provide assistance to several rural and provincial hospitals in north korea this report will be updated periodically to track changes in us provision of aid to north korea

after the end of the korean war in 1953 us strategy toward the democratic peoples republic of korea dprk commonly referred to as north korea was relatively simple deter an attack on south korea this included freeze on virtually all forms of economic contact between the united states and north korea in an attempt to weaken and delegitimize the north korean government in the 1990s two developments led the united states to rethink its relationship with the dprk north koreas progress in its nuclear weapons and missile programs and massive chronic food shortages there in response the united states in 1995 began providing the dprk with foreign assistance which has totaled over 12 billion this aid has consisted of energy assistance food aid and small amount of medical supplies see table 1 1 us

kedo after decade of being one of the largest providers of food aid to north korea the united states gave food aid in fy2006 or 2007 in large part due to new restrictions that the north korean government imposed upon humanitarian agencies the bush administration resumed assistance to north korea in 2007 in july of that year after initial progress in the sixparty talks over north koreas nuclear programs the united states and other countries began providing heavy fuel il hfo in return for pyongyang freezing and disabling its plutoniumbased nuclear facilities in yongbyon 2 then in may

grounds of helping the north korean people regardless of the actions of the north korean regime other members have voiced their outright opposition to food aid to the dprk or have called for food assistance to be conditioned upon north korean cooperation on monitoring and access the congressional debate over food assistance to north korea also has been colored by the competing demands for other emergency situations that have stretched us food aid funds and commodities the north korean human rights act pl 108333 included nonbinding language calling for significant increases above current levels of us support for humanitarian assistance to be conditioned upon substantial improvements in transparency monitoring and access the reauthorized act pl 110346 does not include this language and drops the extensive discussion of humanitarian assistance that was included in pl 108333 both the original and the reauthorized act require annual reports to congress on us humanitarian assistance to north korea 4 congress ability to direct the amounts manner and recipients of food aid is relatively limited the 500000 mt of food that the us pledged to north korea in may 2008 is to come from the bill emerson humanitarian trust reserve of commodities and cash that is intended to provide food aid when other statutory sources of aid ar unavailable the secretary of agriculture has authority to release up to 500000 metric tons of eligible commodities for urgent humanitarian relief historically pl 480 has been the main vehicle for providing us agricultural commodities as food aid overseas and from fy2003fy2005 was the program that funded nearly all of the us food commitments to north kore when commodities or cash are released from the emerson trust they are provided under the authority of pl 480 title ii the emerson trust statute essentially authorizes the use of commodities or cash in the trust to be used as backup to title ii when there are unanticipated humanitarian needs congress directly appropriates pl 480 aid and therefore could although it rarely does direct how the food should or should not be disbursed 5 continued for north korea christopher hill the

republic of korea fo rmed an international consortium the korean peninsula energy development organization kedo to manage the assistance7 the planned aid consisted of the construction of two lightwater nuclear reactors lwrs and the provision of 500000 metric tons of heavy fuel oil annually while the reactors were being built the two turn key lightwater reactors were to replace the dprks graphitemoderated reactors that were shut down under the agreement the lwr plants would have had generating capacity of approximately 1000 mwe each and were to be constructed by 2003 8 the united states contributions covered only heavy fuel oil shipments and kedo administrative costs in october 2002 kedo board members decided to lt fuel oil shipments following dispute over north koreas alleged

provision of their remaining share of non hfo assistance by the end of october 2008 but this has been delayed23 north korea again delayed disablement work in august september and october although those instances appear to be linked to disputes over when the us would remove the dprk from its state sponsors of terrorism list and negotiations over verification measures the united states had delayed its fuel shipments while these issues were being negotiated after an informal agreement on verification had been reached bilaterally the united states removed north korea from the sst list and resumed hfo shipments24 however pyongyang in november 2008 denied having agreed to the verifi cation measures the united states sought and once again slowed disablement work saying that energy shipments were not proceeding as planned25 the united states announced its fourth shipment of 50000 metric tons hfo on november 12 the six parties met on december 8 to discuss verification issues and were also expected to finalize schedule for future hfo shipments and disablement steps since agreement was reached on verification measures at the december meeting hfo delivery schedule was set however some announcements followed on provision of energy assistance china announced it would deliver 99000 tons of hfo equivalent by the end of january 2009 to complete its promised share of

from other countries would not be sent because north korea had not agreed to verification measures 27 this does not appear to have been coordinated or agreed to by the other parties russia and china

largest cumulative contributor to the wfps north korea appeals the second largest donor of food aid to north korea through wfp is south korea as discussed below north koreas largest sources of food

official policy in recent times has delinked food and humanitarian aid from strategic interests including the sixparty talks since ju ne 2002 the bush administration officially linked the level of us food aid to three factors the need in north korea competing needs on us food assistance and verifiable progress in north korea allowing the humanitarian community improved access and monitoring 38 in practice some argue that the timing for us pledges sometimes appears to be motivated also by desire to influence talks over north koreas nuclear program and that the linkage between us donations and improvements in north koreas cooperation with the wfp occasionally has been tenuous39 there is conflicting evidence on this front for instance in february 2003 the bush administration announced it would provide 40000 mt of food and would make an additional 60000 mt contingent upon the dprk allowing greater access and monitoring in december 2003 the administration announced that it would donate the additional 60000 mt because of the continued poor humanitarian situation in north korea and improvements in north koreas cooperation with the wfp those improvements however were widely thought to be marginal administration officials denied the decisions were motivated by desire to influence the sixparty talks on north koreas nuclear programs which at the time had reached an impasse on the other hand in late 2005 despite another impasse in the sixparty talks the united states halted its food aid shipments in response to north koreas tightening of restrictions on the wfps operations the cessation included the second half of 50000 mt pledge that the united states had made in june 2005 37 for short review of the estimates of the famines death toll see stephan haggard and marcus noland

the decline in wfp assistance the first was donor fatigue as contributing nations objected to the north korean governments continued development of its nuclear and missile programs as well as tightened restrictions on the ability of donor agencies to monitor food shipments to ensure that food is received by the neediest the emergence of other emergency food situations around the globe also has stretched the food aid resources of the united states and other donors whatever the causes the wfp was unable to fill its goal of 150000 mt for the 20062008 period during this time increased bilateral assistanceoutside the wfps programthat china and south korea shipped directly to north korea as well as improved harvests in north korea appear to have made up much of the gap which

military wfp officials and other experts have say they have seen little to evidence that the military is systemically diverting food donations and further that the north korean military has need for wfp food since it receives the first cut of north koreas national harvest even if the military is not directly siphoning off food aid however such assistance is fungible funds that otherwise would have been spent on food can be spent on other items such as the military the north korean governments desire to maintain control over the country is inextricably linked to the food crisis and its chronic reliance on food aid residency in north korea is tightly controlled and highly politicized with the elite permitted to live in or around pyongyang where food shortages are less acute than in the countrys more remote areas where politically less desirable families live for this reason the united states generally has shipped its food aid to the northern provinces additionally north korea is believed to expend little of its foreign currency to import food relying instead upon the international community moreover since 2007 the government has taken many steps to reimpose state controls over farmers and markets 41 g344g342g342g348g561g20g142g156g157g155g146g140g157g146g152g151g156g561 in 2006 the wfp drastically scaled down its program after the north korean government imposed new

the north korean government reportedly has not allowed the agency to fully implement parts of its wfp agreement in particular the bush administration has had disagreements with pyongyang over the number of korean speakers and americans allowed in the country due in part to these difficulties the united states has not sent shipment of food to the wfps north korea appeal since august in remarks reported in the washington post wfp asia director tony banbury said that north koreans are fulfilling their obligations but that the wfps north korea program was running short of food the ngo program reportedly continues to operate smoothly49 meanwhile in december 2008 the wfp and food and agriculture organization fao issued report summarizing food security survey taken in october the agencies estimated that the number of hungry has jumped from 62 million to 87 million more than third of north koreas population 50

of 2008 for much of the past decade south koreas yearly shipments of food made it north koreas largest or secondlargest annual provider most of this was provided bilaterally and south korea had few monitoring systems in place seoul also provided 300000 mt in fertilizer every year however in 2008 south korea sent food or fertilizer to north korea earlier in the year the newly inaugurated government of lee myungbak indicated that it would provide humanitarian aid upon north koreas request the previous government had simply offered the assistance the move coincided with the lee

president issued vague pledges of more extensive us assistance that might be forthcoming if north korea dismantled its nuclear programs and satisfied other us security concerns dealing with missiles and the deployment of conventional forces52 the administration reportedly was preparing to offer version of this bold initiative to north korea in the summer of 2002 but pulled it back after acquiring more details of pyongyangs clandestine uranium nuclear weapons program53 similarly south korean president lee myungbak has adopted 3000 policy whereby south korea would help north korea raise its per capita income to 3000 over the next ten years by providing massive aid package if north korea dismantles its nuclear program with regard to us development assistance programs in the near term the president has considerable flexibility to offer some forms of development assistance the foreign assistance act of 1961 for instance allows the president annually to provide up to 50 million per country for any purpose 54 longerterm initiatives however would likely require changes in us law and thereby require congressional action for instan ce the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act specifically bans many forms of direct aid to north korea along with several other countries55 many health and emergency disaster relief aid programs are exempt from such legislative restrictions because they have notwithstanding clauses in their enacting legislation additionally if the administration were to design ate north korea as country involved in drug production and trafficking as some have advocated then by law north korea would be ineligible for receiving most forms of us development assistance56
