parts legislation to reauthorize the child care and development block grant ccdbg act and legislation to extend mandatory funding appropriated under section 418 of the social security act in february

appropriate 2917 billion in mandatory ccdbg funding for each of fiscal years 2004 through 2008 which would have reflected an increase of 1 billion over five years above current fy2002 funding the

introduction child care reauthorization is composed of two parts legislation to reauthorize the child care and development block grant ccdbg act and legislation to extend mandatory funding appropriated under section 418 of the social security act the ccdbg act authorizes discretionary funds and contains all provisions pertaining to the administration of ccdbg programs section 418 of the social security act appropriates mandatory money to be administered under provisions included in the ccdbg act the 108th congress did not complete action to reauthorize either the ccdbg act itself or the mandatory child care funding appropriated under the social security act along with the temporary assistance for needy families block grant both expired at the end of fy2002 however funding for the ccdbg has been continued via series of temporary extensions in the case of the mandatory funding and annual appropriations law for the discretionary funding portion in terms of reauthorization legislation the house passed consolidated bill hr 4 personal responsibility work and family promotion act of 2003 which included discretionary funding authorization mandatory appropriation and amendments to the ccdbg act alongside provisions to amend and extend funding for temporary assistance for needy families tanf1 in the senate two separate bills were reported from their respective committees but ultimately failed to reach final vote on the full senate floor the senate finance committees reported substitute version of hr 4 personal responsibility and individual development for everyone act pride included mandatory funding for child care while the senate health education labor and pensions committees reported bill s 880 the caring for children act of 2003 included all provisions pertaining to discretionary funding authorization and would have amended the 1 for discussion of tanf provisions in the house and senate versions of hr 4 see crs report rl32210 tanf reauthorization sidebyside comparison of current law and two versions of hr 4 by vee burke and gene falk crs2 ccdbg act itself although the senate bills never made it to final floor vote it should be noted that when the legislation was brought to the floor one amendment offered by senator snowe was accepted 7820 that amendment proposed to increase mandatory child care funding above the amounts proposed in the house passed and senate committee bill below is summary of key provisions in all three bills and the snowe amendment as passed on the floor followed by table 1 detailed sidebyside comparison of each bills provisions with current law2 summary of provisions funding discretionary authorization the discretionary portion of child care funding is authorized by the child care and development block grant act as amended in 1996 under current law discretionary ccdbg funding is authorized at 1 billion annually however actual appropriation levels determined during the annual appropriations process have exceeded the authorized level eg fy2004 21 billion both the house version of hr 4 the personal responsibility work and family promotion act of 2003 and s 880 the caring for children act of 2003 proposed to authorize discretionary funding at 23 billion in fy2004 rising by 200 million each year up to 31 billion in fy2008 the discretionary funding authorization does not fall under the senate finance committees jurisdiction and therefore was not addressed in the senate committeereported version of hr 4 mandatory appropriation mandatory funding for the ccdbg was preappropriated in section 418 of the social security act for fy19972002 as part of the welfare law of 1996 pl 104193 series of temporary extensions have continued that funding since the close of fy2002 funding has been maintained at the fy2002 annual rate of 2717 billion the housepassed version of hr 4 would have set mandatory child care funding at 2917 billion for each of fy20042008 for an increase of 1 billion over five years above current funding the version of hr 4 reported by the senate finance committee contained the same 1 billion increase in mandatory child care funding over five years however senator snowe expressed plans at the time of voting for the committee bill to offer an amendment for greater child care increase when the bill was brought to the senate floor the mandatory funding does not fall under senate help committee jurisdiction and therefore was not addressed in s 880 when the bill was considered on the floor march 30 2004 samdt 2937 snowe was offered and approved by vote of 7820 the amendment would have provided an additional 6 billion over five years in mandatory child care funding above the 1 billion 200 million in each of five years provided in the underlying bill hr 4 as passed by the house and as passed by the senate finance 2 for general discussion of child care legislation in the 108th congress see crs report rl31817 child care issues in the 108th congress by melinda gish crs3 committee the additional 6 billion would have been allotted among the years as follows 700 million in fy2005 1 billion in fy2006 12 billion in fy2007 14 billion in fy2008 and 17 billion in fy2009 authority to transfer tanf funds under current law states have the authority to transfer up to 30 of their annual tanf block grant to the ccdbg only 20 if they choose to transfer 10 to the social services block grant the housepassed version of hr 4 would have allowed states to transfer up to 50 of their annual tanf grants to the ccdbg the senate version of hr 4 proposed to maintain current law use of funds for direct services current law includes provision requiring given percentage of funds appropriated under the ccdbg act to be spent on direct services s 880 would have required that after the reservation of setasides at least 70 of the funds remaining be used to fund direct services as defined by the state the house bill had comparable provision option to use excess funds for increasing payment rates s 880 would have allowed states that receive funding above their fy2003 levels to use portion of the excess to support payment rate increases for providers and to establish tiered payment rates under s 880 stricter requirements to set payment rates in accordance with biennial market rate surveys would have been added to the statute quality activities quality setaside current law requires that at least 4 of each states total ccdbg expenditures from all sources eg mandatory discretionary matching funds be used for quality activities described as providing comprehensive consumer education to parents and the public activities that increase parental choice and activities designed to improve the quality and availability of child care in the state both the housepassed version of hr 4 and the help committees s 880 would have raised the percentage of ccdbg funds that must be spent for quality activities to minimum of 6 definition of quality activities both bills provided greater detail than current law in terms of defining what classifies as quality activity in each categories of activities were outlined to include school readiness activities including activities to enhance early literacy training and professional development for staff and initiatives or programs to promote or increase retention of qualified staff the categories reflected new emphasis on school readiness as goal of the ccdbg the senate bill s 880 also specified that quality funds could have been spent on evaluating and assessing the quality of programs and their effectiveness in improving overall school preparedness while s 880 clearly stated that quality funds must be spent for any of the six listed purposes hr 4 house provided three broad categories similar in topic to those in s 880 with fourth more general category of other activities as approved by the state crs4 eligibility federal law currently requires that children eligible for services under the ccdbg must have family income that does not exceed 85 of the state median for family of that size however states have the discretion to adopt income eligibility limits below this federal maximum both the housepassed version of hr 4 and s 880 proposed to eliminate the federal maximum of 85 of state median income smi from the ccdbg law replacing it with provision allowing states to set income eligibility levels with federal ceiling with priorities based on need state plan requirements under current ccdbg law states are required to submit plans every two years certifying that their ccdbg programs include specified elements addressing areas such as parental choice parental access consumer education licensing and health and safety requirements both the house version of hr 4 and the help committees s 880 would have amended current law to require that additional elements be certified in their state plans areas that would have been modified or added related to providing consumer education information describing or demonstrating state coordination of child care services with other early childhood education programs certifying compliance with the quality setaside percentage requirement and addressing special needs child care unlike the house version of hr 4 s 880 included provisions requiring that in their state plans states demonstrate that the process for redetermining eligibility occur more frequently than every six months with limited exceptions and also that the state plan describe any training requirements in effect for child care providers the senate bill would also have put into statute the requirement that the provider payment rates described in the state plan be set in accordance with statistically valid and reliable biennial survey of market rates without reducing the number of families served state plans would also have been required to include the results of those surveys and to contain description of how the state will provide for timely payment to providers results of the survey would also have been required to be made available to the public later than 30 days after the surveys completion data collection and reporting requirements current law specifies set of data reporting requirements for states to collect in the administration of their ccdbg programs states collect data on monthly basis and submit to the department of health and human services hhs disaggregated data on quarterly basis an aggregate report is required to be submitted to hhs on an annual basis s 880 would have retained the quarterly reporting in current law but would have amended the list of data elements that states would be required to collect on monthly basis see table 1 for details it would also have eliminated the separate annual report instead requiring that the fourth quarterly report include information crs5 on the annual number and type of child care providers and the method of payment they receive the house version of hr 4 would have retained current law containing none of these provisions other provisions titles ii and iii of s 880 proposed provisions that stood apart from ccdbg law or section 418 of the social security act title ii of the bill contained provisions to enhance security at child care centers in federal facilities and title iii would have established small business child care grant program through which competitive grants would have been awarded to states for establishment and operation of employeroperated child care programs detailed comparison of child care provisions of
