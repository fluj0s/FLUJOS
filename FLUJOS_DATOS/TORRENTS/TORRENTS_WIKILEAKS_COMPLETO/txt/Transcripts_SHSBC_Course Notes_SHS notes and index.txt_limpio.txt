personal observations references and cognitions as well as many points of editing and interpretations of lrh data whatever i was aware of as nonlrh data or possibly nonlrh data i put in brackets furthermore all tables and illustrations being to variable extent my own originations or interpretations may be considered to be in brackets however while i have tried to be as careful and accurate as possible in putting together these notes and while they contain errors that are known to there are bound to be many inaccuracies in them simply because alteris has way of seeping into any such endeavor to greater or lesser extent hopefully lesser the notes are mainly intended to give an idea of what was said in the tapes all the actual lrh data must be found in the tapes themselves however
