amplifiers and sensor s from directedenergy weapons using filters and optical shutters prevents laser or microwave weapons from causing harm hardening satellite makes it increasingly difficult to harm it41 shielding this technique keeps electromagnetic pulses emp generated by nuclear detonations or weapons systems from penetrating satellite cavities and severely damaging satellite metal shielding and resistant paint coats on the internal surfaces enhance survivability42 circuit protection another important protec tion strategy is the use of circumvention circuits in satellite design during an emp event protective circuits switc h off nonessential components to prevent possible damage by sec ondary nuclear or emp attacks43 denial and deception denial prevents an adversary from gaining information about space systems by reducing the electrooptical and electromagnetic signature of satellites using thermal blankets and energyabsorbing materials on satellites makes optical and heat emissions harder to detect by enemy sensors or radars deception is another technique this met hod misleads an adversary into believing false information about space system the use of decoy satellites is an example of how deception could force an enemy to waste resources on false targets or withhold fire for fear that it is shooting at decoy44 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32602crs12 45 ibid p 4142 46

perform its mission once its limited supply of propellant is gone using maneuvers to avoid threats would significantly redu ce the useful life of satellite developing an onorbit refueling capability in the future could present new opportunities to consider satellite maneuvers as cost effective space control method45 redundancy and reconstitution to increase survivability most satellites have redundant subsystem packages to prevent singlepoint failures and most system constellations have multiple satellites to provide systemlevel redundanc launchondemand lod capability is another option that could quickly regenerate constellation after an attack46 dispersion of space systems because most satellite orbits are predictable scattering them into various orbital altitudes and positions offers added protection dispersion also includes the building of networks of many smaller satellites or microsatellites the microsats would operate collectively to perform the services of larger and more vulnerable satellites and result in more survivable system47 ground segment security ground control stations provide critical links used to operate space systems since terrestrial targets are much easier to destroy than targets in space the ground control segment is probably the most vulnerable protecting the ground segment not only includes the hardening of facilities to survive kinetic weapons or em p attack but also physical personnel and information security measures to protect against cyber intrusions or electronic attacks firewalls and encryption techniques may be critical as well in addition mob ile ground stations could be use to evade detection and attack or assu control if primary facility were destroyed48 stealth and cloaking by minimizing energy reflection and
