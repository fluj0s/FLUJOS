accepted by many is that households at the low end of the income spectrum especially those near the poverty threshold should not be subject to the federal income tax this report estimates income tax thresholdsthe point at which taxpayers have an actual outofpocket income tax payment in addition the report compares these income tax thresholds to the latest available poverty thresholds for families of different sizes the major structural components of the income tax code which influence the income tax threshold levels include the standard deduction the personal exemption the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit eitc each of these items increases the income level at which an individual or family incurs an outofpocket federal income tax liability in 2009 single taxpayers eligible for eitc with income below 11124 do not face the income tax liability married couples with two kids do not have to pay income tax until their income reaches 44900 the threshold for head of household filers with one child is 31026 in 2009 federal income tax thresholds are high enough so that with the exception of single taxpayers the equity principle of exempting poverty level households from income taxation has been achieved over time the introduction and subsequent increase in the child tax credit along with the measures reducing the marriage tax penalty however have significantly increased income tax thresholds for households with children especially married filers for households with children the income tax thre sholds are now substantially higher than the comparable poverty thresholds in fact the child tax credit represents departure from past policy practices because it is not designed primarily as means of differentiating between families of different size at or near the poverty threshold but rather is designed to provide general tax reductions to middle and upper income taxpayers with dependent children under the age of 17 the increases in the child tax credit and marriage tax penalty relief measures are scheduled to sunset expire in 2011 the provisions may be extended or modified however as result it is likely that congress will revisit the issue soon this

influence the income levels at which households become subject to federal income tax include the standard deduction the personal exemption the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit eitc each of these items increases the income level at which an individual or family incurs an outof pocket federal income tax liability1 for instance consider the case of married couple with one dependent child under the age of 17 in 2009 the standard deduction for married couple filing joint return is 11400 each personal exemption is worth 3650 and the child tax credit is 1000 this family would reach the basic income tax threshold the point at which they have an actual outofpocket tax payment for their filing status and family size at an income level of 22350 standard deduction of 11400 plus three personal exemptions of 3650 each income over 22350 would be subject to tax but the child tax credit would offset the first 1000 of this couples income tax liability at this taxable income level the marginal tax rate is 10 that means that the child tax credit shields an additional 10000 of income 1000 divided by 10 at this point the eitc would come into play the maximum eitc for 2009 for families with one child is 3043 the credit phases out for families filing joint returns with incomes above 19540 until it reaches zero for families whose incomes exceed 38583 the income tax threshold for the family in this example will be the point at which the eitc is just enough to offset any preeitc income tax liability so that the net tax liability of the family is zero in the case of couple with one dependent child filing joint return the income level in 2009 will be 36184 at this income level the familys income tax liability before eitc would be 383 and the familys eitc would also be 383 the two woul d offset each other and the family would not have any net income tax liability the federal income tax thresholds for singles jo int returns and head of households for select years between 1996 and 2009 are shown in table 1 the table does not incorporate the effects of onetime tax rebates authorized by economic stimulus act of 2008 pl 110185 such rebates would have increased the thresholds further the data in table 1 show that the biggest increases in income tax thresholds in both dollar and percentage terms over the 1996 to 2009 period occurred for households who had dependent children under the age of 17 for example married couples with children experienced increases in their income tax thresholds ranging from 82 for married couples with one child to 154 for married couples with four children the increase in the income tax thresholds for head of households between 1996 and 2009 ranged from 70 for households with one child to 135 for households with four children the increases in income tax thresholds for single individuals and married couples without children were more moderate than those experienced by households with children tax thresholds for single individuals only increased by 47 between 1996 and 2009 while tax thresholds for married couples with children increased by 59 1 the child and dependent care tax credit might also influence households federal income tax threshold but it is not addressed in this report because it is not widely used by households at the lowest end of the income spectrum t

calculations by crs notes assumes all children qual ify for the c hild tax credit does not incorporate t he effe cts of on etime tax rebates uthorized by economic stimulus act of 2 00 8 income tax thresholds change over time because of two factors first they change because of the annual inflation adjustments to personal exemptions standard deductions tax rate brackets and the eitc second they change because of legislative changes to the tax system the relatively large changes in the tax thresholds for households with children can be traced to three main legislative changes that occurred over the 1996 to 2009 time period these changes included establishment and subsequent increases in the child tax credit an increase in the size of the standard deduction for joint returns and an increase in the width of the 15 tax bracket for joint returns2 the taxpayer relief act of 1997 established the child tax credit initially the credit was set at 500 for each qualifying child under the age of 17 additional legislative changes under the economic tax relief and reconciliation act of 2001 increased the child tax credit to 1000 the 2001 act also increased the width of the 15 tax bracket and increased the standard deduction for joint returns although these changes were originally scheduled to be phased in over number of years subsequent legislation in 2003 and 2004 accelerated implementation and made these provisions effective in full through 2010 2 for more information on the child tax credit and changes to the tax parameters for jo int returns see crs report rl34715 the

significant increase in the income tax thresholds for households with children econom ic theory does not provide an answer to the question of how the costs of child rearing should be accounted for under an income tax however one principle of tax fairness or equity accepted by many is that households at the low end of the income spectrum especially those near the poverty threshold should not be subject to the federal income tax it has been argued that given the precarious financial position of these households they should not be compelled to pay federal income tax an action that would further reduce their level of subsistence the tax reform act of 1986 explicitly cited this principle of eliminating income tax burdens for families with incomes near the poverty level as the reason for increasing the dollar amounts of standard deductions and personal exemptions this act increased the value of personal exemptions and raised the standard deductions for joint returns and head of households such that in combination with the eitc the income tax thre sholds for these taxpayers would be above their respective poverty thresholds given this principle one can compare income tax thresholds to poverty thresholds to see if this equity goal has been achieved over time table 2 shows the poverty thresholds for singles and households with children for 1996 and 2007 the latest year poverty threshold data are available 3 comparison of the data in these two tables reveals several trends first the income tax threshold for single individuals was below their respective poverty threshold in both 1996 and 2007 the difference became smaller for singles eligible for eitc but it remained significant for those not eligible there are many qualifications for eitc as an example childless adults 65 years and older are not eligible4 on the other hand the tax threshold for married couples without children exceeded their respective poverty thresholds in both 1996 and 2007 in addition the amount by which their tax threshold exceeded their poverty threshold increased over the period in 1996 the tax threshold for married couples without children exceeded their poverty threshold by about 12 but by 2007 the difference had increased to 26 more significant trend however occurred for families with children in 1996 the federal income tax thresholds for families with children exceeded their respective poverty thresholds by relatively comfortable margins by 2007 these margins had increased substantially especially for larger families for example in 1996 the income tax threshold for married couple with four children was 25793 while the poverty threshold for this same sizetype family was 20965 so the tax threshold was about 23 higher than the poverty threshold by 2007 the income tax threshold for this family had increased to 62983 while the 2007 poverty threshold had only increased to 27705 in this instance the income tax threshold increased to 227 of the poverty threshold the income tax thresholds for head of households show similarly large increases relative to their corresponding poverty levels 3 2007 represents the most recent poverty threshold

principle of exempting poverty level households from income taxation has been achieved over time in addition however there have been significant increases in the tax thresholds for families especially the ones with children these changes in the relationship between income tax and poverty thresholds for households with children can be attributed primarily to the introduction and subsequent increases in the child tax credit and to the measures addressing marriage tax penalty in fact the child tax credit represents departure from past policy practices because it is not designed primarily as means of differentiating between families of different size at or near the poverty threshold but rather is designed to provide general tax reductions to middle and upper income taxpayers with dependent
