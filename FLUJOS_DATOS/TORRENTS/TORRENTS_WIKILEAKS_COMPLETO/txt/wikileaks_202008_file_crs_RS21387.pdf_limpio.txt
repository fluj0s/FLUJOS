threatened by individual member countries signing economic partnership agreements epas with the european ion eu because these agreements would include policies that sacu has yet to harmoni ze such as

provides for greater ins titutional equality of the member states and effectively redistributes tariff revenue within the member states its three key policy provisions are the free movement of goods

structure 2003 wto trade policy review9 of sacu member states examined the tariff stru cture and trade posture of th customs union it noted that the south african tariff structure which was still the basis for the sacu tariff was relatively complex consisting of specific ad valorem mixed compound and formula duties however the south african govern ment has embarked on tariff rationalization process to simplify the tariff sche dule to convert tariff lines to ad valorem rates and to remove tariffs on items not produced in the sacu according to the ustr the complexity of the tariff regime has made it necessary for some us firms to employ facilitators to export to south africa10 the wto found applied mfn tariffs averaged 118 in manufacturing 55 in agriculture and 07 in mining and quarrying these average tariffs represent reduction from th previous wto review in 1998 when mfn tariffs averaged 16 56 and 14 respec tively however tariffs are often bound11 much higher with some

signed trade investment and development cooperation agreement tidca which is the first of its kind the tidca is reportedly formal mechanism for the united states and sacu to negotiate interim traderelated agreements which may serve as the building blocks for future fta the agreement will also allow the two parties to work on key issues in their trade such as trade facilitation technical barriers investment pr omotion and sanitary and phytosanitary standards12 observers have cited several possible reasons for the halt in fta negotiations first the united states and sacu did not agree on the scope of the negotiations per their mandate from congress to pursue comprehensive ftas us negotiators attempted to proceed with negotiations including intellectual property rights government procurement investment and services provisions howeve r sacu officials reportedly argued for these provisions to be excluded from the ne gotiations they called for making market access commitments first and then negotiating the other areas now that congress has extended the agoa benefits to 2015 throug h the agoa acceleration act of 2004 pl 108274 there may be less incentive for sacu countries to complete an fta with the united states also the united states and sacu reportedly held different views on how to include certain industrial sectors in the negotiations the united states preferred what is called negative list where all industrie s are negotiable unless specifically excluded meanwhile sacu preferred positive list wh ere the industries to be included in the negotiations are specified in advance and additional industries ma be included in the agreement over time finally the united states and sacu differed on issues concerning labor rights and environmenta l regulations some observers have speculated that south africa may be leery of negotiating issues that are included in the current wto negotiations so as not to influence their positions in the wto13 former ustr robert zoellick has stated that the united states recognizes that sacu is still an emerging entity it has not developed harmonized policies on many of the issues that would be included in an fta which
