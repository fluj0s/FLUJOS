environment and natural resources policy divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95849individual transferable quotas in fishery management summary an individual transferable quota itq is an allocated privilege of landing specified portion of the total annual fish catch in the form of quota shares this differs from the traditional openaccess approach to commercial fisheries itqs divide the total annual catch quota into smaller individual portions itqs are generally transferable which means fishing vessel owners can sell their itq certificates or buy others certificates or in some cases lease their quota shares depending on how much or whether they want to participate in the fishery itqs are not considered property but privilege to catch share of the total allowable catch of fish or shellfish in given year the initial allocation criteria for itqs are controversial decisions established by regional fishery management councils usually based on the historical catch of vessels to benefit current active fishing vessel owners currently three federal itq programs operate in the united states for surf clam and ocean quahog in midatlantic and new england waters for wreckfish along the south atlantic coast and for halibut and sablefish off alaska internationally new zealand introduced the first major itq program in 1986 other countries with itq management programs include australia canada iceland italy the netherlands and south africa itq programs are intended to reduce overcapitalization promote conservation of stocks improve market conditions and promote safety in the fishing fleet itq programs guarantee share of the catch thus generally slowing or eliminating the race to fish and allowing fishermen flexibility over the rate and timing of their fishing itq programs have been criticized for increasing the incentive for fishermen to file false catch reports and to highgrade their catch in some cases it is also possible for processors or wholesalers to obtain effective monopoly control over the landings itqs could discourage new entrants into fishery because of the additional capital investment required to purchase or lease quota shares in addition itq programs may require additional enforcem ent expense and could cause substantial unemployment and socioeconomic dislocation in coastal communities finally the equity of current approaches to initial allocation of itq shares is questioned for their creation of wealth and windfall profits and their exclusion of processors and crew knowledge and understanding of itq programs is evolving rapidly and much is being learned many of the early problems with itqs resulted from program design and may not be inherent in the concept of itq management however analysis of itq program implementation is scant to date itq programs have generated substantial concerns but how much of that criticism will prove valid and how much of the benefits claimed by proponents might be realized is still to be determinedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95849abstract individual transferable quotas itqs are controversial fishery management measures allocating privileges of landing specified portion of the total annual

university of san diego researched and prepared draft of this report under the supervision of eugene h buck senior analyst in natural resources policy 2 management biologists calculate tac in each fishery the tac is the total amount of fish that may be harvested in fishing season in accordance with fishery management plan for that fishery with adjustments or reductions to compensate for amounts of the species taken as bycatch in other fisheries the tacs are set annually by regional fishery management councils and approved by the secretary of commerce the tacs are intended to ensure the longterm health and stability of the fishery in managing through use of tacs catch reporting is essential to verify individual harvest as well as the total harvest for the fisheryindividual transferable quotas in fishery management1 in 1976 congress enacted the magnuson fishery conservation and management act autho rizing the federal government coastal states the fishing industry and other interested parties to work together through eight regional fishery management councils to manage the nations fishery resources 16 usc 18011882 the initial goal of the magnuson act was to convert the fishery off us shores from foreign dominance to domestic industry this was accomplished within 15 years resulting in the industrialization of some portions of the us fishing fleet another central goal of the magnuson act is to achieve longterm health and stability of various fisheries prevent overfishing and protect restore and promote the fishery through conserva tion and management 16 usc 1853a1a however progress toward this goal has been much slower within the magnuson act congress authorized region councils and the secretary of commerce to limit fishing effort 16 usc 1853b6 individual transferable quotas itqs as well as the related individual fishing quotas ifqs are measures that may be used to reduce effort and fishery overcapitalization what role itqsifqs might play in accomplishing federal fishery management objectives is an issue in the 104th congresss debate on reauthorization of the magnuson act what is an individual transferable quota an itq or ifq is an allocated privilege of landing specified portion of the total annual fish catch in the form of quota shares quota shares designate how the total annual fish catch ie the total allowable catch or tac2 is to be subdivided into specified portions for individual quota holders itq management differs from the traditional open access for commercial fisheries in which there is limitation on who can catch the fish as well as from license limitation programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95849crs2 3 for additional background on overcapitalization see crs report 95296 enr overcapitalization in the us commercial fishing industry 4 although beyond the scope of this paper it is an interesting issue whether foreign ownership of itq quota shares might contravene the intent of the magnuson act to extend us control over all fisheries within us 200mile jurisdiction 5 all the initial new zealand itqs in 1986 were allocated on tonnage basis new zealand law provided that if necessary the government would enter the market and purchase continueditq shares are transferable fishing vessel owners can buy or sell itq certificates or in many programs can lease their quota shares depending on how much or whether they elect to participate in the fishery ifq shares might or might not be transferable purpose of itqs the primary purpose of an itq program is to provide an incentive to manage capital ie reduce or control overcapitalization in commercial fisheries3 and to improve the overall economic efficiency of the fishing industry itqs provide an alternative to open access market safety and social benefits are anticipated from controlling overcapitalization thus itq programs are also intended to create more stable and profitable marketbased system for commercial fishing allocations transfers and property rights regional fishery management councils decide allocation criteria and transfer guidelines for itq shares and may choose variety of ways to design itq programs thus individual itq programs may differ reflecting an active and rapid evolution in the understanding of this management approach as well as differences in the fisheries being managed and the objectives of the councils management plans initial quota share allocations regional councils recommend initial allocation criteria ie qualifying schemes which must comply with the national standard s of the magnuson act 16 usc 1851a council decides who can participate in the us surf clam and ocean quahog itq fishery for example anyo ne domestic or foreign can own itq quota shares4 but only us vessels may harvest and land the product in the alaska halibut and sablefish itq fishery quota shares were initially allocated only to qualified vessel owners who generally must be us citizens or corporati ons partnerships associations or other entities that meet the federal standards for documenting vessel in the united states the individual part of itqs is determined by dividing the annual tac into smaller individual shares fishing vessel owners receive itq certificates that allow them to catch fixed number of shares representing specific percentag e5 of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95849crs3 5 continued sufficient quota to cover any required harvest reduction when faced with potentially large reduction in orange roughy tac the government shifted the risk to the fishing industry by amending law to provide for proportional quotas with tac changes allowed at the beginning of the fishing year 6 fees are collected for itqs because the magnuson act currently prevents charging royalty for use of the resource 16 usc 1854d and because vesse l owners would not support such program if royalties were charged 7 however because of the lengthy administrative process as long as five years or more can elapse between the time regional council determines the method of allocation and when the plan is actually implemented creating the impression that inadequate consideration was given to current participants in the fishery this problem contributed to public opposition to the alaska halibut and sablefish ifq program 8 the choice of years for the qualifying period is often very controversial since it may benefit one segment of vessel owners relative to another 9 although beyond the scope of this report alternative approaches exist wherein transfer is not permitted such an individual quota iq program would not authorize sales and transfers new entry would be provided when allocated shares reverted to the government upon retirement or exit from the fishery and could then be reallocated by lottery auction or other continuedtac itqs have often been allocated to fishing vessel owners without charge6 based on historical catch during specified qualifying period such an allocation is designed to benefit active fishing vessel owner s according to the history of their vessels participation in the fishery7 vessel owners with extensive historic catches during the specified qualifying period of years receive larger itq shares than vessel owners with minimal catch during this same period8 vessel size has also been used as factor in some programs for determining initial itq share allocation participation in an itq program can be separated into ownership of quota shares and ownership operation of fishing vessels used to catch the fish or shellfish granted through those shares by leasing or another arrangement that permits fishing for someone elses quota shares there is growi ng interest in developing initial allocation formulas that reflect factors other than historic catch record that are important to the fishing community such as compliance with fishery regulation s use of clean fishing techniques ie minimal incidental bycatch and historic partici pation even if current catches are relatively small in addition critics of current itq practice are expressing increasing concern that vessel owners are not the only parties that should receive an initial allocation of quota shares initial allocation can easily be the most controversial part of itq program development but once it is completed ideally through consensus of stakeholders it need not be repeated unlike the timeconsuming and contentious battles over allocation that occur frequently in opena ccess and license limitation regimes transfers fishing vessel owners may sell lease or trade their entire quota or parts of their quota to others9 because in theory any qualified individual can acquire quotahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95849crs4 9 continued means nontransferability provisions are most often included when compensation or buyback options for fleet reduction are not acceptable thus nontransferability leads through natural attrition and retirement to smaller fishery at some later point in the fishery modifications to allow transfers or other means for new entry may be considered 10 national standard 4 of the magnuso n act 16 usc 1851a4 requires that fishing privilege allocations be carried out so that particular individual corporation or other entity acquires an excessive share of such privileges experience in eastern canada indicates that shadow markets may develop wherein limits on the total quota that an individual or company can control are exceeded by formal but illegal private arrangements 11 there is interest in the 104th congress in having regular or periodic review and renewal built into itq programs making it even clearer that these privileges are not permanent 12 the internal revenue service has treated quota shares as property seizing april 1995 and auctioning may 1995 more than 15 million worth of alaska halibut and sablefish ifq shares from 65 fishing vessel owners for nonpayment of back taxes 13 indeed it could be conceived that under itq management where quota shares are awarded to past participants in the fishery us citizens could argue as class that their traditional right to participate in an open access fishery had been takenshares the sales andor leases operate in an essentially free market and sale prices and lease rates fluctuate depending on expectations of catch levels and fishshellfish prices however in practice regional councils can and do place restrictions on the market by dictating whether and how itqs can be transfe rred the market can be restricted to prevent excessive consolidation of effort and other undesirable effects with measures such as requirements that the quota share owner be onboard the vessel to prevent absentee ownership caps on the amount of quota share that can be accumulated by an individual or firm and restrictions on trading outside of specified vessel classes or outside of the pool of eligible quota share owners10 those who quit the fishery may sell their quota shares property rights technically itqs can be construed as exclusive perpetual rights however in the united states the national oceanic and atmospheric administration considers itq quota shares not to be property but to convey privilege to catch an amount of fish or shellfish in given year that can be renewed or revoked itqs as currently implemented in the united states are not permanent and quota shares may represent different resource quantity every year as the tac may vary from year to year11 nonetheless the ability to sell or lease itq shares implies more enduring if not permanent fishing access privilege12 while some fishermen have sought congressional clarification that itqs represent only harvest privilege others have argued that an allocation of itq shares is in effect taking of their current right to fish in the openaccess fishery13 the legal basis for this assertion has not been tested extensively in the courts in addition one has yet successfully argued that thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95849crs5 14 for the surf clam and ocean quahog itq program see sea watch international v mosbacher 762 fsupp 370 ddc 1991 15 the cristiania bank of norway and the key bank of seattle have accepted itqs as collateral for factory trawler loans early in 1995 the cristiania bank of norway sold its factory trawler loans to trust company of the west and other financial groups the national westminster bank of jersey is currently one of the largest holders of itq shares in the midatlantic and new england surf clam and ocean quahog fishery 16 this situation parallels the debate over grazing leases and permits on federal lands the law clearly identifies grazing as privilege subject to renewal or revocation for cause by the federal government and not salable or transferable but some are subleasable nonetheless the value of grazing leases and permits is capitalized into the value of the lessees or permitees ranches and is used for loan collateralfederal governments ability to adjust and modify an itq program constitutes grounds for regulatory taking14 to date few private banks accept itqs as collateral for loans primarily because they are not comforta ble with the existing system for determining the history of previous liens and because banks have difficulty in establishing the value ie long term earnings potential of itqs15 the collateral value of alaska halibut and sablefish ifq shares is minimal generally about 20 percent of their market value provisions have been included in several bills introduced in the 104th congress to establish central registry of itqs to better track liens and share ownership the concern remains that the substantial capital value and invest ment in itqs eg possibly 500 million or more in north pacific halibut and sablefish ifqs will make these programs very difficult to terminate and that federal buyouts may become necessary ultimately only congress as interpreted by the courts can determine whether itq quota shares or the opportunity to fish in an openaccess fishery convey right in perpetuity to the owner16 however the chances of successful takings claim based on revocation of an itq are remote since the federal government explicitly reserves the right to revoke itqs or terminat the program the sunset provisions for itqs in some of the bills proposing to amend the magnuson act in the 104th congress create substantial climate of uncertainty among people considering whether to buy or sell itq shares such uncertainty could be very costly to people who are facing decisions on whether to sell or buy more itqs especially those who choose to buy now should the itq program terminate in short time periodhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95849crs6 17 in addition the spiny lobster fishery off florida features an itp individual transferable pot certificate program administered by the state of florida participation in this program is compulsory for spiny lobster fishing in federal offshore waters this program will not be discussed further 18 this is an ifq program rather than an itq program because transferability of shares is restricted by several criteriacurrent itq programs us itq programs currently three federal itqifq programs exist in the united states for surf clams and ocean quahogs in midatlantic and new england waters for wreckfish along the south atlantic coast and for halibut and sablefish in alaskan waters17 the surf clam and ocean quahog itq program was developed by the mid atlantic and new england fishery management councils and implemented by the national marine fisheries service nmfs in october 1990 this was the first federal itq program in the united states the fishery is pursued from offshore of virginia northward to the canadian boundary before the itq program the council tried license limitation program but vessel owners only made their vessels more powerful and efficient increasing fleet capitalization for surf clams itqs were initially allocated to vessel owners based on their historical catch record in 1986 1987 1988 or 1989 itqs for ocean quahogs were allocated according to average catches for years between 1979 and 1987 when vessels reported landings itqs can be traded or leased with requirement for vessel ownership or restriction on the total amount of itq shares owned in 1994 48 vessels landed surf clams while 36 vessels landed ocean quahogs before the itq program in 1989 135 vessels fished surf clams and 69 vessels fished ocean quahogs previous fishing time restrictions on the surf clam fishery were lifted under the itq program for administrative purposes quota share transfers can occur during the last two months of the season the wreckfish itq program was developed by the south atlantic fishery management council and implemented by nmfs in april 1992 these itqs were allocated to vessel owners based 50 percent on their historical catch record in either 1989 or 1990 with the remaining 50 percent divided equally among all those who qualified to receive quota shares to be eligible vessel owner had to document catches of at least 5000 pounds of wreckfish wreckfish itqs are fully marketable and can be sold traded or leased within the management area the wreckfish itq program does not restrict gear type of vessel or the amount of shares one can hold in the 1994 season 17 vessels landed wreckfish 38 vessels had landed wreckfish in 1991 before the itq program the halibut and sablefish ifq program18 off alaska was developed by the north pacific fishery management council in 1992 and implemented by nmfs in march 1995 in 1993 the alaska halibut fleet was estimated at 3460 vessels while the sablefish fleet was estimated at 740 vessels ifqs were allocated to vessel owners

indivisible upon transfer such transfer restrictions exist for quota shares initially issued in amounts greater than 2000 0 pounds of ifq halibut and sablefish ifqs are marketable but can be sold or

for new zealand itq fisheries italy has clam itq program australia has an itq program regulating the southern bluefin tuna fishery and the tasmanian victorian and south australian abalone fisheries south africa manages its abalone fishery by itqs canada has several fisheries that are managed by itqs along both atlantic and pacific coasts and in the great lakes itqs also are also used to manage most icelandic fisheries as well as the netherlands sole and plaice fishery although this is not comprehensive list of all nonus itq programs it indicates that itq management is widely used internationally the international record so far indicates that itqs can be very effective in reducing or eliminating overcapitalization and the race for fish also profits and overall economic efficiency can increase sometimes dramatically the limited data on conservation that have been collected indicate that itq management increases compliance with tacs and other fishery regulations and that itq holders have more vested interest in the future of the fishery than do fishermen in openaccess fisheries as indicated by the value of quota shares many times higher than the value of the catch that the shares represent in given year19 the controversy itq have become quite controversi with different constituencies claiming variety of effects on the fisheries this section looks at seven topics capitalization and consolidation conservation seafood market and price safety enforcement and administration employment and community stability and equity and wealth creation each topic is discussed presenting the arguments voice in suppo rt of itqs thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95849crs8 20 however some people may choose to remain in fishery for lifestyle reasons rather than for making living efficiently criticisms and limitations cited by opponents and an assessment of the experience and performance for implemented us itq programs capitalization and concentration pro under the openaccess race for fish early entrants into fishery find their investment and profits eroded or eliminated by subsequent entrants under an itq program large capital investment to purchase more equipment and hire more crew members to attain greater shortterm fishing power is unnecessary and since fishermen have secure catch share they can fish throughout the entire season and use the most economical way of fishing thus competition to increase fishing power speed on each vessel is reduced by itq programs allowing vessel owners to match capital equipment investment more closely with the amount needed to harvest the quota shares held rather than trying to plan for an unpredictable catch with extraneous capital employed more productively elsewhere in the economy this reduces overcapitalization if fishermen do not fish then they lease their quota shares or if they believe their quota share is too small to make profit then they may buy or lease itqs from other fishermen or sell their shares and leave the fishery the transferability of itqs improve s the overall economic efficiency in the fishery by encouraging some fishing vessel owners to sell or lease their itqs rather than to continue fishing20 fleet efficiency improves under an itq program because fewe r fishermen are able to catch the same amount of product that larger fleet landed under open access fishing vessel owners can liquidate their stake in the fishery by selling quota shares and taking boats off the water or moving to other fisheries fishermen often find it uneconomic to operate with small quantities of quota shares and may opt to sell their itqs receiving some financial return for their investment in the fishery as opposed to receiving return if they go out of business in an openaccess fishery in an unrestricted itq program an individual or group of individuals could influence the market by obtaining disproportionate share of allocations processors or wholesalers could also exert substantial control over the industry by obtaining large portion of the quota shares under an itq program operators with access to capital at the lowest interest rates will be in the best position to acquire additional quota shares thus corporate investors rather than more efficient fishermen are likely to purchase available itq shares in addition expectations for an essentially free market in quota share trading could prove unfounded because of the limited size of the market and uncertainty in share pricing success in commercial fishing has traditionally depend ed upon the ability to switch among fisheries as conditions eg fishing pressure environmental conditions market forces natural fish stock fluctuations warrant such flexibility may be lost as if many fisheries are managed under itq programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95849crs9 21 even prior to itqs this fishery was controlled by handful of vertically integrated processors along with few independents some of which had very large fleets although vessel consolidation has occurred the pattern of control is not markedly different from what it was before the itq program except that almost all the original owneroperated boats are longer fishing few new entrants have entered this fishery 22 borden sold all its quota shares in this fishery in 1994 23 most of these shares are held as escrow or in lieu of collateral and do not necessarily mean control is exercised by these entitieslacking sufficient quota shares to operate economically some fishing vessel operators may leave an itq fishery selling shares to those who have more capital itqs may discourage new entrants into fishery because of the additional capital investment required to purchase or lease quota shares in addition to vessel and gear required to enter an openaccess fishery all the above concentrate shares assessment of performance in the surf clam itq program substantial capital savings have accrued before the itq program fishing was permitted only six hours every other week leading to low use of existing capacity and low efficiency once itqs were implemented fleet size quickly shrank from 128 vessels 1990 to 59 vessels 1992 vessels were consolidated or retired and remaining fishing vessels improved their productivity this reduction occurred while the tacs for surf clams and ocean quahogs were reduced by 12 percent and 8 percent respectively at the same time landings were close to optimum defined as tac with landings of surf clams down only 4 percent and ocean quahogs actually increasing by 4 percent in addition surf clam vessels appeared to operate more efficiently average number of fishing trips per vessel increased from 47 in 1990 to 83 in 1992 in the surf clam and ocean quahog itq program large companies control substantial portion of the quota shares21 borden major food company had attained control of 40 percent of the quahog and 25 to 30 percent of the surf clam shares in 199022 currently national westminster bank of jersey and kpmg an accounting firm are the largest holders of itqs in the surf clam and ocean quahog fishery23 thus substantial consolidation was already in progress when the itq program was implemented for this fishery however control can be exerted in openaccess fisheries where relatively few processors may determine the price offered to fishermen consolidation also occurred in the wreckfish itq program but with little concentration of shares by processors or other corporate owners the halibut and sablefish ifq program apportioned ifq shares to different size vessels and restricted transfer to vessels in the same size class thus small vessel shares cannot be bought out by larger vessels in response to concerns that itqs may be detrimental by restricting flexible movem ent of fishermen among fisheries advocates of itqs point out that flexible movement among fisheries was primarily fishermans response to short derby fishing and flight from intense competition as such the stability provided by an itq program may make such flexibility less important in addition even under anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95849crs10 24 under open access fisherman who moves to avoid high bycatch could lose in the race to fish under itq programs however such disincentive exists to discourage vessel owners from ceasing fishing operations and moving to new location itq programs create an incentive to move since bycatch can be more effectively monitored on an individual basis continueditq program fishermen have the option of purchasing shares in several different fisheries to preserve the flexible option of moving between fisheries criticism that itqs make it difficult to enter fishery indicates that itq programs are indeed addressing their objectiv of reducing overcapitalization lacki ng sufficient quota shares to operate economically some fishing vessel operators may choose to leave an itq fishery selling shares to those with capital itq programs do discourage casual new entrants into fishery because of the additional capital investment required to purchase or lease quota shares however itq program design can incorporate lottery or other means to allocate reserved tac or revoked quota shares to potential serious new entrants thus new entrants replace existing effort in the first year of the alaska halibut and sablefish ifq program sales of ifq shares appeared brisk with many new entrants to the fishery thus the initial conclusion might be that reasonable balance might have been achieved by consolidating the fishing fleet not by restricting new entry the general pattern in itq programs has been fleet consolidation indeed it appears inevitable although not necessarily bad that itq programs will contribute to greater wealth concentration within the commercial fishing indus try however itq program design can alleviate or eliminate excessive share consolidation through ownership limits requirements that quota share owners participate in the fishing or other similar measures restricting quota share trading such as were incorporated in the alaska halibut and sablefish ifq program alternatively fleet expansion could occur if market conditions favor smaller fishing operatio ns or should technological advances favor certain economies of scale which prompt additional capitalization in addition the number of vessels and participating shareholders in an itq fishery could increase if large shareholders subdivide and sell all or portions of their quotas in some circumstances therefore itq programs alone may not promote consolidation sufficiently to reduce overcapitalization without companion effort reduction program involving compensation or other buyout mechanisms to reduce fleet size conservation pro an itq program grants fishing vessel owner share of the fishery to the degree that fishing vessel owners react as if they were owners of the fishery and that the fishery were longer commons overexploitation or resource waste that reduces the value of their fishing privileges will be minimized and to the extent that fishing vessel owners perceive an increased security in their interests in the fishery they have incentives to conserve and manage the resource to protect the value of those interests also when the race to fish is eliminated and time is longer straint fishermen tend to operate more efficiently the potential for reducing incidental bycatch is an additional benefit since it is believed that fishermen will fish more cleanly ie minimize their bycatch if they can fish in less hurried fashion24httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95849crs11 24 continued variations of itq programs have been discussed that allocate separate itqs for bycatch of certain prohibited species under such system vessel could be required to stop fishing if the bycatch itq was reached before the target species itq thus providing addit ional incentive to minimize bycatch as long as observers were sufficient to assure that all bycatch was reported for additional information on incidental bycatch see crs report 90575 enr waste from fish harvesting and processing growing environmental concerns 25 in the alaska halibut and sablefish fisheries before ifq implementation some processors paid different prices while others did not it is uncertain how this practice might change under the ifq program 26 pacific coast not alaska sablefish are managed by trip limits with price differences of as much as 100 based on size the incentive to highgr ade is this open access fishery is obviousin addition itq programs could be designed to penalize poor bycatch performance through forfeiture of itq privileges primary objective of ifq programs is to give incentives to conserve the resource showing participants that the fish they protect and save have greater likelihood of benefitting themselves and not others as long as only retained catch must be reported rather than total catch itq programs may encourage highgrading under individual quotas fishermen seek to deliver the best quality of fish to maximize the price received the fisherman has an incentive to highgrade the catch by discarding lower quality fish that count against the quota this situation is less problematic in openaccess fisheries because the race to fish usually provides substant ial incentive for fishermen to deliver as much as they can catch as quickly as possible in addition migratory resources exploited by several user groups in different locations may not be amena ble to slower pace of fishing throughout the year under an itq system in anticipation of itq program implementation fishermen may overreport their catch in an attempt to gain an advantage in any quota share allocation scheme based on historical performance in the fishery this erroneous reporting could seriously impair the factual basis for managing the fishery making profit is the prime objective of commercial fishing thus incentives to conserve the fishery resource may be less effective where only the fishing vessel owner and not the crew and skipper own the itq shares and with thousands of boats in the alaska halibut fishery even vessel owner holding itq shares has every reason to believe that what his single vessel does will have little effect on the fishery assessment of performance highgrading is likely whenever the quantity of fish that may be landed is limited as much by vessel capacity and trip limits as by an itq program especially where large price differentials exist for fish of different size or sex25 thus highgrading problems are not limited to itq fisheries but also occur in an openacce ss fishery26 an itq program designed to account for total catch rather than just retained catch and including welldesigned observer program will minimize highgrading and may be necessary to assure that itq program design benefits are attained the surf clam and ocean quahog and the wreckfish itqhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95849crs12 27 however even itqs will be unable to slow the pace where the fishing season is compressed due to specific biological or behavioral features of the species targeted eg brief spawning aggregations of herring adult salmon returning to ascend rivers and spawn regional councils will likely impose some restrictions on fishing flexibility and freedom eg restrictions on time location and methods of fishing to attain conservation goalsprograms do not require fleet observers so current atsea bycatch and discards cannot easily be estimated july 20 1995 report from fisheries information systems in juneau alaska noted that after ifq implementation groundfish bycatch discards declined from 24 percent to less than 10 percent in the sablefish fishery in addition incidental catch declined while small sablefish discard declined from more than 3 percent to less than 2 percent the presence of nmfs fishery observers on larger vessels in the alaska ifq program undoubtedly restricts the opportunity to highgrade smaller vessels are unable to carry observers the initial flat prices offered by processors across different size classes of halibut during early 1995 suggest little incentive to highgrade however the increased landing size of sablefish reported for the canadian itq program suggests that highgrading can be concern decrease in vessels fishing achieved under an itq program probably will result in decreased fishing mortality as long as highgrading is not excessive even with highgrading survival of discards under an itq program may be higher because fish can be handled properly although not used in current programs an alternative approach could set quotas low enough to compensate for expected overfi shing or highgrading thus arguably attaining more optimal catch opposition to proposed 50percent reduction in wreckfish tac declined substantially after itqs were implemented due to new concerns for the longterm health of the resource although under itq programs fishery managers may be able to concentrate more on conservation issues stock assessments often become embroiled in seasonal controversies since they influence tac and the value of quota shares conservation benefits of itq programs derived from the implied ownership of the resource through quota shares could be eroded by insecure expectations about the duration and conditions of itq privileges anxiety and uncertainty about the future can cause itq share owners to become just as oriented to shortterm profits as opposed to longterm sustainability as openaccess fishermen seafood market and price pro itqs generally should eliminate or at least slow the race to catch fish common in many openaccess fisheries by allowing fishermen flexibility over the rate and timing of fishing and providing them more freedom to customize their opera tions27 itqs increase the flexibility of fishing operations within fishery by imposing fewer restrictions on fishing period and choice of gear vessel or technique than in openaccess fisheries fishing vessel owners decide on the time location and fishing method fishermen can fish at different times and thus supply processors with more continuous flow of highquality product in addition financial incentives for retaininghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95849crs13 and marketing nontarget species will likely increase under itq programs processors will not be bombarded with huge amount of raw product during compressed season that may exceed their handling capacity and might have to be frozen for future processing with the moderate and regular landings under an itq program more raw product can be processed for the highervalue fresh market processors will also achieve higher utilization rates by slowing down processing operations thus fishermen have more bargaining power with buyersprocessors and are likely to receive higher prices and the fishery should produce stable or increasing supply for consumers seafood quality is also likely to improve itqs could increase seafood costs because consumers will miss the low prices that occur during and because of the race to fish in addition the market power created by consolidation of itq shares in smaller number of owners could lead to pricefixing and consumers would pay more than in an openaccess fishery assessment of performance under an itq program competition for market price will likely replace competition for speed in catching fish which prevails in open access fisheries under an itq system the most successful fisherman will more likely be the one who best minimizes costs and maximizes product value thus physical competition may be replaced by economic or market competition before itqs surf clams averaged 800 per bushel while ocean quahogs were 300 per bushel at the end of 1994 the average price of surf clams had risen to 12001400 per bushel and ocean quahogs to 400450 per bushel before implementing the wreckfish itq program fishermen occasionally flooded the market with wreckfish the fishery closed in august 1991 when the entire 2 millionpound annual tac had been reached during the 19911992 season wreckfish sold for betw een 110 and 155 per pound since the itq program supply of wreckfish has been constant and average price per pound stable at 169 in 19921993 184 in 19931994 and 186 in 19941995 in the north pacific sablefish prices have increased from 122 per pound in 1994 to 175 or more per pound since ifq implementati on similar increases are reported for halibut likely because more product is going into the fresh market rather than being frozen in the british columbia halibut fishery the price paid to fishermen has become quite volatile how much of this may be attributable to implementation of an itq program is conjecture willingness of consumers to pay more for itq fish derives from perceptions of higher fish quality and increased availability of fresh product throughout more of the year in addition consumers have the potential to influence product form more under an itq program where processing need not be hurried or largescalehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95849crs14 safety pro increased flexibility in choosing when to fish should improve safety fishermen can fish at more leisurely pace and avoid fishing in dangerous weather or dangerous locations market forces could reduce potential safety benefits if processors offer premium prices during inconvenient or less safe times assessment of performance because itqs guarantee that ones allocated catch will be available later they provide the option of choosing when to fish under itq programs fishermen may still choose to fish in bad weather competing to supply processors since the best price for catch may be offered during and immediately after storm periods in addition the race to fish may not be completely eliminated by itqs since the catch per unit of fishing effort expended is still likely to be higher at the beginning of the fishing season although some incentive may remain to fish in less than optimum conditions under itq programs fewer personal injuries and fatalities and less gear destruction should occur than under comparable openaccess conditions july 18 1995 report from liability pool marine safety reserve noted substantial decline in the longline vessel accident rate injuries per fishing day following implementation of the halibut and sablefish ifq program enforcement and administration pro itq shareholders will have increased interest in fishery enforcement by nmfs personnel who monitor itq landings since this enforcement effort protects the value and possibly the size of their future share in the fishery elements of the fishing industry advocate 100percent observer coverage for all fishing vessels in itq programs quota shareholders have an incentive to report on each other since cheating directly harms individual quota holders additional incentive to report can be created by pooling quota shares revoked from cheaters and reallocating it to remaining quota holders the fear of losing itq shares temporarily or permanently may also provide an incentive that encourages compliance with regulations in itq fisheries however this is complicated by determinations of who is responsible for the illegal activity those operating the vessel the vessel owner or the itq share holder with an itq program fisherman personally benefits from poaching quota busting and false catch accounting ie underreporting the quantity of fish landed with open access only aggregate catches increase from false catch reports and one fisherma n filing false report might not benefit thus itqs increase the incentive to operate illegally itqs may increase the incentive to cheat because unreported landings would supplement the shortterm value of guaranteed quota shares the increased dockside monitoring and enforcement staff across the north pacific for halibut and sablefish especially makes enforcement expensive while the sale of illegal halibut can be quite profitablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95849crs15 assessment of performance in the surf clam and ocean quahog fishery administration and enforcement costs have plummeted since the itq program began before the itq program enforcement costs in this fishery were exceptionally high because unusually stringent management regulations were in effect the coast guard closely monitore d the number of trips and fishing hours of each individual vessel now extensive monitoring is longer necessary dockside monitoring alone is considered adequate in the british columbia halibut itq program itq holders became actively involved in efforts to achieve good monitoring and enforcement and the few offenders were turned in by other fishermen the south atlantic regional council reports that wreckfish itq holders have been cooperative that compliance with itq program regulations has been good and that administrative and enforcement costs are low however this optimistic view is less persuasive given the small numb er of vessels and limited area fished in these fisheries simplified enforcement is more likely to be found in smaller fisheries arising from peer pressure and based on mutual interests of itq shareholders on the other hand nmfs estimated that increased monitoring and enforcement costs to cover additional landing ports and vessel observers for the halibut and sablefish ifq program would be approximately 2 million annually to counter high grading and bycatch concerns and deal with the large fleet and area covered thus the outlook is less optimistic larger itq programs will likely require an extensive enforcement effort and the number of viola tions could be substantial however regional managers believe that the estimated economic benefits of the ifq program will far outweigh the increase in management costs employment and community stability pro under an itq program jobs in the fishing industry are anticipated to become more stable and permanent replacing the short temporary or seasonal jobs characteristic of many openaccess fisheries in addition smaller less technologically sophisticated vessels may prove to be more economically efficient under an itq system because they can catch unit of fish with less input of technology labor and capital itqs will lead to smaller fishing workforce and potentially increase unemployment some may be unable to find employment elsewhere and those who do find jobs may earn less the most significant loss is likely to be parttime fishermen and deck hands vessels will not need the dozen or so deck hands to participate in frantic derby openings they will be able to fish more efficiently with fewer deck hands under itq management commercial fishing is laborintensive located in relatively isolated communities itqs could harm such communities should reduction in fleet size fewer employees and relatively stable landings following itq implementation reduce the number of processors and demand for associated shoreside services these effects can disrupt economics of small communities that depend on commercial fishing especially during the transition from open access to an itq program such impacts if abrupt are likely to be painful for small communitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95849crs16 28 mccay bonnie j and carolyn f creed social impacts of itqs in the sea clam fishery final report to the new jersey sea grant collect program new jersey marine sciences consortium february 1994assessment of perfor mance in an itq program or any limitedaccess management program reduction in the number of individuals allocated shares and reduction in fleet size and capacity will likely result in net job loss however job loss is inevitabl in an overcapitalized fishery with or without itqs due to fishery collapse declining profits or shortened seasons in addition working conditions are likely to improve under an itq program due to the slower pace of fishing in the surf clam and ocean quahog fishery where many smaller vessels were retired from the fishery onethird of the people working in the fishery lost their jobs when the former smallvessel quota shares were sold to large companies in 1992 however jobs shifted from infrequent trips at sea or rotation among several different vessels to fewer jobs requiring more labor time at sea and on shore with longer periods on the same vessel less crew employed for longer period may result in the same overall level of employment with less turnover under certain situations the reduced competition for experienced crew under itq programs may depress wages especially where large corporations own itq shares employment may be less secure and totally dependent upon whether and to whom shares might be leased in the surf clam and ocean quahog fishery crew report that they have to work longer hours under itq management for roughly the same wages they received previously in addition companies have attempted to change the basis for giving wages with crew shares being reduced in most cases28 others are more optimistic and believe that crewing jobs will more often be better paid under an itq system leadin g the deep sea fishermans union of seattle to support the creation of the alaska halibut and sablefish ifq program it is still too early to assess the impacts of itq programs on small coastal communities because early us itq programs involved small fisheries in more develop ed coastal regions however in some situations shift from many short term seasonal jobs to fewer longterm jobs may lead to more stability and thus could be better for small coastal communities the transition from current circumstances to an itq program with fewer fishermen different supply industries and communities that form different links with the smaller possibly healthier fishing industry may be long and traumatic for some communities however safeguards to impede or minimize community change can be built into an itq program especially through geographical restrictions on quota trade the alaska halibut and sablefish ifq progr am should be watched closely because it included measures to protect small vessels operating from small coastal communities it comes down to value judgment as to whether boomandbust economy is better than smaller but more stable economy for small coastal fishing community how well the federal government works with small communities in transition will ease or exacerbate the pain associated with these changeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95849crs17 29 although in some itq fisheries processors may own itqs eg the surf clam and ocean quahog fishery 30 matulich scott c et towards more complete model of individual transferable fishing quotas itqs implications of incorporating the processing sector journal of economics and management in press 31 catching privileges allocated to fishermen processing privileges allocated to processorsequity and wealth creation pro the magnuson act provides for equity through significant direction for determining how allocations are to be made both in the national standards 16 usc 1851a and in the limitedentry provisions 16 usc 1853b6 itq programs ensure equity through market mechanism that allows entry into the fishery for those not receiving an initial allocation of quota shares contrary to other management approaches such as the decommercialization of the billfish and redfish fisheries that completely and permanently disenfranchise commercial fishermen itqs can disproportionally benefit those who own the quota shares over others in industry including crew skippe rs and processors29 allocation of quota shares to vessel owners alone does not recognize the traditional composite roles of all parties in creating an historic catch record critics wonder why vessel owners alone should be recognized in the initial share allocation process additional concerns arise from the usual situation where itq shares are allocated to fishing vessel owners and not to processors processors like fishermen capitalized to support the race to fish under prevailing openaccess conditions critics suggest that itq allocation to only the harvesting sector ignores the effects of processor capitalization and results in redistribution of wealth from the processing secto r to the harvesting sector through price concessions due to fishing season elongation and the power fishermen attain through their great er ability to choose when and how to place fish in the market30 inattention to such distributional conflicts are the source of considerable controversy in deciding whether or not to implement an itq program and if so how it might best be designed compensation of processors or symmetrical initial allocation of itq privileges to both harvester and processor sectors sometimes referred to as twopie allocation scheme31 are suggested remedies the potential arbitrariness of the initial itq allocation is large concern because it can convey windfall profits and create considerable wealth currently there are standards on how allocations might be done fairly and equitably for example regardless of ones record in the alaska halibut and sablefish fishery vessel owners who did not fish between 1988 and 1990 were ineligible to receive initial ifq shares conversely someone who last fished in or retired after 1988 would have received or their estate would have received quota shares while someone who entered the fishery in 1991 would receive none assessment of performance what constitutes an equitable approach to the initial allocation of itq shares has yet to be answered who should share in the initialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95849crs18 32 economic or scarcity rents are the returns to land labor and capital in excess of the minimum necessary for production in free markets with private ownership of the factors of production rents assure efficient allocation of resources itqs have been developed as an allocation system where one factor of production fish is not privately owned however section 16 usc 1854d of the magnuson act restricts revenue collections to more than the amount required to cover administrative costs 33 either an open lottery or lottery among pool of applicants meeting certain qualifying conditions 34 although beyond the scope of this report other measures include harvesters gaining management control over certain fisheriesallocation of quota shares is one of the most critical questions allocations based on historic participation in the fishery must use sufficiently recent performance data to reward currently active fishermen but not use such recent years landings that intentional overreporting of catch in anticipation of itqs can introduce other inequities into the process others consider historic catch to be seriously flawed basis on which to allocate itqs since it rewards inappropriate behavior such as illegal fishing in addition policymakers will continue to wrestle with questions of whether some wealth created through itq shares should be returned to the government as resource rent cost recovery although not specifically provided for in the magnuson act congress could choose to amend this act to provi for the use of any of several alternative initial allocation methods focusing on the collection of economic rent32 for example itqs could also be sold initially by auction this would generate substantial revenues for the allocator ie the federal government at the expense of the purchasing fishermen in addition periodic sales or renewals of itq shares might be conducted by auction to increase the return to the public alternatively an initial fee and an annual ad valorem fee for program administration could legitimately be collected in exchang for the granting of an exclusive catch privilege that itqs represent another alternative might be lottery33 where the federal government might require winners to pay portion of the quotas value before taking possessio n another option focuses on the collection of transfer fees whenever quota shares change hands other means for collecting economic rent undoubtedly also exist34 most itq programs are adopted when fisheries are heavily overcapitalized and going throu gh substantial economic stress although itq program designers may anticipate that economic rent can be collected over time there is also the presumption that operators in an overca pitalized fishery would first have to survive difficult adjustment period participants and managers of older itq programs which did not provide initially for the collection of economic rent are engaging in heated debate on whether some fee structure is appropriate and should be implementedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95849crs19 summary accumulated knowl edge and understanding of itq programs are rapidly evolving and much is being learned itq programs are very flexible and the major concern is how well regional fishery management councils design an effective program to address the characteristics of the regional fishery and its problems early us programs were small with less than 200 vessels conclusions based on these efforts while informative might be of limited practical application however the halibut and sablefish ifq program will provide essential new information about program design to address regional concerns nevertheless itqs may be more difficult or even impossible to use in managing the comple xities of multispecies fisheries and fisheries for species whose abundance is highly variable many early problems with itqs are attributable to program design and may not be inherent problems with the concept of itq management proponents claim that itq systems can be designed to mitigate or obviate almost every criticism although the results to date are scant critics warn that itqs can create dynamics that threaten to overwhelm many design features intended to meet regionally determined goals incorporating equity and stewardship itq programs have generated substantial concerns but how much of that criticism will prove valid and how many of the benefits claimed by proponents might be realized is yet to be determined regardless there is an abiding fear among some fishermen that the character of the commercial fishing industry and small fishing communities will be sacrificed or lost particularly if itqs result in large corporations or other absentee owners controlling the industry with focused interes t in market share rather than on the resource and the people fishermen fear that large corporation may seek to dominate the north pacific groundfish trawl fishery similar to the way shares were consolidated in the surf clam and ocean quahog fishery in the rush to address overcapitalization concerns these critics of itqs fear that social and economic concerns may be inadequately considered and that the independent fishermans traditional freedom and flexibility to follow the fish will be sacrificed propriety interests related to holding itq quota shares are likely to provide conservation incentives however these incentives are eroded when itqs are delimited as revocable privileges and could be further diminished if sunset provisions are enacted to terminate itqs after specific time period conservation incentives are most effective when fishing vessel owners feel most secure participate in the fishing and are relatively immobile where the linkage between these is incomplete conservation may suffer and enforcement costs climb key issue is whether and if so how congress should provide guidance to nmfs and the regional councils about designing itq programs to provide secure expectations about the duration and conditions of itq privileges and about the length of tenure of those privileges necessary to bring about hopedfor improvements in resource stewardship it remains uncertain whether any increase in potential legal challenges to itq programs will diminish the will and ability of nmfs to deal effectively with conservation and enforcement concerns the behavioral response of consumers processors and fishermen to itq programs will play large role in determinin g whether the impacts of itqhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95849crs20 implementation are positive or negative consumers may pay higher prices for itq fish but do so with the perception that they are receiving higher value product since consumers could easily substitute other lowerpriced protein sources for seafood processors could choose to emphasize itq species to fill slack time between other episodi c ie migratory or seasonal fisheries fishermen could precipitate domino effect of management problems if largescale movement into remaining openaccess fisheries occurs as itq programs consolidate effort in selected traditional fisheries an additional concern is the potential for itq programs to dramatically alter the balance between the harvesting and processing sectors of the commercial fishing industry under openaccess conditions with short seasons processors can exert substantial control over markets and prices however the power of the processing secto r is greatly diminished by an itq program since fishermen have much more freedom to choose when to provide fish thus how much itqs might empower fishermen and allow them to derive conc essions that could harm the consumer or blunt conservation efforts is problematic one could easily say that we have lived the past century with processors wielding the balance of this same power finally some of the criticisms leveled at itq programs are common to all fishery management and one should take care to judge itq progra ms by appropriate measures ie differences from the fishery under open access commercial fishing is very complex itqs must not be seen as providing the final or sole solution to fishery management concerns but are only one tool to be used in conjunction with more traditional fishery manage ment options itqs alone can address only some of the present concerns eg itqs alone will not bring about restoration of any fishery because itqs do not address habitat quality and other environmental issues
