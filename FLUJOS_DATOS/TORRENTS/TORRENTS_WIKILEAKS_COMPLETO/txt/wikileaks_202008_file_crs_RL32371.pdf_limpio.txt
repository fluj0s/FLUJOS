httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32371trade remedies primer introduction the united states and many of its trading partners use trade remedy laws to lessen the adverse impact of various tr ade practices on domestic industries producers and workers these laws are d eemed consistent with us international obligations provided they conform to the tr ade remedy provisions agreed to as part of the uruguay round of mu ltilateral trade negotiations 19861994 and other trade agreements to which the us is party overview the three most frequently applied us trade remedy laws are antidumping countervailing duty and safeguards enfor cement of these laws is primarily carried out through the administrative investigati ons and actions of two us government agencies the international trade administration ita of the department of commerce and the international trade commission itc antidumping ad laws provide relief to domes tic industries that have been or are threatened with the adverse impact of imports sold in the us market at prices that are shown to be less than fair market value the relief provi ded is an additional import duty placed on the dumped imports countervailing duty cvd laws are designed to give similar kind of relief to domestic industries that have been or are threatened with the adverse impact of imported goods that have been subsidized by foreign government or public entity and can therefore be sold at lower prices than similar goods produced in the united states the relief provided is an additional import duty placed on the subsidized imports safeguard also referred to as escape clause laws give domestic industries relief from import surges of goods that are fair ly traded the most frequently applied safeguard law section 201 of the trade act of 1974 is designed to give domestic industry the opportunity to adjust to th new competition and remain competitive the relief provided is generally an add itional temporary impor t duty temporary import quota or combination of both sa feguard laws also require presidential action in order for relief to be put into effect this report outlines the statutory authority investigative procedures and statistical outcomes for 1 us ad and c vd actions and 2 us safeguard actions other trade remedy laws not discussed in this report incl ude section 337 of the tariff act of 1930 as amended which treats as unlawful

trade trade adjustment assistance taa programs provide readjustment ssistance for firms and workers who have suffered due to increased imports as result of trade agreements brief description of these trade remedy laws appear s in an appendix to this report congressional interest trade remedies have been the focus of much domestic and international debate in recent years on the domestic front the preservation of us authority to enforce rigorously its trade laws was major negotiating objective included in presidential trade promotion authority tpa in the 107th congress pl 107210 and is likely to be part of any future grant of tpa at the outset of the wto doha round of multilateral trade negotiations other wto member nations were c oncerned about the intensive worldwide use of trade remedies since the enactment of th uruguay round agreements in 1995 developing nations such as india and s outh africa had begun using trade remedy actions more frequently whereas they we re tools used almost exclusively by developed nations in the past this inte rnational concern led several countries to press for negotiations on changes to the wto antidumping formally known as the agreement on implementation of article vi and subsidies agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures despite the fforts of us trade negotiators and some in congress to keep them off the table in recent years the number of ad and cvd cases worldwide has been declining but m odifications to these wto agreements are still expected to be key focus of bate should doha r ound talks resume some congressional observers were also concerned when wto dispute settlement and appellate body panels made determinations against two us trade remedy provisions the antidumping act of 1916 and the continued dumping and subsidy offset act cdsoa finding that these measures violated us obligations under the wto1 the antidumping act of 1916 was repealed in the miscellaneous trade and technical corr ections act of 2004 section 2006 of pl 108429 december 3 2004 despite consid erable congressional resistance to repealing the cdsoa measure proposing its repeal was included in the house version of the fy2006 budget reconcilia tion bill hr 4241 introduced november 7 2005 this measure was subsequently included in the version of the budget reconciliation bill that passed the house and senate with provision that will allow disbursements under the act to continue fo r all goods entering until october 1 2007 and was signed by the president on february 8 2006 pl 109171 an administrative practice used in ad and c vd investigations known as zeroing was also challenged in wto dispute nd on january 9 2007 the appellate body also determined against the united states in dispute on zeroing compliance in this dispute could be accomplished without legislative action and the commercehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32371crs3 2 ibid 3 the international trade administration i ta of the department of commerce conducts continueddepartment began imp lementing new administrative procedures in midapril 20072 these wto determinations which some consider as adverse to us interests have caused some in congress to call for great er congressional scrutiny of wto dispute settlement and appe llate body decisions involving the united states action in 110th congress in the 110th congress these and other emerging factors led to renewed interest in trade remedies us manufacturing job losses that many believe are due to increased imports or offshore outsourcing have caused some in congress to call for strengthening trade remedy laws and provi ding greater relieve for us workers in addition the trade deficit especially the rapidly growing bilateral deficit with china have led to increased congressional interest in implementing variety of trade remedy op tions including amending trade laws to apply countervailing action to nonmarket economy countries such as china third some believe that adverse rulings on us trade remedy actions by world trade organization wto dispute settlement panels along with some adverse us court decisions have led to weakening of u s trade remedy laws fourth in 2008 the the us economy is experiencing an economic downturn which many observers believe may deepen into recession during difficult economic times interest in trade remedy actions generally increases observers anticipated that legislation seeking to amend trade remedy laws along with other trade issues such as expanding trade adjustment assistance will continue to be focus of congressional interest issu addressed in 2007 such as attempts to strengthen us antidumping countervailing and safeguard statutes address issues regarding the applicability of these laws to china and other nonmarket economy countries or expand trade adjus tment assistance to apply to workers adversely affected by trade that results in the imposition of ad cvd or safeguard measures may continue to receive legisla tive attention in addition bills seeking to give manufacturers that use of goods subject to ad or cvd proceedings larger role as interested parties in trad remedy proceedings have also

defines the term subs idy as financial contribution by government or public body within the terr itory of wto member which confers benefit three categories of subsidies ar identified 1 prohibited

economists opposing this type of import relief have pointed out that the administrative nature of the ad and cvd investigative processes makes it easier to institute protectionist measures they maintain that the laws delegate the investigation and imposition of duties to administrative agencies so that the decisions and possible negative political fallout are removed from the president and congress13 in addition since certain amount of prior knowledge is necessary in order to follow the procedure the process is engineered so that it does not lend itself to close public or media scrutiny14 some analysts have also criticized the administrative agencies particularly the ita for administering investigations in such way that they are biased in favor of domestic industries15 supporters of trade remedies point out that current ad and cvd procedures have been worked out through painful and difficult multilateral trade negotiations and that this is one of the reasons that the investigative procedure is so detailed furthermore supporters maintain that the process is detailed b ecause investigations must be transparent and provide voice for all parties concerned16

deep and vocal controversy in the us furn iture industry because some larger us companies had decided to import certain furniture lines from china while continuing domestic production of more highend

the timing and volume of the imports should be assessed in order to determine whether there has been substantial increase in imports over short period of time third hr 708 seeks to amend the criteri

can lead to factory closures and loss of domestic manufacturing jobs some workers in the service sector are also feeling the effects of import competition due to increased offshore outsourcing these factors among others are reasons that many in congress support strengthening these laws and insist that the united states must preserve the ability to rigorously enforce its trade laws in international negotiations others believe that trade remedy actions the vast majority of which are ad or cvd investigations and orders in and of themselves introduce inefficiencies in both domestic and international economies that result in decreased economic welfare for example some in congress have become concerned about the additional costs accruing to us producers who use imports of
