v us 332 us 392 1947 that because patent gives the owner monopoly on the commercial exploitation of the patented product it also creates the presumption of suﬃcient market power to allow the owner to

report for congress received through the crs weborder code rs22421 april 13 2006 antitrust effect of patent on tying product illinois tool works inc v independent ink inc janice rubin legislative attorney american law division summary antitrust law generally disfavors tyin g arrangementsthose in which vendor conditions the sale of sired product on the purchase of another possibly notso desired product not only have tying rrangements been considered unlawful as violations of section 1 of th sherman act 15 usc 1 they were determined to be per automatically unlawful it was assume d until at least the late1970s first that such arrangements were only possible because the seller possessed sufficient market power in the tying product to allow him to create the tie and second that they served purpose other than the suppression of competition in the market for the tied unwanted product then in us steel corp v fortner enterprises inc 429 us 610 1977 fortner ii the supreme court recognized that there might be reason other than sellers ability to force buyer to accept the tie ie that the fact of buyer acceptance was not necessarily an indication that the seller possessed market power in the tying product however it has continued to be assume d since the doctrine of patent misuse was imported into antitrust jurisprudence in international salt co v us 332 us 392 1947 that because patent gives the owner monopoly on the commercial exploitation of the patented product it also creates the presumpti on of sufficient market power to allow the owner to force tie between the patented product and some unpatented product congress eliminated that presumption in the patent area when it amended the patent act in 1988 in illinois tool works inc v independent ink inc 547 us ____ 041329 decided marc h 1 2006 the court eliminated the presumption in antitrust law today we hold that in all cases involving tying arrangement the plaintiff must prove that the defendant has market power in the tying product slip opinion at 16 emphasis added background conditioning the purchase of product tyi ng product on the simultaneous purchase of some other product tied product has long been cons

contracts or conspiracies in restraint of trade conduct that is not normally ilateral the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit relied on supreme court reasoning to note that the essence of section 1s contract combination or conspi racy requirement in the tying context is the agreement however reluctant of buyer to purchase from seller tied product or service along with tying product or service to hold otherwise would be to re ad the words contract and combination out of section 1 systemcare inc v wan g laboratories corp 117 f3d 1137 11423 10th cir 1997 emphasis added 2 15 usc 14 3 northern pacific railway v ited states 356 us 1 6 11 1958 4 ie control over the market in which his product competes defendant facing charge of unlawful tying as in any other attempted m onopolization allegation would prefer to have the relevant product market andor the relevant geogra phic market defined broadly if he can include several interchangeable substitutes for his pr oduct its and therefore his proportion of that product market will be calculated differently than if the product market is confined to only his product or his pr oduct and merely few alternatives similarly the more expansive the definition of the geographic market within wh ich the alleged monopolist is operating the less likely it is that he will be seen to control sufficiently large portion of it to justify determination of monopolist or findi ng of attempted monopolization agreement not to purchase any future requi rements for the tied product from any source other than the original vendor is considered an unlawful tie1 either may also be considered violation of s ection 3 of the clayton act2 which prohibits socalled tie outsconditioning purchases on agreements not to use the goods or services of competitor of the tying products vendor both varieties of tying arrangement are considered to skew the market and harm competition where product ties are successfully exact ed competition on the merits with respect to the tied product is inevitably curbed i ndeed tying agreements serve hardly any purpose beyond the suppression of competition standard oil co of california and standard stations v united states 337 us 293 305306 they deny competitors free access to the market for the tied product not because the party imposing the tying requirements has better pr oduct or lower price but because of his power or leverage in another market at the same time buyers are forced to forego their free choice between competing products moreover we think that per treatment is appropriate because the vice of tying arrangements lies in the use of economic power in one market to restrict competition on the merits in another regardless of the source from which the power is derived and whether the power takes the form of monopoly or not3 courts have traditiona lly required however in order to find that tie is in fact unlawful that the seller possess market power4 in the tying product and that more than minimus amount of commerce in the tied produc t be affected the tie therefore would be the guilty behavior that rende red an otherwise lawful monopolist guilty ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22421crs3 5 most usually monopolization offenses are pros ecuted under section 2 of the sherman act 15 usc 2 which prohibits monopolization or ttempts to monopolize in restraint of trade depending on the behavior being challenged how ever section 7 of the clayton act 15 usc 18 which prohibits mergers or acquisitions th at may tend to lessen competition or create monopoly or as noted supra note 2 section 1 of the sherman act may also be utilized for more detailed discussion of monopoly and monopolization see crs report rs20241 monopoly and monopolizationfundamental but separate concepts in us antitrust law 6 the doctrine of patent misuseat least in the c ontext of tying arrangementis similar to the antitrust offense of monopolization the doctrine holds that the patentee seeks to extend his lawful monopoly into an adjacent market it has been summarized by noting that the key inquiry in patent misuse cases is whether the patentee has impermissibly broadened the scope of his patent with anticompetitive effect roger schechter john r thomas intellectual property the law of copyrights patents and trademarks 213 2003 7 the presumption that market power is confe rred by patent originated in motion picture patents co v universal film mfg co 243 us 502 1917 and continued unabated through the decision in dawson chemical co v rohm haas co 448 us 176 1980 congress ended the presumption entirely in 1988 35 us c 271d5 section 201i of pl 100670 section 201 of pl 100703 now requires in or der for patentee to be found guilty of patent misuse on account of tie specific finding that in view of the circumstances the patent owner has market power in the relevant market for the patent or patented product on which the license or sale is conditioned 8 the question presented to us today is whethe r the presumption of market power in patented product should survive as matter of antitrust law despite its demise in patent law we conclude that the mere fact that tying product is patented does not s upport such presumpti on slip opinion at 1 9 the printers are used to print barcodes on cartons and packaging materialsmonopolization which is prohibited under va rious provisions of the antitrust laws5 possession of the market power that would enable seller to force the tie has at least in the antitrust arena and increasingly in the past several years been one of the elements that plaintiff challenging the arrangemen t has generally been required to prove by contrast in the patent area there had been presumption that the existence of patent monopoly creates sufficient mark et power to enable patentee to enforce tie that constitutes patent misuse6 where patented product was the t ying product the presumption continued in court decisions fo r more than 60 years but was specifically rejected by congress when it amended the patent act in 19887 whether such presumption remains reasonable in antitrus t jurisprudence when the tying product is patented was answered in the negative by the court in illinois tool works 8 illinois tool works inc v independent ink inc the case involved challenge

tying arrangement independent ink did not prevail at the dist rict court level that court rejected the assertion that trident necessar ily had market power in the market for the tying product printheads as matter of law10 and found that there had been affirmative evidence neither of the relevant market nor of tridents position in it11 the u s court of appeals for the federa l circuit reversed em phasizing that it had duty to follow the precedents of the s upreme court until the court itself chooses to expressly overrule them12 notwithstanding the courts own dicta13 and academic criticism of the presumption the court did just that in its illinois tool works decision after noting that american courts first encountered tying arrangements in the course of patent infringement litigation14 the court examined its own precedents reaffirming presumption of market power in antitrust tying cases during that exercise it observed that over the years however this courts strong disapproval of ty ing arrangements has substantially diminished15 the court seemed to place particular emphasis on the dissent in fortner enterprises inc v unite d states steel corp fortner i in which the challenged practice of tying the availability of very favorable credit terms to the purchase of the sellers prefabricated homes was described as sale of single product with the incidental provision of financing16 the case was remanded for trial when it again reached the court as fortner ii the unanimous decision found that although the challenged practice did in fact involve the two products necessary to find tying arrangement the arrangement was not an unlawful one the evidence to support the unlawful tying allegation had not only not shown market power in the tying product the court saw nothing more than willingness to provide cheap financing in order to sell expensive homes17 the illinois tool works court noted after recounting fortners judicial journey that the assumption that tying arrangements serve hardly any purpose beyond the suppression of compe tition rejected in fortner ii has not been endorsed in anyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22421crs5 18 547 us at ____ slip

seven years later in jefferson parish hospital dist 2 v hyde 466 us 2 1316 198418 all of the cited and quoted cases involve d unpatented tying products and the court noted that it continued to endorse the presumption of market power arising from the existence of patent19 the validity of that presumption however was specifically questioned in justice connors concurrence in jefferson parish she wrote common misconception has been that patent or copyright high market share or unique product that competitors are not ab to offer suffice to demonstrate market power while each of these three factors might help to give market power to seller it is also possible that seller in these situations will have market power for example patent holder has market power in any relevant sense if there are close substitutes for the patented product20 in its illinois tool works decision the court has againthis time with respect to the presumptive grant of market power confe rred on patentee who chooses to tie the purchase of his patented product to an unpa tented oneadopted the antitrust tying reasoning of justice whose opinion in pr ior case was not the courts own the fact that congress has chosen to eliminate the presumption for purposes of considering patent misuse clearly served to solidify the courts conviction that the presumption is longer justified in the antitrust context
