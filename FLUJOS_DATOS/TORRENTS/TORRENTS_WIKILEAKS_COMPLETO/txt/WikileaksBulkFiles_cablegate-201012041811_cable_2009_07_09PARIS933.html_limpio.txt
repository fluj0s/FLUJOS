00000933 0012 of 002 classified by classified by pol mc allegrone for reasons 14 b and d 1 cnf summary in july 2 meeting with eric chevallier special advisor to the foreign affairs minister ambassador dan fried special envoy for closure of the guantanamo detention facility sgc summarized the results of his efforts to negotiate the resettlement of guantanamo detainees and thanked france for agreeing to consider six new detainee files chevallier stressed that france would review the cases in positive light speaking on instruction he also said that france would not be able to respond until more is known about the attitude of congress toward accepting detainees on us soil chevallier agreed that favorable decision allowing the resettlement of guantanamo detainees in the united states is not precondition but characterized it as extremely important and not far from being precondition he also noted that establishing good precedent with schengen members by providing france with information to share on the previously transferred detainee boumediene would likely assist the process for obtaining schengen visas in other detainee resettlements in europe 2 sbu chevallier was joined by deputy director of the foreign ministers office michele boccoz mfa deputy director for the office of transnational threats martin julliard mfa assistant secretaryequivalent for international organizations sylvie bermann deputy assistant secretaryequivalent for human rights jacques pellet deputy director for the north americas office bernard regnauldfabre and external relations for the european union desk officer fatih akcal charge pekala polmin counselor and note taker also attended end summary six new detainee files potential impact of us decisions 3 cnf fried introduced the dossiers of six detainees that the us would like france to consider taking pointing out that several of them have courtordered releases and noting that we have presented some of the cases to other european governments chevallier expressed appreciation for the new information and assured fried that following the obamasarkozy meeting in june and the resettlement in may of algerian lakdar boumediene france will look at the files in positive light however speaking on instruction he cautioned that france will not be able to provide an answer until more is known about the attitude of congress toward accepting some of the detainees on us soil positive decision by congress chevallier continued would boost the prospects for selling detainee resettlement to the french public and to other european countries when pressed by fried chevallier responded that the congressional decision is not precondition but also said it is not far from that he emphasized that the us decision is part of frances political assessment and is extremely important to frances final decision at the same time chevallier confirmed that france would not intervene negatively in us discussions with other countries for example spain italy and portugal that are moving ahead with resettlement in closing discussions on the filesfried suggested french officials visit guantanamo to interview the detainees and talk to the defense lawyers to inform their decision and aid in the selection of future candidates and to make any requests for further information through intelligence liaison request to share boumedienes file with schengen partners 4 cnf chevallier confirmed that schengen partner states now have to share the files of detainees with their schengen partners per the agreed eu framework if state opposes schengen visa will be issued however if one or more partner states oppose then only national visa can be granted refusal to grant schengen visa would also have an impact on the social services and type of residence status offered to former detainees chevallier would like boumediene to be the first test case as he is lower risk detainee fried agreed to provide revised file that can be shared with eu partners chevallier regretted the eu decision to put this issue under the purview of interior ministers saying it would have been easier to manage under foreign ministers fried concluded his discussion with chevallier by noting that us procedures in detainee transfers have changed somewhat new congressional legislation now requires notification of transfer 15 days in advance and notification of the transfer arrangements the us plans to meet this requirement in the future through an exchange of diplomatic notes 5 cnf chevalliers expert on this issue martin julliard asked about the financial payments the us is paris 00000933 0022 of 002 providing to bermuda and palau upon their acceptance of the uighur detainees fried clarified that us funds are intended to cover reimbursable expenses only and are minimal julliard said that his office has been monitoring french public opinion on the resettlement of boumediene and cited the use of tax money for detainee resettlement as one of the top three concerns fried made commitment but said he would be willing to discuss this further if it becomes necessary symbolically for france 6 cnf comment french authorities remain proud of their lead role in opening the way to resettlement of some detainees in europe and are committed to looking favorably at the six new detainee files however us decision to accept or reject taking detainees on us soil is clearly part of the calculation as they also assess french domestic reaction to resettlement pekala
