million per year and responsible fatherhood 50 million per year tanf work participation requirements the dra makes some significant changes to tanf work participation these changes require most states to engage more of their caseloads in activities andor reduce cash assistance caseloads from fy2005 levels the caseload reduction credit as originally enacted and also under dra tanf sets minimum work participation standards that state must meet or be penalized by reduction in its block grant the st andards are performance measures computed in the aggregate for each st ate which require that specifi ed percentage of families with an adult or minor head of household receiving ssistance be considered engaged in specified activities for minimum number of hours st ate must meet two standards each year 50 of all families with an adult recipient or minor headofhousehold recipient must have work participant and 2 90 of twoparent families must meet participation rules however the 1996 welfare reform law included caseload reduction credit which provided that the standards were reduced one percentage point for each 1 decline in the assistance caseload that had occu rred since fy1995 states were not given credit for caseload declines that resulted from eligib ility changes that had occurred since fy1995 the year before enactment of the federal welfare reform law pl 104193 after the federal and state welfare reform s of the mid1990s many states had large declines in their cash assistance caseloads though the rate of caseload decline vari ed among the states most states received fairly substantial caseload reduction credits which reduced their effective aftercredit tanf work partic ipation standards well below 50 in fy2004 caseload reduction credits were large enough to reduce to 0 the effective aftercredit work participation standard for 18 states the dra revises the caseload reduction credit so that states will receive credit only for future caseload reductions effective in fy 2007 states will only receive credit for caseload reductions that occur from fy2005 forward the fy2007 credit will be based on caseload declines if an that occur from fy2005 to fy2006 the fy2008 credit will be based on caseload declines that occu r from fy2005 to fy2007 and so on as under prior law states are not given credit for caseload declines that occur because of eligibility changes that occurred from the base year fo r measuring caseload changes the base year will be fy2005 under the dra separate state programs the tanf program was created in 1996 by consolidating three programs that provided ma tching grants to states with the federal government funding approxima tely 55 of expenditures made in these predecessor programs tanf requires states to meet maintenance of effort moe requirement which is to spend from their own funds at least 75 of what they had spent in fy1994httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22369crs3 state spending to meet the moe need not be in the tanf program but must be for needy families w ith children and for the same types of activities allowed under state tanf programs under the 1996 law most tanf requirements including the work participation standards did not apply to families receivi ng assistance under separate state programs ssps programs with expenditures countable toward the moe but designated by the states as outside the tanf program states used ssps to among other things assist twoparent families which freed them from the 90 standard applicable to that part of the caseload operate parents as scholars programs for recipients attending college and assist special populations such as fa milies with disabled member permitting them to be exempted from work requirements wit hout negatively affectin g participation rates the dra requires that states count families in ssps in determining their work participation rates the major impact of this change is that states will have to meet 90 standard for the twoparent portion of its caseload this change will also subject special populati ons to the tanf work participation standards and together with the hhs regulations defining tanf work activities affect states ability to allow recipients to attend college without negatively aff ecting work partic ipation rates hhs regulations though the 1996 welfare reform law established tanf participation standards minimum hours requirements and list of 12 categories of activities that count toward meeting the sta ndards much of the detail in operating and enforcing these standards was left to the states the dra required hhs to issue regulations to ensure consistent measurement of work participation rates by further defining tanf work activities beyond the current statutory list requiring uniform methods for reporting hours of wo rk and determining the circ umstances in which parents must be included in the work participati on rate calculation the hhs regulations were issued in interim final form on june 29 2006 definition of work activities table 1 at the end of this report shows the specific work activities that may be included in each of the 12 federal statutory categories as defined by hhs these definitions prohibit states from counting participation in four year college degree program as vocational edu cational training they also provide that activities such as substance abuse and mental health counseling may be counted as job readiness activity countable together with job search for up to six weeks 12 weeks under some circumstances in fiscal year additionally the hhs regulations also include requirements that activities be supervised many on daily basis state work verification plans the dra requires states to have procedures to verify recipients work participation which identify who is subject to or excluded from work standards how recipients activities re present countable tanf work activities and how reported hours of work are verified hhs regulations require states to submit description of these procedures in state work verification plan preliminary work verification plans were due to hhs on september 30 2006 final plans are due on september 30 2007 families included in the participation rate under the 1996 welfare reform law all childonly tanf families families where there are adult recipients were excluded from the work participation cal culation the
