hsieh and his running mate tsengchang were burde ned by what was widely regarded as the poor performance of the incumbent president chen shuibian also member of the dpp corruption scandals in the party and by chens increasing emphasis on controversial proindependence agenda some observers felt that the dpp had lost the opportunity to make critical adjustments in its policies after public dissatisfaction with its performance became clear in 2005 instead of movi ng to where the voters were according to this view the dpp had tried to move the voters to it strategy that did not serve it well in the 2008 elections3 adding to the dpps march feat was its failure to pa ss controversial referendum high priority for president chen asking whether taiwan should apply for membership under the name taiwan although 94 of those voting for the dpp referendum voted in favor th is referendum as well as kmt alternative each failed to reach the threshold of 50 of the electorate turnout that wa s required for the measures to be considered for passage beijing had considered chens re ferendum in particular to be tantamount to public poll on independence prospect the prc has threatened to prevent by force if necessary the referendum also had been problematic for the united states which had called chen s proposal provocative political background to where we are now historically the kmt on taiwan began as party of mainlanders from the republic of china roc government that fled to taiwan in 1949 after chinese communist forces triumphed in chinas civil war althoug h it is credited with engineering taiwans economic growth and transforma tion during its more than 50year rule on the island the kmt for decades remained asso ciated with an increasingl untenable political premise that its military forces one day would retak the mainland and reunify china under the roc government as more countries reco gnized the prc gove rnment and severed official relations with the roc on taiwan the kmts inability to offer clear and more creative vision for taiwans political future ma it vulnerable to challenge in 2000 the fledgling proindependence dpp party was able to elect to the presidency its candidate chen shuibian with bare plurality of the votes cast in threeway race chen was re elected to second term by slim ma jority in the 2004 presidential election4 chens tenure was hampered from the outset first by systemic weaknesses in taiwans political infrastructure that give limited power to either the legislative or executive and second by divided gove rnment in which the opposition kmtled coalition retained mere finge rtip grip on legislative contro l many of chens policy initiatives were blocked by the legislature and he had insufficient power or

to surmount this moreover the p rc rebuffed chens early efforts to improve crossstrait relations citing the dpps proindependence platform as an impediment to such progress as result an emphasis on taiwan nationalism identity and defacto sovereign status became centerpieces of mu ch of chens eight years in office decision that took toll on ustaiwan relati ons and contributed to much divisiveness in taiwans political scene5 from the time it was voted out of power in 2000 the kmt has sought to portray itself as more responsible steward than th dpp for taiwans future the party gained political mileage from portraying president chen as insufficiently attentive to the needs of taiwans economy and business community kmt candidate ma pledged to revive taiwans economy by negotiating comprehe nsive economic agreement with the prc and seeking to reduce restrictions on crossst rait links such as direct air flights and financial matters that limit ta iwans ability to engage in the booming chinese economy the kmt also soundly criticized president chen s posture toward china as provocatively confrontational and promised to replace it with policy of engagement and cooperation with beijing still the kmt was forced to find ways to accommodate itself to the appeal of the dpps proindependence political views which resonated with not insignificant portion of the electorate in an attempt to walk this fine line during his 2008 campaign ma yingjeou promised that in addition to economic prosperity as president he would advocate three noes negotiations on unifica tion with the prc pursuit of jure independence and use of force by either side domestic political implications for the kmt the decisive kmt election wi ns in 2008 provide new opportunities for the government to overcome the political gridlock of the past few years experts watching the taiwan political scene hold that in the last eight years the kmt has moved toward new political centrism and has adapted its policies to reflect the preferences of taiwans middle class6 this shift appears to have pa id off for the party not only in the 2008 legislative and presidential election victories but in other recent election successes for county and city government leadershi p the majority of which the kmt also now controls for some then the kmt presidential victory was as much win for the party as it was vote of noconfidence for the chen administration presidentelect ma himself has reput ation for thoughtful conciliation and many observers have suggested that his early choices will be important determinants in the course taiwan follows in the next few year s for instance observers wonder whether ma will be able to restrain those in his part who may want to drive home the kmts success by revisiting the failures of the chen administration or instead will chart more charitable and forwardlooking policy direction that will help to heal taiwans political wounds they will watch to see if he ppoints old guard kmt members to all the important posts or broadens his government to include ounger party members and dpp and other nonkmt representatives they w onder whether he will be able to craft economic and political improveme nts in relations with ch ina without being seen ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22853crs4 7 frank hsieh himself cited the need for thoroug h party reassessment saying we must let

election for taiwans democratic future march 23 2008 10 samuel p huntington defined this process in his book the third wave democratization in the late twentieth century norman and london 1991 taiwan qualifies by virtue of the dpp having wrested power from the kmt in 2000 and the kmt having regained power in 2008having compromised taiwans interests to those of the prc with the kmts solid majority now in every aspect of gove rnment there will be doubt about where responsibility lies for any perceived f ailures in these early tests for the dpp analysts suggest that the dpp did not make the kind of centrist adjustments to public sentiment that the kmt made in recent years instead staying close to the proindependence interests of its core supporters in the wake of effectively having been crushed in two electoral outings in 2008 the party now is facing period of reassessment and rebuilding as it considers how to broaden its electoral appeal and maintain its vitality in the face of kmt dominance7 how it succeeds is seen as important since many believe bot h us interests and the health of taiwans democratic development would be better served by robust opposition rather than an anemic one in the aftermath of the election views ve been mixed about the dpps nearterm prospects there are different views how robust the partys apparent 42 electoral support is will it shrink or even collapse if the kmt can deliver improved economic performance and stronger international role for taiwan or is it strong enough at 42 to remain viable opposition force some fear that the partys hardcore pro independence base may blame moderates within the part for the 2008 losses and will seek to strengthen the partys hand by purgi ng or marginalizing moderate members and reemphasizing the party s radical core values8 others believe that the dpps future would be tenuous with such narrow appr oach and that the only fertile ground for carving out greater than 42 electoral margin is within taiwans political center they suggest that the dpp seek to broaden its base while working harder in the interim to supervise kmt performance9 for democratic and political development for some taiwans 2008 presidential election means that taiwans democratic development has been validated by having passed the huntington test for estab lished democracies that is having two successful consecutive changes of government through free and peaceful electoral process10 observers who may have harbored concern about how the dpps supporters would take such defeat were reassured greatly by the gracious concession speech of frank hsieh and the widespread apparent d pp acceptance of the results of the democratic process to some watching the march 22 election the taiw an electorate also appeared to have attained new level of maturity and sophistication apparently motivated more in its election decisions by pragmatic calcula tions of governmental performance than byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22853crs5 11 many us and other foreign election observers were in taiwan before and after the march 22 election including this author this report dr aws heavily on these

tenure suggested the agreement was really onechina policy that compromised taiwan sovereigntymore emotional issues involving membership or sovereignty issues11 in sum many have welcomed the election results as sign that taiwans democracy has continued to ripen and mature implications for taiwans prc and us relationships for relations with the prc by most accounts mas election presents unique opportunity to lay new framework in taiw anprc relations one that moves toward crossstrait improvements and new understandings and away from the more confrontational polic ies of the past ma will be f aced with multiple delicate balancing acts he will have to improve cross strait relations nd taiwans economic opportunities on the mainland wh ile not appearing overly eag er to core dpp supporters who worry that he will sell out taiwans interests in pursuit of mainland ties he also will have to strike balance between those in the electorate who favor unification with china those who argue for strong defense for taiwan and the conti nuation of us weapons purchases and those who urge significant improvements in taiwans relations with beijing despite the challenges that ma faces many believe that the election results have placed the real burden for an improved taiwanprc situation squarely on beijing according to some observers the taiwan electorates choice of ma and its inability to pass the two referenda to which beijing objected are seen as first step toward crossstrait improvements having railed against president chen for eight years while wooing the kmt the prc now will have to follow through with creative initiatives with the ma regime if it is to capitalize on the election resu lts the opportunity would appear to be too good to miss rebuffing new and more c onciliatory taiwan gove rnment could damage the prcs credibility that it wishes to pur sue peaceful and constructive solution for crossstrait ties any perceived prc reluctance also could serve to revitalize us and congressional opposition to the prcs taiw an policy opposition which has remained muted in recent years in part because of mutual usprc problems with chen observers suggest there are number of options now for beijing to make meaningful gesture toward taiwan that w ould not impinge on prc sovereignty claims these could include willingness to invite or to be willing to discuss inviting taiwan to be meaningful participant in the wo rld health organization who an invitation to restart crossstrait talks on mutually acceptable basis halt to petulant posturing against taiwan in apec and other multilateral organizations or suspension of taiwan focused military exercises and other military maneuvers in the strait among other acts in the wake of the electi on prc premier wen jiabao s expressed hope that cross strait talks can resume quickly on the basis of the 1992 consensus12 unfortunately past experience demonstrates that th prc often is unable to adopt creative and flexible policyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22853crs6 13 on march 28 2008 ray burghardt chairman of the american institute in taiwan ait which represents american interests in taiw an expressed confidence that the united states would have excellent relations with the incoming government 14 this was view expressed to the author by one us ait official in taiwan in 2006 initiatives at times of great tension as is currently the case with the crackdown against demonstrations in tibet or when there is intense pressure to be seen to be successful as there is now in the months leading up to the 2008 summer olympics in beijing in addition some have suggested that beijing remains concer ned about potential controversies that could aris during the remainder of president chens term before ma takes office on may 20 2008 for these reasons many feel that at least in the short term beijing may be unable to make an important overture to the incoming taiwan regime for us relations us officials say they ve had strong ties with taiwans dpp government and had deve loped considerable networ k of working economic and military ties with taiwan unde r president chen but such problems of trust had developed between president chen himself nd us officials that many believe the bilateral atmosphere can only impr ove under the new kmt leadership13 presidentelect ma has said he will place high priority on repairing any residual difficulties in taiwans relations with the united states still some observers in the past have expressed concern that the united states may ve underestimated the importance of the sea change in kmt thinking that arose from the visits to th prc by senior kmt officials beginning in 200514 those visits they say may have gi ven prochina interests in the kmt new alternate vision for taiwans future if th is concern is founded one consequence could be the growing inurement of the kmt to us pressure or interests for instance taiwan could resist us pressure that it incr ease military spending on the grounds that such expenditures are too high too confrontati onal and may be unnecessary in light of potential improvements in crossstrait interactions some worry then that the kmt driven in large part by economic imperatives and pressures could reach an accommodation with beijing that ultimately ma damage us regi onal interests in other respects the continued success in 2008 of taiwans democratic development is welcome validation of us goals and va lues it also further emphasizes the unique and delicate challenge for us policy that ta iwan poses our ninth largest trading partner with vibrant and free democratic governme nt on an island claimed by the prc with which the united states has diplomatic relations but does have defense commitments and whose independence from china us offici als have said they do not support under the new kmt government then the united stat will be faced with challenges familiar from past years including decisions on new arms sales how to accommodate requests for visits to the united states by ma and other senior taiwan officials the level of us relations with the ma government whether to pursue closer economic ties and what role if any washington should play in crossstrait relations
