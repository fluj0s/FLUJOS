sales to taiwan has evolved over the last two decades into routine rather than ad hoc one where taiwans evolving defense needs can be expected to be considered carefully every year by the united states at high level official taiwan media say that in the last 20 years taiwans armed forces have procured lot of defensive weapons and equipment from the united states2 quoting taiwan military source taiwan newspaper reports that the military there believes the pentagon rather than the state department is quite supportive of taiwans needs and the situation is thus favorable3 this regular process allows for more predictable planning by taiwan authorities in charge of the defense budget and potentially reduces the chance that developments in us relations with the prc could influence arms sales to taiwan moreover taiwan could send senior military delegations to washington through the 1990s the arms talks were lowprofile reducing the opportunities for greater usprc friction indicating security benefits of arms sales for taiwan china objects to the tra and argues that washington is not observing the august 17 1982 usprc communique on reducing arms sales to taiwan4

leadership in foreign policy in recent history indeed despite the unofficial nature of relations us arms sales to taiwan have been significant from 1991 to 1998 arms deliveries primarily us to taiwan

longerrange us approach rather than currently looking at taiwans defense needs narrowly on yearbyyear weaponby weapon fashion that has involved intense interagency differences some defense industry observers say that the arms sales talks have generally ended in disappointment for taiwan because its requests for diesel submarines longrange surveillance radars and other defensive items have been rejected in deference to beijing8 in 1999 some in congress introduced the taiwan security enhancement act s 693 helms hr 1838 delay arguing that pressures to delay deny and reduce arms sales to taiwan have been prevalent since the signing of the august 17 1982 communique other comments both within and outside the administration criticize perceived traditional overemphasis on selling military equipment some would prefer greater attention to diplomatic solutions including efforts to ease tensions in the taiwan strait in 1998 former assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs chas freeman argued that increasing military tensions in the taiwan strait call for reevaluation of arms sales to taiwan9 susan shirk deputy assistant secretary of state for east asian and pacific affairs is quoted as saying in speech on april 14 1999 that neither the prc or taiwan would be served by overemphasis on military hardware while neglecting the art of statesmanship10 others who urge greater support for taiwans military have called for more attention to software including absorption of new equipment military contacts training and advice for taiwans military especially broader training programs on c4i combined arms and joint warfare operations rather than narrow training tied to particular weapon systems11 some critics are concerned that the white house might secretly negotiate with beijing over arms sales to taiwan an authoritative weekly magazine reported that during the june 1998 summit in beijing the prc requested us promise to deny theater missile defense tmd technology to taipei in return for prc pledge not to provide missiles to iran but agreement was reached12 finally some on capitol hill contend that successive administrations have
