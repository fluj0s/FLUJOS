argued that eti was necessary to protect us competitiveness but traditional economic theory questions the efficacy of export benefits theory suggests that exchange rate adjustments reduce most of any increase the tax benefits may cause in exports while at the same time triggering an increase in imports the net result is change in the balance of trade theory also suggests that export subsidies

the current regime of flexible exchange rates international exchange rates at the time were fixed and the us balance of payments problem was highlight ed by current account deficit and large outflows of capital from the united states leading to balance of payments deficit that placed severe pressure on the us dollar the major aspects of the curative program were suspension by the united stat of the dollars convertibility into gold and 10 surcharge on imports for its part disc was intended both to stimulate us exports and to encourage us fi rms to locate their production for foreign markets in the united states rather than abroad2 disc was designed in part to counter the effect of anothe r tax code provision stillexisting tax benefit known as deferral under which us firms can indefinitely postpone us tax on their overseas operations by providing tax benefit for income earned abroad deferra l poses tax incentive for us firms to invest and produce in countri with relatively low tax ra tes disc was designed to counter deferrals incentive with an incentive of its own for investment in usbased production of exports instead of building factories abroad to serve their foreign markets us firms could obtain tax bene fit by producing in the united states and shipping their goods overseas indeed the disc benefits statut ory design mirrored the mechanics of deferral in many respects to see how the 1971 disc provisions were designed to provide preferential tax treatment to exports it is usef ul to take brief look at the overall us tax structure in its international setting in broad terms the united states bases its tax jurisdiction on the residence of corporation or indi vidual not on the source of the taxpayers income under this socalled residence sy stem of taxation us taxes apply to both the foreign and ussource income of corporations chartered in the united states us corporate residents thus without special provision such as disc or its successors uschartered corporation that sells exports directly to its foreign customers is taxed in full on its export income regardless of whether export income is considered to have us or foreign source the aforementioned deferral benefit complicates this picture deferral works like this while the united states taxes its residents on their worldwide income it taxes foreignchartered cor porations only on income from the conduct of us tradehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31660crs3 or business to use the deferral benefit us firm with multinational operations arranges to earn its foreign income through subsidiary corporation chartered in foreign country since the foreign subsidiary is exempt from us tax at least to the extent it does not earn us income us taxes can be postponed until the subsidiarys income is paid to the uscha rtered parent firm as dividends deferral that constitutes tax benefit as long as the subsidiarys income is subject to low foreign taxes in the interim note here that us corporations can normally deduct some or all of dividends received from uschartered corporations as means of alleviating multiple applications of corporat elevel tax however dividends received from foreign corporati ons are not deductible even without disc and later fsc and eti certain tax planning opportunities are available to exporters using the deferral benefit conceivably us exporter can avoid at least some amount of us tax by selling its exports to foreign subsidiary corporation which then sells the usmade products to foreign customers to the extent income from the export can be attributed to the foreign subsidiary it can achieve deferral of us tax two aspects of the us tax code however limit this technique first the intern revenue service irs is empowered by the tax code to reallocate income among related taxpayer s so as to accurately reflect each entitys actual production of income and in genera l the irs allocates income on the basis of hypothetical armslength prices that are assigned to transfers of goods and services between related firms as though the firms were in fact unrelated since the bulk of an exports value is by defin ition added by the homecountry exporter presumably little in the way of export income can be allocated to foreign sales subsidiary and little export income can thus benefit from deferral set of tax code rules known as subpart f also limits deferrals benefit for exports subpart f is generally designed to restrict us taxpayers from concentrating foreign income in lowtax foreign tax havens the better to take advantage of deferral to that end subpart f identifies certain types of income that are subject to current us taxation even if earned thr ough foreign subsidiary generally income from passive investment ie interest dividends and similar income and variety of income types whose source is thought to be easily manipulated included in this latter category is what subpart f terms foreign base company sales income income from sales transactions between related entities thus even if taxplanning exporter were to successfully allocate expor t profits to foreign subsidiary subpart f potentially denies the deferral benefit the disc provisions carved an export benef it into this structure by establishing an indefinite tax deferral for income from exporting emulating certain aspects of the deferral benefit that was already on the books firm availed itself of the disc benefit by setting up subsidiary through which it sold its exports disc in this case meaning corporation chartered domestically rather than abroad discs themselves were tax exempt under special tax code provi sions any income attributed to the disc could thus be deferred until remitted to the parent firm as intrafirm dividends and while disc could be s imply paper corpor ation performing few economic activities of its own the disc provisions contained special income allocation rules under which specified porti ons of firms export income could behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31660crs4 3 for detailed description of how disc worked see us congress joint committee on taxation general explanation of the revenue act of 1971 92nd

rather than the parent corporation3 these allocation rules departed from the armslength pricing method of dividing income that us tax rules normally applied as result of the various rules governing income allocation and other aspects of disc firms could use th benefit to indefinitely defer taxes on somewhere between 16 and 33 of their export income from taxation4 in addition to countering deferral disc was designed to offset what were perceived to be tax advantag provided by foreign countries to their own exporters some countries then as now operate terr itorial rather than residencebased tax systems under which tax jurisdic tion is based on the source of income rather than the identity of the taxpayer territorial systems generally tax only domesticsource income and exempt income attributed to foreign sources the structure of territorial tax systems can provide export subsidies under certain circumst ances for example if armslength pricing is not rigorously applied so that large fraction of export income can be concentrated in exempt offshore branches another perceived advantage for foreig ners was the border tax adjustments provided by countries that make extens ive use of valueadded taxes vats countries that use vats in cluding those in the eu co mmonly rebate the vat that has been paid on exports while applying th vat to imports these adjustments are intended to ensure that pr oducts made in vatutilizing c ountries do not face price disadvantage in competing against goods fro m other countries however some us businesses argued and some still argue toda that vat rebates give foreign goods an advantage over us exports provision such as disc was thought necessary to place us and foreign products on an even footing taxwise again disc was designed to address balance of payments deficit both by reducing outflows of capital and the us trade deficit shortly after disc was enacted however the us abandoned the gold standard and the worlds major trading countries ultimately dopted regime of flexible exchange rates according to economic theory the new regime neut ralized any impact disc may have had on exports under flexible exchange rates an export subsidy such as disc drives up the price of the exporting countrys currenc in this case the dollar making its exports more expensive for foreigners and its own imports cheaper any initial export expansion from the tax benefit is reduced while imports increase ultimately the export benefit has impact on the bala nce of trade although it does increase the overall level of trade according to economists these same adjustments refute the argument that vat rebates provide an advantage to foreigners exchange rate adjustments offset any eff ect the rebates may havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31660crs5 5 european doubts about discs legality were expressed before the provision was actually enacted the us treasury however was prepared to maintain that disc was

trade p 761 more importantly economic theory also questions the efficacy of export subsidies regardless of their impact on the balance of trade according to theory export subsidies reduce the economic welfare of the subsidizing country in two ways first any expansion in exports is likely accomplished by reduction in prices that foreign consumers pay for the exports price reduction that is financed by the subsidizing countrys taxpayers second an export subsidy reduces economic welfare by distorting resource use in the s ubsidizing and subsidized countries alike it induces countries to trade more than is economically efficient however in the case of disc fsc and eti alike these leterious effects were probably not large in part because of exchange rate adjustments disc and the general agreement on tariffs and trade disc was enacted on december 10 1971 and went into effect on january 1 1972 almost immediately the european community ec the precursor of the european union began proceedin gs against the provision under gatt gatt was created in 1947 as an agreem ent among the major trading countries that would govern acceptable commercial po licy in the conduct of trade gatts purpose was to reduce the tariffs and other trade barriers as well as discriminatory trade practices that had grown up in the in terwar years and that had contributed to the worldwide economic collapse that preceded world war ii in promoting free trade it was believed that gatt would promote rising standards of living and full employment gatt did not have autonomous power and was not formally constituted organization like the world bank or interna tional monetary fund further decisions required consensus among the contracting countries effectively giving each country veto power nonetheless the agreement included prohibition against subsidies for exports of manufactured goods and proce dures were developed within gatt for settling trade disputes under the proce dures an aggrieved country would first request consultations with th country it believed to be in violation of the agreement if the differences remained unresolved the gatt council could appoint panel that would issue report on the dispute th gatt council could either adopt reject or take action on the panel report in cases where count ry was f ound to have violated gatt the complaining country could request permission to apply sanctions the ec took the first step in this process in february 1972 by requesting consultations with the united states on disc5 the united states in turn requested consultations under gatt

permitting taxhaven operations but were activel helping exporters to enlarge that tax advantage by adopting very generous pricing rules for tax haven transactions united states tax officials who took

produced solution to the dispute and in may 1973 both the ec and the united states took the next step in the dispute process by filing formal complain ts with gatt the gatt council as set forth under its procedures established inde pendent panels to examine and report on the complaints the european complaint against disc relied on the conclusions of 1960 gatt working party report containing an illustrative list of subsidies report that had been adopted by the major gatt c ountries the reports list included the remission of direct taxes on exports as well as the exemption of export income from tax although it did not specifically list tax deferrals the ec argued that because the disc deferral was in principle unli mited it was the ec onomic equivalent of an outright remission or exemption6 in response the united states pointed out the omission of tax deferra ls as an explicit item on the 1960 list7 the us response struck an additional theme to which the united states was to return in future episodes of the controversy that parallel existed between the us export tax benefits and the territorial systems maintained by the several european countries the united states argued that since income of foreign sales branches is not taxed under territorial systems and b ecause the ec countries did not rigorously apply armslength pricing territorial systems subsidized exports indeed this was exactly the argument the united states mount ed against the ec territorial systems in its own gatt complaint at the same time however the united states argued that gatt had by custom always considered territorial systems acceptable disc the united states maintained simply removed the distortion introduced by the territorial systems by introducing another if the firs t distortion the territorial systems was legal so too was the other8 the gatt panel report was issued in november 1976 it found elements of subsidy in both the us and territorial systems in the first place the panel concluded that disc was prohibited ex port subsidy notwithstanding its deferral rather than exemption of income from taxe s the subsidy was conferred the panel reasoned because interest charge

territorial systems does not justify another and that mere custom furthermore did not necessarily make territorial systems gattlegal as for the us complaint against the territorial systems the panel report concluded that the territorial systems in question provided tax subsidy for export sales through lowta x countries and that lenient intrafirm pricing and cost allocation rules amplified the benefit9 following the issuance of the panel re ports the next step in the dispute resolution process would normally have been for the gatt council to consider whether or not to adopt the reports howe ver the united states and the ec were at an impasse the united states was willin g to accept the finding against disc but only if the findings against the three territo rial systems were also adopted the three european countries were only willing to adopt the finding against disc10 gatt council decision remained in abeyance for nearly five years in part the hiatus was due to the increased opposition to disc within the united states itself in 1978 the carter administration initia lly proposed repealing disc before withdrawing its proposal in the face of strong opposition in the face of possible unilateral repeal of disc by the united states the controversy lost its urgency in addition negotiation of new gatt subsidies c ode occurred during gatts tokyo round and appeared to point to resolution of the dispute the code explicitly included tax deferrals as subsidies casting doubt on discs legality while affirming the importance of using armslength pricing in intrafirm transfers again key element of the united states complaint against territorial systems at the same time the subsidies code appeared to countenan ce the legality of territorial systems in general11 in december 1981 the four disc panel reports were finally dopted by the gatt council subject to an understandi ng the understanding which later assumed an important role in the us defense of fsc before the wto

gatt council over how the understanding applied to disc the ec continued to argue that disc was an illegal export subsidy while the united states main tained that every export involves at least some extraterritorial income and that disc was reasonable means of approximating the extraterritorial portion13 however policymakers in the united states noted that the dispute was becomin g more serious and threatened breakdown of the dispute resolution process and th at the united states had become isolated over the issue14 the us treasury thus proposed what ultimately were enacted as the 1984 foreign sales cor poration fsc provisions the fsc provisions were designed to achieve gatt legality by providing an export tax benefit incorpora ting elements of the territo rial tax system countenanced by the 1981 understanding the fsc provisions worked as follows in manner similar to disc exporters obtained tax benefit by selling their exports through specially qualified subsidiary corporation in this case an fsc but in contrast to discs fscs were required to be incorpor ated outside the united states and also in contrast to discs fscs were requi red to conduct certain management activities or economic processes abroad examples of management activities included maintaining bank account abroad having boa rd of directors that included at least one person who was not us resident nd holding all shareholder meetings outside the united states foreign economic process requirements were met if an fsc at least participated in activities such as dvertising arrangement of transportation transmittal of invoices and receipt of paymen t processing of or ders and assumption of credit risk15 notwithstanding these requirements an fsc like discs before it could be little more than paper corporation as with disc the fsc itself was the tity that received special tax status in this case partial tax exemption the ta x code granted the partial exemption by classifying qualifying fsc income as foreignsource income not connected with the conduct of us trade or business because foreign firms are subject to us tax only on us income this placed fsc income out side the us tax jurisdiction further us parents of fsc subsidiaries were permitted 100 dividendsreceived deduction despite the fact that fscs were foreignchartered corporations and to rule out possible us taxation under subpart fs foreign base company sales income rules fsc income was exempted from subpart fs antideferral rules since the fsc was the taxfavored entity the size of the benefit as with disc depended heavily on how much income firm was permitted to allocate to its tax favored subsidiary as with disc th fsc provisions contained administrative income allocation rules that assigned more

available under disc17 fsc and the world trade organization the adoption of fsc in 1984 dampened the exportbenefit controversy for period the ec did not formally bring the matter of us export tax benefits before gatt for almost 15 years although ther were some indications of european dissatisfaction with the redesigned benefit18 in the meantime the ability of gatt to maintain compliance with

that had grown up under gatt but with th addition of sta nding appellate body to hear appeals of panel decisions an important strengthenin g of the process under the wto however is this under gatt consensus was required for decisions meaning for example that the loser of panel decision could in effect veto the report under the wto however c onsensus is required for decision not to be approved at each stage in the process thus for example requiring the loser of case to persuade the winner to overturn panel decision21 the hiatus in the dispute ended on n ovember 18 1997 when what had become the european union eu took the first step in the wtos dispute settlement process by formally requesting consultations with the united states over fsc22 t h consultations failed to pr oduce soluti on and in july 1998 the eu requested the establishment of dispute settlement panel which the wto formed in september the heart of the eus complaint was th at fsc violated article 31a of the scm agreement which prohibits provision of subsidies that are contingent on export performance article 11 in tur n defines subsidies as financial contribution by government where gove rnment revenue that is otherwise due is foregone or not collected in general the eu argued that the fsc rules provided special tax exemptions where export income would otherwise be taxed for example under subpart f or as income from the c onduct of us business the eu also argued that fscs administrative pricing rules constituted an export subsidy the united states in turn argued that territorial taxation was wtolegal and that fsc was analogous to territorial ta xation more specifically the united states maintained that the 1981 gatt understandi ng together with the scm agreement provided that countries need not tax in come from foreign economic processes which established the acceptab ility of territorial taxation23 the united states then argued that fscs various foreign econo mic presence and mana gement

forgives taxes otherwise due and thus whethe r subsidy exists depends on how the provision in question compares to countrys own general method of taxation in the panels words we consider that the united states has made an unwarranted leap of logic from the proposition that income arising from foreign ec onomic processes may be exempted from direct taxes to the proposition that if countries are under obligation to tax income from foreign economic processes then they should be free to exempt all such income or just part of it emphasis added24 in short because fsc carved out an exception from the way the united states normally taxed exports it was the panel concluded an export subsidy the united states appealed the panels decision almost immediately generally arguing again that the wto rules hold th at country need not tax income from foreign economic processes nd that fsc was therefore pe rmissible however on february 22 2000 the wto appellate body c oncluded that having decided to tax foreign source income in general the unite d states provided subsidy by carving out an exception to that treatment thus again rejecting the analogy between fsc and territorial taxation25 the extraterritorial income benefit as described above the adve nt of flexible exchange rates called into question the ability of export benefits such as fsc and disc to reduce the us trade deficit nonetheless many in the united states believed that the decision against fsc confronted the united states with dile mma achieve wtolegality or maintain the competitiveness of us exports some prominent us policymakers including thenchairman of the house ways and means committee bill archer suggested the dilemma could be solved by adopting relatively broad tax reforms rather than making small adjustments in the benefits design for example some suggested the united states adopt form of consumption tax thus foregoing taxati on of business profits altogether another suggested alternative was adopting pure territorial tax systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31660crs12 26 ryan j donmoyer legislative fix for fscs needed this year or soon archer says tax notes march 13 2000 p 1524 27 us ambassador

rules26 the clinton administration however did not rule out the possibility of narrower approach finding reformulati on of just the fsc benefit that would nonetheless be wtocompatible in april 2000 the united states informed the wto that it would comply with the panels rulings but would do so in way that would ensure that us exports are not di sadvantaged in relation to their foreign counterparts27 in may the united states brie fed eu representatives on planned replacement for fsc the plan contained the basics of what were later enacted as the eti provisions the general approach it took was to attempt wtolegality by extending the tax benefit beyond exports to income from foreign operations thus attempting to provide tax benefit that included exports but that was not export contingent as prohibited by the scm agreement28 however after examining the plan eu representatives stated their belief that it too was not wtocompliant because its benefit was still exportcontingent eu offi cials indicated that the measure if enacted would be challenged under wto rules29 notwithstanding the eus objections congress passed the eti provisions in november 2000 and president clinton signed them into law on november 15 pl 106519 in general the eti provisions begin by exempting what they term extraterritorial income from us tax but continue by defining extraterritorial income and chain of other concepts in way that confines the exemption to firms us exports and at most ma tching amount of income from foreign operations the initial link in the chain of definitions is qualifying foreign trade property which is genera lly products manufactured pr oduced grown or extracted within or outside the united states unlike the parallel fsc concept of export property qualifying foreign trade property can be partly manufactured outside the united states however not more than 50 of the value of qualified property can be added outside the united states the next link in the chain is foreign trading gross receipts which the provisions define as income from the sale or lease of qualifying foreign tradehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31660crs13 30 firm can always choose to exempt 15 of income from tax altern atively if its return on sales is sufficiently high it could use the gr oss receipts method to exempt up to twice that amount from tax the range of exemption in other words is 1530property and which parallels the fsc concept of gross receipts as with fsc firm would only be treated as earning foreig n trading gross receipts if it conducts economic processes abroad however fscs foreign manage ment requirements would be dropped the provisions next define foreign trade income as taxable income attributable to foreign trading gross receipts the provisions term specified part of this foreign trade income qualifying foreign trade income and grant such income tax exemption the bill sets qualifyi ng foreign trade income and thus the exclusion equal to either 12 of foreign trading gross receipts 15 of foreign trade income or 30 of the income attri butable to the foreig n economic processes undertaken under the foreign trading gro ss receipts requirements the rule exempting 30 of income is similar in its effect to the fsc rule that applies to firms that use armslength pricing as with fsc and the may 2000 proposal before it the arithmetic result of these rules is that firm can exempt somewhere between 15 and 30 of qualified in come from us tax30 as noted above in contrast to fsc th eti provisions do not require firm to sell its exports through foreignchartere d corporation to qua lify for the benefit since us corporation could qualify for the exemption directly the special dividendsreceived deduction language in th fsc provisions is not necessary the provisions also contain language providing that foreign corporation that uses the benefit can elect to be taxed like us corporation this mechanism rules out the possible application of subpart f which pplies only to income earned by firms that are foreign corporations for tax purposes on november 17 2000 the eu formally requested consultations with the united states over the eti provisions the consultations failed and on december 7 the eu requested that the wto establish panel to determine etis legality the panel was appointed on december 20 nd issued its report on august 20 2001 in defending eti the united states first argued that the provision addressed the previous fsc panels finding that fsc created an exception to the general us tax practice and was thus subsidy the united states argued that eti was broader and revised the general us method of taxing overseas income because the provisions could be applied to income from foreig n operations as well as exports thus according to the us argument eti is neither an exception to the general us practice and is therefore not subsidy nor contingent on exporting second us argument held that even if eti were an export subsidy it is means of alleviating double taxation of foreign income and is therefore permissible under wto rules by virtue of language contained in footnote 59 of the scm agreement but the wto panel ruled against the united states finding that the eti provisions imposed enough special conditi ons on their use that they were anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31660crs14 31 world trade organization united

to income from foreign operations ie nonexport income32 finally the panel rejected the us argument that eti was intended to avoid doubletaxa tion concluding that the scope of the benefit was considerably broader than the type of inco that would ordinarily be at risk of doubletaxation33 for example nations do not usually include foreigners income from homecountry exports within their own tax base on october 10 2001 the united states nnounced it would appeal the panels decision on eti asking the wto appellate b ody to reverse the panels findings that eti is subsidy that the subsidy is contingent on exporting and that it is not measure to alleviate double taxation however on january 14 2002 the appellate body issued report upholding the pa nels ruling on each of the three main arguments advanced by the united states34 etis repeal wto procedures permit comp laining country in this case the eu to ask the wto for permission to impose sanctions if the noncompliant country in this case the united states does not take action to come into compliance wto procedures also permit the level of sanc tions to be arbitrated at the defending countys request in the case of eti the eu asked the wto to authorize imposition of 4043 billion in sanctions on its imports from the ited states an amount based on the eus estimate of the full value of the us subs idy to all countries the united states in turn argued before wto arbitrators that the authorized tariffs should be only 956 million based on the united states estimate of the impact of the us export benefit on european

closely with congress to find solution39 for its part the eu indicated its willingness to postpone applying sanctions to us goods as long as it perceived that congress was making progress toward solution40 on july 11 2002 chairman thomas introduced hr 5095 bill that proposed outright repeal of the eti provisions rather than their redesign at the same time the bill proposed broad range of tax cuts for us firms operating abroad reductions designed to improve the competitiveness of us firms in international markets the tax cuts included changes in foreign tax cr edit rules and in subpart f in addition the bill contained revenuerais ing provisions designed to restrict earnings stripping and corporate inversions the former being the artificial shifting of ussource income from us subsidiary corporations to foreign parents and the latter tax motivated corporate reorganization whereby us corporations would reincorporate in foreign country hr 5095 encountered criticism from veral
