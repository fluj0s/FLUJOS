and the remnants of its very active involvement in supporting terrorist groups in the past on the other side some observers maintain that cuba has shed its past as supporter of terrorist and insurgent

government maintains that it has been actively involved in hosting peace ta lks and that its contributions to peace talks have been acknowledged by colombia and the united nations34 on the other hand some observers contend that cubas role in suppor ting the terrorist activities of the farc was demonstrated by the arre st of three alleged irish republican army ira operatives in colombia in august 2001 one of whom niall connolly had lived in havana as sinn feins representa tive since 1996 the three went into hiding in june 2004 after they had been acquitted by lower court on charges of training

cuba these include such fugitives as joanne chesimard who was convicted for the killin g of new jersey state trooper in 1973 charles hill and michael finney wanted for the killing of state trooper in new mexico in 1971 victor manue l gerena member of militant puerto rican separatist group wanted for carrying out the robbery of wells fargo armored car in connecticut in 1983 and guillermo morale s another member of puerto rican militant group who was convicted of illegal possession of fi rearms in new york in the 1970s those who oppose this rationale for keepin g cuba on the terrorist list argue that this has nothing to do with terrorism and that many countries eg mexico and salvador harbor fugitives from us justice but are not on the terrorist list36 moreover they argue that cuba has expre ssed interest in considering negotiation of the mutual extradition of fugitives for example cuba would like to see the extradition of orlando bosch ami resident and luis po sada carriles both are accused of responsibility for the bombing cuban airliner in 1976 while posada as described above was impris oned in panama for severa l years on weapons charges in plot to assassinate fi castro

countries on the list iran syria sudan nd north korea iran is considered the most active state sponsor of terrorism wh ile countries believe d to be less active supporters of terrorism include sudan and cuba given this wide range of activity some suggest that there should be tiered approach with sanctions calib rated to the degree of support for terrorism while others maintain that any level of support for terrorism is unaccep table and must be met with strong sanctions some suggest that s hould there be more flexibility in the ability to add and remove countries from the terrori sm list in order to bring about behavioral changes in the states that are involved in rrorist activities others believe that there is already sufficient flexibility in the legi slative conditions set forth in the export administration act for the administration to add and remove countries according to their behavior
