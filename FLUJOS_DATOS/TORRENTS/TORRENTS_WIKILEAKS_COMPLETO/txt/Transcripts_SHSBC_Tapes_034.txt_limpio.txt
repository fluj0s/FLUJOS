subject shsbc 34 date 21 mar 2000 210051 0000 from anonymousremailerseecommentheader fzba organization mail2newsnymaliasnet newsgroups altclearingtechnologyaltreligionscientology cant have create fundamentals of all problems lecture given on 18 july 1961 well youre very lucky to be here listening to this lecture today thats all i got to say whats the date audience 18th thank you very much eighteenth ad 11 july probably saint hill briefing course understand something happened to you people today audience yes oh im sorry im very sorry its very very difficult trying world isnt it now were going to turn back the clock to 1952 philadelphia lecture series and scientology 88008 are the basic texts on havingness thats basic and fundamental on havingness havingness is very dominant situation its very dominant thing i have worked from time to time down through the ages here and put together be do and have as the primary activities now you are probably more acquainted with scientology fundamentals of thought and the discussions of games conditions games conditions very very important point and all of sudden it emerges as far far more important than it ever has been because now were back to games conditions and its relationship to havingness and in this book scientology 88008 along with other things theta mest theory differentiation association and so forth we get in here some general discussions of havingness and this is the first written text on the subject of havingness and it says the goal of processing is to remedy scarcity and abundance in all things well thats whats important about this remedy scarcity and abundance of all things and on the 17th of july this book remember was written in the winter of 52 53 and on the 17th of july in 1961 why i suddenly undid ive been thinking about this by the way for just weeks ive been working with this for weeks but i suddenly found out simple modus operandi by which you put this into effect i call to your attention that all we had previously was creative processing that was the key of how you remedied scarcity and abundance in all things and lot of people couldnt run it and they got into bad trouble trying to create things and so forth now the next datum just few weeks ago that fell out of the hamper was just this and this is very important datum because you will be using it in processing undoubtedly from here on out the status of affairs right now is that i could set somebody down put them on an emeter and probably in five or six hours at the outside have them clear as beer now thats about the step we have just got through taking and that step derives immediately from having resolved how you remedy the scarcity and abundance in all things and thats what im going to talk to you about today now lets look at this very very important datum concerning havingness i have finally gotten the interrelationship between havingness and creativeness and when youve got the interrelationship between having and create you pretty well got it sewed up because these things look little bit separate they look different one to the other creating things well obviously after youve created something you may have it and you may not have it thats the way weve looked at it it may be taken away from you it may asis lot of things might happen so that just the fact of creating something doesnt mean that we have something id like to make discursion right at this point i see we have some nice new students some very freshlooking students the wife of one of our students was on the phone last night saying if her husband didnt come home instantly and at once that she was going to take gun to him and meet him with divorce papers at the airport i dont know whether anybodys communicated this to this student or not at the present moment well i see they have all right thats fine but almost precisely at the moment she was calling i was writing this same student note telling him he had to be here another week now my postulate goes on something like that now aside from welcoming you new students youll notice some notices on the board i invite you to read the board and they tell you that you have to learn the whole course in the first week thats right because weve got to have time to digest it after we learn it so i want you to pay good attention to those things and get those wheeling and dealing in hurry because nobody has arrived at this course yet knowing how to do any of those things which is quite interesting there are only seven things you have to know about auditing and these seven can be just brrrrrrrerp off just like that theres nothing to it and we havent had anybody arrive here yet that knew how to do one of them much less seven and how scientology has been done through the world im sure i dont know theyre little things like the trs and reading an emeter and things like that and we actually have never had anybody coming here yet that knew how to do one of them well and the students who have been here for while i congratulate you because you now know how to do these things pretty good now thats just getting it out of the road and anything i have to say about theory or what you audit depends first and foremost on the ability to audit and the ability to audit is consists of these seven things not theory you see that these stand totally independent of any theory now these things are nailed in brass and if you know how to do them you can audit and if you dont know how to do them i could give you the pearls of ophir and youd feed them to psychiatrists you understand all right its all very well to know the new theory and the new thing to get all excited about that because i was pretty excited about this myself but those of you who are new or havent been here very long just pay attention to that board in there because none of this is going to work for you not for five minutes on anybody or on yourself unless you know these seven principles of auditing which have to do with emeters and trs and that sort of thing okay all right so i give you that dire warning in the middle of this not only to you but the fact that if you take this material which im about to give you and psychiatrize it and squirrelicate it youre going to have somebody in the soup man because you have got both red hot pokers straight into where the thetan lives and if you cant audit youre not going to be able to handle this boy thats all we already had one student today screaming its easy its easy but to bring him all the way through it and make him feel better afterwards that depends on your knowing the seven things okay so major breakthrough doesnt immediately change the seven fundamentals of how to do it okay these fundamentals these tools prehavingness scale and the rest of these things are all part and parcel to what were doing here now havingness went into revival ill get off of this cross professorial note here and this revival of havingness came about at the johannesburg congress practically the night before the congress i got some kind of chart to draw to show people so theyd understand some of these facts and that was the birth of the prehav scale but youll notice it got called the prehav scale and thats all of auditing prehavingness i dont care whether its done by that particular scale or not it is prehavingness prehavingness now the relationship between creativeness and havingness i have just licked that now that relationship is this and this has to do with the fundamental formation of the reactive bank and this is very important when person cant have he creates thats the law on which man operates now youd just never dream it under the sun that that went together that way but thats the way the crossword puzzle fits that is the way this big french roll of bread crumbles when you cant have it you create it and that is the formation of the reactive bank and that is the most fundamental law of the reactive bank now discovered we have now gone down in diving suits well below the surface of the bottom of the ocean thats the bank thats the story of the bank if you couldnt have it you created it this tells us all sorts of things all this last winter and summer i have been collecting little odd data that looked like something strange and didnt look like it was quite part of the puzzle it began with an observation that italy routinely goes into renaissance every time it is licked obviously the best thing possible for italian civilization is to get whipped thats quite an odd random factor isnt it if they get licked they have renaissance youd think it would be quite the reverse youd think theyd go into decline but they dont they have renaissance arts government everything goes on resurge all you have to do is lick the italian and boy does he produce it goes into such things as the roses which you see out here on the terrace i have long known as most gardeners have known that all you had to do was cut rose routinely and it bloomed only they put it down to this that the roses have to be appreciated and if you dont cut them they arent appreciated so they dont produce roses now thats the modus operandi that most gardeners think occurs or halfway think occurs with regard to roses and that isnt true at all the abuse of rose causes it to produce roses all right now lets look little bit further here all these observations one after the other plus long story which i myself went through it does you lot of good for to get out into the real universe every once in while and get out that rope ladder and get off the ivory tower you know and go out and rub elbows with the sweating humanity you know and i have been fooling around with ships for long time and this was another correlative factor i found out i couldnt get ship from south africa so right away i started to buy ships and ive been trying to buy ships ever since and then i found out i was now creating ships and i was beginning to build ships and this wasnt totally waste of time because ive done rather fantastic thing design ship hull earth apparently hasnt had one because they have very calm seas here on earth compared to most planets and resulted in designing motor and apparently they dont have motor on this planet i heard people say this an awful lot of times but all this directly derives from the fact that i couldnt have ship so i had bit of subjective on the thing that wasnt where we got the main part of it but that all kinds of little observations of this character have gone on and on and try these are funny bits of the crossword puzzle what are all these things and all these things add up to this fact that if rose bush cant have rose it creates roses it also adds up to this interesting fact that if shipyard is building ships it is because they cant have ships and thats why they build ships that only last for seventeen or twenty years thats why the great empress of canada which was just launched up here has an aluminium boy is that british superstructure its whole superstructure is aluminium isnt that interesting because in something on the order of about thirtyfive years its going to be mound of gray powder i know now aluminium doesnt work in shipbuilding because i have been in receipt of tremendous catalogues which are very beautifully put together and pamphlets beyond count released by kaiser and the aluminium company of canada and all of them are so insistent that aluminium can be used and they are so hysterical on the whole subject that i began to look up the data and looking up their own data you find out that at the most few decades and the aluminium is pile of gray powder also you cant weld it you have to solder it and if you use zinc why that wont hold under the sea water conditions and theres all these reasons but you must use aluminium to build ships i think they just put out about two million pounds in money to build the whole superstructure of the empress of canada out of aluminium and itd seem to like that many tens of millions of pounds invested in ship should last longer than about thirty years itd just seem to because you start adding it and dividing it and subtracting it and you find out that it just the ship just sitting there is going to cost half million quid year before you do anything to it at all because its all going to disappear in about thirtyfive years and you ask yourself odd questions like this and you come up with this odd observation if somebody is creating ships its because he cant have ships ah but lets take one further look at this hes going to make sure that you dont have ship if hes reactively building ships it must be because he cant have ships so hes for sure going to qanda with you and youre going to wind up with ship ohho so of course the ships on this planet with all the materials available out of which you could make ships that would last well teak and cypress last practically forever there is an old ship i was trying to get my hands on down in palmas she was built in 1885 she is much sounder than the dollar she is in beautiful condition 1885 and shes built out of teak and the teak lasts forever but has man enthusiastically been building teak forests all over the place so he could have lots of teak to build ships with oh nothing like that do you see cypress growing everyplace in the swamps so that you could have wood to build ships oh you see oregon pine well you say well it grows fast and there are lots of reasons for it but even lloyds tells you that oregon pine lasts and ive never seen an oregon pine hull after its been in the water twenty years but what you cant see daylight through the dry rot now lot of surveyors will argue with and so forth but they argue and i can still find examples whereby the ships which they build have endurance and they go to pieces and it costs lot of money well now theres an interesting field one that i happen to know something about and out of this we get this interesting series of observations and suddenly total explanation of what this is all about if they they really dont want to build ships and they certainly dont want you to have ships shipyard worker goes in and he works for something on the order of five pounds day but when you get the bill his wages were fifteen pounds day why thats fascinating thats just method of not getting ships for anybody its very interesting i think the reason the us government punishes all the producers of the united states is simply to get them to produce on some reactive basis but the government is noproduction body so its going to make sure that nobody else produces but the immediate result of not permitting anybody to have anything is to make everybody create something so the stupider the government gets with regard to handling production the more is going to get created and the more passive government is and the less interested government is on the subject the less is going to be created in the country isnt that an interesting fact theres all sorts of cross observations under all of this that make life much more comprehensible that isnt whats important to us im just giving you background music the various things ive looked at that were close to and so on ive been rubbing elbows on the subject of ships and ive monkeyed with lot of other things in the last few months and looking at life in general it has seemed very interesting to that theres evidently some cross relationship that goes further than the overt withhold mechanism there is something more than the overt withhold mechanism well actually it was described in theory its marvelous thing to eventually understand your own work but i find myself in that interesting position every once in while and im of two minds with regard to my own past work and one mind says boy that was sure stupid and the other mind is boy that was sure smart you see i mean its two minds definitely but this havingness situation compounded with the games conditions of scientology fundamental of thought actually give us the answer to any case games condition what do we mean by games condition says in scientology fundamentals of thought its preventing people from having things but how far can we go on this basis and what is this all about and what do we mean by things well anything you can name is thing you name it its havingness you can name it if you can name it its havingness and if you can guess at it its havingness and thetan is only unhappy when he cant have and his idea of quality well amongst us i think personally it could be reformed but if you deny him any given thing his instant and immediate reaction is to try to obtain it so that prohibition in america makes drunkards out of the whole country now i know how to make successful civilization now that would just go like hot bomb just using this principle i would find everything i wanted the civilization to have in it and then hire nothing but police and agents in all directions with bureaus and departments to prevent each one of these things from existing and then id make sure that i had real knuckleheads in charge of these bureaus so that they would not be in the least effective or efficient well just name the number of things you want in the society or the civilization and then form bureaus to prevent each one of them and youll immediately get demand thats the way you create demand you dont create demand by supply and thats whats wrong with economics you create demand by prohibition now how do you create creation by just running broad canthave thats all thats all you have to do and everybody will create it now if you were to run millionpound advertising campaign in england stating categorically giving fines particularly in england england works on this like gorgeous thing i mean its marvelous you get instant reaction on games condition and if you made it absolutely against the law completely and utterly to have cat cawow you know you wouldnt be able to see the pavement anyplace well think about it for minute you see everybodyd kind of get even with you theyd immediately start breeding cats man well i can see it now the secret cloak and dagger society for the breeding of angora cats or whatever having clandestine meetings you know and everybody wrapped in cloaks and meeting behind back doors and so forth whole secret fishing industry springs up so they can smuggle fish in the government passing regulations fish for cat consumption will be imported into england i can see it now man thats the way itd go too thats the way itd go now oddly enough the games conditions situation can get so bad that if you insist on people having something they also dont want it so if you insisted on england having nothing but slums you would immediately improve the standard of living but unfortunately by insisting that they have nothing but council houses with very very nice appointed apartments for one and all youre going to get slums theyre going to uphold the standard of living if youre going to uphold this standard of living with great violence you see people are going to listen to everything else i think the total birth of rock and roll in england is the attitude of bbc toward culture i think so after all old bbc sits up there and they just figure day and night how theyre going to make everybody cultured and the net result is the only thing they they havent got bach and brahms being played on the streets man all theyve got is rock and roll and the whiffy tiffy five you know unless you knew these rules mans activities would look totally incomprehensible and as once you know these rules his activities look very comprehensible all right lets say that we want threesixteenthsinch size bolts produced in enormous quantity in manchester well the first thing we do is put heavy tax on such bolts and we prohibit their being sold in any of the stores everybodys going to produce threesixteenthsinch bolts thats for sure theyre going to make them left and right i can see it now they take quarterinch bolts and swell them up and halfinch bolts and shrink them down see everythings got to be threesixteenths man its right there bang nothing else will do so this all looks totally irrational youll go into community youll arrive here on earth its new area to you and you start looking around and you see this happening and that happening and the other happening and it doesnt make any sense to you at all well you dont know what the law has been so therefore you cant read the opposites because your games condition is going to bring into existence the reverse if you run canthave on people theyre going to create it its very interesting you take district and you utterly prohibit one hundred percent crime and everybody goes just little bit bugs or crime starts to occur around and about the place or something like that it is totally police action that creates crime everybody knows this sort of instinctively but they never quite look it over ive operated down in parts of angeles south alvarado and main and that sort of thing its as much as your lifes worth to go down there on weekend hang around those bars and gin mills and marijuana joints they just stack up the bodies like cord wood its nothing you pick up some guy on the corner and hes cut from ear to ear and bleeding gore all over the pavement nobodys paying bit of attention to him that is too usual well it was very odd in operating in that particular area to look what man was actually doing or what he would accept or what he was trying to do and it was very peculiar that the police were trying in some measure throughout that area to squash all of this kind of activity and they were particularly hot in those particular activities there is more police per square inch on main and south alvarado and so forth in angeles than any other place on earth its totally populated by police and it is the seamiest lousiest scummiest skid row in the world well isnt this fascinating look well you see reasonability throws you astray you say the place is rough therefore they have to have police there you have police there to forbid roughness so you get roughness now i have actually seen police create roughness it goes this far heres guy minding his own business cop walks up to him turns him around and tells him to get out well what is the fellow doing hes doing nothing well that was why he was told to get out its all too calm here for the cops man and the next thing you know i have actually seen man beaten till every tooth was knocked out of his head and stamped on and everything else and there wasnt going to be single thing going on i mean the fellow didnt do anything or otherwise the cops just had to have some trouble it was very interesting one of the cops after that foray was all done was all beat up he was just black and blue and he was in terrible condition and all this and this other fellow got away by the way and i was standing there explaining to this police officer how i had helped him all i could i did too and he was trying to create trouble i helped him create trouble for himself i was helping him beat the guy up you see i was operating as special police officer myself you know just somehow or other every time hed raise his hand to strike you see his wrist would hit my arm or something like this he kept getting in my road thats what i kept telling him it was very confusing brawl he explained to afterwards over glass of whiskey and so forth hed never been in quite as confusing brawl hed never but that it was possible to keep law and order in these places was very very easy to observe because in those areas where i was they didnt have any trouble now that wasnt some special monkey business i was pulling off in fact i wasnt looking for any trouble either way i wasnt either trying to make people be good or be bad or try to start fights or otherwise actually there was law and order in that immediate area because nobody was running canthave on anybody there were canthaves being run id talk to all the guys that came in and so on people kept trying to hire by the way because it was bad for business to have these brawls and so forth occur and ive been offered some very fancy sums to keep on with this job it was very very amusing and entertaining to they took as the real mccoy you know i must have been the real thing i thought that boy thats the biggest fraudulence i ever pulled in my life anyway there where you didnt run super canthave and super nohave enforcement of some kind or another nothing would happen im talking about rough area of the world ive had ships ive had places of this character and as long as you yourselves werent in games condition with the people present and you had some control in the area nothing happened things just went on and everybody was happy and cheerful and so on and so we get this oddity we get captain bligh who was an awfully good officer but he did have mutiny bligh did have mutiny good officer i wonder why he had mutiny well he had fellow by the name of mr christian and mr christian was running canthave on the captain the captain ran canthave on the crew and ill tell you running canthave on bunch of sailors where bunch of beautiful polynesian women are concerned is mighty hard thing an adventurous thing to do if i may say so i myself never tried it personally i never tried it personally myself not wearing any halos in this particular department ive followed quite an opposite course i remember running the golden gate bridge one time with radar only with golden gate pilot san francisco bay pilot standing there getting grayer by the instant with nothing but cottonpacked fog you couldnt even see the bow running down fairway full of ships at flank speed hed never heard of radar before and it was brandnew in the war you see and of course i could see alcatraz at the other end of the entrance and i could see every ship in the fairway and down the line we went crash bang turned on our tails snap boom underneath the oakland bridge bang onto our mooring spot down went the anchor shook the pilot by the hand he didnt have to apply any motion to his hand it was already shaking and boats away and if he had examined the situation very carefully he would have seen this was perfectly reasonable sensible activity i myself had innumerous dates on the top of the mark which i would be late for and all of my petty officers undoubtedly had numerous dates along the waterfront that they would be late for and all of the crew undoubtedly had numerous dates elsewhere well its very fantastic but nobody was running canthave on these characters you get the idea quite the reverse but not any enforcement on it either the reasonable sensible thing to do from this crews point of view of course was to get ashore as fast as possible after long cruise and get their liberty boats away by fourthirty on the button that was the reasonable thing to do because man that beach was just crammed with dames man crammed see thats reasonable thing to do bligh didnt do that he says you see all those beautiful women he said nope hgh games condition now we read in the annals how he didnt create the mutiny isnt that an interesting thing to read he didnt create the mutiny well he you see there is nothing against running canthave its supposed to be good thing on this planet so when you sailed in here from wherever you came from and took look at this scrambled hamburger you were probably amazed because the one thing that is bound and determined to produce complete upset throughout the whole civilization is allowed on this planet condoned hundred percent you are only sterling upright pathimontheback citizen if you run good solid canthave in all directions on everybody now youre good man lets put him in charge of the national provincial bank or something see lets put him in charge hes good safe man you see thats good safe admiral umhmm umhmm runs canthave on all the sailors all the officers the navy department everybody okay good lets appoint him see well this must be an excellent army because the sergeants and captains and generals in it wont let anybody have anything must be fine army look it over must be thats the test are they strict what do you mean by strict you see you have governments that dont govern well now how can you possibly add this up in any other fashion than the government is running canthave on the people with government but they dont take these odd decisive steps they dont take odd peculiar sensible decisions they dont act when theyre supposed to act you see so theyre good fellows got the idea the best thing you can do is of course create as many problems as possible and the way you create problems is and were right back to the common fundamental is run canthave and as soon as you run enough canthaves youre going to create problems we had one here in the last two weeks we had somebody in accounts turn in an accounts record on which some four or five thousand pounds were not shown well thats interesting when youre very interested in getting the show on the road and keeping everything together and so forth you all of sudden read your bank statements and there are four or five thousand pounds less but i had told this person not to reconcile these bank statements anymore but it looked like the bank statements had all been reconciled this accountant was running canthave the immediate result of this has been caroms in all directions canthave suddenly appeared in the organization and theres all sorts of discussion and offbeat activities and everything you could possibly think of just as result of this rumor lines going around left and right and so forth this is all tempests in teapots or in tea saucers but it all came from one little canthave got the idea and this thing went zoom zoom zoom zoom so canthave in addition to being the fundamental of the reactive bank is also the fundamental of all problems if you want to create problem run canthave thats the best way to create problem your problems normally look as though theyre donthaves you can look at your problems as mainly donthaves you have problem of what to do with the weekend because you dont have you see car or something or other you get the idea so they look like donthaves well how did you get into donthave thats the fascinating question how did you get into donthave how come you havent got this thing that you need thats the question to ask and all of sudden you can materialize it heres exactly what you do you say well got weekend coming up and i dont have car so there i have problems of what to do with the weekend thats very mild version of problem see look out in front of your face what have you done at that moment youre liable to spend the rest of the weekend trying to build car or something in some various via you will have something to do with the scarcity of cars because you ran into the fact that you dont have one you may have one where you normally live but right at this particular area you just dont have one well how did you get into position where you cant say presto digitanjo pretslosis or something and have this car materialize how are you in position in life where you can have donthave run on you because thats sort of the last ditch of canthave isnt it the donthaves thats way downstairs well how did you get in that position well its the overt motivator sequence you see you run enough canthaves until you create situation of donthave and then all of sudden you can look around and nothave yourself see youve opened the gates on the motivator by running canthave youve opened the gates of the motivator and you will eventually wind up not with just canthave but youll run up with donthave its very very simple its one of the idiotic simple simon mechanisms but thats the ow sequence as applied to the games condition and thats where we arrive at now with the practicalities of auditing ill stop reminiscing to you about this and that and get down to some practicalitis and it just adds up to simply this that if your pc doesnt have anything it must be because he has denied it as elementary as this he must have denied it if he has low quality of something as his favored quality it must be that he is operating on this kind of an activity mentally he cant have good one but nobody wants bad one so hes got bad one now youve seen that guy around youll find them in the electronics world theyve got the whole backyard full of impossibly decayed machinery electronics junk and so forth theres always spool of wire you know the wire itself is broken in fifty places and nothing you can do with it or about it and yet thats it and nobody wants this wire and you run into this and you puzzle yourselves with this problem you say well why does he have the wire if nobody wants the wire and of course youve answered your own question he has it because nobody wants it and if nobody wants it then he can have it and that is his first test of havingness with regard to wire he can only have it if nobody wants it have you ever realized that there might i know it sounds incredible to you but there might be there just might be an explanation for the old ladies hats you see in london theyre too incredible to be believed well thats the only hat they can have and they can only have it because nobody wants it obviously you get it you get that kind of an answer now the total absence of something does not mean the thetan is without it this is the other interesting fact the total absence of something doesnt mean the thetan is without it youre going to find it in his reactive bank being obsessively created hawhawhaw and the further it is out of sight and the further it is out of his sight or anybody elses sight of course the more covertly he thinks he has to create it so the covert creativeness which goes on called reactive bank is remedy of havingness and thats all reactive bank is now you run canthave on somebody on sex and then one fine day you find people are running canthave on you on the subject of sex and youre very puzzled because these two facts dont necessarily or easily associate well now if you go on that far you will find out that second dynamic activities are impossible see you cant have these second dynamic activities so therefore theyre liable to take some kind of flip theyll go off in some different direction and you start building up various types of second dynamic activities that you could have you got the idea and when these too fail of course you wind up with these even hidden from yourself but still being created in the bank you get how this is so they dont only pass out of somebody elses sight they pass out of your sight too so we get the degrade of quality we get the downgrading quality you see fellow cant have cadillac so he thinks he might have buick but he actually cant have buick so he settles for ford but he cant quite have the ford so he settles for 1928 austin baby austin now hes all set to buy this and then he finds out that he cant have that because it cant be licensed anymore or something of the sort dont you see so were auditing him we find car wreck hey whats this you know this guy is stuck in car wreck hes not stuck in car wreck hes stuck in having wrecked car you get the reinterpretation of the thing thats something nobody wants see life sort of ran canthave on him in cars so his cars downgraded downgraded downgraded and then disappeared there wasnt anything lower i dont think than 1928 austin unless its vintage stutz bearcat 1912 vintage model mint condition im familiar with the car it was never in mint condition all right so you get the degrade you see and the degrade is only what person can have now what emotion or feeling can pc have now lets just depart from the nature of things of just solid havingnesses and lets move over into what feeling can the pc have and do you know the commondenominator complaint of most people who are around the bend is that they cant feel anything anymore or they cant emote and they have more sensation that is common denominator way downstairs and then you get little bit upstairs and you find everybody has something that they wish they could feel more about they cant feel about certain things anymore and they this upsets them that is what that is nothing more nor less than canthave on feeling so the feelings degrade the beautiful exhilarated superserenity of tone 40 you see well thats impossible you know you have to gaze at your navel for forty years on the tops of everest and every time you climb everest you know you get wiped out and all kinds of things thats impossible to obtain so we will settle for little enthusiasm but of course thats really an overt act to be enthusiastic to people so its best to be conservative except bank managers set us such terrible example in that that nobody wants us to be conservative so the best thing to be is sort of bored the best thing to do is angry but you cant nobodyll let you be bored you wont let anybody else be bored either and so the best thing to do well lets start crying but you dont want people to cry and people dont want you to cry so you cant have that one either so you at least could be good and degradedly apathetic oh but nobody wants you to be apathetic and you dont want anybody else to be apathetic so you wind up with feelings but you can mock em up way at the back of the bank now at the first saint hill acc i talked about two routes experience and another route that we were using at that particular time you see these two things weve now combined because the experiential factor is havingness all of sudden it all can be lumped under one heading experience is havingness if you regard all experience as havingness then all experience can be restored in other words take these doingness and beingness factors and add them all under havingness in other words make beingness and doingness junior to havingness all right we get beingness now we cant obviously be some of these scarce and rare beingnesses which are way up to the top of the list of social stratas and so forth so we settle for lesser beingnesses and lesser beingnesses and lesser beingnesses and we get into this sort of state where were not being anything right where we are particularly or we maybe are being bit of something which is not too acceptable to us and we mock up some kind of beingness reactive mockup of beingness and of course the first grade of beingness that were liable to mock up is something terrifically desirable and then pretend to be it but were not it you got the idea now little kids do this all the time i want to call to your attention that children are not allowed to fly airplanes in this society this is an omission undoubtedly it is done to deny people airplane crashes but the truth of the matter is that little kid is not permitted to fly airplanes he is not permitted to be an aircraft pilot nor train as one they say go to kindergarten and learn your abcs and hes only interested in learning how to read bankandturn indicators and engine temperature gauges and so forth this is all hes interested in but they say go to kindergarten and play with those blocks and we find this little kid buzzing around buzzing around buzzing around buzzing around buzzing around hes creating being an aviator all the time why is he creating being an aviator well nobodys let him be an aviator see theres the explanation you got the idea this is reactivity were talking about by running the canthave we get the creation this is reactive what confuses everybody is all of this can take place on an analytical level totally analytical level and we say to somebody analytically well you really shouldnt drink so much alcohol because it makes you drunk and youve got class in the morning or something and they say yes thats right and they dont drink see that throws all of our computations out that the way you get people to do something but oddly enough if we did this to them very often and if we did this to them in some unacceptable way so its canthave so the communication is canthave they cant have the communication and they cant have the liquor theyll all of sudden start feeling little dizzy all the time what theyre doing is rekindling their past drunkennesses youve run canthave on drink and theyve started rekindling their drunkennesses and they start going thuuhthuth now see what youve done to you see and they use it for some new purpose but the truth of the matter is that by running canthave not by as friend of theirs helping them out or something like this you see that level can exist but we run canthave good games condition our motives are as impure as politicians see theyre really impure now we say well you really shouldnt drink anything this evening you know weve sort of privately reactively got our eye on the bottle and we see theres only three drinks left all of these mechanisms take place below the level of arc of course so that absence of arc is almost direct requisite for reactive creation by reason of canthave it must be canthave run without arc or some portion of arc or misarc you got the idea the canthave really has to be run man it really has to be run now people all over the place are working day and night on this saw sergeant bilco on television last night and i never saw quite so much canthave on the army in my life but that was gorgeous program whereby these recruits come in under military school graduate who is some military prep school graduate and theyve all been drilled up already and they want bilco to take them out on the rifle range and teach them how to shoot and bilcos trying to beg off and all hes doing is run canthave on them on training you see and he thinks of fifty dozen different ways to insist that they not be trained real gorgeous but do you know the condition of peace which avails every place is simply canthave on army activities they just run canthave on all these soldiers soldiers like to come back and tell you how beat up they are after war as matter of fact they dont you know its only lying around shore bases and things like this and waiting forever and not doing anything that really upsets them theyre denied the experience of war generals of course are the people who will run canthaves hardest you get more peace and more war along with the peace and more explosive peaces which develop instantly into war under generals than any other single class of person man you can have yourself some nasty international situations if you get somebody who is totally insistent on peace why hes reactively running canthave on war see it isnt that war is good or bad hes just running canthave on war thats what hes totally devoted and dedicated to and he runs one hard enough hell get one somebodyll create one why will they create one lets look back at the first rule hes run canthave on the subject well man dont run canthave on the germans on the subject of war because they react on it too easily they mock it up at once the best way to handle the germans is you can see immediately is to get into good arc with them and explain to them how they must get ready to fight we dont care what but just ready them up to fight in all directions explain that theres alien races on arcturus or something you know keeping the peace does not consist of running canthave about war and getting out with bunch of propaganda about i hate war and eleanor hates war and james hates war we all hate war and that is why we are going instantly and immediately into one that we should have entered five years ago see that was real mess but its all on you mustnt have war you mustnt have war now if you dont think that wasnt reactive it went this far there were bulletins about the war there was canthave on war run by the us information services on the american public and it was the wildest canthave on the war i ever heard of you could read newspaper accounts about what was going on in the part of the world which you were in and they bore slightest relationship to reality now i dont know that it was doing the enemy any harm or any good but i know now that it had nothing to do with the enemy it was just big canthave on war everybody was involved in fighting war but simultaneously everybody was running canthave on the subject of war man the trouble you got into in world war ii for going and attacking the enemy that was something that just wasnt done you think im kidding but its true thats the most trouble you could get into you couldnt get in any trouble sitting still you couldnt get in the slightest trouble saying well the engines are broken down and i havent got full crew and nobodys serviced with provisions and the refrigerators wont cool the meat everybodyd say oh well good boy good boy you know and pass on down the line theyd just leave you alone but if you ever said say you know theres whole bunch of japs or something just landed on that island over there and id like permission to go over and run harassing patrol man theyre liable to put you in the booby hatch or something you know you were non persona grata at that moment you had broken the prevailing mores which is there mustnt be war but somebody should have called it to their attention there was one in progress after whole united states fleet had sacrificed itself holding the japs back and buying three or four months worth of time they then said some old obsolete ships have disappeared in the pacific its the most fantastic story ive ever read i read it the day i stepped off of boat from that exact area how these old obsolete ships which didnt mean anything anyway had kind of sunk at their moorings or something well you get somebody who cant walk hell run nomotion on everybody right all right now there is the interlocking complications of existence people are running canthaves on things that exist lets move it up now to that state lets run canthave on something that exists lets say it doesnt exist we get total delusory state theres whole religion devoted to this called christian science im not mad at christian science we are indebted to christian science but unfortunately for the christian scientist their canthave runs to the degree that the physical universe isnt here you try running 8c sometime on christian scientist cawow cawow cawow youre going directly against their most basic canthave which is they mustnt have physical universe what does it amount to but you mustnt have physical universe when you tell somebody there is none here there is physical universe nobody asks the intelligent question then where the hell are we everybody says oh i see i got that yeah ooohh lets look over and see where these things come what do you suppose this christian scientist is then going to do whats his bank going to look like after while cawow what would be the basic mass of bank of person in christian science to have canthave on the whole physical universe now whats their bank going to look like audience solid solid well theyre going to have whole solid bank arent they thats real good huh and just for kicks sometime you ought to get somebody thats been in christian science and ask them to swing around arcturus and other places because its all in their minds its all present everything is all present its all inside all being obsessively created internally because it cant exist externally the insistence on thetan on the somethingness of existence and on the first axioms is utterly fantastic now how are you going to use this do you realize theres lets get into some very practical practicalities here in ending this thing up youve got bunch of people for instance in england who cant think try to run think process on them bunch of people down in south africa they cant think you say think of time kabow wow cant cant think of time oh this is faschinating have you ever run into anybody and you try to run think process on them and you had to change it over to get the idea did you ever do that you had to change it over actually you could well we had ways and means for while of notising of running the notis off of thinking it was back about the 4th london acc ah but there is something very much worse than this as process that is absolutely deadly utterly deadly look if they cant think they must have ow games condition on thought haha there must be something there whereby they have preventing people from thinking so if they cant have thought then they have added it up to canthave on thought oh this is very fascinating canthave on thought therefore people are going to run canthave on them on thought arent they and that is going to be very interesting and with that one observation we can antiquate every security check we have arent these people withholding all of these various things so as to deny other people from thinking things about them so there is one twocommand process which knocks out security check necessity now were still going to do security checks were still going to have them but recognize what they are if the individual is withholding thought he is doing what he is running games condition on you on the subject of you cant have it and this is going to render him in condition where hes going to have less of it and if you can make him get off his withholds which is to say give you the thought you have then stopped him from playing this particular games condition and he feels much better but why does he have all these discreditable things anyway well they dont exist they havent existed for instance why is this fellow nursing to his bosom having robbed candy store of bar of candy at the age of five why why has he got this thing pulled into his bosom why wont he tell you completely in addition to the fact that he doesnt want you to have that thought that thought is scarce if person is withholding the thought is scarce and if the thought is scarce we must assume then that theres damn little robbery and theft in candy stores hes got it cut down see it is not in abundance its in scarcity and so the individual is taking these immoral actions criminal actions actions of against the mores of the society well the reason he withholds them is because theyre against the mores of the society and therefore scarce they are scarce because they are against the mores of the society so if he can get hold of one of them he has little jewel there in that little plush box tucked away you see under the left oblongata its scarcity but then he holds on to it for this other mechanism he doesnt want you to have bad thoughts about him and of course thats totally recognizable but its in the same category as games condition hes running canthave of bad thoughts on you youre not supposed to have bad thoughts so therefore you mustnt think these bad thoughts in any direction much less against him got the idea so this is basic process this what thought well any i dont care how you phrase it you dont have to write it down as command because its just theoretical process its what thought havent you permitted another to have and what thought hasnt another permitted you to have well that immediately starts doing all kinds of weird things with the security checks weve got because its the one of the basic modus operandi of why the security check exists the person is running canthave on thoughts he doesnt want you to have bad thoughts so if you ran any such auditing command well if you said when havent you wanted another person to have thought or what thought havent you wanted another person to have accompanied to get your flow in properly what thought havent people wanted you to have youve immediately jumped over the top of all security checks get the idea now another mechanism about this is you tell somebody you say think of woman thank you think of woman thank you think of woman thank you and then just keep tags on what kind of women he thinks of its quite therapeutic by the way but youre making him create women all right think of woman thank you think of woman thank you what kind of women first he gets nothing perhaps its probably quite invisible he probably gets some generality he probably thinks of the general idea of women he probably doesnt have any broad concept of it at all except just women you know and then he starts thinking of specific departed women you know theyre specific but theyre departed therefore he hasnt got any picture of them and then as you run this process you eventually come back up to basis where he can get dead women so he gets dead women and dead women and dead women and then he gets sick women by the way if this is running perfectly it runs through all the sequence of the funerals you have certain strata of funerals you see so you have womens graves and then you have women being buried and then you eventually get women dead in state or something of this sort and then you get women dying you see and then you get women sick and about to die you got the idea and it goes back up this line what exactly is happening here youre making him examine the scarcity of women that is all and it runs backwards and eventually the process would be flat if at length he was able to think of present time woman with the greatest of ease and actually get perfect 3d picture of her you see that well actually just think of woman would do this youre getting him to exercise the automaticity of the downgrade of women you see that not recommended process thats not recommended process thats test process and very simple test process and very valuable one australia of autumn 1959 spring australian time now what is this whats the next process what is valuable process how would you work these theories around into process now all right we find this fellows deficient on the subject of women one of the things hes probably deficient we detect that hes deficient on women is because perhaps he has peculiar ideas about sex with men you dont condemn this you just its just indicative that he obviously cant think about women if hes man and he cant think about women he can only think about men well theres something weird going on here so therefore he must have hell of scarcity on women well heres the gag and heres the formula by which you put together the gamescondition process whatever it is that you find him inverted or nonexistent on you develop process by which you can discharge his using that item in games condition on others and others using that as games condition on him and because youre running out stable data all the way on this you add confusion problem or emotion along with it in other words you take whatever the item is that you find him inverted on or nonexistent on and you run gamescondition process heres an example your confusion and stable datum is what accounts for the last command the guy if he doesnt asis some of the confusions and problems and motions in connection with this he will be content to just sit there and run the stable data of the games condition out from the middle of it and wind up in confusion so youve got to throw something else in there to make him asis the conf the motion got the idea whatever it is or the problems with regard to it youve got to bring up his confront on the problem of it otherwise youre just taking apart game for him so the last part of the command or the third part of the command is to rehabilitate the games condition and when that is missing the games condition doesnt necessarily rehabilitate easily and the process takes lot longer to run and hes going to feel like youre taking game away from him so you run this last one hes short of games too merely because he cant the way you deny people of games really is to give them things they cant confront and of course thats marvelous way to deny everybody havingness so the fellow can longer confront problems so he cant have new games you got the idea because new games require havingness so the confront of problems is necessary to the rehabilitation of all new games right all right now heres sample of this heres women when have you denied another woman when has another denied you woman what problem about women is not present now now those three commands would take any of these oddball sexual difficulties and just knock em out brrrrrrr now lets take woman and she has lot of trouble with men having lots of trouble with men of one kind or another of course you give them the same command only it is addressed to men when have you denied man to another when has another denied man to you and what problem about man is not present now now why that form not present now well you remember my lecture on notises well thats the notis version of problem confront and thats murderous process man because it unnotises everything involved got it well now that basically is the road out as far as games conditions are concerned and it started back there with scientology 88008 and went through the vicissitudes of problems and creative processes earlier than that and then problems and came up more recently into the prehav scale and has moved out into highly workable functional activity all you have to do is establish the nonexistence or the downgraded form of something in the pc run games type process on the pc and the pcs going to snap out of it now how does the prehav scale fit in with this well you could actually assess it on the prehav scale and find out the person was very short on something or other well its hes got something he reacts badly on something so you simply consider hes short on it and let us say it was leaving its as indefinite as this dont you see this would be your routine 2 application of this sort of thing you assess it on the prehav scale just as you normally would and you find that he is short on leaving when i say you find hes short on leaving it simply means youve assessed and found out that the hot button was leaving so you run gamescondition type of process on this and you would find that the person would recover in maybe tenth of the time or something like that than he would on general run and the games condition process would be something made up out of leaving but make sure that it makes sense just make sure it makes sense thats the main thing you have to work it over and then make sure that the commands react on the meter before you start running them because they might be totally unreal to the pc in other words it would be when have you prevented anothers leaving when has another prevented your leaving and what problem about leaving isnt present now and that would be the way youd put gamescondition process together on basis of routine 2 now youll get some of these levels and they dont make sense so you wouldnt say to somebody what fail leave isnt and what fail leave is or something of the sort and its all up in the air and he cant quite wrap his wits around it well you have to work around it until you get an answerable command and one that reacts on the emeter now the basic thing that this has resolved and the basic target at which all this work has been leveled is the problem run into by peter williams and the problem run into by us on endless assessment for goals since proper assessment for goals obviously is taking much too much time well now why because it is not everybody who takes this amount of time in an assessment for goals what is this all about it is simply games condition on the subject of goals and youre sitting there asking somebody for goals who is in games condition about goals and goals are very scarce and theyre not going to let you have one man so of course theyre never going to give you their goal and you can easily get thousand goals out of them none of which are their goal so you can use games condition process on goals which is preparatory to goals assessment which shortens the goals assessment right on down boom which is what is what goal havent you let another have or what goal dont you want another to have or any way you want that thing and what goal doesnt another want you to have or hasnt wanted you to have or any way you want to phrase it you see and what goal would be problem or some such command all of sudden they come off of games condition with you the auditor on the subject of goals they begin to level and reactively they are incapable up to this time of digging up goal and giving you one now all of sudden they actually stretch their goals out you can find their goal you can find their terminal rather easily that defeated that game but anyway games condition is an unnatural situation since in games condition person becomes convinced that only this game exists and that game always consists of singleness in that field and canthave and all games consist of canthave and the person gets into the opinion that there is only that game so they can only run this canthave and the more they continue to run the canthave of course the less they have of it so the thing disappears from view after while and theyve gotten worse if anything not better so there is the long and short of games you understand of course that originally when you started to clear people way back they wouldnt clear because they thought they were losing their games and when you did get them by some hook or crook clear then they were left with only one game and became impatient with the idea of being clear and so promptly got themselves aberrated up again so that they could have game and they expressed it this way well i wanted to be like other people or have some fun in life and i felt like i was totally detached from existence and i didnt want to be this detached well what was pinning it all down was games scarcity of games and their scarcity of games was so terrific that they felt if they left this game of being aberrated they would never find any new game and sop goals of course walked them out of this but was walking them out of it for some people much too slowly we were being successful but at what slowness in many cases all right so remedy of havingness of games consists basically of broadening their view on the subject of games and if you can broaden their view on the subject of games you can of course clear people rather easily so therefore all you would have to do is find out all of the basically aberrated games that the fellow was playing knock them out one right after the other and getting his fixation off of these things hed be able to look around and find out there was more games and would practically blow clear almost at once because he would now be willing to but every person going for clear has become totally convinced that if he audited just one more auditing command if he said just one more answer he would longer have his game and he will tell you occasionally that he really doesnt want to be clear and yip yap yip yap and hes just talking about one thing he said well if you run out this game there are other games and ive had it so my attention has been very much on that thing and i am very happy to tell you that i have gotten that wrapped up thank you very much
