commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states july 2004 section 122 p 365367removing terrorist sanctuaries the 911 commission recommendations and us policy overview1 the national commission on terrorist ttacks upon the united states issued its final report the 911 commission re port on july 19 2004 the report offered number of recommendations to strengthen us efforts to combat terrorism one strong recommendation was that the us government should id entify and prioritize actual or potential terrorist sanctuaries2 for each it recommended realistic strategy to keep possible terrorists insecure and on the run using all elements of national power the commission stressed that the ited states should reach out listen to and work with other countries that can help the rationale given for devoting special ttention to denial of sanctuaries was that complex interna tional terrorist operation aime d at launching catastrophic attack cannot be mounted without the time space and ability to perform competent planning and staff work command structur able to make necessary decisions and possessing the authority and contacts to assemble needed people money and materials opportunity and space to recruit train and select operatives with the needed skills and dedication providing the time and structure required to socialize them into the terrorist cause judge thei r trustworthiness and hone their skills logistics network able to securely manage the travel of operatives move money and transport resources like explosives wher they need to go access in the case of certain weapons to the special materials n eeded for nuclear ch emical radiological or biological attack relia ble communications between c oordinators and operatives and opportunity to test the workability of the plan the commission stressed the value to qaeda of its afghan sanctuary under the taliban government as well as of it s logistical networks running through pakistan and the united arab emirates in preparing the 911 attack and other operations the report also emphasized the lax internal security environments in western countries including the united states that the terrorist were able to exploit the commission stated that to find sanctuary terrorist groups have fled to some of the least governed most lawless places in the world the united states was seen as facing an enormous challenge finding ways to extend its reach and influence to some of these remote areas the commission warned that every policy decision madehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32518crs2 3 httpwwwwhitehousegovnewsreleases200302counter_terrorismcounter_terroris m_strategypdfneeded to be viewed through this lens for instance iraq could not be allowed to become failed state because it could b ecome primary breeding ground for attacks against americans at home similarly the report stressed that us and allied efforts to achieve stability in afghanistan must succeed or else the taliban warlords and drug traffickers might prev ail and allow the country to again become potential refuge for qaeda or likeminded terrorist groups as the commission report pointed out us efforts were underway even prior to 911 to get governments especially t hose of afghanistan and pakistan to deny sanctuary to qaeda and other terrorist groups but these efforts were largely unsuccessful until the 911 attacks caused many governments to change their course us policy to combat global terrorism s long included the objective of denying sanctuary to terrorist groups by isolating nd applying pressure on states that sponsor terrorism or tolerate terrorists on their territory and by strengthening the counterterrorism capabilities of countries th at cooperate with the united states but need help the national strategy for combating terrorism released by the white house on february 14 2003 stressed the broad sc ope of us policy aimed at denying terrorists sanctuaries3 what was termed the second front of us strategy gave priority to denying terrorists the spons orship support and sanctuary that enable them to exist gain strength plan and execute their attacks the strategys stated focus was threefold 1 to convince all states of their responsibility to combat terrorism 2 to target aid to countries with the will but not the means to combat terrorism and 3 to take action against states that are unwilling to meet their obligation to fight terrorism military force and law enforcement remained major tools of the new strategy however th strategy document also emphasized other instruments such as diplomacy economic assistance and programs to strengthen governance the aim was to choke off the lifeblood of terrorist groups in language very similar to that of the 911 commissi on report the strategy document spoke of denying access to territory funds equipmen t training technology and unimpeded transit more broadly the strategy sought to eliminate conditions that produce terrorist sanctuaries especi ally in failed states the st rategy spoke of the need to build powerful coalition of nations against terrorism including reorienting existing partnerships and creating new mechanisms of cooperation it stre ssed that the united states was recasting its relations and fo rging new cooperation with russia china pakistan and india after 911 the united states rallied much of the worlds support for the war against qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan and for global crackdown against terrorists and their money the united states was able to enlist allies as well as russia and china in support of the war ffort in what many experts saw as fundamental shift in russian policy with potential longt erm consequences for us russian relations president putin allied himself

issue of possibly moving us bases in order to better positi on forces to meet the new gl obal threats including the ability to attack terrorists in their sanctuaries planning for such redeployment has reportedly advanced considerably though most details have not yet been made public the united states also uses economic ca rrots and sticks to gain cooperation from governments and to strengthen their capacity to deny sanctuary to terrorists the united states has strong economic sanctions regime in place barring us foreign assistance to states that support terro rism the united states also uses

that the united states make longterm commitment to provide comprehensive support for islamabad so long as it is committed to policy of enlightened moderation according to the us departments of state and defense pakistan has afforded the united states unprecedented levels of counterterrorism coope ration by allowing the us military to use bases within th country helping to identify and detain extremists and deploying tens of thousands of its own security forces to secure the pakistanafghanistan border top us officials regularly praise pakistani anti terrorism efforts the state department reports that islamabad has captured 550 alleged terrorists and their supporters and has transferre d more than 400 of these to us custody including several top suspected qaeda leaders pakistan also ranks fourth in the world in seizing terrorist assets according to state among the security related assistance provisions to pakistan from the united states since 2001 are surveillance radars

afghanpakistani border region where islamic extremists find sanctuary especially worrisome are indications that members of the taliban may continue to receive logis tical and other support inside pakistan senior us nators and state department officials have voiced such worries including concern that elements of pakistans intelligence agencies might be helping members of the taliban and perhaps even qaeda since the talibans ouster from power in kabul and subsequent retreat to the rugged mountain region near the pakistana fghanistan border what the us military calls its remnant forces have been ab to regroup and to conduct hitandrun attacks against usled coalition units often in tandem with suspected qaeda fugitives these forces are then able to find haven on the pakistani side of the

brought vocal criticism from musharrafs tractors among islamist groups many of whom accuse him of taking orders from the united stat some observers worry that increased government pressure on tribal communities and military operations in the fata may create backlash sparking unrest and strengthening proal qaeda sentiments there during march 2004 the united states pa kistan and afghani stan intensified their coordinated military ope rations in the mountainous afghanpakistani border region and pakistani troops fought pitc hed 12day battle with islamic militants in traditionally autonomous tribal area more than 130 people were killed in the fighting including 46 pakistani soldiers but high value qaeda or taliban targets were reportedly killed or capture d up to 6000 paki stani soldiers were involved in the battle which encouraged ma ny observers as sign of president musharrafs sincerity in the effort to uproot terrorists and their supporters on pakistani territory but which also appa rently exacerbated already volatile anti musharraf sentiments held by many ethnic pashtuns in the region on april 24 2004 in what came to be known as the s hakai agreement islamabad took new tack of seeking reconciliation with pashtun militants and the foreign radicals they are accused of harboring by allowing foreign fighters to remain in the region if they turn in their weapons and renounce

c ountries in the region to both the threat and to the us reaction generally have varied with the intensity of their concerns about the threat to their own stability and domestic politics in general singapore malaysia and the philippines were quick to crack down on militant groups and share intelligence with the united states and australia whereas i ndonesia began to do so only after attacks or arrests revealed the severity of the threat to their citizens that said combating antiamerican terrorism in southeast asia presents the bush administration and congress with delicate foreign policy pr oblem most regional governments feel threatened by homegrown or imported islamic militant groups and therefore have ample incentive to cooperate with the us antiterrorist campaign however southeast asian governments have to balance these security concerns with domestic political considerations although proponent s of violent radical islam remain small minority in southeast asia many governments view increased american pressure and military presence in their re gion with ambivalence because of the political sensitivity of the issue with both mainstream islamic and secular nationalist groups the rise in antiamerican sentime nt propelled by the usled invasion and occupation of iraq makes it even more di fficult for most governments to countenance an overt us role in their internal security the challenge is to find way to confront the terrorist elements without turning them into heroes or martyrs in the broader southeast asian islamic community furthermore the continued activities of qaeda and jemaah islamiyah will require coordinated interna tional response in region where multinational institu tions and cooperation are weak strategies for combating terrorism in southeast asia to date the us approach to fighting terrorism in southeast asia primarily has been bilateral rather than multilateral in nature and generally has been limited to the law enforcement rather than the military realm in the near term barring another major terrorist attack it is difficult to foresee these features of us strategy changing since they are based upon features of inte rnational relations in southeast asia relatively weak multilateral institutions the poor histor of multilatera l cooperation and the wariness on the part of most re gional governments of being perceived as working too closely with the united states rectifying these deficiencies could be elements of the longterm goal of competing against terrorist ideologies decapitation the 911 commission recommends conceptualizing the battle against islamist terrorism as twopr onged campaign on the one hand aimed at disrupting the leadership of qaeda jemaah islamiyah and likeminded terrorist networks and on the other hand competing against the rise of radical ideologies within the islamic world that inspire terrorism23 to date us policy in southeast asia necessarily has been focused on the first goal which is more

able to exploit the sense of alienation produced in part by the corruption and breakdown of instituti onal authority in indonesia and by the marginalization of minority muslim groups in the southern philippines and southern thailand strategies for dealing with th is problem include greater emphasis on attacking the institutions that suppor t terrorism and building up regional governments

for the attacks on th united states as result it quickly became evident that europes different legal systems the largely open borders of the then15 member eu liberal asylum laws and strong privacy protections allowed terrorists and other criminals to move ar ound easily and evade arrest and prosecution the large muslim populations in many west ern european countries often provided cover for terrorist cells as well as fertile recruiting grounds drawing especially from young disenfranchised muslim populations th at have not been wellintegrated into mainstream european society the l ack of sizable muslim communities in most central and eastern european countries has made this region less of known sanctuary although laxer borde r controls and weaker governments especially in the balkans still pose concerns the march 11 2004 terrorist bombings in madrid spain further confirmed for analysts and policymakers that europe remains both target and base for qaeda and qaedainspired terrorists49 to respond to these threats european g overnments have sought to tighten their domestic laws against terrorism and terrorist financing and many have taken steps to reform immigration and asylum laws to prevent terrorists from gaining footholds in their countries especially notable ar eu initiatives since september 11 to boost police and judicial cooperation brin g down traditional barriers among law enforcement and intelligence agencies and harmonize national laws against terrorism among other steps the eu has established common definition of terrorism and list of terrorist groups an eu arrest warrant enhanced tools to investigate terrorist financing and new m easures to strengthen external eu border controls the eu has been working to bolster europol its fledgling joint

cultural hurdles as they seek to introduce more effective law enforcement tools against terrorism th march 2004 terrorist attacks in spain highlighted these ongoing implementa tion problems national police and intelligence services have remained reluct ant to share information with europol or with each other several of the madrid suspects were reportedly known to security services in spain and in other eu stat but fell through communication cracks and legal loopholes50 furthermore agreed eu measures such as the euwide arrest warrant have bogged down in the legislative processes of individual member states the warrant was supposed to have taken effect on january 1 2004 but only eight of the eus then15 members had transposed the warrant into national law the warrant is still not in force in seven members of the enlarged eu of 25 like the united states european gove rnments have had to balance their counterterrorism efforts against wellesta blished civil liberty protections and democratic ideals for example the evidentiary bar is still set very high in most european countries although there have been hundreds of terro ristrelated arrests throughout europe in recent years cr itics assert that many suspects have been released because of lack of sufficient or admissible evidence and there have been few successful prosecutions as of janua ry 2004 for example only six of the 544 people arrested under uk antiterrorist gislation since september 11 had been convicted51 cooperation challenges also remain between the united states and europe european opposition to the use of th death penalty in the united states may still slow or prevent the extradition of terrorist suspects different data protection regimes have complicated quick and r obust useu cooperation in the area of

qaeda and other terrorist groups as so countries in western europe in part because most countries in the region have not attracted large numbers of muslim immigrants in recent decades however cerns have been raised about several countries in southeastern europe with large muslim populations especially bosnia and herzegovina one area of particular concern in bosnia is the presence of islamic fundamentalist fighters from the 19921995 war in bosnia most left bosnia at us insistence after the deployment of the natoled peacekeep ing force in 1995 however some stayed behind and becam bosnian citizens in addition some islamic charities and humanitarian groups that proliferated during and after the war have served as qaeda fronts for planning attacks in bosnia and elsewhere some qaeda operatives in bosnia reportedl have had connections to members of bosnias intelligence service another gacy of bosniak wa rtime cooperation with islamic militants terrorist groups have also operated from albania there have been few reports of terrorists operating from kosovo52 it should be stressed that opposition to terrorism among indigenous muslims in the balkans has been remarkably strong bosniaks and albani ans are generally more secular in outlook than muslims elsewhere most view themselves as part of europe and are grateful for the perceived us role in defending them against serbian aggression in the 1990s efforts by islamic extremists to r ecruit local muslims into their organizations have met with limited success53 the state department patterns of gl obal terrorism reports for 2002 and 2003 noted that the countries of s outheastern europe have take n steps to combat terrorism bosnia has transferred terrorist suspects to us control shut down nongovernmental organizations with links to terrorism and frozen terrorist assets albania has taken similar steps however as noted by the 911 commission report border controls and security services in central and eastern eu rope are not as effective as their western counterparts the situation is improving in new eu member states in central europe due to substantial eu assistance in bringing their border controls up to eu standards countries in southeastern eu rope which are not likely to join the eu for many years have received lesser amounts of aid for the same purpose they continue to be particularly vulnerable due to the weakness of their government institutions and the power of organized crime and corruption in the region on the other hand nato led peacekeeping forces operating in bo snia and kosovo dubbed
