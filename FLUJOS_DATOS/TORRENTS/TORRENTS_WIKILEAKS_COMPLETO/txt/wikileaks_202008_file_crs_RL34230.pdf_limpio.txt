globe and foster international cooperation in these efforts creating global intolerance of terrorism is central as well the 2006 strategy differs from the 2003 versi on primarily in that it sets different priorities for the strategic elements designed to achieve its goals perhaps most significant of these differences is major increase in emphasis on democratization as method of combating terrorism dditionally the 2006 strategy places greater emphasis on denying terrorist s sanctuary in underdevelope d failed and rogue states the use of economic and political tools to strengthen nations vulnerable to the spread of terrorist influence appears to receive ss emphasis in the 2006 strategy than in the 2003 version inherent in the national strategy are number of issues for congress

september 5 2006 the white house released the 2006 national strategy for combating terrorism nsct or strategy1 the 2006 nsct complements the national security strategy of the united states released by the white house in march 20062 subsequently on may 31 2007 the bush administration released public diplomacy strategy th at addressed the issue of counterterrorism and set up rapid response

carry out multitude of tasks to include destroying qaeda enlisting support from allies and training experts in foreign languages nd cultures with emphasis on gaining better understanding of islam its overarching goals reportedly are to 1 defeat terrorism as threat to americas way of life as free and open society and 2 create an environment inhospitable to terrorism worldwide4 the white house subsequently released an updated second national strategy for homeland security on october 9 2007 it is described as companion to the 2006 national strategy for combating rrorism since both strategies

strategy for combating terrorism strategy follows on an earlier strategy released by the bush administration in 20039 the 2006 strategy differs from the 2003 document in number of strategic and tactical areas this report examines the 2006 nationa l strategy in the context of its predecessor in 2003 and identifies issues and options for consideration by congress the 2006 national strategy for combating terrorism provides framework for protecting the united states and its allies from terrorist attacks core components of the strategy include disrupting and disabling terrorist networks across the globe and fostering internationa l cooperation creating global environment intolerant of terrorism is central as well emphasizes the need to engage actively in the war of ideas ie to combat and counter the dissemina tion of terrorist ideology and to promote international intolerance of terrorists and of terrorism as tactic internationa l cooperation and support to bring about such worldwide ideological shift are seen as crucial to the success of such efforts shares the same major goals as its 2003 predecessor protecting the homeland disabling terrorist networ ks and creating an international community intolerant of violent extremism like its 2003 edition calls for utilization of all elements of us power to combat international terrorism diplomatic economic law enforcement financial intelligence military and information dissemination it also reiterates the importan ce of preemptive action against terrorist groups and their sponsors in conjunction with measures which seek to deny sanctuary funding and arms to terroristshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34230crs3 10 note that the term rogue states is not fined although rogue is implied in terms of nations support for terrorism or inclination theretohowever the 2006 strategy differs from the 2003 version primarily in that it sets different priorities for the strategic elements designed to achieve those ultimate goals perhaps the most significant of these differences is major increase in emphasis in the 2006 document on democra tization as method of combating terrorism additionally the 2006 strate gy places greater emphasis on denying terrorists sanctuary in underd eveloped failed and rogue states the use of economic and political tools to strengthen nations vulnerable to the spread of terrorist influence appears to receive less emphasis in th 2006 strategy than in the 2003 version strategy components the 2006 strategy is broadly divided into shortterm and longterm objectives the shortterm objectives address the immediate problem of violent extremism whereas the longterm objectives concern the eradication of terrorism in the future shortterm objectives the strategys shortterm objectives include 1 preventing attacks by terrorist networks 2 denying weapons of mass destruction wmd to terrorists and rogue states 3 denying terrorists the support and sanctuary of rogue states and 4 denying terrorists control of any nation preventing attacks by terrorist networks important to this objective are sustained relentless often preem ptive attacks on the personnel and infrastructures of terrorist networks emphasis is placed on attacking and targeting leaders in the hopes of weakening the cohesiveness strategic guidan ce and morale of terrorist groups targeting the foot soldiers of terrorist groups by law enforcement and military means disrupting the recruitment of foot soldiers by terrorist organizations targeting the communications centers and propaganda operations of terrorist groups disrupting the flow of funding and w eapons to terrorist organizations denying wmd to terrorists and rogue states10 this component of the strategy seeks to deny terrorists wmd and wmdrelated material it includes elements of both prevention and response i enhancing us ability to determinehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34230crs4 terrorist intentions and capabilities rega rding wmd as well as us ability to prevent and respond to wmd attack should such an attack take place denying terrorists the support nd sanctuary of rogue states this component of the strategy places emphasis on discouraging state sponsorship of terrorism through imposing economic and political sanctions on states that support harbor or fund groups th at use terrorism as tactic denying terrorists control of any nation this component of the strategy seeks reduction and eventual elimination of safe havens overseas by combining military assistance and nation bu ilding to suppor t governments that are effectively unable to combat terrorist activity on their own support is envisioned in the form of measures to f acilitate economic deve lopment foster creation or extension of the rule of law and strengthen law enforcement included in the concept of terrorist safe havens are phy sical and legal extraditionpr oof safe havens cyber safe havens and financ ial safe havens longterm objectives the longterm objectives of the strategy include 1 winning the war of ideas by advancing effective democracy 2 promoting international coalitions and partnerships and 3 enhancing governme nt counterterrorism infrastructure and capabilities winning the war of ideas by advancing effective democracy important here is the promotion and suppor t of democracies that not only hold free elections but also uphold democratic rights such as freedom of religion conscience speech assembly association nd the press the assumption is that establishing and strengthening democratic institutions principles and practices will in turn reduce the four major causes of the spread of terrorist ideology outlined by the strategy political alienation grievances and perceived injustices that can be blamed on others subcultures of conspiracy and misinformation and an ideology that justifies murder promoting international coa litions and partnerships the strategy calls for assisting allies in their efforts to strengthen their c ounterterrorism capabilities so these can be used more effectively to combat terror recognizing the need for broad based intern ational cooperation in fightin g the war on terror is key enhancing government count erterror infrastructure and capabilities this component of the strategy emphasizes strengthening and restructuring us government mechanisms to promote interagency collaboration and to formulate clear national priorities also key is developing community of counterterrorism experts with enhanced knowledge and capabilitie s to address more comprehensively the growing problems of terrorism and violent extremismhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34230crs5 issues for congress overview the 2006 national strategy raises numbe r of challenging issues for congress these include 1 effectiveness of democra tization as counterterrorism strategy 2 the underlying factors fueling the spread of terrorism and the motives of terrorists 3 implications of the war in iraq fo r us counterterrorism strategy 4 effectiveness of the policy of us nonenga gement with states that support or harbor terrorists ie rogue states as well as lect terrorist groups 5 alignment of the strategy with recent national intelligen ce estimates 6 mitigation of extremist indoctrination of the young disenfranchi sed and economically marginal and 7 efficacy of public diplomacy important as well but difficult to ascertain is the degree to which current funding follows the priorities of the 2003 st rategy in contrast to those of the 2006 document the focus of the strategy is primarily the terrorist threat from radical islam however there may be potential threats from groups or individuals aligned with other extremist causes or ideologies so wonder whether the emphasis on single front in the war on terror might leave the c ountry vulnerable to surprise attacks from groups that have been overlooked there is tacit presumption in the strategy and its goals that meaningful data exist on which to base and implement po licy decisions these data might include results on issues relating to terrorism fro m attitude surveys in various populations interrogations or profiles of known terrorists demographi c and socioeconomic trend analyses risk analyses costbenefit and funding studies and other sources the nature and extent of data actually available the interpretation and implications of this data and the degree to which the strate gy reflects the data are open questions another unresolved question is the need if any for periodic if not ongoing review of strategy components and for appropriate instituti onal mechanisms and resources to implement such review the issue of coordinating strategy with key allies may warrant examination by congress as well to what degree was such coordination accomplished to what degr ee were allies on whose support the united states relies in combating international terrorism simply presented with fait accompli what are the overall pros and s of advance coordi nation of strategy and its formulation with im portant counterterror allies the strategy does not include discussi on and contingency plan for scenario in which one does not win in such s cenario one might choose to opt to measure victory or progress in terms of accep table losses rather than triumph few would contend that there has been complete triumph in the war on drugs or the war on crime for example despite decades of effort and countle ss billions of dollars spent it is therefore possible perhaps even likely that the war on terror may have similar longterm outcome stalemate whether ag ainst decentralized well funded terrorist adversaries with formidable resources and weaponry or against isolated cells of homegrown extremistshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34230crs6 11 see crs report rl33160 combating terrorism the challenge of measuring effectiveness by raphael f perl march 12 2007 12 see for example imperial hubris why the west is losing the war on terror by michael scheuer brasseys 2004 309 pmore than six years after the terrorist attacks of 911 there are few agreedupon criteria for measuring the success or failure of us strategy for combating terrorism therefore while the strategy can be anal yzed discussed and cr itiqued its results and effectiveness are difficult to evaluate reliably11 democratization as counterterrorism strategy the 2006 national strategy bases much of its longterm approach on the premise that effective democracy combats the conditions and circumstances that legitimize and spread terrorism indeed the strategy asserts that the longterm solution for winning the war on terror is the advancement of human freedom and human dignity through effective democracy according to the strategy democratic institutions that support human rights count er the four factors identified as major contributors to the rise of terrorism 1 political alienation 2 grievances and perceived injus tices that can be blamed on others 3 subcultures of conspi racy and misinformation 4 an ideology that justifies murder some however see efforts to promote mocracy as sign of unrestrained us imperialsim which can contribute to the spread of terrorism12 in this camp are also those who suggest that western democracies are increasingly becoming morally bankrupt societies where materialism nd moneyworship reign where drug use pornography and violent crime are widespread and where the traditional family and traditional values are disintegrating with little substance to replace them in this regard the 2006 strategy appear s to make major assumption that the 2003 strategy does not namely th at democratization is in nd of itself an effective means of combating terrorism in the long term however the 2006 strategy is silent on when and how democracy promotion shoul d be implemented visavis the various other counterterrorism t actics and objectives both long and shortterm the 2006 strategy implies that effec tively implementing democracy in community promotes conditions that deter terrorist recruitment and activity in contrast the 2003 strategy suggests the c onverse that by combating terrorism in conjunction with stabilizing areas vulnerabl to terrorist recruitment effective democracy could eventually come into existence there is heavy emphasis in the 2006 stra tegy on democratization as means of countering terrorism viewed in the c ontext of the mixed success of fledgling democracies in iraq and afghanistan and the persistence of autocratic regimes amonghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34230crs7 13 francis fukuyama and michael mcfaul should democracy be pr omoted or demoted the stanley foundation june 2007 14 see crs report rl33555 trends in terrorism 2006 by raphael perlus allies in the middle east the credibility and effectiveness of this strategic thrust may merit scrutiny supporters of democr atization as pillar of us counterterrorism policy argue that the history of the past century is replete with examples demonstrating that advancing effective democracy and human rights over the longterm contributes to the legitimacy and stability of government s and to the economic prosperity of nations they see implementing democracy as tool of us foreign policy as an effective deterrent to violent internal antisystemic activities including terrorism13 in effect they suggest that where effective democracy is achieved higher degrees ofpolitical stability and economic prosperity evolve and terro rism if it emerges at all is shortlived or marginalized proponents of the 2006 strategy contend that spreading democracy is important to the longterm stability of the middle east and south asia they assert that promoting democracy in iraq and afghanista n is an important aspect of creating democratic environment th roughout the region which could reduce the threat of terrorism in the longterm skeptics caution that there is often tradeoff between the idealistic goals of democratization and us security in terests democra tization under certain circumstances may actually undermine us security interests and exacerbate the terrorism problem recent experience in the middle east and south asia has shown that democratic elections can bring to power governments that show little interest in the principles and practices of liberal democracy possess insufficient power or legitimacy to counter or prevent terrori sm within their borders support or condone terrorist activity within or beyond their bor ders andor are hostile to us national interests as examples they cite iraqi shiites voting in 2005 elections for an iranian style islamic republic in areas under their control terrorlinked organizations winning democratic elections in the middle east eg hamas in gaza and hizbollah in lebanon and popular election of radical islamic government the election of pakistani president musharraf is cited as well also at issue is the question of whether democracy in and of itself can stabilize nation given the troubling growth in num bers and influence of radical groups in some democratic countries skeptics argue that the burgeoning popularity of extremist and terrorlinked groups such as the mujaheddin council in indonesia the party islam in malaysia the islamic courts union in somalia hizballah in lebanon and the democratically elected hamas party in gaza would seem to indicate that democracy per does not entirely dissuade or disc ourage the ideology of terrorism the rise of these parties in democratic societies presents major foreign policy dilemma for the united states since it p its us support for democracy directly against us commitment to combat terrorism aggressively 14 given these examples

democratically elected governments that are less supportive of the war on terrorism than those they replace if not actively hostile to us security interests in the region others argue that making democratiz ation pillar of us counterterrorism strategy while pursuing regime change only selectively in the region aggressively pursued with respect to syria and iran not so with saudi arabia egypt jordan or morocco generates cynicism and distrust throughout the region and the world regarding us motives this in tur n may undermine support for democratization efforts if not directly provoke increased support for terrorist activity in nations such as iraq afghanistan or other states tenuously allied with the united states moreover emphasis on democra tization in afghanistan and iraq some suggest may reflect tendency to undere stimate the many political and cultural barriers to effective democracy in these countries diverting resources from other critical elements of long term stabilization effort such as economic development those who question the efficacy of demo cratization as means of countering terrorism in iraq and afghanistan point out that the democratic governments that were hastily erected in these countries to replace the regimes ousted by the united states and its allies remain only margina lly effective they note that sectarian conflict and terrorist activities in iraq continue to limit severely the effectiveness of the central government15 and that in afghanistan the power of the elected government does not extend much beyond th capital city in both countries the democratic governments appear to exert effective influence over limited portion of their territories and populations while th rest remain heavily influenced by insurgents and more traditional forms of tribal or sectarian leadership validity of strategy perceptions about terrorism the 2006 strategy predicates many of its objectives on set of perceptions about terrorism and terrorists that some w ould argue is incomplete if not flawed emphasizing the need to win the longterm war of ideas the 2006 strategy for example argues explicitly that the terrorism we confront today springs primarily from four factors political alienation grievances and perceived injustices that can be blamed on others subcultures of conspiracy and misinformation and an ideology that justifies murder the first three factors clearly have been exploited by terrorists in many different countries and contexts in their efforts to advance various social political or religious objectives the 2006

httpwwwstategovdocumentsorganization87427pdf 17 2006 national strategy for combating terrorism p 6activity an ideology that justifies murder16 offers perspective on terrorist motives and objectives that some observers consid er simplistic and inaccu rately villifying of islam however others contend that actively confronting terrorist ideology and radical religious doctrine is long overdue delayed by political correctness while acknowledging that the transnational movement of terrorist organizations networks and individuals is not monolith ic the 2006 strategy observes that the movement is united by an ideology of oppression violence and hate and the shared pursuit of world vision darkened by fear and oppressi on skeptics argue that this portrayal of transnational terrorism mischaracterizes and thereby obscures other different goals and motives of terrori sts along with their motivational appeal which the united states seeks to counter they contend that terrorists rally their supporters around specific social religious or political agendas urging retaliation for real or perceived injustices not around world vision of hate fear and oppression critics also argue that the strategys portrayal of terrorist motives and objectives is overly simplistic and unid imensional perhaps intended to draw clear battle lines in the war of ideas erodes us credibility and diverts attention away from specific terrorist grievances and objectives that might be addressed or resolved through diplomacy negotiations or other nonviolen t means on the other hand as high level policy document the strategy must simplify certain complex topics in the interests of brevity more detailed treatme nt may appear in other reports or plans the 2006 strategy also invites questi ons about the interpretation of the underlying causes of terrorism by explic itly downplaying the importance of number of factors that many view as major contributors to the recent spread of terrorist ideology and activity 1 us policy in iraq 2 us efforts to prevent terrorist attacks 3 poverty 4 israeliarab issues impact of us policy in iraq the strategy states prominently that terrorism is not simply result of hostility to us policy in iraq17 however many would argue that us policy in iraq has become major focal point of terrorist activity and related rhetoric and has perhaps even become cause celebre for terrorist recruitment the iraq study group report of 2006 states the challenges in iraq are complex viol ence is increasing in scope and lethality it is fed by sunni arab insurgency shiite militias

polarized18 impact of us efforts to prevent terrorist attacks many argue that us counterterrorism efforts in the ddle east and south asia primarily us military involvement in iraq and afghanista n as well as what many consider us political favoritism towards regimes in arab countries such as saudi arabia and egypt plus policies avoiding active engage ment of nations such as iran and syria have been important factors fueling the spread of global jiha d critics of the 2006 strategy argue that failure to recogniz the full impact of this phenomenon limits the strategys effectiveness others however see recognizing such factors as given which is inherently incorporated into the strategy and its component parts perception of poverty issues the strategy downplays poverty as contributing factor to terrorism citing the fact that the 911 hijackers were from the middle class while acknowledging that the leaders of major terrorist groups and their frontline operatives in advanced i ndustrialized nations come mostly from more educated middle class skeptics poi nt out that impoverished commun ities with islamic backgrounds in iraq the west bank gaza and other parts of the middle east and south asia have proven to be fertile spawning gr ounds of terrorist activity recruitment and support we llfunded terrorist organiza tions often provide social services that host governments do not winni ng popular approval moreover the level of corruption in such terrorist charitable endeavors is widely perceived to be minimal perception of importance of arabisraeli peace settlement critics suggest that the strategy fails to addre ss the importance of peaceful settlement to the arabisraeli conflict as an overall tool to reducing terro rism in support of their linkage of progress against terrorism to arabisraeli peace they note that the iraq study group report of 2006 states the united states will not be able to achieve its goals in the middle east unless the united states deals directly with the arabisraeli conflict19 others however while recognizing that the arabisraeli conflict is important to consider emphasize that the multifacated c onflict is only one of many issues that terrorists seek to exploit and suggest that should aspects of the arabisraeli conflict be peacefully resolved terrorists will s imply move on to other causes celebreshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34230crs11 20 httpwwwglobalsecurityorgintelllibraryreports2006nie_globalterror trends_apr2006htmadequacy of strategys treatment of situation in iraq skeptics argue that major shortcoming of the strategy is its failure to address adequately the importance of the ongoing conflict in iraq according to the 2006 national counter terrorism center nctc data on incidents of terrorism approximately 45 of all terrorist attacks worldwide occurred in iraq resulting in almost 65 of global terrorismrelated fa talities the same data show that the number of acts of terrorism in iraq n early doubled from 2005 to 2006 however it is often not fully clear whether such data reflect terrorist incidents that could be considered the product of casualties of civil war moreover the april 2006 national inte lligence estimate nie trends in global terrorism implications for the ited states notes as one of its key judgments the iraq conflict has become the cause celebre for jihadists breeding deep resentment of us involvement in th muslim world and cultivating supporters for the global jihadist movement20 these data and judgments to the degree that one accepts them indicate that iraq is currently both major source of terrorists and terrorist activity and major global catalyst for the spread of violent extre mism however the 2006 strategy makes specific recommendations for us policy in iraq leaving many issues unaddressed for example what is the l ongterm strategy for continued troop presence in iraq is it to be increased or reduced and for what purpose what steps are being taken to address the perception of iraq as rallying point for terrorists what are the anticipated steps to be taken to strengthen the fledgling iraqi democracy iraq is increasingly perceived as both the current center of terrorist attacks worldwide and one of the most important negative elements in winning hearts and minds arguably necessitating some means of addressing these concerns directly it is widely believed that stable and democratic iraq would be an invaluable asset to us interests in the middle east however many believe that if iraqs disintegration into terrorism and sectarian violence conti nues americas standing and influence in the region will be further reduced and other nations may increasingly fall prey to radical islamist attempts at incitement and destab ilization the 2007 troop surge in iraq also has some impact on the current strategy the degree of success or failure of the us troop surge may serve as model for counterterror related policy in afghanistan and other areas such as southeast asia strategys effectiveness against rogue states and groups engaging rogue states it is difficult to determine if the 2006 strategy adequately addresses rogue states the strategy states the united states and its allies and partners in the war on terror make distinction between those whohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34230crs12 21 national strategy for combating terrorism 2006 p 15 22 considered by the state department to be the two most prominent state sponsors of terrorismcommit acts of terror and those who support and harbor terrorists21 accordingly the strategy recommends policy of isolating and sanctioning rogue states until they renounce terrorism and their support of terrorist groups in 2007 however diplomatic channels were used with syria and iran22 with the goal of acquiring their support in stabiliz ing iraq some view this approach as visionary arguing that isolation and sanctions appear to have had little effect on either governments willingness to sponsor terrorism and that cautious dialogue with these regimes may at least provide opportun ities to explore directions of potential mutual benefit however opponents of relaxing the policy of nonnegotiation with rogue states warn that such overtures will be seen as sign of weakness and will only serve to legitimize terrorism and its sponsor ship moreover concern exists as well that current leaders of nations such as iran simply might not be trusted to keep their word others maintain that the reopening of negotiations with rogue states will be ineffective without an overall adjustment on the part of the united states of its stance towards the regimes in question the united st ates has repeatedly stated desire for regime change in both syria and iran dding to these regimes mistrust of us motives and actions many contend that nearterm regime change in iran or syria is unlikely and that under current conditions th disintegration of either regime would have major destabilizing effects on the region as whole considering the effect destabilized iraq has already had on the region refugee flows crossborder ethnic tensions destabilization of another nearby nation could potentially threaten the stability of the region as whole iran and syria will not likely accede to us demands without incentives or inducemen ts so proponents of negotiation could perhaps consider what incentives the united states can offer to either nation without compromising the us overall interests in the region selective engagement of terrorist groups if there is merit in negotiating with state sponsors of terrorism under certain circumstances the question arises whether in select instances there may also be merit in negotiation with terrorist groups or individuals neith er hamas nor hizballah is itself nation however both are powerful entities with abunda nt political influence in th middle east to date the united states has yet to make substa ntive overtures to either group continuing to adhere to the policy of nonnegotiation with terrorist organizations however some argue that this policy should be reex amined in light of current circumstances complicating us policies supporting non engagement of such groups is the increasing role of many such groups in mocratic processes nd lack of consensus with allies as to the terrorist nature of some of these groups considering the significant and growing influence of such groups one might ask whether reluctance to engage them is effective policy or simply matter of principal at variance with realpolitik supporters of the curre nt policy of nonnegotiation argue that any relaxation of this policy will lend legitimacy to terrorism and thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34230crs13 23 knowledge of the culture and language of ones interlocutors during negotiations may enhance precision in understanding what if anything has actually been achieved for example the arabic word hodna or hudna which translates as truce armistice or ceasefire often connotes negotiated agreement which is breakable for literal translation see dictionary of modern written arabic by hans wehr fourth edition edited by milton cowan spoken language services inc ithaca nyorganizations that perpetra or otherwise support terro rist activities proponents of selective engagement on the other hand argu that the current policy of isolation leaves the united states with too few tools only sanctions and military options to combat terrorist activity effectively whereas cautious dialogue with selected terrorist organizations may yield opportun ities to redirect the political agendas of these organizations away from terrorist activity and towards nonviolent strategies for achieving their objectives factor of interest is whether other major governments are negotiating with these organizations which may put the united states at disadvantage politically if it refrains this underscores the importan ce of international cooperation on terrorism policy as is the case with state sponsors of terrorism the question of potential incentives arises visavis terrorist group that is what if any incentives can the united states offer to groups such as hama s and hizballah to f acilitate andor reduce their involvement and support of terrori sm without fundamentally compromising us goals and interests in the region given the stated commitment of both hamas and hizbollah to bring about the destruction of israel americas longstanding ally in the middle east this is indeed difficult challenge negotiations with rogue governments or terrorist groups bring different cultures methods goals and agendas from the various parties involved under such circumstances one party may seek compromise and resolution while another partys goal may be delay deceit publicity or other tactical advantage without the desire for peaceful resolution23 duplicity misdirection nd sabotage of the negotiation process itself can be the goals of recalc itrant party howeve r without negotiation at some level it is difficult to identify leadership structure and to establish criteria and objectives for each side increasingly the viewpoint is advanced th at too little has been done to determine the specific goals of various terrorist groups and to understand whether acceptable compromises are possible history shows that highly disparate positions can often be resolved moreover even if the perv asive terrorist doctrine of group is simply to destroy the west or impose another culture upon it by force knowing this early can help improve subsequent policy decisions or target selec tion if military force must be usedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34230crs14 24 declassified key judgments of the national intelligence estimate trends in global terrorism implications for the united states april 2006 25 2006 national strategy for combating terrorism p 9degree to which strategy addresses threats reflected in recent nie some suggest that there is disconnect between the 2006 national strategy and key judgments contained in the unclassified april 2006 and january and july 2007 national intelligence estimates they obser ve that in many cases the 2006 strategy does not address concerns or recommendations raised by nies and that in certain instances the 2006 strategy and the nie j udgments seemingly contradict each other for example the april 2006 nie states four underlying factors are fueling the spread of the jihadist movement 1 entrenched grievances such as corruption injustice and fear of western domination leading to anger humiliation and sense of powerlessness 2 the iraq jihad 3 the slow pace of real and sustained economic social and political reforms in many muslim majority nati ons and 4 pervasive antius sentiment among most muslims all of which jihadists exploit24 in the 2006 strategys declaration of four factors contributing to the spread of terrorist ideology only one is shared with the nie that entrenched grievances are significant contributing factor however the strategy does not specifically flag the importance of stag nant econom ic cond itions or the need for social and political reforms and does not address the pervas ive antius sentiment in many muslim countries the strategy also seemingly does not give full import to the degree to which conditions and events in iraq are contributing factor in spreading terrorism an issue strongly emphasized in the april 2006 nie the strategy states terrorism is not simply result of hostility to us policy in iraq the united states was attacked on september 11 and many years earlier well before we toppled the saddam hussein regime25 in contrast the released key judgment s of the april 2006 nie immediately preceding the release of the 2006 strategy consider th situation in iraq one of the four most important catalysts for the spread of violent extremism mitigating terrorist indoctrination of the young indoctrination of the young over an ex tended period is seen by many as an effective means of solidly inculcating ex tremist attitudes and pr edispositions thereby influencing decisions made in later life c oncerning terrorist recruitment or support of terrorist causes hence an increasing cause for concern which may merit consideration in the strategy is the growin g indoctrination of the young into extremist ideology the us experience with segregation and also with the cold war would

of government comes in large part from the childhood educational environment some suggest therefore that it is important to focus more attention on mitigating extremism in educational systems in situations where negative attitudes and values are deeply entrenched reducing bigotry and hatred may take significant transformation in the educational curriculum and generation or more to achieve desired results however if this process is not initiated it may be more difficult perhaps impossible to achieve relate d goals such as democratization26 most experts tend to agree that benign neglect has not been viable approach to the threat of terrorism or indoctrin ation for terrorism for decades the united states avoided confrontation over the increasing number of islamic schools madrasas and mosques espousing radical islamist ideology funded largely by vast oil wealth and the mandatory charitable contributions of faithful muslims similarly the international community has failed to resolve the problem of palestinian refugees living in camps for over three generations these delays ve provided enormous opportunities and some would say compelling justification for extremists to expand their influence increasingly analysts view terrorism as process once it gains foothold it can become selfperpetuating with vested interests funding sources micro economy recruitment training social out reach and the means to expand thus process of terrorism that could potentially have been dislodged at an earlier stage with relative ease often becomes increasingl robust if left unc hecked particularly with respect to indoctrination of the young efficacy of public diplomacy the strategy addresses winning the war of ideas through democratization however other elements of public diplomacy do not receive equally high priority in the strategy27 some might assert that this prioritization is appropriate b ecause it may be an ineffective use of resources to attempt to persuade indoctrinated populations to change their views when such resources would be better directed towards other areas such as economic transformation however many would disagree pointing to the popularity of jazeera and other dia organizations as confirmation of the importance of appropriately tailored broadcasts and repetition of viewpoints to target audienceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34230crs16 28 as part of pl

the department of state on october 1 1999 28 public diplomacy has had to compete against variety of other department of state interests for funding and management support some therefore feel that the consolidation was illadvised and reduced the efficacy of our public diplomacy while others applaud the savings resulting from merged administrative functions and the closer coordination of policy29 conclusion reasonable minds can differ on the approaches to countering terror including the role for democratization in counterte rrorism strategy and how to effectively deal with rogue states however central question remains to what degree does the strategys approach adequately characterize and respond to the terrorist threat and the current forces driving it congress may wish to further examine this issue to determine whether possible adjustments to the strategy its funding and its implementation are warranted
