credit union was of cooperative organization formed for the purpose of promoting thrift among its members and providing them with source of lowcost credit during the last couple of decades technology competition and economic conditions have brought many changes to the financial services marketplace that have affected all types of depository financial institutions the credit union industry has evolved with marketplace changes so that many of the financial services credit unions provide are similar to those offered by banks and savings associations credit unions nevertheless remain distinguishable because of their cooperative framework and unique charter requirements credit unions are nonprofit member owned financial institutions and are subject to specific restrictions not placed on other depository financial institutions credit union charters are granted by federal or state governments on the basis of common bond this requirement determines the field of membership and is unique among depository financial institutions there are three types of charters 1 single common bond occupation or association based 2 multiple common bond more than one group each having common bond of occupation or association and 3 communitybased geographically defined common bond individual credit unions are owned by their mbership the members of credit union elect board of directors from their institutions membership one member one vote members savings are referred to as shares and earn dividends instead of interest credit union loan and investment powers are more restricted than thos of commercial banks credit unions can only make loans to their members to other credit unions and to credit union organizations the investment authority of federal credit unions is limited by statute to loans government securities deposits in other financial institutions and certain other limited investments given that credit unions are considered financial cooperatives the institutions are exempt from federal income tax individual members are taxed on their dividends since 2001 both the banking and the credit union industries have worked with congress to develop legislative proposals that would reduce existing regulatory requirements and the burdens compliance enforcement places on depository financial institutions during the 109 th congress legislation was enacted pl 109351 120 stat 1966 that provided some of the changes sought the statute reduced regulatory requirements for all types of depository financial institutions both the banking and credit union industries remain interested in the regulatory relief provisions excluded from the law1 in the 110th congress the current measure providing regu latory relief and reform for credit unions is the credit union regulatory improvements act hr 1537 and s 2957 the stated intent of this legislation is to modernize the prompt corrective action system for credit unions make adjustments to their loan authority enhance the ability of credit unions to serve financially underserved areas and ease credit union regulatory burdens credit union advocates suggest that the legislation would ensure the financial strength of credit unions enhance the services provided to credit union members and address the growing costs of regulatory compliance banking 1 for additional information on regulatory relief in the 110th

to the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs on march 6 2008 the house committee on financial services held hearing on the need for credit union regulatory relief to examine the related issues the following is an overview of the three titles of curia g22g146g157g149g142g561g11g497g561g5g138g153g146g157g138g149g561g20g142g143g152g155g150g561 this section would change credit union capital requirements by redefining the net worth ratio to include riskbased asset approach for the pr ompt corrective action pca requirements for federally insured credit unions the requirements are enforced by the national credit union administration the federal regulator for credit unions and the reforms address recommendations of the federal regulator the objective of pca is to minimize the probability of credit union insolvency through early intervention by th federal regulator the new pca framework establishes net worth ratio that requires progressively more stringent mandatory and discretionary regulatory actions for credit unions with low or declining capital or net worth levels significant part of credit unions net worth is its retained earnings balance credit unions use retained earnings as their only source for meeting capital requirements unlike banks which can raise capital in many different ways including subordinating debt the proposed legislation would require all credit unions to meet riskbased net worth requirement riskbased requirements would be designed to be comparable to capital standards required of institutions insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation in addition curia would make adjustments to required actions for an undercapitalized credit union including the implementation of net worth restoration plan

would expand the scope for credit unions to serve financially underserved areas under current law credit unions can make loans only to their members to other credit unions and to credit union organizations currently the aggregate limit on credit unions net member business loan balances is the lesser of 175 times the credit unions net worth or 1225 of the credit unions total assets curia would replace this limitation with flat rate of 20 of the total assets of credit union in addition the legislation would ex clude from the member business loan limit loans or loan participations to nonprofit religious organizations the definition of member business 2 for discussion of this issue please see crs report 97548 should credit unions be taxed by james m bickley

definition to exclude loans of up to 100000 or less curia would permit federal credit unions of all charter types to expand credit union services to eligible communities that meet the income unemplo yment and other distress criteria identified by the us treasury department or that qualify as low income areas under the new markets tax credit targeting formula currently only credit unions with multiplegroup common bond charters can add underserved areas to their field of membership provisions of this title would also arguably enhance the ability of credit unions to assist the economic revitalization efforts of distressed communities it would give credit union operating in an underserved community more flexibility in regards to the leasing of sp ace in building or property in which the credit union maintains physical presence credit union would also be permitted to acquire construct or refurbish building in an underserved community and then lease out excess space in that building g22g146g157g149g142g561g11g11g11g497g561g20g142g144g158g149g138g157g152g155g162g561g15g152g141g142g155g151g146g163g138g157g146g152g151g561

the investment authority of federal credit unions is limited by statute to loans government securities deposits in other financial institutions and certain other limited investments some believe this restriction places federal credit unions at competitive disadvantage with state chartered credit unions and other depository financial institutions this provision would permit federal credit union to purchase for its own account certain investment securities of defined investment grade the total amount of the invest ment securities of any one obligor or maker could not exceed 10 of an institutions ne t worth the aggregate amount of investment securities could not exceed 10 of the assets of the credit union

federal credit unions are authorized to make loans to members other credit unions and to credit union organizations prior to pl 109351 loans were restricted to statutory 12year maturity limit with few
