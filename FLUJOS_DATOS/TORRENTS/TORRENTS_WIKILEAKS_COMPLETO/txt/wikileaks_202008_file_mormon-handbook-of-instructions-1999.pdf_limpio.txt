refer unre solved proc edural questions to the office of the first presidency questions about decisions local presiding offi cers should not expect general authorities to tell them how to decide difficult matters decisions on churc h discipline are within the discretion and authority of l ocal presiding offi cers as they pra yerfully seek gui dance from the lord page 102 first presidency authority the first presidency has ultimate authority ove r all churc h discipline decisions of the first presidency take precedence despite any rul or proc edures to the contrary considerations in church discipline the following pa ragraphs list some of the factors that leaders may need to consider in reaching decisions on form and inform churc h discipline these factors are listed in orde r from those that sugge st stem discipline to those that sugge st more lenient discipline none of these factors dictates any pa rticular decision t hey are only aids to decision that must be purs ued prayerfully and gui ded by t he spirit of the lord violation of c ovenants if transgressor s been endow ed he has made covenants to live higher standard of be havior than applies to those who ve not been endow ed violating these covenants magnifies the seriousness of the transgression t herefore endow ed persons who commit adultery or forni cation including hom osexual relations are subject to stern churc h discipline adultery is more serious sexual transgression than forni cation be cause adultery involves violation of m arriage covenants position of tr ust or authority if transgressor oc cupied position of t rust or authority such as parent bishop or t eacher that was violated by t he transgression the seriousness of the transgression is magnified for example incest is most serious form of sexual transgression for parent because it violates the sacred trust of pa rental authority embezzlement is most serious form of theft because the transgressor s been trusted with funds it is particularly serious offense when it involves churc h funds see also serious transgression w hile holding prominent churc h position page 96 repetition if transgression that was previously confessed and seemingly fors aken is repeated the repetition m ay be viewed as part of pattern of c onduc t even though t he earlier transgression has been resolved with churc h authorities as the lord w arned those he had forgi ven g your ways and m ore but unto that soul who sinneth shall the form er sins return d c 82 7 magnitude the seriousness of transgression is measured in part by the num ber of s inful acts and the number of pe rsons injured the num ber of pe rsons who are aware of the transgression also affects its seriousness age maturity and experience presiding offi cers should consider transgressors age maturity and experience when administering churc h discipline the lord re vealed f or of hi m unto whom much is given much is required and he who sins against the greater light shall receive the greater conde mnation d c 82 3 leniency is often appropri ate for t hose who are immature in the gospel leniency may also be appropri ate for young m embers who are involved in moral transgression if they fors ake the and m anifest sincere repentance however young m embers who pe rsist in immoral conduc t may require form disciplinary action interests of th innocent when administering and announc ing di scipline presiding offi cers should consider the interests of innoc ent victims and the transgressors innoc ent family members time between transgression and confession if transgression oc curred many ye ars before it was confessed the presiding offi cer carefully considers the intervening circumstances if the was not repeated and the member has lived righteously in the interim his conduc t during the intervening time can show that he has forsaken the in t his instance confession m ay complete rather than start the proc ess of re pentance voluntary confe ssion voluntary and complete confession monstrates repentant attitude which may favor leniency an admission of gui lt after person s been accused of or i nterviewed about transgression is less indicative of re pentance person w ho admits guilt when interviewed by bishop s hows greater repentance than one who tries to deceive and admits guilt only when confront ed with evidence page 103 evidence of r epentance normally evidence of re pentance is the most important single factor in determining how to accomplish the first purpos of churc h discipline saving the soul of the transgressor g enuine repentance is demonstrated more reliably by ri ghteous actions over period of t ime than by intense sorrow during single interview judgm ents about the adequacy of re pentance require spiritual discernment factors to consider include the nature of the confession pth of s orrow for the success in fors aking the strength of fa ith in jesus chri st faithfulness in obe ying other commandments truthful communications to churc h offi cers restitution to injured persons obedience to legal requirements and w illingne ss to follow the direction of churc h authorities fellowshipping the bishops role as common judge does not end w hen member has been disciplined it continues until the person re turns to full fellowship and w hen necessary re ceives restoration of blessings disciplinary action should be the first step on t he way back to the full blessings of churc h membership churc h leaders and m embers should be anxious to help person w ho s been disciplined to repent so he can enjoy these blessings the bishop ove rsees these efforts the time just after person s been disciplined is difficult and critical for t he person and hi s family during this time priesthood l eaders and ot her churc h members should be patient and sensitive to the needs of those involved and should give special encouragement and assistance the bishop s hould interview the person fre quently and if necessary hi s spous the bishop s ees that mature caring hom teachers and vi siting teachers are assigned to person who s been disfellowshipped or xcommunicated and to his immediate family members in some cases couples may be assigned home teachers and vi siting teachers should make regular contacts and see that the person hi s spous and ot her family members receive the couns and fellowship they need duri ng this critical period of nguish repentance and he aling if person w ho s been disciplined moves from the ward be fore he has returned to full fellowship and re ceived restoration of bl essings the bishop i nform s the persons new bishop of the discipline and w hat remains to bring the member back to full fellowship and bl essings the bishop m akes this
