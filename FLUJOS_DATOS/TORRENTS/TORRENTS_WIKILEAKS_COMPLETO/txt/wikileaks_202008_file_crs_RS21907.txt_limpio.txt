the minting of 50cent coins with the image of president kennedy the current image on the obverse side of the half dollar was of benjamin franklin the likeness of benjamin franklin had been on the coin since 1948 so the 25year requirement had not been met there was some debate in congress about httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21907 removing benjamin franklins image and whether more time should pass before

currently four bills would redesign circulating currency and coin to incorporate the likeness of the late president the project is in favor of changing the 10 note which bears the portrait of alexander hamilton to date hearings have not been held on any of the bills the secretary of the treasury has the authority to make the proposed changes without federal legislation hr 3633 would provide for the minting of the dime coin with likeness of president reagan on the obverse side since the image of president roosevelt has been on the coin for more than 25 years the treasury department could make this change without legislation the legislation was introduced before president reagan died on november 21 2003 original support for the legislation cooled when it was reported that mrs reagan was not in favor of replacing president roosevelt on the dime in addition concurrent resolution hconres 343 to preserve president roosevelts image on the dime was also introduced on november 21 2003 interest in the reagan dime was renewed with the death of the 40th president legislation hr 4525 to redesign the half dollar by placing the image of president reagan on the obverse side was introduced on june 8 2004 the treasury could also httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21907 make this change without legislation since the image of president kennedy has been on the coin for more than 25 years hr 4528 would redesign the 10 note changing the face of the bill by replacing the portrait of alexander hamilton with the image of president reagan alexander hamilton lived from 1755 to 1804

treasury on june 14 2004 hr 4563 was introduced to change the face of the 20 note the bill would redesign the note by replacing the portrait of president andrew jackson with the image of president reagan president jackson was twoterm president first elected in 1828 he built political coalition that was the foundation of the subsequent democratic party several issues have been raised concerning the proposed legislation some characterized the legislation as premature replacing the images of democratic presidents on the dime half dollar or 20 note with the republican president reagan might invite partisan fight in addition because the portraits on the us currency have been consistent since the 1920s there is concern that reagan 10 or 20 note would cause confusion and be assumed to be counterfeit alternatives such as twodollar coin or commemorative coin have been suggested hr 4669 and s 2517 would provide for the minting of gold silver and bimetallic gold and platinum coins in commemoration of president reagan as collectors items
