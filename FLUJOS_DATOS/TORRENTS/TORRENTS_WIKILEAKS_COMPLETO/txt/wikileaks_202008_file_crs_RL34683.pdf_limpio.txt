assumed office on may 20 2008 taiwanprc talks have resumed for the first time since 1998 the first set of talks resulted in establishment of regular direct week end charter flights taiwan also has made other concessions such as lifting longstanding caps on taiwan investment in the prc and giving lower profile to taiwans bids for participation in specialized agencies opponents of the governments plans have said that president mas moves to improve crossstrait relations have been too rapid too unilateral and have compromised taiwans sovereignty and placed its economic security in jeopardy president ma also has sought to address any annoy ances in taiwanus relations arising from the former chen administration throughout his tenure from 20002008 president chen shuibian member of the democratic progressive party dpp pursued the position that taiwan already is an independent sovereign country this position was highly objectionable to beijing and problematic for many aspects of us policy which is based on vague onechina policy formulations termlimited chen was required to step down in may 2008 since then he has been fighting growing financial scandal that erupted during his presidency involving allegations of moneylaundering and corruption by his administration and members of his family in addition to its bid the taiwan government also is seeking to raise its

framework of the taiwan relations act pl 968 and shaped by three uschina communiques under these agreements the united states maintains its official relations with the prc while selling taiwan military weapons and having extensive economic political and security interests there but continuing transformations in both the prc and taiwan political systems mean us officials have continued to

time opened government positions to native taiwanesethe 85 of the islands population who predated the influx of the two million mainlanders fleeing civil war in china in the ensuing years members of the roc legislature on taiwan elected on mainland china over 40 years earlier were asked to retire and new streamlined legislature was elected in 1992 in 1996 taiwan held its first direct presidential election which was won by kmt leader lee tenghui himself native taiwanese during hi s presidency lee increasingly distanced himself from his partys longstanding position that there was only one china and that taiwan was part of it and instead began emphasizing taiwans separate culture and identity apart from chinas this posed complications for one of the fundamental tenets on which us relations with the prc were basedthe statement that the united states acknowledges that all chinese on either side of the taiwan strait maintain that there is but one china and that taiwan is part of china 2 2

march 18 2000 when dpp candidate chen shuibian won the presidency with only 39 of the popular vote in threeway race the victory was stunning defeat for the kmt and its unbroken 50year tenure in power on taiwan by the narrowest of margins president chen was elected to second and final term in march 2004 winning by only 29518 votes out of reported 1325 million votes cast3 the kmts fall from political dominance was compounded in two subsequent legislative elections in december 2001 and december 2004 by 2004 the struggling party saw its majority of 115 seats in the 225member legislative yuan ly cut to just 79 with neither the dpp nor the kmt having working majority each formed coalitions with smaller parties to gain strength as president chen shuibian presided over pangreen coalition composed of his dpp party and the taiwan solidarity union it was opposed by the panblue coalition of the kmt and the people fi rst party pfp which together retained the barest control of taiwans 225member legislature since the two opposing coalitions had very different political ideologies and roughly equal political strength this split government created significant gridlock in taiwans political arena and thus difficult political realities for us policymakers throughout chens tenure

back behind the kmt while the dpp struggling with growing political scandal and low voter confidence lost power in both presidential and legislative elections while many had expected victory on march 22 2008 for kmt presidential candidate ma yingjeou and his running mate vincent siew the size of the partys winning margin 22 million votes was surprise to most outside observers and even to some in the party itself4 emphasizing platform of economic improvement and better relations with the prc and the united states mr ma did respectably even in southern and rural districts heavily dominated by the dpp in the past his tickets wide margin of victory echoed similarly dramatic kmt victory in the january 2008 legislative elections where the party gained majority of 81 seats in the new 113seat body compared to the dpps 27 seats5 when ma assumed office on may 20 2008 the kmt had regained solid control of the government the electoral fortunes of the dpps presidential ticketcandidate frank hsieh and his running mate tsengchangwere burdened by what was widely regarded as the poor performance of the dpp incumbent president chen shuibian particularly with respect to the economy by corruption scandals in the dpp and by chens increasing emphasis on controversial pro continued with the prc 3 in this campaign president chen and his vicepresident annette lu were both shot and slightly wounded just before the election kmt opponents who believed they were on the verge of victory called this the shooting incident with some suggesting it was staged to give the dpp slate an edge in the 2004 election 4 based on the authors conversations in taiwan on march 2324 2008 with both kmt party officials and with foreign observers 5 dpp candidates received 37 of the votes in the

opportunity to make critical adjustments in its policies after public dissatisfaction with its performance became clear in 2005 instead of becoming more moderate and moving to where the voters were according to this view the dpp had tried to move the voters to it strategy that did not serve it well in the 2008 elections6 taiwans new president ma yingjeou of the kmt has pursued more conciliatory approach toward the prc and has vowed to improve relations with the united states since his landslide election however mas popularity has fallen plagued among other things by tumbling stock markets and rising energy prices as well as by concerns over his crossstrait policies and by residual domestic political tensions in taiwan under taiwans new kmt government the united states will be faced with challenges familiar from past years these include decisions on new arms sales to taiwan the level of us relations with taiwan and the ma government and whether to pursue closer economic ties under the ma administration taiwanus relations also face new challengesnotably the implications for us interests of closer and more cordial ties between taiwan and the prc and what role if any

congress enacted amendments to the vwp which may provide for waiver of the nonimmigrant refusal rate with waiver taiwan may meet the requirements of the program although taiwan citizens would benefit from the facilitated travel that the us visa waiver program affords another key taiwan government motive is thought to be the international stature that taiwan would gain from being among the vwps

whether taiwan should apply for membership under the name taiwan this was high priority for president chen but both chens referendum and kmt alternative each failed to reach the threshold of 50 of the

force if necessary the referenda also had been problematic for the united states which had called chens proposal provocative analysts attributed the dpp losses in part to its failure to make the kind of political adjustments to public sentiment that the kmt had made in recent years instead of focusing on public perceptions of taiwans economic ills perception emphasized by the kmt and appealing to the selfinterests of the divided taiwan electorate analysts said the dpp instead decided to stay close to the proindependence interests of its core supporters raising tensions with both the prc and the united states in the process of doing so in the wake of effectively having been crushed in two electoral outings in 2008 the dpp now is fa cing period of reassessment and rebuilding as it

the kmt assumed solid control of the taiwan government in may 2008 the 2008 legislative elections were the first held under new electoral rules adopted in 2005 under an amendment to taiwans constitution the new rules halved the size of the legislature to 113 members from its former size of 225 and increased the term of office from three years to four the rules also instituted new singlemember district system employing two ballots for voters similar to systems used in germany and japan one to be cast for candidate and one to be cast for political party as demonstrated by the january 2008 electoral results the new system appears to favor larger wellorganized parties and to put smaller parties and fringe elements at disadvantage 52 frank hsieh himself cited the need for

subsequent statements and actions by bush administration officials continued to appear more supportive of taiwan than those of previous us administrations this support was in keeping with growing concern in congress in the late 1990s that the us policy framework to ward taiwan may be outdated and that taiwans selfdefense capabilities had eroded while those of its chief antagonist the prc had grown these conclusions were supported by series of congressionally mandated annual reports first issued by the pentagon in february 1999 assessing that the military balance in the taiwan strait was

officials that the bilateral atmosphere eroded significantly54 the bush administration came to balance criticisms of chinas military buildup oppo site taiwan with periodic warnings to the taiwan government that us support was not unconditional55 the chen administrations continued willingness to employ the provocative gesture heightened the concerns and sharpened the criticism of many us officials about its credibility and its commitments to the us government the uncharacteristically pointed language directed at taiwan in the state departments statements listed abovein the written

overt support for taiwans democracy and to put more pressure on beijing to lessen its hostility us officials were put in the position of continually seeking to rebalance the crossstrait relationship

responding to reporters question with we believe its important for the two to work towards peaceful resolution of the crossstrait issues 57 but while us policy favors improvements in taiwanprc relations it has been silent on what should be the speed depth and degree of crossstrait conciliation some observers worry that the kmt government may be overly responsive to economic imperatives and to pressures from influential taiwan business interests that have substantial economic investments in china they worry that the ma government could reach swift accommodation with beijing that may complicate us regional interests the implication for us interests is only one factor president ma will have to consider in pursuing his prc policy ma will be faced with multiple balancing acts he will have to improve crossstrait relationsand taiwans economic opportunities on the mainlandwhile not appearing overly eager to core dpp supporters who worry that he will sell out taiwans political interests in pursuit of closer mainland economic ties he also will have to strike balance between those in the electorate who favor unific ation with china those who argue for strong defense for

conciliatory taiwan government could damage the prcs credibility that it wishes to pursue peaceful and constructive solution for crossstrait ties any perceived prc reluctance also could serve to revitalize us and congressional opposition to the prcs taiwan policy opposition which has remained muted in recent years in part because of mutual usprc problems with former president chen observers suggest there are number of options now for beijing to make meaningful gesture toward taiwan that would not impinge on prc sovereignty claims beijings willingness to restart crossstrait talks on mutually acceptable basis was one such step others could include new willingness to entertain taiwans aspirations to be meaningful participant in the world health organization who halt to petulant posturing against taiwan in apec and other multilateral organizations or suspension of taiwanfocused military exercises and other military maneuvers in the strait among other acts unfortunately past
