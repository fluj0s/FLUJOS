n2 continuedendangered species list revisions summary of delisting and downlisting introduction central to the debate before congress over appr opriations for or reauthorization of the endangered species act is the question of whether the act actuall works different standards h ave been used to judge the failure and success opponents of the act contend that the has faile d while costing taxpayers billions of dollars citing the low number of recovered species removed from the list proponen ts assert that the has succeeded in preserving endangered an d threatened species and their habitats citing the significant number of listed specie s with stable or increasing populations or the low number of extinctions of liste d species further controversy arises from uncertainty over the definitions of the term s recovered an d extinct should species that may have been already extinct when listed under the be used to judge the acts effectiveness if species s declined to point that its very existence is in question should later determination that it is in fact extinc t be attributed as failure of the act should species removed from the list because of the discovery of additional populations be classified s recovered should species downlisted from endang ered to threatened due to stable or increasing populations count as recovered understanding the process an d reasons for removing particular species from the endangered species list or fo r reclassifying them from endangered to threaten ed will help to answer these questions and to inform the debate choosing criteria to evaluate the to determine whether the has been effective one must first choose standard of measure the primary goal of the is the recovery of species to levels where protection under the act is longer necessary if this is the standard f measure the act could be considered failure as of july 31 1997 only 11 species have been delisted due to recovery of the remai ning species that have been removed from the endangered and threatened lists seven have gone extinct and nine species have been delisted due to new or improved data some scientific studies have shown that most species are listed only after they are very depleted eg median popula tion of 999 animals for listed vertebrates 1075 invertebrates and 119 5 plants and recovery in the short term may be unrealistic2httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9832crs2 continued2 endang ered species analysis of the us endangered species list 19851991 conservation biology 71 8793 1993 bean michael j the evolution of national wildlife law new york ny praege r3 publishers 1983 p 319321 ibid p 3214therefor another standard of measure might be the number of species whos populations have stabilized or increased even if the species is not actually delisted using this standard the act could be considered moderate success since larg number of the 1676 listed species 41 according to one study have improved or stabilized twentytwo species originally listed as endangered have been downlisted to threatened status with two of these eventually being delisted altogether another standard of measure for the could be the number of species that have not gone extinct while extinction can be considered normal evolutionar process widely diverse methods suggest that current rates of extinction excee d baseline rates by 100 10000 times with only 7 of the 1676 listed species having gone extinct although 5 of these were later determined to have been extinct at the time of listing this standard cou ld be used to classify the as success species like the california condor and the red wolf might not exist today without protection on the other hand s charismatic species at risk may have gone extinct without notice in sum t hese three different standards would count the as failure modest success or success any participa nt in the debate could therefore find support for his or her interests by choosing an appropriate standard of measure creation of endangered species lists congress first authorized the creation of federal list of endangered species in the endangered species preservation act espa of 1966 as part of early efforts to halt or reverse the decline of wildlife species this act in part directed th secretary of the interior to publish the names of all species found to be threatened with extinction in the federal register fr the focus of this legislation was the protection of h abitat primarily through federal acquisition it did not restrict taking or trade in interstate commerce of listed wildlife species3 the endangered species conservation act esca of 1969 provided additional protections for declining species m ajor innovation was the authorization to create list of wildlife threatened with worldwide extinction and to strictly limit th importation of these species into the united states the esca also directed th e4 secretary of the interior and the secretary of state to seek binding internationa l convention on the conservation of endangered species the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild faun and flora ci tes the result of that congressional call was signed by 21 nations in 1973 and took effect in 1975 one of its major contributions to endangered specieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9832crs3 ibid p 3255 while the is the domestic legislation implementing many of the provisions of cites6 there is necessary connection between species listing on the appendices of cites an d listing under the section 318 of the defines the term take to mean harass harm pursue hunt shoot7 wound kill trap capture or collect or to attempt to engage in any such conduct section 36 of the defines the term endangered species to mean any species which8 is in danger of extinction throughout all or significant portion of its range other than species of the class insecta determ ined by the secretary to constitute pest whose protection under the provisions of this act would present an overwhelming and overriding risk to man section 319 of the defines the term threatened species to mean any species which9 is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or significant portion of its rangeprotection was the recognition of different levels of endangerment cites liste d5 species on one of three appe ndices appendix i listing the species most vulnerable to extinction appendix ii listing species less vulnerable or those species whose trade must be controlled to prevent endangerment and appendix iii containing species that could be listed unilaterally by countries wishing to prevent overexploitation f populations within their own boundaries this agreement was significant both i n6 substantively regulating international trade and in providing framework fo r domestic legislation congress passed the endangered sp ecies act in 1973 replacing both the espa and the esca in addition to further restrictions on taking and interstat e7 commerce the authorized the listing of endangere d and threatened wildlife8 9 and plants those species previously listed under the espa and the esca wer directly incorporated into the lists of endanger ed and threatened wildlife and plants under the found at 50 cfr 1711h and 1712h process for delisting or downlisting species the processes for delisting or downlisting species from the li sts of endangered and threatened wildlife and plants are the same as the processes for listing appendix the secr etary of the interior may initiate change in the status of listed species alter natively after receiving substantive petition for any change in listing status the secretary shall conduct review of the species status the determination to delist downlist or uplist species must be made solely on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data available 4b1a without reference t possible economic or other impacts 50 cfr 42411b fish and wildlife service fws regulations also state that at least once every five years the director shal l conduct review of each listed species to determine whether it should be remove d from the list delisted changed from endangered to threatened downlisted r changed from threatened to endangered uplisted 50 cfr 42421 species may be removed from the list only if the data substantiate that it is longer threatened or endangered for one or more of the following reasonshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9832crs4 first the secretary may declare species to be extinct if after sufficien t period of time individuals of listed species can be found throughout it s historical range or all individuals of captive populations have died second the secretary may determine that species is recovered if the bes t available scientific and commercial data indicate that it is longer threatened or endangered and longer requires the protections of the third the original data or the interpret ation of such data used to list species as endangered or threatened may have be in error this reason could include discovery of pre viously unknown populations or habitat or taxonomic revision of the listed species after species has bee n removed from the endangered or threatened list due to recovery or an error in the original data the fws will continue to monitor its status to insure that proper action has been taken emergency relisting may occur if these monitorin g efforts show that the species is again endangered or likely to becom endangered 50 cfr 42420 extinct species of the 1676 species on the lists of endangered and threatened wildlife an d plants as of nov ember 30 1997 seven have been delisted due to extinction four of these species the tecopa pupfish longjaw cisco blue pike and santa barbara song sparrow were protected under laws predating the and therefore were automaticall listed under the when it passed in 1973 they were apparentl already extinct by 1973 however tecopa pupfish the tecopa pupfish cyprinodon nevadensis was firs t described in 1948 from the outflow streams of the north and south tecopa ho t springs north of tecopa california in 1970 the declining tecopa pupfis h population was liste d on both the federal and california endangered species lists due to habitat alteration and introduct ions of exotic species primarily bluegill sunfish and mosquito fish by 1972 the species longer occurred where the species was first found surveys done in 1977 failed to locate any other populations in 1982 th fws determined the tecopa pupfish was extinct and removed it from the endangered species list 47 fr 2317 longjaw cisco the longjaw cisco coregonus alpenae was one of severa l species of deepwater whitefish that was an i mportant part of the smoked fish industry in the great l akes it was known to occur in lakes michigan huron and erie extensive overfishing and increased lake pollution led to population crash in th first half of the 20 century the cisco was further decimated by sea lampre yth predation and habitat degradation and has not been seen in lakes huron and eri since the 1950s the last collection in lak michigan was in 1967 at which time the species was listed as endangered under the espa in 1983 the fws declared th longjaw cisco extinct and took it off the endangered species list 48 fr 39942httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9832crs5 blue p ike the blue pike stizostedion vitreum glaucum was abundant in the commercial fishery of the great lakes it was historically found in lakes erie an d ontario and in the niagara river in 1915 population levels began cycle f extreme fluctuati on caused by overfishing leading to the eventual collapse in 1958 the fws listed the pike as endangered under the esca in 1970 suggesting tha t introgressive hybridization with walleye may have caused the final disappearance of the stock survey by the blue pike recovery team in 1977 found individuals in 1983 the fws declared the blu pike extinct and removed it from the endangered species list 48 fr 39942 santa barbara song sparrow the santa barbara song sparrow melospiza melodia graminea is subsp ecies of the song sparrow that was known to exist only on santa barbara island angeles county california santa barbara g sparrows have been seen s ince fire in 1959 destroyed most of the 640acre islands habitat in 1983 the fws determined that m m graminea was extinct and removed it from the endangered species list 48 fr 46336 sampsons pearly mussel sampsons pearly mussel epioblasma dysnomia sampsoni is freshwater bivalve mollusk that was historically found in parts of the wabash river in illinois and indiana and parts of the ohio river near cincinnati dam construction and siltation eliminated much of the gravel and sandbar habita t where the species was found the fws listed this mussel as endangered under the in 1976 41 fr 24064 status review initiated in 1981 determined that specimens had been collected in over 50 years despite repeated sampling within its range in 1 984 the fws concluded that sampsons pearly mussel was extinct and removed it from the endangered species list 49 fr 1057 amistad gambusia the amistad gambusia gambusia amistadensis was small fish known only to occur in goodenough spring val verde county texas tributary of the rio grande river this species was eliminated in the wild whe n construction of the amistad reservoir in 1 968 submerged goodenough spring under approximately 70 feet of water the fws listed the amis tad gambusia as endangered in 1980 at which time it occurred only in captivity 45 fr 28721 the two captive populations held by the university of texas and the dexter national fish hatchery in new mexico died or were eliminated through hybridization and predation the fws ruled the amistad gambusia extinct in 1987 and removed it from th endangered species list 52 fr 46083 dusky seaside sparrow the dusky seasid sparrow subspecies ammodramus maritimus nigrescens was small songbird that existed only on merritt island and the upper st johns river marshes of brevard county florida populations of th sparrow declined as its salt marsh habitat was converted to freshwater mosquito control impoundments or drained the use of ddt to control mosquitos was also suspected as contributing factor in the species decline dusky seaside sparrows were first list ed as endangered in 1967 under the espa 32 fr 4001 the last remaining wild birds all males were taken into captivity in 1979 and 1980 to begin captive breeding program the males were mated wit h females of closely related subspecies scotts seaside sparrow m peninsulae to try to preserve their genetic information the hybrid offspring were not protecte dhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9832crs6 under the and the breeding program proved unsuccessful the last male sparrow died on june 16 1987 and the hybrid offspring died by the summ er of 1989 in 1990 the fws declared the dusky seaside sparrow extinct and took it off the endangered species list 55 fr 51112 recovered species the goal of the is the recovery of listed species to popu lation levels where protection under the act is longer necessary species may be classified s recovered if its decline has be halted or reversed and threats minimized so that its survival in th wild is likely according to fws there are currently 11 species that have been delisted due to recovery see note on rydberg milkvetch brown pelican the brown pelican pelecanus occidentalis is large coastal bird with wingspan of nearly seven feet it feeds almost exclusively on fishe s captured by plunge diving in the early 1960s pelican populations suffered dramatic reductions as result of organochlorine pesticide poll ution the pesticide endrin was thought to kill many pelicans through direct toxic eff ects while the pesticide ddt led to eggshell thinning and reproductive failure the br own pelican was listed under the esca as an endangered species throughout its us and foreign ranges in 1970 35 fr 16047 and 35 fr 8495 in 1973 the environmental protection agency epa banned the use of ddt in the united states 37 fr 13369 and began to sharpl curtail the use of endrin since that time pelican populations in the eastern gulf and atlantic coastal regions have reached or exceeded their historical breeding levels in 1985 the fws removed the brown pelican from the endangered species list in alabama florida georgi south carolina north carolina and points northward along the atlantic coast 50 fr 4938 the brown pelican remains endangere d throughout the rem ainder of its range which includes mississippi louisiana texas california mexico central and south america and the west indies palau fantail flycatcher palau grounddove and palau owl the pala u islands are located east of the philippines in the south pacific they were formerly usadministered united nations trust territory and since 1994 have had n independent constitutional government world war ii fighting caused heavy damage to many of the islands and as result many popula tions of native species dramatically declined the palau fantail flycatcher rhipidura lepida palau grounddov gallicolumba canifrons and palau owl pyrroglaux podargina are three nativ bird species th at were virtually eliminated during the war these species were listed as endangere d under the esca in 1970 35 fr 8495 based on data from militar surveys done shortly after the us invasion of angaur and peleliu in 1944 since the end of world war ii the fantail flycatcher grounddove and owl have returned to near original abundances and are not faced with any foreseeable threats none of the sp ecies are sought as game species and the new constitution of palau bans the personal possession of firearms making it illegal to hunt with any type f gun based on this evidence the fws removed the p alau fantail flycatcher the palau grounddove and the palau owl from the endangered species list in 1985 50 fr

states it is one of only two species chinese alligator and american alligator of the genus alligator overharvesting due to commercial demand for alligator products led to significa nt population declines during the 1950s and 1960s in 1967 the fw s listed the alligator as an endangered species under the espa the lacey ac t amendmen ts of 1969 prohibited interstate commerce in illegally taken reptiles an d their parts and products the heavy penalties added under the of 1973 and the listing in appendix ii of the convention on international trad in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cites provided further protection against illegal taking populations have recovered and are now stable but disjunct and limited to areas of remaining suitable habitat within their former range in 1977 the fws downlisted the alligator from end angered to threatened in part of its range including florida and certain coastal areas of georgia south carolina louisiana and texas 42 fr 2071 in 1987 the fws downlisted the america n alligator throughout the remainder of its range to threatened due to similarity f appearance 52 fr 21059 this classification reflects complete recovery of the alligator but is intended to facilitate necessary protections for the american crocodile crocodylus acutus in the united states and fore ign countries and other endangered crocodilians in foreign countries whose products are difficult to distinguish fro m those of the american alligator any propos ed harvests under this classification must comply with the fwss special rule on american alligators 50 cfr 1742a and existing state statutes and regulations rydberg milkvetch the rydberg milkvetch astragal us perianus is small flowering plant that occurs in the mountain and plateau region of south central utah the fws listed the lkvetch as threatened in 1978 based on data showing that the plant was known to occur only in two locations bullion canyon piute county utah and mt dutton garfield county utah 43 fr 17914 beginning in 1983 the us forest service conducted extensive surveys as part of management pla n develop ed for the rydberg milkvetch the surveys resulted in the discovery of 1 1 additional populations with estimates of over 300000 plants based on this ne w information the fws delisted the rydberg milkvetch in september 1989 54 fr 37941 the fws s categorized this delisting as recovery in its published list f species removed from the endangered and threatened lists it should be noted however that the information published in the final rule delisting the rydberg milk vetch could also be interpreted as an error in the original data gray whale gray whales eschrichtius robustus are large marine mammals that can reach lengths of 50 feet they are bottom feeders whose main diet consists of small crustaceans called amphipods the eastern north pacific california population spends the summer feeding in the bering chukchi and beaufort seas after migrating along the western shore of north america gray whales spend th winter off of the coast of baja california where the young are born in shallo w lagoons httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9832crs8 commercial whaling significantly reduced gray whale population s with estimates of 4000 5000 whales remaining by the mid 1800s in 1947 the internationa l convention on the re gulation of whaling banned the commercial harvesting of gray whales although subsistence harvesting by aboriginal groups was allowed to continue since the ban the eastern population has recovered to nearly the estimated original level and is now neither in danger of extinction nor likely to become endangere d within the foreseeable future throughout all or significant portion of its range the fws concurred with the national marine fisheries services determination an d delisted the eastern north pacific california population of the gray whale in 1994 59 fr 31094 the western north pacific korea population remains listed s endangered gray whales continue to receive protection under the marine mammal protection act of 1972 16 usc 1361 arctic peregrine falcon the peregrine falcon is mediumsized brown r bluegray raptor t hat preys primarily on birds three subspecies of peregrines occur in north america arctic peregrine falcon falco peregrinus tundrius american peregrine falcon f p anatum and peales peregrine falcon f p pealei arctic peregrines nest in the tundra regions of alaska canada and greenland they ar highly migratory wintering mostly in latin america arctic peregrine falcon pop ulations declined in the 1950s and 1960s as result of contamination with organochlorine pesticides such as ddt these pesticides can accumu late to lethal levels in the fatty tissues of animals eating contaminated prey at lower concentrations the principal metabolite of ddt can disrupt eggshel l formation causing eggs break easily arctic peregrines were protected in 1970 under the esca and subsequentl covered in 1973 under the populations

mammals indigenous to australia marsupial populations i n australia began to decline with european settlement and the expansion of shee p ranching dramatic drop in kangaroo populations resulted from the development of commerc ial market in kangaroo hides and meat citing evidence of excessiv commercial utilization the fws listed the red kangaroo macropus rufus eastern gray kangaroo macropus giganteus and western gray kangaroo macropu s fuliginosus as threatened species in december 1974 and banned the commercia l importation of kangaroos their parts and products 39 fr 44990 the fws also asserted that australias regulatory control of hunting and trade were inadequate httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9832crs9 in april 1 981 the fws lifted the importation ban on the three threatene d kangaroo s after accepting the management programs of four australian states the fws determining th at managed taking would not be detrimental to the survival of the species and removed the red kangaroo eastern gray kangaroo and western gray kangaroo from the list of threatened wildlife in 1995 60 fr 12888 subspecies of eastern gray kangaroo m g tasmaniensis which occurs solely in tasmania retains its

subsequent reviews of the literature and available data could find evidence to support t his endangered status to the contrary scientists now classify l p punctata and l p andersoni as only one
