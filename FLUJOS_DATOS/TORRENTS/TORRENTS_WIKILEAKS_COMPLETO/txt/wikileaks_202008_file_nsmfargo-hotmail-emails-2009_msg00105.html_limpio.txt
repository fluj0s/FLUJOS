looking forward to this trip the following are the first two paragraphs of the speech i wrote for nationals but i can also use it for miluakee i would appreciate your critique i am also including the ending of the speech as well good afternoon i am private first class william herring nsm north dakota i have not come here today to deliver message of hate nor have i come here to preach to you doctrines of racism intolerance bigotry or prejudice i am here for much different purpose i have come here to make declaration of love love for my people who are dying and it is upon the very threshold of that racial annhilation that we now find ourselves hatred is not drives us hate is an empty philosophy that will consume and destoy those who allow themselves to be driven by such base emotion what motivates we in this movement what motivates all true white patriots is rare breed of love and passionate determination to do all this is necessary to preserve our folk from extinction it is an undeniable instinct that we can longer in good conscience allow ourselves to ignore i spoke of instinct it is what preserves and protects all living things where emotion or intellect often fail instinct is the great equalizer the final arbiter of survival the drive the instinct to survive is the foundational urge of every living creature from deer fleeing forest fire to men who endure years of physical and mental torture in prisoner of war camps and yet still emerge alive it is that same instinct that has driven we in the national socialist movement to adopt what you see as an extremist political position when in reality national socialism is really nothing more than man made political philosophy that adheres to natural law that is to say we are forced to secure the survival and prosperity of our people at any cost darwinism robed in politics if you will those are the opening paragraphs like i said i rattled this out in about 20 minutes so its far from perfect but i dont think anyone at the city hall is expecting the gettysburg addresslol i decided to end the speech on powerful note we in this movement do not condone espouse or promote violence or criminal acts of any kind that being said i would like to close if i may with an exerpt from speech given in september of 1983 it was the sunday evening meeting of the national alliance founded and run by dr william pierce the speaker was young man by the name of robert mathews like us bob recognized what was happening to his country and especially to his race bob struck back at those he viewed as the enemy of his people he resorted to tactics that we in the national socialist movement view as negative and nonproductive little more than year later robert mathews paid for his beliefs with his life burned alive in small cabin on whidbey island washington by federal agents while we do not necessarily condone how robert mathews conducted his fight with his enemies we recognize courage and honor when we see it and credit must be given where credit is due the following are the last words from one of robert mathews last public speeches ten hearts one beat 100 hearts one beat 10000 hearts one beat we are born to fight and to die and to continue the flow the flow of our people onward we will go onward to the stars high above the mud the mud of yellow black and brown so kinsman duty calls the future is now so stand up like men and drive the enemy into the sea stand up like men and swear sacred oath upon the green graves of our sires that you will reclaim what our forefathers discovered explored conquered settled built and died for stand up like and reclaim your soil look towards the stars and proclaim your destiny defeat never victory forever help yourself to free treats served up daily at
