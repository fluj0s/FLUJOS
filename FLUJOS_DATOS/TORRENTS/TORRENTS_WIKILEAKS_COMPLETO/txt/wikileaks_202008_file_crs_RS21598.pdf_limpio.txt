order code rs21598 updated december 27 2007 federal mandatory minimum sentencing statutes an abbreviated overview charles doyle senior specialist american law division summary federal mandatory minimum sentencing statutes mandatory minimums demand that execution or incarceration follow cr iminal conviction among other things they cover drug dealing murdering federal officials and using gun to commit federal crime they have been feature of federa l sentencing since the dawn of the republic they circumscribe judicial sentencing discreti on although they impose limitations upon prosecutorial discretion or upon the pres idents power to pardon they have been criticized as unthinkingly harsh and incompatible with rational sentencing guideline system yet they have also been embraced as hallmarks of truth in sentence and certain means of incapacitating the criminally dangerous the sentencing commission and others argue that mandatory minimums unde rmine the sentencing guidelines and introduce disparity into the federal senten cing scheme still others respond that introduction is necessary the guideline system already creates and tolerates considerable disparity mandatory minimums come in several varieties the notlessthan the flat sentence and piggyback versions in any form they are not per unconstitutional although in rare instances they might be so grossly disproportionate as to offend the eighth amendments cruel nd unusual punishments clause this is an abbreviated version of crs report rl32040 federal mandatory minimum sentencing statutes stripped of its citations footnotes and appendices types of mandatory minimums mandatory minimum statutes come in many stripes including some whose status might be disputed the most widely recognized are those that demand that offenders be senten ced to imprisonment for not less than designated term of imprisonment few members of this not less than category are less mandatory than others for example veral of the drugrelated mandatory minimums are subject to safety valve for small time first time offenders that may render their minimum penalties less than mandatory or at least less severe some of the other not lessthan statutes permit the court to sentence an offender to fine rather than to ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21598crs2 1 543 us 220 2005 booker left the guidelines in place and essentially intact but they continue to have large rather than co mmanding presence within the federal sentencing scheme see eg rita v united states 127 sct 2456 2007appellate courts may consider sentence within the accurately id entified guideline range reasonable gall v united states 128 us 586 2007sentencing courts must begin by determining the appropriate guideline range for the case at hand and then consider the ot her sentencing factors identified in 18 usc 3553a they may not consider sentence within the guideline range per reasonable nor one outside that range per unreasonable appellate courts are to review trial court sentences under deferential abuse of discretion standardmandatory term of imprisonment moreover prosecutors may negate the notlessthan statutory minimums for defendant they f eel has provided substantial assistance second generally recognized category of mandatory minimums consists of the flat or single sentence statutes the vast majority of which call for life imprisonment closely related are the capital punishment statutes th at require imposition of either the death penalty or imprisonment either for some term of years or for life the piggyback statutes make up third class the piggyback statutes are not themselves mandatory minimums but sentence offenders by reference to underlying statutes including those that impose mandatory minimums until the supreme court intervened in booker v united states to eliminate the binding effect of the sentencing guidelines1 the final and least obvious group was comprised of statutes whose violation resulted in the imposition of mandatory minimum term of imprisonment by operation of law or more precisely by operation of the sentencing reform act and the sentencing guidelines issued in its name after booker and the line of cases that followed the guide lines cannot fairly be characterized as source of mandatory minimum sentences althoug h they continue to tilt heavily towards incarceration mandatory minimums and the sentencing guidelines even though the guidelines work to reduce judicial sent encing discretion and might once have been characterized as creating host of new members of the species of mandatory minimums the notlessthan mandatory minimums have been criticized as incompatible with the federal sentencing guidelines perhaps most prominent among its critics has been the sentencing commission itself its report sketched the arguments traditionally offered in support of mandatory minimums retribution or just deserts perhaps the most commonlyvoiced goal of mandatory minimum penalties is the justness of long prison terms for particular serious offenses deterrence by requiring the imposition of substantial penalties for targeted offenses mandatory minimu ms are intended both to discourage the individual sentenced from further invol vement in crime and by example discourage other potential lawbreakers incapacitation especially of the serious offender mandating increased sentence sever ity aims to protect the public by incapacitating offenders disparity indeterminate sentencing systems permit substantial latitude in setting the sentence which in turn can mean that defendants convicted of the same offense are sent enced to widely disparate sentences inducement of cooperation because they provide specific lengthy sentences mandatory minimums encourage offenders to assist in the investigation of criminalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21598crs3 conduct by others in order to take advantage of the escape hatch 18 usc 3553e supplies to those who coope rate with authorities inducement of pleas prosecutors express the view that mandatory minimum sentences can be valuable tools in obtaining guilty pleas the report argued however that only 4 of the 60 mandatory minimu ms were regularly prosecuted mandatory minimums induce new sentencing disparities others contend the extent of earlier disparity was exaggerated nd that disparity under the guidelines continues due to plea bargaining 35 of the defe ndants who might have been charged and sentenced under mandatory minimums were not disparate application of mandatory minimu m sentences appears to be related to race some cr itics point to the crackpowdered cocaine sentencing distinction rather than its attendant mandatory minimums as the culprit mandatory minimums lack the capacity to consider the range of aggravating and mitigating circumstances that may attend the same offense and as consequence produce unwarranted sentencing uniformity these arguments would seem to be most persuasive in the case of flat sentence mandatory minimums in other instances the range between the mandatory minimum and the statutory maximum would seem to provide ample room for the type of distinctions just mentioned uneven application deprives mandatory minimums of their potential to deter proponents might suggest that incapac itation and the prospect of minimal punishment were always the pr incipal objectives deterren ce is at best challenging to judge the fact that not all possible cases receive mandatory minimum treatment is reason to abandon incapacitation for t hose that are ensnared and the result is one more properly laid to the door of pr osecutorial discretion than to mandatory minimums mandatory minimums breed disparity by transferring judicial discretion to the prosecution this presumes that unwarranted disparity existed before the guidelines that the guidelines have reduced or eliminated it and that mandatory minimums returned it to the system three propositi ons upon which there is consensus even if one accepts all three the question re mains whether disparity produced by plea agreements that make possible the convi ction of other wrongdoers is unwarranted or appropriately id to the door of mandatory minimums in contrast to the calibrated approach of the guidelines mandatory minimums create cliffs where minuscule factual di fferences can have enormous sentencing consequences critics might suggest that such cliffs are natural necessary and frequently occurring in the law eg th age of majority alcoholblood levels statutes of limitations or that few cliffs are as high as the one that stands between crime committed the day before the effective date of the guidelines and one committed the day afterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21598crs4 the amendment process of the sentencing guidelines makes them perpetually self correcting while mandatory minimums are singleshot efforts at crime control and the most efficient and effective way for congress to exercise its powers to direct sentencing policy is through the establis hed process of sentencing guidelines permitting the sophistication of the guidelines structure to work rather than through mandatory minimums the commissions report was quickly followed by department of justice study that concluded that substantial number of those sentenced under federal mandatory minimums were nonviolent firsttime lower level drug offenders congress responded with the safety va lve provisions of 18 usc 3553f under which the court may disregard various drug mandatory minimums and sentence an offender within the applicable sentencing guideline range as long as the offender was low level nonviolent particip ant with prior criminal r ecord who has cooperated fully with the government constitutional boundaries defendants sentenced to mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment have challenged them on number of constitutional grounds ranging from cruel and unusual punishment through ex post facto and double jeopardy to equal protection and due process each constitutional provision defines outer boundaries that mandatory minimum must be crafted to honor none confines legi slative prerogatives in any substantial way mandatory minimums implicate considerations under the eighth amendments cruel and unusual punishments clause the clause bars mandatory capital punishment statutes and although the case law is somewhat uncer tain it seems to condemn punishment that is grossly disproportionate to the misconduct for which it is imposed standard which sentence imposed under mandatory minimum statute is likely to breach under extreme circumstances the fifth and sixth amendments insist th at person be held to answer for capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on presentment or indictment of grand jury and that in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to speedy and public trial by an impartial jury moreover due process requires that the prosecution prove beyond reasonable doubt ev ery fact necessary to constitute the crime with which an accused is charged yet the court has declared that fact such as defendants criminal record or the brandishing of firearm during the commission of the offense upon which imposition of manda tory minimum rests need not be alleged in the indictment submitted to the ju ry or proved beyond reasonable doubt while it remains basic principle of our constitutional scheme that one branch of the government may not intrude upon the central prerogatives of another the supreme court has observed that congress has the pow er to define criminal punishments without giving the courts any sentencing discretion thus the lower federal courts have regularly upheld mandatory minimum statutes when ch allenged on separati on of powers grounds and the supreme court has denied any separation of powers infirmity in the federal sentencing guideline system which might be thought to produce its own form of mandatory minimums httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21598crs5 the equal protection objections to the mandatory minimums that attach to the sale and possession of cocaine base crack flow fro m the disparate treatment afforded the two forms of cocaine the penalties for possession with intent to distribute 50 grams of crack are the same as those for possession with intent to distribute 5000 grams of cocaine powder the 1001 ratio between the two continues through th federal sentencing structure with one exception there is mandatory minimum for simple possession of powder cocaine but simple possession of 5 gr ams or more of crack is punishable by imprisonment for not less than 5 years the sentencing difference has racially disparate impact that invites equal protection analysis one federal court concluded that the disparate penalties had disparate racial impact was subject to and could not withstand equal protection strict scrutiny the deci sion was overturned on appeal under an analysis that rejected as have other courts strict scrutiny in favor of rational basis standard double jeopardy bans trying defendant twice for the same offense and ex post facto bars retroactive criminal statutes more precisely the double jeopa rdy clause protects against successive prosecutions for the same offense after acquitta l or conviction and against multiple criminal punishments for the sa offense the ex post facto clauses on the other hand preclude laws that retroactively alter the defin ition of crimes or retroactively increas the punishment for criminal acts some argue that recidivist mandatory minimums offend both the double jeopa rdy and ex post facto clauses they are contrary to double jeopardy it is said becau by using first conviction to justify an increased penalty for second conviction they are in effect punishing the first offense twice they contravene ex post facto pros cription when they are used to sentence defendant whose first conviction pr edates the recidivist statute or so it is contended the courts have rejected both arguments as the supreme court explained when it rejected the double jeopardy challenge to the ca lifornia three stri kes statute historically we have found double je opardy protections inapplicable to sentencing proceedings because the determinations at issue do not place defendant in jeopardy for an offense see eg nichols v united states 511 us 738 747 1994noting that repeatoffender laws p enalize only the last offense committed by the defendant nor have sentence nhancements been construed as additional punishment for the previous offense rath er they act to incr ease sentence because of the manner in which the defendant committed the crime of conviction an enhanced sentence imposed on persistent offender thus is not to be viewed as either new jeopardy or additional penalty for the earlier crimes but as stiffened penalty for the latest crime which is consid ered to be an aggravated offense because repetitive one courts confronted with ex post facto challenges to recidivists statutes have similarly focused upon the latest crime and not upon the first
