established for ensuring that drugs are safe and eﬀective it includes primer on drug approval how drugs are approved and come to market including fdas role in that process it also describes fda and industry roles once drugs are on the pharmacy shelves the postmarket or postapproval period it moves on to discussion of the problems in identifying and resolving postmarketing safety and eﬀectiveness issues that are raised most frequently in the debate it outlines actions that variety of analysts have suggested to improve the situation both ones that fda could adopt on its own and others for which legislation would be necessaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32797 order code rl32797 drug safety and effectiveness issues and action options after fda approval updated january 24 2007 susan thaul

summary cox2 inhibitors and ssris the us public has become more familiar with these technical abbreviations for biochemical processes than one might expect from our general level of science knowledge safety cerns about these drugs used primarily to treat pain and depression have turned spotlight on the food and drug administration fda and its approach to protecting the public from drug risks that had not been identified before fda approval allowed the drugs on the market two regulatory frameworks exist for the review of prescription drugs first in the premarket approval process fda reviews the safe ty and effectiveness of new drugs that manufacturers wish to market in the united states large part of this review is fdas examining the manufacturerprovided data from clinical testing studies in which humans take the investigational new drug in carefully controlled and usually randomize d trials from progressively larger phase i ii and iii trials second after manufacturer has sufficiently demonstrated drugs safety and effectiveness for define d population and specified conditions and the drug is fda approved fda acts through its postmarket regulatory procedures manufacturers must report all serious and unexpected adverse reactions to fda and clinicians and patients may do so the law gives fda authority to take limited action if it finds drugs post approval use presents an increased risk of an adverse event however many suggest that not only does fda need broader range of enforcement tools but that fda also is not taking full advantage of the authority it does have while critics of fda differ in their assessment of what is wrong with fdas approach to postmarket safety activities there is broad agreement that it needs significant change discussion of the problems and possible solutions revolves around six areas fda organization fda budg et role of industry opportunities to use the drug approval process to enhance postmarket activities insufficient postmarket information and lack of public access to available data some of the proposed changes lie within the power of fda to implement others would require congressional action this report examines various options for strengthening fdas ability to protect the public it will be updated from time to time to re flect legislative action by congresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32797contents introduction 1 f d p

serevent to treat asthmadrug safety and effectiveness issues and action options after fda approval introduction little over two years ago the senate finance committee convened to hear testimony sparked by concern over the popul ar merck antiinflammatory drug vioxx few weeks before merck had notified the food and drug administration fda that it was withdrawing vioxx from the market in response to recent study results indicating an increased risk of heart ttacks and sudden cardiac deaths among the millions of patients who had been using vioxx since its intr oduction in 1999 senators wanted to find out what had gone wrong and what could be done to prevent it from happening again this was not the first time that this c ongress had reacted to news about dangers posed by drugs that had already reached the market earlier that year the house committee on energy and commerces subcommittee on oversight and investigations had held hearings because of controversy over the safety of antidepressants when prescribed to children in both cases members were worried that neither the public nor fda were suffi ciently informed by manufacturers or in the case of fda sufficiently forthcomin g about risks occurring after the drugs had been first approved at the finance committee hearing david graham associate director for science and medicine in fdas office of drug safety was asked whether these concerns were warranted in the case of vioxx he stated i would argue that the fda as currently configured is incapable of protecting america against another vioxx we are virtually defenseless1 pressed to name ot her marketed drugs he thought troublesome graham named five2httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32797crs2 3 concerns about postmarket safety involve many drugs the vioxx situation however has uniquely sparked congressional and public attention because of the sheer numbers of prescriptions filled 93 million by some estimat dr grahams analysis led him to see 7fold increase in heart attack risk resulting in he calculated between 88000 and 139000 americans who suffered heart attack or stroke from the drug in addition there have been wide variety of recent books editorials and polls on industry and fda responsib ilities for action that offering cr iticisms similar to those graham made in november 4 fda joint meeting of the arthritis advi sory committee and the drug

hereafter reich jan 9 2005the february 2005 meeting of two fda advisory committees coming three months after dr grahams testimony to the senate finance committee and five months after merck withdrew vioxx from the market also drew intense public attention3 after weighing the evidence on the safety and riskto benefit of vioxx and similar drugs the committees unanimously asserted that the three cox2 inhibitors then holding fda approval fo r sale in the united states vioxx celebrex and bextra do increase the risk of heart attack and stroke illustrating the complexity of decisions that fda faces majority of the committee members noting that the benefits of the drugs outwe igh the risks for certain groups of people therefore recommended to fda that the agency permit the sale of these drugs with however several severe limitations on advertising and strong warnings in consumer and clinician labe ling about cardiovascular risk that is likely associated with dose and duration of use4 the furor surrounding dr grahams testim ony reawakened interest in variety of regulatory issues that have surfaced periodically ever since the storm of protest over filthy decomposed or putrid f ood and worthless dicines resulted in fdas creation during theodor roosevelts presidency5 concerns about regulatory agencies abilities to prot ect the public are not unique to fda or public health6 the lifeanddeath issues of medicine however strike most closely to home for many americans there has not been decade since fdas creation without highly publicized incident involving drug safety that has led to legislation expanding and strengthening fdas authority to protect the public examples include the scores of children killed by an untested antibiotic elixir of sulfanilamide marketed by company in tennessee in 1937 the mistakes at plant manufacturing polio vaccine in 1954 that actually caused 260 cases of polio and 11 deaths and in 1962 thalidomide the sleeping pill that eventually resulted

such issues is the food and drug administration fda in fy2006 fda operated on budget of 188 billion 149 billion in appropriated funds and 382 million from user fees8 more than 6 per us citizen with that money fda was expected to oversee about 1 trillion of goods which make up about onequarter of all us consumer spending9 congressional funding for fda has increased at about half the rate as that

history derived from the dutch word meaning to boast quacken quack was the word americans commonly used to describe charlatans in medicine quacks peddled adulterated and misla beled medicines throughout the united states without penalty until 1906 when congress passed the food nd drugs act outlawing the practice it was the first in series of laws intended to assure americans that the medicines they used did harm and actually worked that they are in other words safe and effective over the next halfcentury congress passed two major pieces of legislation expanding fda authority in pursuit of those goals it passed the federal food drug and cosmetic act ffdca10 in 1938 requiring that dr ugs be proven safe before they could be sold in interstate comme rce then in 1962 in the wake of the thalidomide tragedy congress amended the w to require that drugmakers prove the effectiveness of th eir products as well11 the process has not remained the sa since 1962 the 1983 orphan drug act began series of additional laws passe d by congress in recent decades to boost pharmaceutical research and development sp eed the approval of new medicines or in some cases both the orphan drug act provided incentives for pharmaceutical manufacturers to develop drug s biotechnology products nd medical devices for the treatment of rare diseas and conditions other laws include the 1984 hatch waxman act the landmark compromise balancing greater patent protection of manufacturers with quicker public access to lowerpriced generic drugs the 1992 prescription drug user fee act pdufa which ushered in user fees and performance goals for faster drug appr ovals and the 1997 fda modernization act fdama which relaxed clinical testing requirements eased access to experimental therapies and awarded drugmakers six mo re months of marketing protection for testing drugs in pediatric patients the 107th congress reauthorized the fdama pediatric testing provision within the 2002 best pharmaceuticals for children act and extended the drug user fee law for fi ve more years under the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act12 all six pieces of legislation inform the us drug approval process which is supervised by fda in accordance with the laws from 1938 and 1962 in the following section we describe the drug approval process as it functions nowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32797crs5 13 labeling has become the focal point for much of the controversy involving safety and effectiveness some contend that changes in prescribing information are not enough to protect the publics health because as r ecent questions from consumers and members of congress demonstrate the labeling language cl ear to those in the drug approval business can confuse lay readers for example effectiveness in children has not been demonstrated represents different state of knowledge than studies in children have not demonstrated effectiveness in the second ntence we learn that researchers have looked to see whether it was effective and were unable to find that evidence although the drug still could be effective in children but the study sign or analysis did not see that the first sentence however does not make clear whethe r any study had been done in january 2006 fda issued final rule final guidance and supporting documents to overhaul the labeling

that the new drug has statistically significant benefit over place bo or comparative drug accordingly result could be called negative if despite sufficient statistical power to demonstrate that the new drug offers benefit over placebo or comparative drug the trial does not show benefit trial with insufficient statistical power to draw conclusion regarding effectiveness most often due to inadequate sample size that does not find an association is considered inconclusive the current system drug cannot be marketed in the ited states without fda approval for which the manufacturer must demonstrate the drugs safety and effectiveness to fdas satisfaction see its manufacturin g plant pass fda inspection and obtain fda approval for the drugs labeling term that includes all written and electronic material about the drug including packaging prescribing information for physicians and patient brochures13 there are four steps leading to fda approval of drug for marketing in the united states investigational new drug ind application before testing in humans referred to as clinical testing the drugs sponsor usually its manufacturer must file an ind application with fda it includes information about the proposed study protocol completed anima l test data the lead investigators qualifications and the written approval of an institutional review board based on its determination that the study participants will be made aware of the drugs investigative status and that any risk of harm will be necessary expl ained and minimized the manufacturer will meet with fda to discuss whether the clinical study design has sufficient statistical power to enable the manufacturer to draw valid estimates of the safety and effectiveness of the drug14 the application must include an indication for use section that describes what the drug doe s and the clinical condition and population for which drug use is intended trial subj ects should be representative of those who would receive the drug if it is approved the fda has 30 days to review an ind if there is objection manufacturer may begin clinical testing after that time clinical trials with ind status researchers

the optimal dose of the drug needed to achieve the desired benefit studies that look at safety also seek to identify any potential adverse effects that may result from exposure to the drug efficacy refers to whether drug demonstrates health benefit over placebo or other intervention when tested in an ideal situa tion such as tightly controlled clinical trial effectiveness describes how the drug works in realw orld situation effectiveness is often lower than efficacy because of interactions with other medications or health conditions of the patient sufficient dose or duration of use not

drug safety and effectiveness16 fda has interpreted this to mean that the manufacturer must provide at least two adequate and wellcontrolled phase 3 clinical studies each providing convincing evidence of effectiveness the agency however exercises flexibility17 as its regulations describe in detail fda can assess safety and effectiveness in variety of ways relying on combinations of studies by the manufacturer and reports of other studies in the medical literature18 fda has 180 days to review an nda if it finds deficiencies such as missing information the clock stops until the manufacturer submits the additional information if the manufacturer cannot re spond to fdas request ie if required study had not been done making it impossible to evaluate safety or effectiveness the manufacturer may voluntarily withdraw the application if and when the manufacturer is able to provide the information the clock resumes and fda continues the reviewhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32797crs7 19 fda

fda reviews took in 1993 median review time for priority drugs was 163 months19 figure fda acknowledged could be lower with more fda staff the pressure for quicker approvals came from two directions first manufacturers wanted it because the 20 year patent protection begins with nda submission manufacturers see the time from nda submission to fda approval decision as lost income the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america phrma argues that because of the long approval process and the hatc hwaxman act encouraging generics the average effective patent life for prescription medi cines is 1112 years compared to an average of 185 years for other products20 meanwhile consumer groups also wanted quicker approvals to speed their access to promising drugs congress reacted by looking for legisla tive ways to speed up the drug review process without lowering pproval standards especially those whose weakening might compromise patient safety in 1992 it passed the prescription drug user fee act pdufa and five years later in 1997 the food and drug administration modernization act fdama these laws created system in which congressional appropriations only pa rtially fund new drug review

increased at quicker rate than the contributions from cong ressional appropriations provoking further concern among those critics worried about undue industry influence59 congressional options those who see budgetary solutions to postmarketing problems have offered solutions that are primarily legislative revise or repeal pdufa some critics maintain that fda could keep the current structure

that congress repeal pdufa and increase fda appropriations to cover or exceed current user fee levels even with user fees the fda program level has decreased in buying power fda advocates explain because routine inflation adjustments do not adequately cover increases in employee benefits or fdas costs of recruiting and retaining highly educated and skilled scientists60 that coupled with the additional tasks and responsibilities the congress s required that fda take on presents problems that go beyond drug safety aff ecting fdas food biologics and animal drug programs increase fda appropriations independent of any action regarding pdufa some analysts urge increases in congressional budget authority to fda in general and the office of dr ug safety in particular develop alternative funding dr avorn points out that there actually are wide variety of ways to conduct postmarket reviews other than by government some alternatives all of which would require legislation to implement include research by organizations such as hmos universities or insurers he suggests as possible ways to fund such reviews 10cen t fee per filled prescription user fee by payers on per

complicated issue in this list while the immensely pr ofitable and widely re sented industry has drawn sharp criticism many of the specifi c criticisms of its role are passionately rebutted not just by industry spokespeople but by academics and with substantive arguments many observers believe that fdas dependency on industry user fees has gradually worn away at the agencys willingness to confront drug makers they say that more than funding issue the pr oblems indicate what they have called cultural issue they contend that fda rather than exercising the respected scientific authority it has earned over the decades to combat corporations interested only in the bottom line instead sees as its role to accommodate industry again dr grahams testimony61 articulated this point and because he argues from within fda his remarks attracted wide attention the corporate culture within cder is also barrier to effectively protecting the american people the culture is dominat ed by

criticism of industry traditionally co alesces around one argument that in its zeal to market drugs companies could overlook dangers that might be more evident to unbiased researchers thus h ilts writes that in the case of thalidomide the marketing department not the dical department ran the trial62 accounts of the vioxx controversy four decades later indicate that some merck scientists did argue for further study of the drug but were met with objections from marketing divisions63 certainly industry makes its influen ce felt in many ways for example data information on which fda approval is based comes from studies funded by the manufacturer while industry argues that its sense of social responsibility and concerns about litigation keep reporting hone st critics have found that difficult to square with cases such as the one involving vioxx in which data indicating increased risk were available to the manufacturer four or five years before it withdrew the drug funding user fees have been mentioned elsewhere in this report because they influence issues such as fda organizati on and of course budget but there are those who are primarily interested in it as an example of inappropriate industry role user fees support new drug reviews in 2005 industry paid fda more than 269 million in pdufa fees almost all of it directed to new drug reviews by law this influx of money also allows fda to pay fo r staff conferences travel and training but is limited primarily some say to newdrug reviewers independent research although this is changing journals conferences and

in this paper the reason is that not everyone sees these problems in the same way for example is it the fault of industry for supporting solution such as user fees that could compromise objectivity or

premarket studies she argues that government whether fda or nih should control the clinical trials designed to test safety and effectiveness one potential drawback of this proposal is the cost according to phrma its member companies spent 388 billion in research and development in 200569 an expense congress might find difficult to fund so observers have proposed assessing industry for those costs but legislating wa ys to eliminate industry influence in how the funds are spent diminish marketing role in study design as the vioxx story makes clear marketing is where pharmaceutical employees have the sharpest conflict of interest when it comes to scientific decisions70 with 93 million vioxx prescriptions having been written since its approval in 1999 with worldwide sales in 2003 of about 25 billion it is not surprising that in the gray area where research is not crystal clear marketers will clamor for more proof of safety or effectiveness concerns more available funding for independent research could mitigate the pressure that marketing considerations place on research decisions create transparency in f unding of academic research congress could mandate full and open disclosure of industry contributions to premarket and post approval research in the same way it has mandated the disclosure of campaign contributions reduce conflicts of interest in consumer and

approximate anticipated circumstances of use fda accepts as evidence of safety and effectiveness data from trials that do not include what some critics see as reasonable range of patient disease and care characteristics that is clinical trials often limit st udy to people without problems other than the one being studied the initial trials of cox2 inhibitors such as vioxx therefore excluded patients likely to have heart attacks or strokes yet once the drugs went on the market such patients became cox2 users as one might expect of drug prescribed for arthritis because both arthr itis and increased cardiovascular risk are associated with getting older excluding groups from clinical trials is well established approach to drug research if it is reasonabl to expect that those groups not

limited incidence data gaohehs0021 jan 18 2000so far this report has looked at problem s that become apparent in the postmarket period that may have been avoided by ac tions in the preapproval process but whatever the limitations of the premarket review and approval procedure it produces useful and peerscrutinized data and analysis the focus of postmarket data collection and analysis dramatically shifts with changed incentives and statutory and regulatory requirements for both the manufacturer and the fda critics and even some supporters of the system find that postmarket information on the safety and effectiveness of fdaapprove d drugs is insufficient to support the kinds of decisions clinicians and patie nts need to make the following discussion divides these problems into two groups insufficient postmarket information and lack of access to existing information insufficient postma rket information analysts of the current fda system point out that it is one of passive surveillance rather than reaching out to identify problems fda waits for consumers and physicians to voluntarily re port concerns with drugs manufacturers are required to pass on to fda the reports they receive such reports are valuable aids to researchers looking for potential risks fdas adverse events reporting system aers received 464068 repor ts in 2005 about 25000 as medwatch reports from individuals and the rest from manufacturers76 what are the limitations of passive pproach 2000 study by the general accounting office gao renamed the g overnment accountability office in 2004 estimated that fda receives re ports on more than 10 of all adverse drug events the picture painted by the data therefor is fragmentary and inconsistent77 first in relying on anecdotal evidence it provide s an incomplete and distorted picture of actual problems second the system relies on physician or consumer making the connection between an adverse event with drug physicians are much more likely to report rare conditions that follow dr ug use than more common conditions that could be expected in an older user even without the drug so liver failure and anaphylactic shock get reported but fatigue nd heart attacks do not there are other reasons that voluntary re ports do not present balanced picture 63yearold weekend tennis player taking cox2 inhibitor for knee pain may not even consider reporting heart attack as drug reaction meanwhile consumers and physicians report many events that occur immediately after drugs use that may have nothing to do with that drug furt hermore the system relies on physicians or consumers actually following through and reporting their concerns that adverse events are related to the drughttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32797crs26 finally data from surveillance reports do not include sufficient information about the medical behavioral and sociode mographic characteristics of the patient scientists analyzing the data need that information to clarify what appear to be associations between drugs and events medwatch provides count of events but does not provide the total num ber of people taking the drug medwatch may get 100 reports of adverse events but ar 1000 people taking the drug or million without the denominator cluster of events reported to system such as medwatch serves only as red flag to prompt further investigation there is second more aggressive way to find drug effects after drug is on the market researchers can design studies to address suspected association of drug and an adverse event by trying to hold constant other characteristics of the illness and the patient researchers also can design studies to test hypotheses suggested by drugs mechanism of action or based on findi ngs concerning other drugs in its class they may also measure drugs safety and effectiveness for known offlabel uses and can comply with commitments made as part of the drug approval process postmarket effort to identify safety and effectiveness problems requires two pronged approach first an accurate asse ssment of what is happening to patients the warning signs that something may be wrong and second carefully designed rigorously impartial research to see what is wrong fda options reassess criteria qualifying as signal whatever the surveillance mechanism fda could reassess the criteria it uses to decide that the surveillance data indicate problem called signal and then could clarify what steps it could take the next two postmarket activities so appear among preapproval options there the issue is commitment to do the studies here in the postmarket options section the issue is actually doing them periodically assess the range of offlabel use fda could actively collect prescribing or pharmacy data by characteristics of patient and

give fda authority to take specific enforcement st eps other than the current allornothing threat of revoking approval and therefore halting us sales require comparative effectiveness studies the clinical trials that manufacturers field to support applications to fda usually compare outcomes in two groups people with the disease who are given the new drug and people with the disease who are given pl acebo what this approach does not provide though is any comparison of the new drug with other available treatments clinician who is deciding whether to prescribe drug wants to know more than whether drug is better than nothing the clinician also wa nts to know whether drug is better more effective or safer than drug b79 in part because fda does not require comparative effectiveness

must have enough information about risks to make up their own minds howe ver indepth analysis is often required to assess drugs full effects some qu estion whether individuals or even their physicians can meaningfully interpret all relevant information the fdas task involves providing that in depth analysis as it weighs benefits against risks for example codeine provide s pain relief but is addictive tamoxifen keeps breast cancer at bay for those who have had single mastectomy but can cause uterine cancer and blood clots ibuprof relieves inflammation but can cause gastrointestinal distress and statins lower cholesterol but may weaken muscle fibers manufacturers and researchers should find new ways to diminish or mitigate risk furthermore if drug is not effective there is potential bene fit to counterbalance even the smallest risk fdas advisory committees routinely tackle these tasks100 but the february 2005 joint advisory committee meeting made cl ear how hard it is
