linguistic tradition the word charter has been used to refer to many legal writs including articles of agreement founding legislation contracts articles of incorporation and more1 the varied uses of this term to refer to so many different legal writs may reflect the terms etymology charter is derived from the latin charta or perhaps the ancient greek chartÃªs both of which mean paper2 as used in federal statutory law the term charter usually has carried much more specific meaning congressional or federal charter is federal statute that establishes corporation such charter typically provides the following characteristics for the corporation 1 name 2 purposes 3 duration of existence 4 governance structure eg executives board members etc 5 powers of the corporation and 6 federal oversight powers beyond conferring the powers needed to achieve its statutorily assigned goal charter usually provides corporation with set of standard oper ational powers the power to sue and be sued to contract and be contracted with to acquire hold and convey property and so forth g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g514g156g561g23g156g142g561g152g143g561g5g145g138g155g157g142g155g156g561 many of the original 13 colonies were established by royal charters and both colonies and states incorporated governmental and private entities before the united states was established3 however at the

to charter corporations was effectively put to an end by the supreme courts decision in mcculloch v maryland in 1819 17 us 4 wheat 315 the court ruled that incorporation could be necessary and proper means for the federal government to achieve the ends assigned to it by the us constitution5 after chartering the national bank though for the next century congress issued charters almost solely in its role as manager of the affairs of the district of columbia article i section 8 clause 17 the district of columbia which became the seat of the federal government in 1790 had neither general incorporation law nor legislature that could grant charters so it fell to congress incorporate the districts corporations thus congress issued charters to establish the office of the mayor and the council of the city of washington in 1802 2 stat 195197 and to found the washington city orphan asylum in 1828 6 stat 381 6 in the 20th century congress began chartering large number of corporations for diverse purposes in part congresss resort to the corporate device was response to host of national crises such as the two world wars which re quired the production of an enormous number of goods and the great depression which revealed the limited power the federal government had over the national economy corporations it was thought were by nature better suited than typical government agencies to handle policy areas that required commercialtype activities for example selling electrical power as the tennessee valley authority does 7 while each congressionally chartered corporation is unique in that it is fashioned for very particular purpose these entities still may be sorted into rough types an elementary division is between those chartered as nonprofit corporations versus those that

securities invest or protection corporation 15 usc 78ccc et seq looks very different from that of the am erican national red cross 36 usc 3001 et seq the power to craft corporations ad hoc however has produced confusion when corporations are established that have both governmental and priv ate sector attributes this distinction is not without consequence governmental entities operate under different legal authorities and restrictions than do private sector corporations 11 for example confusion arose over the national veterans business development corporation nvbdc 15 usc 657c the department of justice declared it to be government corporation in march 200412 some members of congress disagreed the 2004 omnibus appropriations act pl 108447 division k section 146 attempted to dispel the confusion by stating that the nvbdc was private entity that is not an agency instrumentality authority entity or establishment of the united states government in some instances federal courts have been asked to intervene and make determination of corporations status 13

een made difficult by few factors first single federal department or office is charged with overseeing the activities of all congressionally chartered corporations second many of these corporations were established independently of any department and have few if any federal appointees on their boards or in their executive ranks this separation of corporations from departments may make the federal management of corporations more difficult 14 third the government corporation control act 31 usc 9101 9110 provides many tools for managing chartered corporations activities however congress has excepted many corporations from some or all of the acts provisions 10 some of the more wellknown ones include the american legion big brothersbig sisters of america boy scouts of america and

states and municipalities often limited the duration of charter corporation would expire unless the sovereign renewed its charter this practice has fallen by the wayside usually congress charters entities to have perpetual succession this means that corporation may continue to operate whether it is effective or not until law is enacted to abolish it this seldom occurs15 longlived chartered entities have been accused of taking business from the private sector moving into areas of business or activities outside the bounds of their charters and developing networks of influence to protect themselves from abolition 16 g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 kevin r kosar analyst in american national government
