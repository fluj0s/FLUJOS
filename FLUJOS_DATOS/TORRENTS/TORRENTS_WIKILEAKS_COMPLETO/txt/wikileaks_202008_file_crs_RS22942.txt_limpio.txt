feickert foreign affairs defense and trade division august 28 2008 abstract the joint light tactical vehicle jltv is currently being developed by the army and the marine corps as successor to the 11 different versions of the high mobility multiwheeled vehicle hmmwv that have been in service since 1985 there are concerns about the affordability of jltvs and its redundancy with other tactical wheeled vehicles order code rs22942 august 28 2008 joint light tactical vehicle jltv background and issues for congress andrew feickert specialist in military ground forces foreign affairs defense and trade division summary the joint light tactical vehicle jltv is currently being developed by the army httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22942 and the marine corps as successor to the 11 different versions of the high mobility multiwheeled vehicle hmmwv that have been in service since 1985 there are concerns about the affordability of jltvs and its redundancy with other tactical wheeled vehicles this report will be updated as events warrant background1 the jltv is an armyled multiservice initiative to develop family of future light tactical vehicles to replace many of the 160000 hmmwvs used by the armed service today hmmwvs which first entered service in 1985 were developed during the cold war when improvised explosive devices ieds and other antivehicle explosive devices were not major factor in military planning the hmmwvs demonstrated vulnerability to ieds and the difficulties and costs experienced in uparmoring hmmwvs already in the inventory have led to renewed emphasis on vehicle survivability with more than 50 of the armys total tactical wheeled vehicle fleet nearing the end of its useful life and with the needs of the services to repair equipment and grow their forces the jltv with its scalable armor protection is intended to replace large portion of the hmmwv fleet dod officials have emphasized that jltvs are not intended to replace hmmwvs one for one2 the pentagon envisions hmmwvs remaining in service for many years to come about 3000 to 5000 hmmwvs continue to be produced on an annual basis 1 alan l gropman combat vehicle sector could be headed for turbulent

general purpose mobility and would carry 3500 lb payload category bs are intended to serve as infantry carriers command and control and reconnaissance vehicles and weapons carriers and would accommodate 4000 to 4500 lb payload category cs are intended to serve as shelter carriers prime movers and ambulances and would carry 5100 lb payload jltvs are to be designed with scalable armor enhanced suspension and drive train capability to accommodate future load carrying capacity as planned jltvs would be more mechanically reliable maintainable with onboard diagnostics allterrain mobile and equipped to link into current and future tactical data nets strategic and operational transportability by ship and aircraft are also key jltv design requirements program structure4 the jltv is an acquisition category acat 1d program5 the army bears the overall responsibility for developing the jltv through its joint program office within the armys tank automotive and armament command

last 27 months contractors would build four test subconfigurations during the first 15 months followed by 12 months of testing the army and marines planned on issuing technology development contracts in june 2008 but in order to have sufficient funding for more than two technology development contracts dod requested to reprogram 60 million in fy2008 funds8 because dods fy2008 omnibus reprogramming request was not approved by all four defense committees before the august 2008 recess jltv technology development contracts may be delayed contingent upon congressional approval of dods reprogramming request on august 19 2008 the army and marines announced that they anticipated awarding jltv technology development contracts in october 20089 if the reprogramming is approved by congress after the recess according to dod design selection for the system development and demonstration sdd phase could be made in the middle of fy2011 with contract for the final production design being issued in

land combat systems industry by the national defense university industrial college of the armed forces suggests that major defense contractors are likely interested in jltv because vehicle requirements for high survivability and other potential technologically advanced requirements such as an active protection system and networking capabilities make the program economically attractive11 program cost and funding12 dod has not publically assigned definitive cost to the jltv program suggesting that it is too early in the development process to determine an accurate cost estimate some defense and trade analysts suggest that the jltv program will cost well over 10 billion and possibly as much as 30 to 70 billion 7 jltv request for proposal w56hzv08r0210 february 5 2008 and marjorie

jltv price tag drives new three step tactical vehicle plan for the army insidedefensecom august 8 2008 crs4 depending on the final cost of the vehicles chosen and the number of vehicles procured13 the army estimates that each jltv will cost 418000 almost 70 higher than the target cost of 250000 per vehicle that would have enabled the army to replace all of its hmmwvs with jltvs the armys current jltv requirement is 140709 vehicles and at the estimated 418000 per vehicle cost the army may be required to reduce total jltv acquisition quantities scale back jltv capabilities or find additional funds for the program one estimate by the center for army analysis suggests that it would require about 67 billion per year to outfit all army brigades over 15 years with jltvs the fy2008 budget request for jltv was 823 million in research development test and evaluation rdte funding but congress decreased funding to 385 million because of contract award delays14 the fy2009 budget request for jltv is 661 million rdte and the house and senate armed services committees have recommended fully funding the presidents budget request15 current jltv topics jltvs versus mraps16 in late 2007 the department of defense dod httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22942 launched major procurement initiative to replace most uparmored high mobility multi wheeled vehicles hmmwvs in iraq with mineresistant ambushprotected mrap vehicles by fy2009 mraps have been described as providing significantly more protection against ieds than uparmored hmmwvs dod approved the acquisition of 15858 mraps of all categories and as of august 11 2008 dod accepted delivery of almost 11300 mrap vehicles17 when the jltv program first started in late 2006 the 15858 mrap requirement did not exist the unforecasted procurement of significant numbers of the costly mraps has had an impact on the jltv program the army has stated that mraps fill nearterm urgent joint service requirement for enhanced crew protection for both the army and marines and that jltvs are the long term solution for the services18 while the services do not view the jltv and mrap as an eitheror proposition some might question the affordability and necessity of maintaining both programs given their overlapping missions and requirements armymarine combat tactical wheeled vehicle strategy in late november 2007 concerned that the

subcommittee on the army force protection program january 18 2007 pp 12 crs5 for raft of new tactical wheeled vehicles may be laden with excessive redundancy the white house office of management and budget omb directed the army and marine corps to develop and present strategy by march 31 2008 justifying wheeled vehicle procurement19 some of the issues to be addressed by the army and marines in this strategy were 1 what missions are envisioned for mraps hmmwvs and jltvs 2 to what extent do their capabilities overlap 3 how do the army and marines plan to eliminate redundancies between their hmmwv mrap and jltv fleets and 4 to what extent are the acquisition of these three wheeled vehicles meeting the identical requirement omb also asked the services to identify how many of each type of vehicle the army and marine corps plan to procure in the near and long term and how jltvs will be incorporated into vehicle fleets consisting of thousands of new mraps and hmmwvs the office of the secretary of defense osd also in november 2007 called for similar assessment from the army and marines to be provided by july 1 2008 the omb request was extended by three months in late march 2008 to july 1 2008 in order to synchronize the two similar strategy reports20 the army and marines finalized their collaborative tactical wheeled vehicle strategy in early august 200821 briefing on the new strategy does not appear to propose any httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22942 major changes to current wheeled vehicle programs or consolidate developmental efforts for vehicles with redundant capabilities both the army and marines emphasize mixed fleet approach in the near term while transitioning to fleet with scalable protection with the jltv being the vehicle that embodies all desired light wheeled tactical vehicle capabilities both services propose to eventually relegate the majority of their mraps to war reserves and preposition locations under this proposed strategy the army plans to allocate about 1 billion annually to procure new light tactical vehicles but funding would need to be increased substantially in order to afford jltvs in significant numbers international procurement of jltvs us defense officials have expressed an interest in international involvement in the jltv program and to date australia britain and number of unnamed nonnato countries are discussing potential program participation with dod22 the pentagons planned initial purchase of 60000 jltvs for the services could be increased if there is international participation in the program there are concerns however that because of some of the advanced technologies that may be incorporated into the jltv it may prove to be difficult to obtain export licenses from the department of state23 some believe that congress too could play role by expressly barring the sale of advance technology jltvs to foreign governments as it did in the 19 jason sherman white house tactical vehicle plans may be excessive

aircraft24 others suggest that export problems are not likely to arise in light vehicle such as the jltv noting that hmmwvs have been sold to numerous asian and middle eastern countries25 if jltv export is permitted and countries order significant numbers of jltvs the pervehicle cost could possibly decrease thereby addressing some of the jltv affordability concerns raised by us officials potential issues for congress jltv affordability in recent testimony on dod weapons programs the government accountability office gao asserted that total acquisition costs for the fy2007 portfolio of major defense acquisition programs still in the system development and demonstration sdd phase increased 26 and development costs increased by 40 from first estimates26 as previously noted while still in the technology development td phase the army now estimates that each jltv will cost 418000 almost 70 higher than the target cost of 250000 per vehicle in comparison with gaos data jltv costs appear to be significantly higher than fy2007 program averages and could possibly increase even more as jltv progresses through the sdd phase jltvs early httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22942 aboveaverage cost growth may merit greater congressional oversight jltv and the armymarine tactical wheeled vehicle strategy although the army and marines have not widely shared their combat tactical wheeled vehicle strategy there are indications that both services intend to continue with their current acquisition efforts without fully taking into account redundant capabilities these efforts include the continued acquisition of hmmwvs and perhaps even an improved hmmwv the ecv2 if jltvs prove to be too expensive27 all services are expected to complete the acquisition of almost 16000 mraps by the end of fy2009 and although these vehicles have helped to reduce ied casualties decreasing ied attacks in iraq and anticipated incremental largescale troop withdrawals may drastically reduce the need for mraps resulting in an unused excess of these vehicles some analysts say that unless the pentagon can convincingly demonstrate that jltvs are unique vehicles with capabilities not found in hmmwvs ecv2s and mraps it will likely be difficult to justify servicewide pure fleet of well over 100000 jltvs at the current estimated cost army and marine plans to mothball large portion of the 23 billionplus mrap fleet might also prove to be contentious unless jltvs can provide comparable or superior troop protection 24 in crs report rs22684 potential f22 raptor export to japan by christopher bolkcom and emma
