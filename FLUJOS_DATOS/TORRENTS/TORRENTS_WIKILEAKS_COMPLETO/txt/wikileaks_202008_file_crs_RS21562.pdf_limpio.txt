offices for former members of congress or other figures of local or national renown approximately one in five of the public laws passed by the 109th congress was post office naming bill approved under suspension of the rules unanimity of states congressional delegation is required for the movement of naming bills to the floor of the house or senate the costs of dedicating post office in the name of an individual are modest and this action results in change in public identification of the facility by its geographic location this report describes how the practice of naming post offices through public law originated and how it is commonly done today house and senate practices for approving such legislation and procedures followed by the us postal service in organizing dedication ceremony are also described this report will be updated early in the 111 th congress

single most common form of legislation if measured by the number of public laws enacted ninetyeight of the 482 public laws passed by the 109th congress or 201 were post office naming bills1 this report briefly recounts the history of the practice of naming post offices for individuals describes the process currently followed for enacting such bills and explains how law changing the name of post office is implemented by the us postal service usps g10g146g156g157g152g155g162g561 the post office department did not formally address the naming of post offices until 1891 until then the names of post offices were derived from number of sources including the name of the town or township in which the post office was located certain neighborhoods crossroads local landmarks and even the postmasters name or place of residence on february 18 1891 postmaster miscellaneous order 87 instructed the clerks of post offices nationwide to utilize the post office names published in the bulletins of the united states board on geographic names in naming post offices the next year in 1892 postmaster miscellaneous order 48 instructed the fourth assistant postmaster general not to establish any post office whose proposed name differed from that of the town or village in which it was to be located in order to avoid confusion and facilitate the expeditious and efficient delivery of mail search of legislative titles indicates that congress first recognized an individual by naming post office through freestanding legislation in his honor in 1967 when pl 90232 named combined post office and federal office building in bronx ny as the charles buckley post office and federal office building in honor of the late representative charles buckley who had chaired the house public works committee through 1964 courthouses and federal buildings some doubt containing postal facilities had been named before that the united states postal service came into being in 1971 with its own separate real estate authority legislation to name usps facilities was then referred to the house and senate post office and civil service committees and when these committees were abolished to the house oversight and government reform and senate homeland security and governmental affairs committees legislation naming courthouses and other federal buildings is referred to the public works committees postal naming acts were relatively infrequent until recently averaging 12 per congress for the 102 nd through the 105th congresses in the 106th congress 50 such bills were passed that named 58 post offices in the 107th congress the number of bills passed declined to 462 and then practically doubled in the 108th congress to 89 retired members of congress were honored in 17 of the acts of the 109th congress while most of the others appear to be people of local renown some of the nationally known figures honored in recent years include ronald reagan three times bob hope cesar chavez nat king cole frank sinatra walt disney and jay hanna dean better known as dizzy dean at least 10 of the naming acts recognized the sacrifice of soldiers who died in iraq 1 this report originally was

staff member should consider in preparing naming bill is the selection of an appropriate post office most congressional districts contain many postal facilities and it often comes as surprise to congressional staff that usps does not have comprehensive list of those that have already been named for individuals either through legislative or administrative action however usps government relations representatives can determine the status of particular post office on request they may also point out that local customers sometimes resent their post office being named for an outsider without strong and favorable local identification the condition and activity level of the building is also consideration since some post offices offer better presentation than others while few post offices have been closed in recent years it is not difficult to foresee that there will be an initiative in the future to close some of those that are less active once post office has been selected several key pieces of information are needed for drafting the legislation one is the precise address of the facility another is whether the facility is owned by usps or more commonly for smaller post offices leased from private owner in the latter case the buildings owner should probably be consulted finally critical step is determining from the person to be recognized or his or her family the precise form and spelling of the persons name some public figures use different names for formal and informal purposes all but 14 of the 98 naming acts passed in the 109 th congress originated in the house wording of the legislation shows little variation pl 10817 signed by president bush on april 23 2003 is typical an act to designate the facility of the u nited states postal service locate d at 212 7 beatties ford road in charlotte north carolina as the jim richardson post office be it enacted by the senate and the house of re presentatives of the united states of america in congress asse mbled section 1 designation the facility of the united states postal service located at at 2127 beatties ford road in charlotte north carolina shall be know n nd designated as the jim richardso n post office sec 2 references any refe renc in law map reg u lation d ocument pap er or other record of the u nited states to the facility referred to in section 1 shall be deemed to be refere nc to the jim richardson post office the house oversight and government reform committee has policy though not formal rule that post office naming bill will not be approved unless and until all members from the state where the post office is located have signed on as cosponsors of the bill in recent years the committee has generally not marked up or otherwise formally approved naming bills in committee meeting rather committee staff keep list of naming bills and other measures appropriate for consideration under suspension of the rules or by unanimous consent to be taken up when opportunities appear negotiations between the majority and minority leaders determine when and how the bills are to be considered on the floor

vote or on roll call vote that is unanimous an exception occurred on the house floor on september 27 2005 when the motion to suspend the rules and pass hr 438 was defeated on 190215 roll call vote the bill which would have designated post office in berkeley california as the maudelle shirek post office building was intended to recognize community activist and longtime member of the berkeley city council during the debate opposition was expressed based on her attributed espousal of principles that would be running contrary to american values 3 senate procedures are less regular and it is not uncommon for naming bills that have passed the house to languish for several months waiting for action by the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee and the full senate on june 25 2003 the senate considered 14 post office naming bills bloc and passed them all by unanimous consent without debate under both democratic and republican leadership in the 107 th 108th and 109th congresses the committee has required that both senators from state agree to naming bill though formal co sponsorship is not required after the first session of the 109th congress the senate committee adopted policy not formal rule that it would longer consider post office naming bills that honor living persons the policy became effective on january 1 2006 since some bills naming post offices for living persons had been passed by the house in 2005 and were already before the senate when the policy came into effect there was some question whether or not they would fall under the policy on june 14 2006 the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs ordered 14 postal naming bills to be reported two of which hr 2977 and hr 3549 named post offices for persons still living one former member of the house at the beginning of the 110 th congress the committee on homeland security and government affairs discontinued this policy g6g142g141g146g140g138g157g146g152g151g561 the practical effect of legislation renaming post office is less than might appear for operational reasons post offices retain their geographical designations in the usps addressing system and there is change in the way renamed post offices are identified in the official listing of post offices the national fivedigit zip code and post office directory for example which is widely circulated and available in post office l obbies does not contain names of individuals for whom certain post offices have been named by law nor is there separate list of named post offices that could be consulted to determine which post offices have been named in law and which have not the tangible effect of naming post office is the installation of dedicatory plaque in prominent place in the facilitys lobby preferably above the post office boxes 4 the plaque which is purchased locally at usps expense running from 250 to 500 measures about 11 inches by 14 inches and contains the following inscription 3
