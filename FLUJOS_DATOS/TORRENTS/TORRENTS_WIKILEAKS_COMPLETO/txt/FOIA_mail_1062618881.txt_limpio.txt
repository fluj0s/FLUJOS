from tim osborn tosbornueaacuk to keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk edward cook drdendroldeocolumbiaedu subject fwd re fwd soon baliunas date wed sep 3 155441 2003 hi ed first all yes i agree that we need paper that takes more objective look at where we are now and how we can take things forward in terms of nh temperature reconstructions and possibly global sh spatial etc as keith said we mainly i so far have been planning our version of this hopefully objective assessment and by chance i was sketching out vague outline of its possible content weve been keeping this fairly close to our chests for now so please keep our plansideas to yourself for the moment there is partial overlap between our ideas and yours so it might be good to do this jointly anyway my current ideas are number of forum articles the first comparing existing reconstructions but without going into more depth and the other three looking at the way forward ie what should we attempt to do to improve them forum piece 1 comparison of existing reconstructions this has most overlaps with your ideas though i hadnt thought of it being so comprehensive i was thinking more of comparing original series b comparing them after our recalibration to common target data including discussion of why some things dont change much eg relative positioning of reconstructions though amplitudes can change and of course the comparison of mann et with and without oceanstropics c maybe bit on comparison with boreholes though maybe not d uncertainty estimates and how these may decrease with time scale and hence not all reconstructions lie in the mann et uncertainty ranges forum piece 2 selection of predictand and predictor data what to try to reconstruct and why it matters eg will we get the wrong spectral shape if we reconstruct ocean sst from landbased proxies plus some on seasonality though jones osborn and briffa cover part of that issue are you aware of that paper in press with jgr b what proxies should be used eg does throwing in poor proxies cause problem with simple averaging weighted averaging and multivariate regression approaches plus does using precipitation proxies to reconstruct temperature result in the wrong spectral shape forum piece 3 reconstruction methods something here on different methods simple averaging multivariate regression type approaches and different implementation choices eg calibration against trendsfiltered data not entirely sure about this but it would not be new work just would critically appraise the methods used to date and what their theoreticalpotential problemsadvantages might be forum piece 4 estimating uncertainty again not entirely sure yet but this must emphasise the absolute requirement to estimate and use uncertainty when comparing reconstructions against observations or simulations etc then something about how to do it contrasting using calibration residuals verification residuals parameter uncertainty with the type of approach that youve taken bootstrap uncertainty or measures of the eps to look at the common signal with additional uncertainty of how the common signal differs from the predictand so thats it perhaps rather ambitious so maybe reduction to certain key points might be required i was deliberately avoiding any review of treering contributions and lowfrequency per thinking that you and keith would be taking the lead on that kind of review one final think to mention is that the emails copied below and the attached file might be of interest to you as an example of something that might go in comparison paper of existing reconstructions its shows how the recalibrated average of existing reconstructions differs from the average of existing calibrated reconstructions youll see from mike manns initial request below that he was thinking of it as contribution to the eos rebuttal of soon and baliunas but ive not heard much from him since also tom crowley was very interests in this composite of the reconstructions and i started to converse with him about it but never finished estimating the uncertainty range on the composite series and kind of stopped emailing him but i guess either of them might reproduce this idea sometime if it suits them visit to talk face to face about all these things would be good keith and i have been talking about how to fit visit in cheers tim date wed 12 mar 2003 161616 0000 to michael mann mannvirginiaedu tom crowley tcrowleydukeedu phil jones pjonesueaacuk from tim osborn tosbornueaacuk subject re fwd soon baliunas cc malcolm hughes mhughesltrrarizonaedu rbradleygeoumassedu mhughesltrrarizonaedu srutherfordgsouriedu kbriffaueaacuk mannvirginiaedu this is an excellent idea mike in principle at least in practise however it raises some interesting results as i have found when attempting this myself that may be difficult to avoid getting bogged down with discussing the attached pdf figure shows an example of what i have produced nb please dont circulate this further as it is from work that is currently being finished off however im happy to use it here to illustrate my point i took 7 reconstructions and recalibrated them over common period and against an observed target series in this case landonly aprsep 20n but i get similar results with other choices and this recalibration stage is not critical you will have seen figures similar to this in stuff keith and i have published see the coloured lines in the attached figure in this example i then simply took an unweighted average of the calibrated series but the weighted average obtained via an eof approach can give similar results the average is shown by the thin black line ive ignored the potential problems of series covering different periods this was all done with raw unsmoothed data even though 30yr smoothed curves are plotted in the figure the thick black line is what i get when i recalibrate the average record against my target observed series this is the important bit the recalibrated mean of the reconstructions is nowhere near the mean of the reconstructions it has enhanced variability because averaging the reconstructions results in redder time series there is less common variance between the reconstructions at the higher frequencies compared with the lower frequencies so the former averages out to leave smoother curve and the recalibration is then more of case of fitting trend over my calibration period 18811960 to the observed trend this results in enhanced variability but also enhanced uncertainty not shown here due to fewer effective degrees of freedom during calibration obviously there are questions about observed target series which series to includeexclude etc but the same issue will arise regardless the analysis will not likely lie near to the middle of the cloud of published series and explaining the reasons behind this etc will obscure the message of short eos piece it is of course interesting not least for the comparison with boreholebased estimates but that is for separate paper i think my suggestion would be to stick with one of these options i single example reconstruction ii plot of cloud of reconstructions iii plot of the envelope containing the cloud of reconstructions perhaps also the envelope would encompass their uncertainty estimates but without showing the individual reconstruction best guesses how many votes for each cheers tim at 1532 120303 michael mann wrote ps the idea of both representative timeslice spatial plot emphasizing the spatial variability of eg the mwp or lia and an eof analysis of all the records is great idea id like to suggest small modification of the latter i would suggest we show 2 curves representing the 1st pc of two different groups one of empirical reconstructions the other of model simulations rather than just one in the time plot group 1 could include 1 crowley lowery 2 mann et 1999 3 bradley and jones 1995 4 jones et 1998 5 briffa et 200x keithtim to provide their preferred mxd reconstruction 6 esper et yes noone series that differs from the others wont make much of difference i would suggest we scale the resulting pc to the cru 18561960 annual northern hemisphere mean instrumental record which should overlap w all of the series and which predates the mxd decline issue group 2 would include various model simulations using different forcings and with slightly different sensitivities this could include 6 or so simulation results 1 3 series from crowley 2000 based on different solarvolcanic reconstructions 2 2 series from gerber et bern modeling group result based on different assumed sensitivities 1 bauer et series claussen group emic result includes 19th20th century land use changes as forcing i would suggest that the models 20th century mean is aligned with the 20th century instrumental nhem mean for comparison since this is when we know the forcings best id like to nominate scott r as the collector of the time series and the performer of the eof analyses scaling and plotting since scott already has many of the series and many of the appropriate analysis and plotting tools set up to do this we could each send our preferred versions of our respective time series to scott as an ascii attachment etc thoughts comments thanks mike at 1008 am 3122003 0500 michael mann wrote thanks tom either would be good but eos is an especially good idea both ellen mt and keith alverson are on the editorial board there so i think there would be some receptiveness to such submissiont i see this as complementary to other pieces that we have written or are currently writing eg review that ray malcolm and henry diaz are doing for science on the mwp and this should proceed entirely independently of that if there is group interest in taking this tack id be happy to contact ellenkeith about the potential interest in eos or id be happy to let tom or phil to take the lead too comments mike at 0915 am 3122003 0500 tom crowley wrote phil et i suggest either bams or eos the latter would probably be better because it is shorter quicker has wide distribution and all the points that need to be made have been made before rather than dwelling on soon and baliunas i think the message should be pointedly made against all of the standard claptrap being dredged up i suggest two figures one on time series and another showing the spatial array of temperatures at one point in the middle ages i produced few of those for the ambio paper but already have one ready for the greenland settlement period 965995 showing the regional nature of the warmth in that figure we could add few new sites to it but if people think otherwise we could of course go in some other direction rather than getting into the delicate question of which paleo reconstruction to use i suggest that we show time series that is an eof of the different reconstructions one that emphasizes the commonality of the message tom dear all i agree with all the points being made and the multiauthored article would be good idea but how do we go about not letting it get buried somewhere can we not address the misconceptions by finally coming up with definitive dates for the lia and mwp and redefining what we think the terms really mean with all of us and more on the paper it should carry lot of weight in way we will be setting the agenda for what should be being done over the next few years we do want reputable journal but is the holocene the right vehicle it is probably the best of its class of journals out there mike and i were asked to write an article for the egs journal of surveys of geophysics youve not heard of this few have so we declined however it got thinking that we could try for reviews of geophysics need to contact the editorial board to see if this might be possible just thought but it certainly has high profile what we want to write is not the scholarly review jean grove bless her soul that just reviews but doesnt come to anything firm we want critical review that enables agendas to be set rays recent multiauthored piece goes lot of the way so we need to build on this cheers phil at 1255 110303 0500 michael mann wrote hi malcolm thanks for the feedbacki largely concur i do though think there is particular problem with climate research this is where my colleague pat michaels now publishes exclusively and his two closest colleagues are on the editorial board and review editor board so i promise you well see more of this there and i personally think there is bigger problem with the messenger in this case but the soon and baliunas paper is its own separate issue too i too like toms latter idea of more hefty multiauthored piece in an appropriate journal paleoceanography holocene that seeks to correct number of misconceptions out there perhaps using baliunas and soon as case study poster child but taking on slightly greater territory too question is who would take the lead role i know were all very busy mike at 1028 am 31103 0700 malcolm hughes wrote im with tom on this in way it comes back to rant of mine to which some of you have already been victim the general point is that there are two arms of climatology neoclimatology what you do based on instrumental records and direct systematic observations in networks all set in very late holoceneanthropocene time with hourly to decadal interests paleoclimatology stuff from rocks etc where major changes in the earth system including its climate associated with major changes in boundary conditions may be detected by examination of one or handful of paleo records between these two is what we do mesoclimatology dealing with many of the same phenomena as neoclimatology using documentary and natural archives to look at phenomena on interannual to millennial time scales given relatively small changes in boundary conditions until the last couple of centuries mesoclimatology has to work in way that is very similar to neoclimatology most notably it depends on heavily replicated networks of precisely dated records capable of being either calibrated or whose relationship to climate may be modeled accuarately and precisely because this distinction is not recognized by many eg sonnechkin broecker karlen we see an accumulation of misguided attempts at describing the climate of recent millennia it would be better to head this off in general rather than draw attention to bad paper after all as tom rightly says we could all nominate really bad papers that have been published in journals of outstanding reputation although there could well be differences between our lists end of rant cheers malcolm hi guys junk gets published in lots of places i think that what could be done is short reply to the authors in climate research or slightly longer note in reputable journal entitled something like continuing misconceptions about interpretation of past climate change i kind of like the more pointed character of the latter and submitting it as short note with group authorship carries heft that reply to paper in matter what journal does not tom dear all apologies for sending this again i was expecting stack of emails this morning in response but i inadvertently left mike off mistake in pasting and picked up toms old address tom is busy though with another offspring i looked briefly at the paper last night and it is appalling worst word i can think of today without the mood pepper appearing on the email ill have time to read more at the weekend as im coming to the us for the doe ccpp meeting at charleston added ed peck and keith onto this list as well i would like to have time to rise to the bait but i have so much else on at the moment as few of us will be at the egsagu meet in nice we should consider what to do there the phrasing of the questions at the start of the paper determine the answer they get they have idea what multiproxy averaging does by their logic i could argue 1998 wasnt the warmest year globally because it wasnt the warmest everywhere with their lia being 1300 1900 and their mwp 8001300 there appears at my quick first reading discussion of synchroneity of the coolwarm periods even with the instrumental record the early and late 20th century warming periods are only significant locally at between 1020 of grid boxes writing this i am becoming more convinced we should do something even if this is just to state once and for all what we mean by the lia and mwp i think the skeptics will use this paper to their own ends and it will set paleo back number of years if it goes unchallenged i will be emailing the journal to tell them im having nothing more to do with it until they rid themselves of this troublesome editor cru person is on the editorial board but papers get dealt with by the editor assigned by hans von storch cheers phil dear all tim osborn has just come across this best to ignore probably so dont let it spoil your day ive not looked at it yet it results from this journal having number of editors the responsible one for this is wellknown skeptic in nz he has let few papers through by michaels and gray in the past ive had words with hans von storch about this but got nowhere another thing to discuss in nice cheers phil xsender f055popueaacuk xmailer qualcomm windows eudora version 51 date mon 10 mar 2003
