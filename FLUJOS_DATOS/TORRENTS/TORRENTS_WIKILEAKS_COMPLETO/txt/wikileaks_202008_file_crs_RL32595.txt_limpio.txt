updated february 10 2005 jonathan medalia specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division congressional research service the library of congress nuclear terrorism brief review of threats and responses summary it would be difficult for terrorists to mount nuclear attack on us city but such an attack is plausible and would have catastrophic consequences in one scenario killing over halfmillion people and causing damage of over 1 trillion terrorists or rogue states might acquire nuclear weapon in several ways the nations of greatest concern as potential sources of weapons or fissile materials are widely thought to be russia and pakistan russia has many tactical nuclear weapons which tend to be lower in yield but more dispersed and apparently less secure than strategic weapons it also has much highly enriched uranium heu and weapons grade plutonium some said to have inadequate security many experts believe that technically sophisticated terrorists could without state support fabricate nuclear bomb from heu opinion is divided on whether terrorists could make bomb using plutonium the fear regarding pakistan is that some members of the armed forces might covertly give weapon to terrorists or that if president musharraf were overthrown an islamic fundamentalist government or state of chaos in pakistan might enable terrorists to obtain weapon terrorists might also obtain heu from the more than 130 research reactors worldwide that use heu as fuel if terrorists acquired nuclear weapon they could try many means to bring it into the united states this nation has thousands of miles of land and sea borders as well as several hundred ports of entry terrorists might smuggle weapon across lightlyguarded stretches of borders ship it in using cargo container place it in crude oil tanker or bring it in using truck boat or small airplane the architecture of the us response is termed layered defense the goal is to try to block terrorists at various stages in their attempts to obtain nuclear weapon and smuggle it into the united states the underlying concept is that the probability of success is higher if many layers are used rather than just one or two layers include threat reduction programs in the former soviet union efforts to secure heu worldwide control of former soviet and other borders the container security initiative and proliferation security initiative and us border security several approaches underlie multiple layers such as technology intelligence and forensics many policy options have been proposed to deal with nuclear terrorism such as developing new detection technologies strengthening us intelligence capability and improving planning to respond to an attack congress funds programs to counter nuclear terrorism and holds hearings and lessformal briefings on the topic several bills have been introduced in the 109th congress related to nuclear terrorism this report is intended for background not for

an attack is plausible and would have catastrophic consequences report of june 2004 by the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states found that even though an attempt by qaeda in 1994 to purchase uranium failed qaeda continues to pursue its strategic objective of obtaining nuclear weapon1 book by the center for nonproliferation studies emphasizes the urgency of taking steps to reduce the risk that terrorists could obtain nuclear weapons or materials2 may 2004 report by harvard universitys project on managing the atom finds that nuclear attack would be among the most difficult types of attacks for terrorists to accomplish but that with the necessary fissile materials capable and wellorganized terrorist group plausibly could make deliver and detonate at least crude nuclear bomb capable of incinerating the heart of any major city in the world3 an earlier report by the same group estimated the consequences of ten kiloton weapon twothirds the yield of the hiroshima bomb detonated at grand central station in manhattan as over halfmillion people killed immediately hundreds of thousands injured the possibility depending on wind direction of having to evacuate all of manhattan much of lower manhattan permanently destroyed direct costs of well over 1 trillion indirect costs several times that and the prospect for nationwide panic and economic chaos if terrorists

nuclear threat initiative controlling nuclear warheads and materials available at continued crs2 provide detailed data on us threat reduction programs and argue that there is an urgent need to accelerate these programs this report divides the threat into two aspects the acquisition of bomb and its delivery to target the former could involve obtaining nuclear weapon or obtaining fissile material and making it into bomb delivery involves more common and less sophisticated skills to move the weapon covertly to its target weapon acquisition experts have raised concerns that terrorists might try to acquire two types of nuclear weapons in the simplest guntype weapon mass of uranium highly enriched in the fissile isotope 235 highly enriched uranium or heu is shot down tube resembling an artillery tube into another heu mass creating supercritical mass and nuclear explosion the hiroshima bomb used this approach its designers had such high confidence in it that they did not test this type of weapon prior to using it the second type an implosion weapon typically uses weaponsgrade plutonium wgpu composed mainly of the isotope 239 shell of wgpu is surrounded by chemical explosives arrayed to produce symmetrical inwardmoving implosion shock wave that compresses the plutonium enough to be supercritical the nagasaki bomb was of this type it is much more complex in design and manufacture than gunassembly weapon an implosion device was tested in new mexico prior to use on nagasaki national academy of sciences report asserts crude heu weapons could be fabricated without state assistance6 some experts believe that terrorists could create an implosion weapon7 others disagree8 terrorists or rogue states might acquire nuclear weapons or fissile materials in various ways

ferguson et the four faces of nuclear terrorism p 135138 9 see crs report rl32202 nuclear weapons in russia safety security and control issues by amy woolf crs3 considerable work remains for the disposition of this material10 and national academy of sciences report states that the risk of diversion of special nuclear material snm or fissile material from russia is high because large inventories of snm are stored at many sites that apparently lack inventory controls and indigenous threats have increased11 related concern is that pakistan might be the source of nuclear weapons or materials for terrorists under several scenarios 1 islamists in the armed services might provide such assistance covertly under the current government 2 if that government were overthrown by fundamentalists the new government might make weapons available to terrorists or 3 such weapons might become available if chaos rather than government followed the overthrow other nations are seeking nuclear weapons president bush in his 2005 state of the union address said today iran remains the worlds primary state sponsor of terror pursuing nuclear weapons it must give up its uranium enrichment program and any plutonium reprocessing 12 according to press report mohamed elbaradei director general of the international atomic energy agency says he is now certain that the nuclear material his agency once monitored there in north korea has been converted into fuel for four to six nuclear bombs13 and in statement of february 2005 north korea declared that it had nuclear weapons14 there is also evidence of transfers of nuclear weapon materials designs production equipment and expertise to other nations aq khan the father of pakistans atomic bomb ran covert operation for many years that reportedly provided libya north korea and iran with equipment for making heu and plans for making an atomic bomb15 reports of february 2005 pointed to evidence that strongly indicated that north korea had provided libya with uranium hexafluoride chemical used as the feedstock to produce heu though another report said that the evidence could just as easily point to pakistan16 transfers to rogue states or directly or indirectly to terrorist groups are source of concern 10 us department of energy office of management budget and evaluationcfo fy 2005 congressional budget request vol 1 national

washington post february 3 2005 18 crs4 nuclear research reactors offer still another route to obtaining weapon securing the bomb states more than 130 research reactors still use heu as their fuel in more than 40 countries most of these facilities have very modest security in many cases more than night watchman and chainlink fence17 more recent government accountability office report stated that as of july 30 2004 39 of the 105 research reactors targeted by doe for conversion from heu to low enriched uranium or leu have converted to leu fuel18 six of these reactors are reportedly on us university campuses19 gunassembly weapon need not be particularly large the hiroshima bomb according to one source weighed 8900 pounds and was 10 feet long and 28 inches in diameter20 much of that size and weight however was taken up by an armored steel shell and stabilizing fins as well as by arming fuzing and firing devices21 the gun barrel the actual nuclear explosive device measured 6 feet in length by over 6 inches in diameter and weighed about halfton22 simple improvements might shrink size and weight terroristmade implosion weapon or weapon stolen from nations arsenal could be smaller in short weapon could fit in car boat or small airplane and would occupy small corner of shipping container weapon delivery the united states has many thousands of miles of land and water borders as well as several hundred sea land and air ports of entry 317 by one count giving terrorists many pathways to smuggle nuclear bomb into this nation23 there are many types of borders as the

also present terrorists with different risks and opportunities legal crossings are points such as seaports airports and border stations on roads entering the united states illegal crossings are lines the thousands of miles of unguarded stretches of coasts and land borders securing points poses different requirements from securing lines points have an immense volume of traffic almost all of it legal and corresponding concentration of people and resources of us customs and border protection cbp the task of cbp is to find the needle in the haystack while expediting legal traffic attempts to smuggle nuclear weapon through legal crossing would run the risk that the weapon might be detected by computerized screening of cargo manifests imaging devices similar to xrays neutron activation devices or physical inspection as discussed below that risk is reduced by the need for cbp agents to process huge numbers of vehicles vessels and passengers leaving little time or attention for those not raising suspicions and by the low radioactivity of fissile uranium235 approximately one hundredmillionth that of radioactive material that might be used in dirty bomb24 abc news attempted to highlight the difficulty of detecting smuggled material on september 11 of 2002 and 2003 that organization smuggled 15pound cylinder of depleted uranium du natural uranium minus most of its uranium235 into the united states in cargo containers cbp did not detect it abc news said that du is good surrogate for heu cbp said that was not the case and that there was reason for cbp to have detected the du because it is legal to import up to 15 pounds of du as long as it is declared the dhs inspector general found improvements are needed in the inspection process to ensure that weapons of mass destruction do not gain access to the us through oceangoing cargo containers detection equipment and search protocols and procedures are the two areas where improvements would enhance the effectiveness of the inspection process25 24 halflife is the time it takes for half the atoms of radioactive isotope to decay by emitting radiation into another isotope as such it is rough measure of how radioactive an isotope is the halflife of uranium235 is about 700 million years while the halflife of cobalt60 is 53 years that of plutonium239 is about 24000 years us department of energy office

measurements of the us coasts vary sharply depending on such things as the length of the yardstick used and how far up inlets and rivers the seacoast is measured see also crs report rs21729 us international borders brief facts by marilyn nelson and barbara salazar torreon cbp resources are spread much more thinly along lines attempts to smuggle nuclear weapon across an unguarded section of border would avoid the risk that the weapon might be detected but cbp agents would only need to detect the smugglers not the weapon anyone or anything entering the united states across lines is illegal on the other hand risk to smugglers is reduced because cbp faces an immense task in patrolling the vast stretches of borders26 terrorists could avoid the risks attendant to smuggling across both points and lines if they could place weapon on board an airplane or ship bound for the united states and detonate it before it could be inspected such as in the air above city or as it entered seaport scenarios for smuggling nuclear weapon across unguarded coasts or borders are similar to those for smuggling bales of marijuana many of which are reportedly flown in brought by small boats or carried across land borders the difficulty of patrolling the borders makes such scenarios feasible key difference between smuggling marijuana and nuclear weapon is that in the former case smugglers expect losses due to interception by cbp and view them as cost of doing business terrorists attempting to smuggle nuclear weapon into the united states in contrast would presumably have only one or few weapons and would have to go to great lengths to succeed conversely because of the great value of nuclear weapon to terrorists methods that create substantial probability of detecting an attempt to smuggle weapon into the united states might deter such an attempt 26 see crs report rl31019 terrorism automated lookout systems and border security options and issues by william krouse and raphael perl crs7 another scenario commonly discussed is smuggling nuclear weapon in shipping container27 these metal boxes typically 8 by 8 by 20 feet or 8 by 8 by 40 feet are used to transport vast quantities of goods ranging from clothes to computers to automobile engines nearly 9 million containers enter the united states by ship each year28 container ships may carry several thousand containers from seaports they are transported by truck or rail throughout the country the concern is that if terrorists could place bomb in container overseas they could ship it into the united states and transport it anywhere in the country under the container security initiative csi discussed below cbp agents and their foreign counterparts screen containers being loaded onto container ships at certain foreign ports and the foreign agents inspect containers that the screening identifies as suspicious based on ports of call manifest data shipping company etc terrorists however might try to circumvent csi by acquiring trusted shipping company to avoid suspicion falsifying manifest data infiltrating csi ports shipping from noncsi ports nuclear explosion in us port from bomb in shipping container would have not only direct effects but could also have farreaching effects on the world economy because of its dependence on container traffic an effect magnified by industrys use of justintime deliveries according to robert bonner commissioner of customs and border protection simply put the shipping of sea containers would stop the american people for one would not likely permit one more sea container to enter the united states until there was significantly greater assurance such as 100 inspections that additional terrorist weapons would be smuggled into the country governments in other major industrial countries would doubt adopt similar policy thus bringing the global economy to its knees29 stephen flynn an authority on us vulnerabilities to terrorist attack cites john meredith director of hutchison port holdings which flynn describes as the worlds largest terminal operator as worried about the cascading consequences should the us government close its ports for two to three weeks after terrorist attack meredith warned the entire system would go into gridlock30 another possible scenario is the use of an oil tanker to transport nuclear weapon31 the middle east is the dominant source of antiamerican terrorism the united states imports an average of more than 2 million barrels of crude oil day 27 see crs report rs21293 terrorist nuclear attacks on

31 see crs report rs21997 port and maritime security potential for terrorist nuclear attack using oil tankers by jonathan medalia crs8 from persian gulf nations32 this crude oil is transported by ship and it would be very difficult to detect bomb inside supertanker part of the difficulty of detecting bomb inside floating vat of crude oil would arise from the sheer size of supertankers which carry 100000 deadweight tons or more of crude oil33 for example two supertankers built in 2003 for cosco china ocean shipping group were 330 meters almost quartermile long and 60 meters in beam and had capacity of about 300000 deadweight tons34 there are even larger tankers that carry 500000 deadweight tons of crude oil and have length of 396 meters and beam of 71 meters35 on land some detection devices use gamma rays highenergy xrays to peer inside shipping container and create an xraytype image but the size of supertanker and the thickness of the steel especially with the use of double hulls make this technique unworkable another possible means of detecting nuclear weapon is neutron activation in which burst of neutrons is sent into the item to be examined such as shipping container neutrons that strike uranium235 or other radioactive material will cause some atoms to fission releasing neutrons and gamma rays any neutron coming back as result of neutron bombardment would be suspicious the gamma rays produced by the disintegration of each isotope have unique set of energies creating fingerprint that permits identification of the isotope however neutrons sent into the oil and any produced by fissioning of uranium would be absorbed forming deuterium or tritium or scattered by the hydrogen atoms in crude oil and the large volume of oil would attenuate any gamma rays produced defeating this form of detection at the same time designing means to detonate bomb inside tanker could prove technical challenge for terrorists bomb in tanker could devastate an oil port by the blast and by secondary fires in nearby refineries and oil storage tanks tanker bomb might be used against other maritime targets such as the panama canal and if bomb in shipping container could lead to the shutdown of container traffic seriously damaging the world economy tanker bomb might by the same token lead to the suspension of crude oil shipments with similar results 32 us department

handbook for the personincharge pic fourth edition centreville md cornell maritime press 2001 p 20 crs9 responses by now over three years after the attacks of september 11 the components of the us and global response have become clearer the response is often termed layered defense reflecting the idea that terrorists would have to proceed through many steps to acquire nuclear weapon and smuggle it into the united states and that attempting to thwart them at each step has higher likelihood of success than trying to block one step only36 whether layered defense is an overarching strategy as is the case in ballistic missile defense or simply name given to what would have happened anyway as many agencies with different capabilities contribute in the ways each is able to or some of both is another matter in any event many programs have been established to deal with nuclear terrorism since 911 and others created well before then have acquired new urgency the following six categories of programs are presented in the order in which they bear on terrorist or rogue state effort to acquire and deliver nuclear weapon threat reduction programs in the former soviet union the soviet nuclear threat reduction act of 1991 pl 102226 title ii also known as the nunnlugar amendment authorized department of defense dod program to assist in the destruction of soviet nuclear and other weapons the united states now funds threat reduction and nonproliferation programs through three agencies dod runs the cooperative threat reduction program to secure and dismantle former soviet nuclear and other weapons the department of energy doe runs several programs within its defense nuclear nonproliferation account such as international nuclear materials protection and cooperation and elimination of weaponsgrade plutonium production to secure nuclear weapons materials and knowledge and the department of state runs such programs as science and technology centers in russia and ukraine to provide weapons scientists with grant funding or employment on nonweapons projects37 efforts to secure heu worldwide heu is used in many research reactors around the world the united states and the soviet union provided this material to many nations years ago as noted above much is said to be poorly guarded it is concern because acquiring suitable quantity of heu would be the most difficult step for terrorists intent on making nuclear bomb efforts to secure some of this material have been ad hoc rather than part of comprehensive plan for example in 1994 project sapphire reportedly removed from poorly guarded warehouse in kazakhstan enough heu to make 2050 nuclear weapons and brought it to the united states38 in august 2002 project vinca reportedly removed enough heu for two nuclear weapons from research reactor in serbia and flew it to russia 36 for discussions of layered defense see flynn america the vulnerable p 6871 and ferguson et the four faces of nuclear terrorism pp 8083 37 see

2001 and suggests global cleanout of heu40 on may 26 2004 responding to such concerns secretary of energy spencer abraham announced new global threat reduction initiative to secure russian origin fresh heu by the end of 2005 to secure spent fuel of russiansoviet origin by 2010 and of us origin within decade to convert the cores of civilian research reactors using heu to be able to use uranium with concentration of uranium235 too low to be used in nuclear weapon and to try to identify and secure other nuclear and radiological materials that may pose threat41 for this effort secretary abraham said the united states plans to dedicate more than 450 million other doe personnel indicated that sum is the approximate cost to complete the program that the funds would probably be spent over more than 10 years and that most of the funds would be for alreadyexisting programs42 there are also concerns about the security of any iranian and north korean heu as discussed above and pakistani heu discussion of diplomatic efforts to secure such material goes beyond the scope of this report43 control of former soviet and other borders while some programs discussed earlier seek to secure former soviet nuclear weapons and fissile materials does second line of defense sld and the state departments export control and related border security assistance exbs program provide assistance to russia and other countries to prevent nuclear materials from being smuggled out through their borders doe states that sld deploys radiation detection monitors at strategic transit and

february 2005 state of the union address president bush said we are cooperating with 60 governments in psi49 the participants seek to interdict sea or air shipments of wmd or wmdrelated materials to or by states of proliferation concern trying to acquire or transfer such items shipments could be interdicted at ports in territorial waters on the high seas or in national airspace according to press reports the first interdiction under psi was of the german ship bbc china in october 2003 the seizure of its libyabound cargo thousands of parts for special centrifuges of value for enriching uranium

containers it bombards container with neutrons producing nuclear fissions in such material as heu and wgpu56 the fissions produce gamma rays with specific energy levels unique to each substance permitting identification detecting illegal movement across us borders in contrast does not require detecting fissile material relevant technologies include surveillance sensors and data analysis software57 the fy2006 dhs budget includes the establishment of new domestic nuclear detection office dndo within dhs the dndo will develop acquire and support the deployment and improvement of domestic system to detect and report attempts to import assemble or transport nuclear explosive device fissile material or radiological material intended for illicit use58 intelligence the possibility that terrorists could evade any of the layers described above necessitates an enhanced intelligence capability to complement other means of detecting movement of nuclear materials and warheads such capability could also focus the efforts of particular defenses whether alerting russian facility that smuggling plan was in the works or indicating that particular cargo container might hold nuclear weapon improving and organizing intelligence for homeland security have been sharply debated59 nuclear forensics the ability to glean information from nuclear weapon debris and other radioactive material lies at the intersection of technology and intelligence during the cold war the united states obtained much information by analyzing fallout from soviet nuclear weapon tests for example analysis confirmed that the soviet union had conducted its first atomic bomb test and analysis of fallout from the first soviet hydrogen bomb test revealed many details about that weapons design60

warheads detecting signs of nuclear proliferation and thwarting illicit trafficking of nuclear materials62 in the event of terrorist nuclear attack forensics might be able to identify the nation that originated the fissile material or weapon and determine whether terrorists had fabricated the weapon on their own or obtained it from nations stockpile this information would aid efforts to prevent further leakage the ability to attribute weapon or material to nation might also deter nation from providing such items to terrorists by holding the prospect of military response further if terrorist nuclear weapon were found forensic analysis could contribute to an understanding of the weapons design which could help determine whether it could be moved and how best to disable it other issues that bear on nuclear terrorism include missile defense export controls and nuclear nonproliferation efforts more generally many organizations and other groups are involved such as the the international atomic energy agency and the group of eight63 options and implications for us policy in combating nuclear terrorism the standard for success for the united states is daunting zero nuclear detonations which may require stopping every terrorist or rogue state attempt to acquire and deliver nuclear weapon while single nuclear detonation in the united states would constitute terrorist success measured against that binary standard it is impossible to determine the extent to which or even if the initiatives discussed above have increased us security nonetheless studies have shown many potential weaknesses in us ability to thwart nuclear terrorism the main response of policymakers has been to strengthen consolidate coordinate or initiate wide array of programs government accountability office
