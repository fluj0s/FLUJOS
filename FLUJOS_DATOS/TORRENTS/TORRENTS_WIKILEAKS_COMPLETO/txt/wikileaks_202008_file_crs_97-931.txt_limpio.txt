extend existing procedures under the budget enforcement act of 1990 scheduled to expire at the end of fy1998 and to make technical and conforming changes to budget laws staff of the house and senate budget committees began working on the same basic draft legislation the two committees also involved the congressional budget office cbo and the office of management and budget omb in the development of the legislation before the house and senate considered the bea of 1997 as part of the reconciliation process commitment to budget process change was made in the bipartisan budget agreement and reaffirmed during action on the budget resolution bipartisan budget agreement and budget resolution house and senate action on the budget resolution was preceded by budget negotiations between congressional leaders and the president some informal discussions took place earlier in the session but negotiations began in earnest on march 31 on friday may 2 president clinton and congressional leaders announced that they had reached agreement on plan to balance the budget by fy2002 an extensive written summary of the agreement was finalized on may 163 the agreement consisted of 10 general items separately enumerated as well as budgetary tables and explanations of policy assumptions in specific program areas under the agreement the house and senate were charged with developing budget

budget resolution contained several budget process provisions in title ii budgetary restraints and rulemaking first section 201 set forth discretionary spending limits for fy19982002 consistent with the limits recommended in the bipartisan budget agreement to be used for enforcement only in the senate the section also established point of order in the senate against the consideration of any budget resolution or spending bill that would violate the limits the budget resolution did not contain any house procedures regarding discretionary spending limits second section 211 revised the asset scoring rule in manner consistent with the recommendation in the bipartisan budget agreement finally several other sections provided reserve funds in the house senate or both bodies under which enforcement procedures would be adjusted automatically to allow the consideration of particular spending measures as long as they were deficit neutral several of the reserve funds for the senate provided for adjustment of the discretionary spending limits in the budget resolution for legislation affecting the international monetary fund and arrearages of international organizations the bipartisan budget agreement contemplated similar adjustments in the statutory discretionary spending limits house action on the bea of 1997 on june 25 1997 the house took up the first of the two

section 310 of the congressional budget act of 1974 the budget committees receive reconciliation submissions from instructed committees and report them in an omnibus bill without substantive revision

minority member of the house rules committee indicated that he would seek to have the amendment made in order as one of series of amendments if the rule were amended10 however the previous question on the rule was ordered by vote of 222204 thereby precluding representative moakley from amending the rule and obtaining consideration of other amendments advocates of the amendment also were

the bea of 1990 relies upon sequestration for enforcement sequestration is process involving automatic uniform spending reductions in nonexempt programs16 triggered generally after the close of

particular the bea established new title vibudget agreement enforcement provisions the title made temporary changes in the congressional budget process also aimed at ensuring compliance with the deficitreduction policies of obra of 1990 some of the changes in title vi included 1 requirement that budget resolutions cover five rather than three fiscal years 2 requirement that budget resolution levels be enforced for the full fiveyear period and 3 modifications in the procedures for allocating and suballocating funds in the budget resolution to committees many of the changes made by the bea

limits and paygo requirement enforced by sequestration through fy2002 in addition it makes permanent many of the temporary changes in title vi of the cba of 1974 by repealing title vi but incorporating its components into other sections of the 1974 act or the bba of 1985 further the bea of 1997 makes many technical and conforming changes correcting certain drafting errors in the bea of 1990 and bringing the law up to date for various changes enacted during the interim finally it makes other changes in the sequestration and congressional budget processes these changes are mostly minor ones that ratify recent changes in practice sectionbysection summary of the act the bea of 1997 is divided into two subtitles subtitle groups together various amendments to the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 pl 93344 as amended the first nine titles of the act which are referred 15 the bea of 1990 is title xiii of obra of 1990 16 many accounts programs and

requirement the two sets of procedures under the bea of 1990 like the earlier deficit targets are enforced by sequestration section 10001 short title table of contents the section provides short title the budget enforcement act of 1997 and table of contents subtitle aamendments to the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 section 10101 amendments to section 3 section 3 of the cba of 1974 defines various terms used in the congressional budget process section 10101 of the act revises the definition of entitlement authority in section 3 and adds the food stamp program to the definition the revised definition makes clear that entitlement authority is to be treated for purposes of budget enforcement as another form of budget authority section 10102 amendments to section 201 title ii of the cba pertains to the congressional budget office cbo section 201 of the cba establishes cbo section 10102 of the act makes two technical changes to section 201 first section 201a3 which sets the term of the cbo director at four years is rephrased without substantive change to remove an obsolete date reference second obsolete references to the office of technology assessment and the technology assessment board are removed finally the first of two different subsections designated as section 201g is redesignated as section 201f thereby correcting designation error made by section 13202 of the bea of 1990 the newlyredesignated section 201f deals with revenue estimates section 10103 amendments to section 202 section 202 of the cba sets forth the duties and functions of cbo section 10103 of the act amends section 202a to provide that it shall be the primary duty rather than the duty of cbo to furnish certain budgetary information to the house and senate budget committees the change was meant to clarify the priority of cbos duties which also involve the other standing committees of the house and senate and have been expanded recently by the unfunded mandates reform act of 1995 pl 1044 also section 202e an obsolete provision that transferred the functions and personnel of the joint committee on reduction of federal expenditures to cbo is stricken and the following subsections are redesignated accordingly crs10 section 202e as newly redesignated is modified to require that cbo include in its annual report on the economic and budget outlook statement of the budgetary impact in the baseline of 1 the extension of mandatory programs that exceed 50 million and 2 excise taxes dedicated to trust funds section 10104 amendment to section 300 the timetable of actions required by the congressional budget process is set forth briefly in section 300 of the cba and the timing of particular actions also is addressed in subsequent sections section 13112a5 of the bea of 1990 amended section 301d of the cba to change the deadline for submission by house and senate committees of their annual views and estimates reports to the budget committees from february 25 to within six weeks after the president submits his budget the timetable in section 300 was not modified in 1990 to reflect this change accordingly section 10104 changes the reporting deadline in the timetable to make it consistent with the requirement in section 301d also conforming changes are made in house rules x and xlviii see the discussion of section 301d of the act below section 10105 amendments to section 301 section 301 of the cba provides for the annual adoption of the budget resolution specifying required and optional contents of the resolution and establishing procedures regarding its development section 10105 of the act changes section 301 in several ways first the permanent requirement that budget resolutions cover three fiscal years is changed to minimum of five years the bea of 1990 had put in place temporary requirement set to expire at the end of fy1998 that budget resolutions cover five fiscal years this change effectively makes that requirement permanent the budget committees however may recommend that the budget resolution cover period longer than five fiscal years second section 10105 makes optional rather than mandatory the inclusion of total direct loan obligation and total primary loan guarantee commitment levels in the budget resolution and the accompanying report these elements of the budget process effectively were made obsolete by the enactment of the federal credit reform act of 1990 which was incorporated into the cba of 1974 as new title v by the bea of 1990 under the federal credit reform act credit activity is controlled primarily by the appropriation of budget authority for credit subsidies decisions regarding the levels of such budget authority are enforced in the same manner as for other spending programs under the congressional budget process however credit subsidy levels are influenced greatly by executive branch estimates of interest rates and default risk consequently this section retains the option for congress of setting credit levels in the budget resolution should these interest and default estimates become subject to significant error in the future third section 10105 further modifies the optional contents of the budget resolution to include special payasyougo procedures in the senate pertaining to the use of reserve funds effectively ratifying recent senate practice reserve funds enable committees to pursue increased funding for specified programs within their jurisdiction when such increases are not assumed in the budget resolution adjustments are made in committee allocations and other levels so that points of crs11 order under the cba of 1974 may not be raised as long as the committees legislation is deficit neutral fourth section 10105 modifies the deadline for committees to submit their views and estimates reports in section 301d of the act allowing the budget committees to set an alternative to the usual deadline of within six weeks after submission of the presidents budget see the discussion of section 300 of the act above fifth section 10105 revises the listing set forth in section 301e of the act of elements in the report accompanying budget resolution the revision distinguishes between required and optional elements finally section 10105 amends section 301i of the act which establishes point of order in the senate against budget resolution recommending decrease in the projected surplus in the social security trust funds as originally framed the point of order applied only to reported budget resolution the amendment broadens the point of order to apply to the budget resolution at all legislative stages the change is consistent with the practice of the senate during the past several years which effectively expanded the application of the point of order by means of provisions incorporated into the annual budget resolution header for the subsection also is inserted additionally section 22 of the fy1995 budget resolution hconres 218 of the 103rd congress which initially established the senate practice is repealed section 10106 amendments to section 302 section 302 of the cba sets forth procedures for the allocation and suballocation of spending levels in the budget resolution to committees and for the enforcement of these levels the bea of 1990 added new title vi to the cba of 1974 which in part established new allocation and enforcement procedures that temporarily superseded those in section 302 the temporary procedures in title vi were scheduled to expire at the end of fy1998 see the discussion of the repeal of title vi of the act below section 10106 of the act for the most part replaces the old allocation and enforcement procedures under section 302 with the newer procedures under title vi and makes them permanent allocations must be made for the period covered by the budget resolution except that allocations of appropriations are made for one year the allocations and suballocations of appropriations must conform to the categories used for the discretionary spending limits including defense nondefense and violent crime reduction spending as appropriate in addition various technical modifications are made such as deleting references to the allocation of entitlement authority due to the fact that the term is subsumed under the revised definition of budget authority see the discussion of section 3 of the act above further section 10106 changes the procedure for contingent allocations to the house appropriations committee when budget resolution is not adopted by the april 15 deadline any contingent allocations are based on the discretionary spending limits for the applicable fiscal year in the prior years budget resolution rather than those in the presidents most recent budget crs12 section 10107 amendments to section 303 section 303 of the cba generally bars the consideration of spending revenue and debtlimit legislation for fiscal year prior to the adoption of the budget resolution for that year section 10107 of the bill makes technical and conforming changes in section 303a and b also section 303c is deleted the subsection set forth procedure by which the senate could waive section 303 by adopting special waiver resolution after the first several years under the cba the senate began the practice of waiving section 303 by motion or by unanimous consent rather than by waiver resolution section 10108 amendment to section 304 section 304 of the cba provides for revised budget resolutions section 10108 repeals section 304b regarding the use of economic assumptions in revised budget resolution in order to remove ambiguities regarding the procedures applicable to such resolutions the conferees stated their intent that all provisions of the cba of 1974 apply to revised budget resolutions unless specific exception is made section 10109 amendment to section 305 section 305a1 of the cba provides for the offering of highly privileged nondebatable and nonamendable motion to consider budget resolution five days after it has been reported by the budget committee excluding saturdays sundays and legal holidays clause 2l6 of house rule xi as amended in the 104th congress requires that reported bills and resolutions lay over for five days before they may be considered on the floor but includes saturdays sundays and legal holidays in the count when the house is in session section 10109 of the act amends section 305a1 and house rule xi to count saturdays sundays and legals holidays if the house is in session toward the fiveday layover requirement for budget resolutions section 10110 amendments to section 308 section 308 of the cba deals with budgetary reports particularly cbo cost estimates scorekeeping tabulations and budget projections section 10110 of the act eliminates the requirements that information on credit authority be included in these reports which effectively were made obsolete by the enactment of the federal credit reform act of 1990 and makes other technical changes section 10111 amendments to section 310 section 310 of the cba establishes the budget reconciliation process section 310c establishes fungibility rule which effectively allows committees essentially the house ways and means and senate finance committees to alter the mix of spending and revenue changes in its reconciliation submission so long as the total amount of required changes the committees were directed to make is achieved and neither the spending nor the revenue components are altered by more than 20 percent of the directed levels section 10111 of the act amends section 310a to clarify in the case of house committees that the 20percent standard applies to the sum of the absolute value of the directed changes in revenue and the directed changes in spending the change makes clear that the fungibility rule may be used when committee includes revenue reductions in measure and that such revenue reductions do not cancel out spending reductions also contained in the measure crs13 section 10112 amendments to section 311 section 311 of the cba provides for point of order against the consideration of any budgetary legislation that would cause the aggregate spending and revenue levels in the budget resolution to be violated an exception known as the fazio exception is provided in the house for spending legislation in instances in which the committee reporting the legislation has stayed within its total spending allocation under section 302a also section 311 establishes mechanism for enforcement in the senate of the social security firewall which seeks to ensure that the longterm balances of the trust funds are not eroded section 10112 of the act makes the point of order apply to spending for the first year of the budget resolution as is current practice but makes it apply to revenues for both the first year and the sum of all years covered by the budget resolution additionally the section retains the fazio exception and makes various technical and conforming changes section 10113 amendment to section 312 section 312 of the cba pertains to the effects of certain points of order in the senate the section states that each point of order in the senate against an amendment also lies against an amendment between the two houses further the section provides that when point of order under the cba is sustained against bill it shall be sent back to the committee of jurisdiction section 10113 of the act amends section 312 for several different purposes first general statement is made in section 312a that the budget committees shall determine spending and revenue levels for purposes of enforcing titles iii and iv of the act similar statements made in other sections of titles iii and iv are deleted by the bill and replaced by this single statement points of order formerly in sections 601b and 605b of the cba involving the enforcement of discretionary spending limits and maximum deficit amounts in the senate are retained as new section 312b and c17 new section 312d states that point of order under the act may not be raised while an amendment or motion that would remedy the violation is pending before the senate this change effectively incorporates the current senate practice the two original provisions in section 312 dealing with the effects of certain points of order in the senate are retained as section 312e and f section 10114 adjustments and budget committee determinations section 10114 adds new section 314 to the cba establishing procedure for the adjustment by the chairmen of the budget committees of various budgetary levels generally for fy19982002 the adjustments are made pursuant to the consideration 17 maximum deficit amounts were added to the cba of 1974 by the bba of 1985 and expired at the end of fy1995 the bill deletes the old maximum deficit amounts from the cba by virtue of repealing title vi and does not provide new ones nonetheless the pointoforder mechanism is retained in form that would apply automatically if maximum deficit amounts were incorporated into the bba of 1985 in the future crs14 of legislation in several different categories and are meant to parallel similar adjustments made automatically in the statutory discretionary spending limits the budgetary levels subject to adjustment are the discretionary spending limits and budgetary aggregates set forth in the most recent budget resolution and the spending allocations to committees made thereunder adjustments may be triggered by legislation in the following five categories 1 measures containing designated emergency amounts of discretionary spending direct spending or revenues 2 measures funding continuing disability reviews 3 measures providing an allowance for the international monetary fund 4 measures funding arrearages for international organizations international peacekeeping and multilateral development banks but only for the period covering fy19982000 and subject to limit of 1884 billion in budget authority and 5 measures providing funds for an earned income tax credit compliance initiative subject to annual limits ranging from 138 million for fy1998 to 146 million for fy2002 the adjustments made under this section apply while the legislation is being considered but only take effect permanently when the legislation is enacted the appropriations committees are authorized to report revised suballocations conforming to any adjustments that are made section 10114 of the act in part replaces authority for certain adjustments that had been authorized in section 606d and of the cba section 10115 effect of adoption of special order of business in the house of representatives section 10115 of the act adds new section 315 to the cba effectively providing that in the house point of order under titles iii and iv will not lie against reported bill if it is considered under rule special order of business reported by the house rules committee that eliminates the violation the change eliminates the need to waive the cba under circumstances where the violation would have been cured under the usual legislative practice section 10116 amendment of section 401 and repeal of section 402 sections 401 and 402 of the cba established controls over backdoor spending specifically the sections prohibit the consideration of legislation providing new spending authority or new credit authority unless such authority is made effective only to the extent or in such amounts as are provided in annual appropriations acts section 10116 of the act updates and consolidates these controls it merges the two sections together into new section 401 section 402 is repealed and subsequent sections are renumbered accordingly section 10116 also deletes provision in section 401 that provided for the referral of certain entitlement measures to the appropriations committee for limited review and makes other technical and conforming changes in the section and in house rules x xi and xiii section 10117 amendments to title v title v of the cba known as the federal credit reform act of 1990 was added by the bea of 1990 title v crs15 established system for controlling the subsidized costs of loans requiring that budget authority and outlays be budgeted for the estimated subsidy cost of direct and guaranteed loans this cost is defined as the estimated longterm cost to the federal government of direct loan or loan guarantee calculated on net present value basis excluding administrative costs section 10117 of the act amends sections 502 504 and 505 of the cba essentially to incorporate technical and conforming changes recommended over the years by omb in particular section 10117 clarifies the definition of cost and other terms the conferees indicated their intent that omb and cbo report recommendations on certain technical aspects of the credit process by march 30 1998 section 10118 repeal of title vi title vi was added to the cba by the bea of 1990 on temporary basis initially through fy1995 and later through fy1998 it extended the coverage of budget resolutions from three years to five years established certain enforcement mechanisms in the senate altered the process for allocating and suballocating spending under section 302 and established various other procedures intended to enforce the deficit reduction achieved by the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 and the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 section 10118 of the act repeals title vi various elements of the title are incorporated into other sections of the cba or the bba of 1985 by the act and are discussed elsewhere in this report section 10119 amendments to section 904 section 904 of the act in part requires the affirmative vote of threefifths of the senate 60 senators if seats are vacant to waive specified points of order in the act or to sustain an appeal of the chairs ruling on those points of order in seven instances the requirement is permanent18 in the remaining instances which generally involve the enforcement of various types of budgetary levels the requirement is temporary section 10119 of the bill reorganizes section 904 to more easily distinguish between the provisions subject to the requirement temporarily and permanently also new subsection 904e extends the effectiveness of the temporary requirements through the end of fy2002 ie until september 30 2002 in the past few years the temporary requirements had been extended by provision included in the budget resolution section 10120 repeal of sections 905 and 906 sections 905 and 906 of the act provide the original effective dates for the initial implementation of the congressional budget process and certain changes in the presidents budget submission section 10120 of the act repeals these two obsolete sections 18 these seven cases involve germaneness requirement
